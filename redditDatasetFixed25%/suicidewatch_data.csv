226,c79p5n,False,,40,"I asked last Saturday if ""Anyone there"" ? You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt.",SuicideWatch,"I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.  I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.

558,eqg8kz,False,,55,Why do both of my parents think everything i do is wrong?,SuicideWatch,"I’m 17 years old and these past few years I occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons I don’t even know.

The reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.

It’s mostly of simple reason such as :
When we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. So my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. So i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. Then my parents asked what did i say to them. I answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. Then they told me “why did you say that? You should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” I said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. They asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate
Just because of coffee......

And it’s been like this these past few years 
I mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn’t this to much? 
Since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me.
They didn’t 

Just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents. 
But, this time i feel this would be the last...

I couldn’t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who’s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who’s causing the problem.
They keep telling me I’m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you’re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life.

I get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don’t know. I don’t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it. All i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you’re reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/eqg8kz/why_do_both_of_my_parents_think_everything_i_do/,331,"Eh I have to side with your parents about the coffee. 

And with no other examples given, I must consider the possibility that you actually do a lot of things ‘wrong’.

About the coffee, your parents have a point. It sounds like they’re trying to avoid the possibility of having to argue with the hotel if the hotel insisted on charging for the coffee, which is a valid concern. You seem to think that it’ll all be fine but that’s not a given. What you could’ve done instead was say, “oh yeah i didn’t think of that possibilty. Thanks, i’ll try to remember next time.”

To make things worse, after they pointed out that you weren’t as careful as they are, your response was to fight back, ie refuse to fix the possible problem. What was wrong with calling hotel service back about the coffee? In my opinion, when your parents insisted on calling back, and you insisted that there was no need, you sound like the less reasonable party. 

...why couldn’t you just call back and clear a potential misunderstanding? Why, given the choice between 1) making a phone call and 2) resisting/fighting with your parents, you chose the latter? Is it because you have social anxiety and don’t want to call the staff too many times? Is it because you want to stand up for yourself and not follow your parents orders, for a sense of control? Is it because you don’t want to admit that you could’ve done something better?

I have to reiterate that this is the only example I have to go on.

And since this is the one you chose to present, I assume this is one that puts you in the best light OR is somewhat representative of the other instances of fights between you and your parents. So far the picture it suggests doesn’t seem to support your side. ",2020-01-18 13:13:46

Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most.

713,gybb26,False,,41,I fucked up my body and my life thinking I was transgender.,SuicideWatch,"Go into my post history for the full story. I'm too exhausted to type all of it back up.

TL;DR: I thought I was transgender, took testosterone injections for over a year, realized I was just a masculine/androgynous woman, dealing with the fallout.

I am now a woman with a deep-ish voice, horrible acne scars all over my back, thinning hair, an enlarged downstairs, profuse body hair, deformed breasts, and facial hair.

I feel like a fucking freak. It was a long, horrible road realizing I made a mistake and was not trans, but a road I drove down much too late. I can deal with most of it alright. Body hair can be shaved if I so desire to, I can raise my voice pitch through voice training, there are creams or whatever for the acne scarring. My thinning hair is actually regrowing since I stopped injections a few months ago.

But my genitals and breasts will never be the same. I can't remove my facial hair permanently without spending several hundred dollars (I am very broke.) I have permanently mutilated myself with these injections. Ironically, they were supposed to make me feel ""more aligned"" with who ""I truly am"" but for me, it was really just a desperate attempt to slap a bandaid on the gaping wound which is my body dysmorphia and deep rooted self image problems.

And to make matters even more delightful, there exist certain individuals who take my suffering and twist it to fit whatever political agenda suits them. Trans people hate me because they think I give them a bad name and discredit medical transition. Evangelicals and TERFs love me because they want to use me to discredit medical transition.

I don't want my pain to be misappropriated for someone else's vindicative internet posts. I don't want my story used to harm real trans people. 

I hate my stupid fucking deformed body and I just want to go back in time and kill my past self so that she never ever takes that first testosterone shot. Never has to feel this pain. It's abysmal staring myself down in the mirror every day. To see the effects this powerful drug has had on my poor body.

I have been suicidal for many years but lately I just feel something evil growing inside me, something which will give me the power to end my own life before my rational brain can talk me down. I have no job, I'm actually on the comedown of a terrible LSD trip, I'm a budding alcoholic and binge eater. No one will ever love me like this. Its not like I've got a great personality to make up for my physical flaws. I'm depressing and condescending without realizing it.

I'm done being told to do impossible things like rip off the government(?? how) to bring money into a house, money that is supposed to go to a new house but instead gets spent for weed. I'm done hearing him degrade my mother and her just taking it. I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog. And of course, my brother gets anything he needs anyways, because he's male and worth more than me.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study. I hurt or ghost everyone I get close to online because he cuts the internet and changes passwords every other day to keep me off so what's the point.

I need to get out. It's either I get out, soon, or I kill myself and hopefully take him with me beforehand, whether it be today or next week or next month. It's been looming for a while now, the urge. The only reason I haven't yet is because I didn't know how until recently, my life is THAT FUCKING CONTROLLED that I couldn't even kill myself.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in.

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering.

besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else.

0,c34ko8,False,,188,My girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up,SuicideWatch,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when.

How the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?

Do y'all mfs just think I can go to Amazon and order one?

I- I don't get it. I don't get it.  I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST GO UP TO A GIRL I LIKE AND SAY ""hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so"" FUCK YOU YOU TRIVIALISING PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH.

fuck you.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, I've only become worse.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking ""professionals"". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act. 

No one will ever fucking love me for any part of what I am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking ""professional"", it's truly incredible. Leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, I was and am and will be unlovable, I should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible

is this really it? life = money?
what are we? arent we humans? 
why cant we treat eachother with value and respect despite our wealth, looks?

why cant we love eachother and help eachother?
i feel numb, i feel frustrated that this is what we human really are, a greedy little fucks who only care about themselves
maybe not all of us , but the majority
of us are just like that 

im so tired of going to school to just ""get shit done to get to work to get money to survive""

and i say survive, not live happily
because there is nothing happy about our misrable world....maybe there is things you can enjoy or should i say now its just to ""destract myself from my constant suicidal thoughts and my depression""

everyone look down on you because ""you are a disapointment and you got no wealth""

everyone CAN rise you up and respect you because ""this man is a successor!
this man got that company ! this man is blah, that woman got the money""

and honstly....i undersrand how delucional everyone is but....i think we took it way too far

we are losing ourselves in our shit show

as a fucked up person that is me...

i want this nightmare to be over...
im tired of how we humans are associated with our school, work like we are slaves to our survival
if you want to survive in a crule,fucked up world go ahead....

but im so tired of always being a slave to my needs...i dont want to burden, bother anyone with my survival

honstly i dont care about furture,success,work,relationships
and life ingeneral

i just dont give a fuck anymore...its all meaningless to me
its all gray and pointless to me
like why am i even trying to do that or that? to just breath? to survive? to not end up homeless?
fuck this shit and fuck survival and fuck money fuck people fuck fake friends fuck relationships who they love only your looks,money
fuck family who treat you like a fuckin dog,slave
fuck everything and lastly
fuck me and mylife
soon i will die....

im tired of living... everything always gets the best of me

edit : also i forgot to mention...
why didnt god just make us less greedy 
make us less ""you have to eat, sleep,work to survive"" why didnt he just made us pure souls wandering around 
enjoying nature? without the need of food or anything? so we all could love eachother and FINALLY no more rape, war , murder
its all frustrating
why did god made us with so many flaws?
why cant god just free us from our suffering? 
the answer is simple ....it might be for ""reasons"" we humans dont understand
well why couldn't he just make us understand why he made us..
or it might be just for his entertaintment
just like us humans
when you are bored....you go watch a movie or something
maybe we are only toys and a show to him..
there is no exuse nor ""reason"" is justified to him for making us suffer like this

is there REALLY a good reason for him to make us suffer like this?? especially depressed,sucidal people? 
like you realize you dont live that badly you start to feel super guilty about anything to the point only death will free you from your constant guilt 
i didnt ask to be a suicidal asshole
i didnt ask to have a very close minded

i didnt ask to have such a fat body from the start

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated.

171,bgq09m,False,,53,I jumped off a (small) bridge,SuicideWatch,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad.

753,8xwnnr,False,,27,This sandwich doesn't taste good.,SuicideWatch,"It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent.

667,bhebhr,False,,80,Mental Hospitals never work,SuicideWatch,"So a bit of backstory: In my state, if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others, can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital (for a max of 3 days) after going to the ER to check if you've tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist (for at least 30 minutes). 

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

&#x200B;

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

EDIT: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included: 

because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder. 

My mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse, the nurse hung up and said ""im sorry, but this is getting annoying"" right to my face.

A diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend, so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches.

351,co415i,False,,56,Suicide is on my mind 24/7 but I know all that I really want is to feel like I’m loved.,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone, my name is Everett. I’m turning 15 soon and I’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled. I have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out I wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. I have to wear a mask everywhere I go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. It doesn’t help either that every adult I know doesn’t take me seriously because I’m not an adult.

650,dzjrh6,False,,49,I failed,SuicideWatch,"A couple of days ago, I finally decided to end my life. I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

However, this Holiday season I have been feeling it extra hard, and I don't know why. I have tried to do everything I can to cheer myself up. I've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. Tried dressing a lot nicer at work. Figured fake it until I make it. It's worked in the past. But last night I found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. I used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. Then over time I would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. I don't have any more. I bought a Kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. Just ending up cutting a little. However, last night I found myself wanting to buy a gun. However, with me as someone who likes guns I want the gun to have meaning. Isn't that fucked up? Like almost anyone will do, but I wanted something specific. Found one that was almost exactly what I wanted and priorly owned, but didn't end up purchasing it. Instead I drove around for a bit and just meditated. Although I am debating going back there today, getting that gun, driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car... 

I hate hurting people. I have seen what suicide has done to people. My best friend killed himself while drunk almost 5 years ago. It tore everything apart. My girlfriend's brother killed himself shortly before Thanksgiving and it has torn her apart. I have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down. I also fear what does or doesn't come next. I most likely won't do shit, as I am a coward and I care too much, but damn do I want to just end my suffering...",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ectk8j/anyone_else_get_super_depressed_around_the/,223,"I have been suicidal during this time of year for much of my adult life.

I had a friend but she has ghosted me since February for some reason. I had a receiving manager job at a bookstore for 12 years until I was laid off in February 2018. I was making enough money to pay my bills and a little extra. Now I have a job that pays half of what I was getting before. So I'm also possibly losing my home to the bank. It's in forclosure. I don't know where I will live after that happens. So yeah, I am super depressed. I'm thinking about killing myself on my birthday in January. My therapist, who is not charging me, is trying to change my mind. Killing myself right now feels like I'm throwing her generosity in her face. I am grateful for her though. ",2019-12-19 14:00:43

I get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which I guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow?

They say honesty is the best policy. They're right of course. But that doesn't mean what should be done is the same as what can be done.

I fucked up. Not in a huge way. Not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term. I'm a lazy asshole. Am I escaping? Am I hiding? And I distracting myself? Doesn't matter. I was supposed to be working. I wasn't. I got reprimanded. And I'm taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today.

So here I am, in tears because I take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally. I don't want to die. Dieing hurts. Dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason. Dieing is complicated. I want to have never existed. Then no one would hurt.

I want to tell people I'm hurt. But it's not their problem. I want to tell people I'm not okay. But who am I to ruin a perfectly good day? People get so upset when you tell them things that suck. I don't want to make anyone upset. So I go through one day where I'm in pain. Then two days. Then a week, a month, two months... I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee. I'd shoot myself with my husband's gun, but I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm too squeamish to open my veins. I don't know how to end this. If I did, I would have left earth months ago.

112,gcb0sp,False,,83,"I spent 3 yrs writing this horror book, making a soundtrack for it, and making it viewable like a film. I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I’ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I’m so stressed",SuicideWatch,"I put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.


I've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. 


And now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. 


I have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: ""I made this"" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called ""spam"" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying ""I made this"" to ""I found this."" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)

What else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these ""instapoets""? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.


I lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for.

I see no hope in living anymore. 

I ruin all my relationships. The love of my life broke up with me a month ago. In a state of despair, I hooked up with random men to fill the void. My ex said he would never get back together with me if I slept with other people. I see no point in living. I’m an abusive pile of shit who isn’t capable of being loved because I hurt the people I love most. I have been in therapy for years and I continue to be a fucking monster. 

I ordered refills for medication I have been hoarding. Tonight, I’m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and I. I am going to end it all tonight. There’s no point in living if my brain will never be fixed. There’s no point in being alive if I’m a terrible human being who never even had a chance.

931,e3nth,False,,24,Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,SuicideWatch,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e3nth/lessons_from_four_decades_of_depression/,178,"Hey man, thanks for posting.

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

634,95bmmt,False,,21,I think the main reason why I don't kill myself is because I don't want my cats to be sad,SuicideWatch,"Title sounds like a joke. It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them.

449,8ssuet,False,,50,The annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion,SuicideWatch,"If anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, I'd strongly urge them to not read any further because I would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8ssuet/the_annoying_lexicon_of_suicide_dissuasion/,403,"You're somewhat right, there is absolutely no sense in people spouting the same template responses to those who are suicidal. That is not moral, that is not helpful, it is just as bad as telling people to kill themselves. However, if done right, by someone who cares and emphasizes, some people can be helped, and deep down those people really really don't want to kill themselves. They're terrified of their suicidal thoughts. These people need help, which is why i don't advocate for just encouraging people to end it when they SAY things are rough. Sometimes things are truly as rough and awful as people say they are, and sometimes, most of the time they're not. Most of the time people need a helping hand to get out of their head. I have waves of suicidal ideation, if people just told me to go ahead and kill myself when I tell them how much I'm suffering, I might just have done it. If I hadn't, I still would have felt more alone and betrayed than ever. How could people side with my terrible thoughts like that? I want to get better, but that is going to take a lot of work: my brain tells me the easiest way out is death. 
If you really want to just kill yourself, and you're so angry and bitter about people trying to understand (and i mean really understand and emphasize, not template responses) do you really need someone to be honest with you?  ",2018-06-21 15:35:14
936,5mg6x4,False,,13,I told my husband.,SuicideWatch,"I told my husband I was suicidal as expected he cried and got upset. He made me promise not to leave him. I promised him. I feel good finally asking for help, now that's it's the new year and I have health insurance I can finally get the medicine I need. Plus I had a job interview this morning that was pretty promising. Who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. I have a good feeling about this year.

I think, however, it is incumbent upon us to remember that while all of that may be true, it's also very likely to be coming from a place of fear and/or compassion. 

Without explicitly bringing up suicide or self harm and the like, I have had two people express more or less hypothetical-future-anger toward me if I were to do something to hurt myself.  I'm not upset or angry with them because I can understand why they would say those things, even though I don't agree with or justify them. ",2017-01-06 21:06:26
897,az7elm,False,,73,My brother killed himself and I am about to do the same thing,SuicideWatch,"This is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it. 

Please help me

Edit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. I put the knife away and I will try to sleep for a bit.

Thanks to each and every single one of you

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold.
I also want to thank every person that has offered me to talk with them, I really appreciate it.

Im sorry for bothering you guys

132,fhzr9a,False,,45,found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help,SuicideWatch,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fhzr9a/found_and_performed_cpr_on_dead_friendlooking_for/,756,"There have been plenty of times I almost went the same path...

544,clm7h0,False,,113,"I'm attracted to children, and now I've lost all will to live.",SuicideWatch,"Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this. It just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/clm7h0/im_attracted_to_children_and_now_ive_lost_all/,338,"HOLY FUCK.

So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I am 28 and cannot even afford the healthcare I need to take care of my MS, my collapsed ankles and my ADD which keeps me from focusing on anything. My hand is shaking like mad and I'm doing what I can to avoid painkillers.

I know it's completely stupid, but I find it hard to believe I'll ever find anyone who will love me as much as the two people I've screwed over. I'm out of options and pretty sure I'm at my limits.

I never went to Europe, never even went to the East Coast. If I believed in reincarnation or religion, I'd probably not be as worried, but at this point, I've got nothing left.

The suicide hotline was useless, my therapist is an idiot and I can't afford her anymore anyways, my friends are clueless and I'm out of options. Reddit is my last hope to maybe find someone to help me out.

I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

 Police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). They said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.

She told me the next time I wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself, to go to the emergency room. I did that. She told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me. I stayed there over night about 8 hours. A therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. I now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. Fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. 

I plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. I’m really hurt because I trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse.

387,cpy5ew,False,,38,"""it will get better"" being the biggest lie ive been told. I desire suicide.",SuicideWatch,"I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems.

916,e5yjm6,False,,64,What are you realistically supposed to do? I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.,SuicideWatch,"**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e5yjm6/what_are_you_realistically_supposed_to_do_i_fail/,182,"I call it a Hamletian moment.

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. 

When I go home I’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help I’ve been procrastinating on getting. I’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight.

41,dub69m,False,,89,"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life",SuicideWatch,"3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.

911,bxw9gd,False,,28,It is Likely that I’ll lose my Husband to suicide.,SuicideWatch,"We’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. He attempted suicide once, before we met. I should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. He’s been honest since we met about his mental health and I knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but I was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. 
Fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) He wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. We’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. This Past Fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. He was really down for a few months.  Finally we tried a Ketamine infusion series which worked really well. But slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. We tried a Ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.
He told me last night that he’s done fighting. Life is just too hard. 
I felt like in the fall I had started preparing myself for the fact that I might lose him. I was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. But right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. 
No one else really knows the extent of His depression. I feel selfish wanting him to stay, because I know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. However the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and I have to think about those things because I will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their Dad. And I cannot imagine life without my soul mate. I don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I feel so scared and alone.

** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. This is my first post and first I thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how I was feeling. 

I know it sounds like I’m giving up, but truly I will fight with him as long as he wants. He knows this. He also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. Depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (In my opinion) 

So I’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. 

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. Working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. He’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! 

And we have a beautiful family. We have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. They know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. My kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. 

And for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know I hear you. Keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but I am proof, it’s possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bxw9gd/it_is_likely_that_ill_lose_my_husband_to_suicide/,186,"I have some thought that I doubt will be popular but I hope they are helpful. 

1. Compassion

What Ive found most in my journey here is the almost zero level of compassion for being on the side of life's bell curve that makes one not what to play this Earth game anymore. 

Let him know you understand. Let him know how proud you are for his fight up to this point. No one, and I mean no one has ever uttered these words to me. Most just say how you can't commit suicide...instead of recognizing the effort to remain here long after it seems like the loving and compassionate thing to do is leave. 

Seriously, Let him know you are in love with him, and proud of his fight but understand him and just want peace for him. It might jus give him something to fight a little longer for. 

2. Ownership

While your fear is valid, I would take ownership of the choices that got you here and remove that stress from the debate. You chose to have this life despite admitting to its knowledge beforehand. This means you are responsible for the actions that come. 

You chose this risky behavior for the sake of love. Maybe love is what you need to look at. Maybe you gave him an extra 5 years because you loved him when other women would have broke him. Focus on what you've helped him with not your future responsibilities. No guilt. No shame. Just a life choice. 

Maybe its loving him so much to allow him to end his suffering. You signed up for this and you might be the only person to help him and show him the compassion he needs. Love is not always saying you cant kill yourself because X,Y,Z but facing difficult situation and showing love and compassion. 

3. Fix his gut

Some time ago I started on this path to fix my gut I didnt know was messed up. When I did this my depression went away almost entirely. I think almost everyone in the west has a fucked up stomach... I won't get into here for brevity but seriously... fix your gut, fix your depression... The real problem is then not being depressed or sad in anyway and still having to push thru the issue and stay here. 

I hope this helps. I wish you the most light and love you'll need in the tough situation. (hugs) ",2019-06-07 15:57:00

I’m young, 17, and I understand there’s so many years that I could have, I just don’t want them. I’ve contemplated suicide a few times over the years, I’m sure everyone has, but it was always a fleeting thought, now it’s constant. 
I just lost a parent, I’m in so much pain, not just mental, mostly physical actually. I live with health conditions that leave me in pain every second of every day, no matter what I do. The odd thing is, I’m not depressed, I deal with crippling anxiety, but not so much depression. 
I’ve been in therapy for a couple years now, she’s an amazing therapist, I genuinely couldn’t ask for anything more, she has tried very hard. The only time I’ve ever admitted wanting to die is last week, I regretted saying it immediately, she asked a couple questions, I answered honestly but told her I didn’t want to say anything else as I was scared she would tell my mother and I would be committed. She said she didn’t have to break confidentiality unless she suspected I was a danger to myself, doing things like stockpiling, planning etc. 
so obviously I didn’t admit that I had been doing those things, because I don’t want to be stopped. 
I honestly don’t understand why we try so hard to save people that don’t want to be saved. If someone wants to die, and they are so determined that they will do whatever it takes to make it happen, let them do it. At least they’d be able to go out with some shred of dignity. I’ve set a date to do it multiple times, and then backed out at the last minute, but tonight’s the night, I’m done backing out. I was scared this morning, and then counted how much I had stockpiled and was suddenly so relieved and for the first time in a while, felt excited. I can’t wait to go to sleep and not have to wake up resentful that I’m waking up. 
I feel bad that my family will have to find me, but not bad enough that I’m not going to do it.

I also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. Now I'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, I'm in a club, looking better... But scared of future and everything. I have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing I must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. I'm OK with family - but I never told them I want to kill myself. I plan to visit a Halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens I'm gonna overdose. I just wanna feel loved at once.

Been diagnosed with SzPD, paranoid schizophrenia, depression and social anxiety. Before that I've spent 2 years untreated, including a year in total social isolation. Was told by a psychotherapist that I was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care.

I've since got out and found a job I've always dreamed of having. I am trying to improve and integrate into society, but the effort seems fruitless. I feel like I am constantly lying to people by acting as if everything's alright, by smiling and pretending to be happy. Even my therapist couldn't tell the state I am actually in. Needless to say, even though I told him about it, he didn't help much.

I am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, following any advice given in therapy. It's just not helping me against this.

I've tried looking for a suicide hotline, but there are no active ones in my country. So I've decided to post here and it's the first time I am opening about this to strangers. Please, don't tell me to discuss this with my family. The last time I've told them about it - they commited me to yet another mental hospital.

I remember when I was a kid and I thought I’d have a wife or girlfriend when I grew up, what a fucking joke. Instead here I am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me

I’ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because I’m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and I’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

I’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but I’m a man and I can’t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy I’m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again it’s been so long




BIG UPDATE: ASKED HER OUT SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME TOO BUT WE UNDER QUARANTINE LMAO",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fj5nq9/i_really_just_wish_someone_gave_a_fuck_about_me/,505,"You can’t be happy with someone else unless you are happy with yourself. 

If you hope that other people will make you happy, you’ve put your happiness into very risky hands. Other people will sooner make you miserable than happy, when you put your happiness in their hands.

You may assume, for example, that you will be happy when you fall in love with the right person. Someone who will really love you back and understand you to the bone. And then it happens. And you’re happy all the way up to the first fight. Or the first time your love is in a bad mood. Or they flirt with someone else. Or whatever. Then everything collapses. And you’re unhappy again.

Neither a perfect lover nor a perfect boss can make you happy. Or a new friend. Or an alien. Other people will sooner make you miserable than happy. Many unintentionally and many on purpose. Because they are just humans like you are. Much like you make others’ lives tougher if you’re unhappy. Why? Because people have to listen to all your bitching, whining and complaining, while deep inside they might hope you’ll make them happy.

I know it kind of sucks. You can’t make other people permanently happy, other people can’t make you a happier person, but they can surely make you unhappy – an abusive partner or parents, a jackass boss or an ignorant friend or whoever you love.

So here is what you should do regarding relationships and happiness:

First of all, you should at all costs avoid people who make your life miserable intentionally or are zombies or energy vampires. And you should surround yourself with happy, encouraging and supportive people who bring out the best in you. While doing that, make sure you aren’t infecting them with your unhappiness.

Then you should expect that even the loveliest people, even the most positive living beings, will hurt you from time to time. So you should always have a center on yourself, and be aware that your happiness shouldn’t depend on other people (we will see how you can achieve that at the end of the blog post).

You can absolutely be in a bad mood when someone disappoints you, but you should also get yourself back in your center after a short while.

Other people can’t make you a happy person, but they can make your life a little bit happier or completely miserable. So don’t put your happiness in the hands of other people, but make sure people aren’t the ones making you unhappy and miserable.

If you cut out of your life all the negative people who drag your happiness level down, it may be a solution to being happier in life. But unfortunately, that’s rarely the case.

You will probably find other things to be unhappy about or attract other assholes in life who will make you unhappy again. The outside world, including your relationships, only mirrors your inner emotional state and processes.

If you’re unhappy, it's very hard to have happy relationships. And if you were a happy person, you would have ditched the negative people in your life a long time ago. To sum up:

Crappy people in your life = May be the reason why you are unhappy in your life
No crappy people in your life = If you are still unhappy. ",2020-03-15 18:13:20

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dem5tu/i_got_a_gun_to_kill_myself_and_my_parents_found/,542,"Hey!!! You're loved!!! Period. You have purpose even if you don't see it
You're on suicide watch because our Lord straight up said.... NOPE!!! NOT leaving. Not your time.
Yea suck it up, but no guilt trip here. It's about finding yourself, seeing your gifts, your abilities, and trusting on your light that there IS benefit for your life, your living!!!

Try different meds ones that don't have the same side affects and WHILE on your meds please feed yourself, exercise, try not to abuse yourself by controlling what you ""feel"" you have control over.  Binging and purging.

Find a different therapist sometimes it take YEARS to find one you can connect with, God willing you don't have to wait so long. Find a trauma therapist, stick with your psychiatrist, see an internal med doc, try some cognitive behavioral health sessions, or eating disorder groups, or self help groups. 

READ. Read other's stories and struggles and how they over came them. Pick it apart, choose what servers you, let go of what doesn't. 

The ""guilt""trip is nothing more than individuals who have no other resources available to them. They're digging at the bottom of the barrel because that what was ingrained in them growing up. Some people run on pain and turn things around other's they simply barrel diem the freaking worm hole of abuse. 

If you get anything out of my response get this, 

YOU are worthy of a happy life, you deserve to be free of the pains that still haunt you, you deserve to let go.... let go of what does NOT serve you. You deserve to see and feel the beauty of life and the GIFT it truly is. 

Please rethink your plans. Rethink who's controlling you. You ARE NOT a puppet so cut the strings that hold you and torment you. Walk free flick the dust off your shoulder, pull yourself up by your boot straps, remind yourself YOU GOT THIS, you were NOT an accident. 

You are purposely made with great strength, deep love, understanding, and the ability to pull out of the trenches, because you SEE... heal yourself first, while healing other's, main focus is you otherwise you're no good for anyone else. 

""Man up"" means morning more than,  SEE YOURSELF, your future. Your happiness basking in the glory of the light above. 

Don't make a snap decision, for a temporary situation. YOU and you alone have control on which path you take, how much you want to suffer, whether or not you stand still and put the ""record on skip"". There's no reasons to continue to abuse. Break free my friend. You obviously have the power to do so. So now use that energy for good not for destruction. 

The dark forces, energies, low level frequencies thrive off that bullshit. Tell them to fuck off and go get what YOU know you deserve. 

Here's a hint..... It's NOT suffering. Contact me anytime. I would love to go through this journey with you as a support. 

Remember not all give give all hence why it takes a village to raise a child, a teen  am adult, and the elderly. Stick together, shoulder to shoulder and remember everyone has a level I  which they are capable of when it comes to support, love, understanding, and compassion. It does not make them inadequate. It makes them what you need, because REMEMBER it takes a village. 

Please continue to seek your life, your understanding, healing, appreciation, acceptance, forgiveness, and most importantly the belief that you are created for more.

Misery was not ""really""in the agenda. 

What does NOT serve you, let go!!

Contact me anytime.

Yours truly an understanding soul ",2019-10-07 16:52:36

What if I could admit this to a psychiatrist/therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med + therapy combo to get me on the right track?

Because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as I’m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for 3 or more days *wouldn’t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future*.

What if I could just be candid about how I feel so that I can get treated? Can’t imagine that I’m the only one who feels this way. Makes me feel horribly alone.

The second thing was to commit suicide to prove that these people did not have the power to prevent it!!  My higher mind prevailed and I called a family member instead.

However, and I think the people who have such powers should be aware of this, the feeling of being psychically imprisoned as well as the emotional imprisonment from faulty brains, is a huge stress factor which can actually cause suicide or self-harm.  

I was effectively prevented from getting the help I need by that junior doctor because, as a direct result of her actions, I distanced myself from medicine as a whole.

I've had these thoughts for a long time now. The difference is that I don't think negatively about suicide now.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist.

399,afo6tb,False,,67,My boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day.,SuicideWatch,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up.

To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

I was an outcast most of my teenage years - no friends, no boyfriend, always at home in my computer. And I always dreamed of the things you write. I recall thinking ""I'll never take a summer trip with friends because I have none"".

Three years later, I started college. Formed a nice group, we were friends for a while. And we took a summer trip together. It felt so nice, even if we didn't remain friends. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is gjve yourself a chance. You are capable of making friends. Perhaps in a different environment, you can feel at ease enough to form bonds with other people. I know that you are capable of being a friend, and someone out there would appreciate you.

He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay.

385,ed9ci5,False,,42,My worst fear has come true and I have already decided that I am going to take my own life,SuicideWatch,"I am a 31 yo gay male who was severely bullied throughout my childhood whilst having to come to terms with my sexuality. Nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when I was growing up it was not. I was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. I was very confused and vulnerable at the time so I felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.

As a result, I developed OCD and body dysmorphia. From that point on I thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if I was perfect. I strived for perfection; i was a straight A student, I ate really healthy, I was physically active and I valued my appearance above all else. I could confidently say that I was an attractive guy and I know now I had a lot going for me. Regardless of how hard I tried to be perfect over the years I developed social anxiety and although I had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and I missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. Slowly but surely I was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. I had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. 

When I turned 29 I fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. I thought I could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. It wasn’t until we moved in together that I realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - Like I was back in high school. He was a sociopath but I didn’t realise until it was too late. He abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til I was nothing. 

After 2 years of torment I finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. My body dysmorphia and OCD came back but with extreme vengeance. I dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. My hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so I went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst I was there I also got Lipo on my stomach even though I know now I didn’t even need it. I came back from Turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. I was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.

It all took a turn for the worst when I started focusing on my skin. My skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. I researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. I bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. After the first few sessions I noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. I brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. Cut to the last session I got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. In the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face I look deformed. My entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. I have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. This disfigurement is permanent and I look like a monster. 

I have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but I just can’t. One told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value I put on myself was in my appearance. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to die. I feel like if I didn’t have body dysmorphia Which is obviously making the situation so much worse I may have stood a chance. 

I have taken a month off work for the Christmas period and have been staying at my parents because I’m too scared to be alone. For the past month  I have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. Every part of my being has given up on life and I havnt left my room. I have been researching ways to end my life and I feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. My worst fears have come true.

My parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. I wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. Everyday for the past month I have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. My brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. He showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. Unbeknown to him this is how I plan to end it.

did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities I used to love and harmed myself. 

started having suicidal thoughts and a year after I attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.

was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend. i've been so happy with him these past months. but with him only. i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before, except when i was spending time with him.
