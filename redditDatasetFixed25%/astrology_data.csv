907,90s6ss,False,,23,Closing out Cancer season and hello Leo season!,astrology,"Wow. Cancer season was a ride, right? Cancers are the mothers of the zodiac and ruled by the moon. We have all been asked to see ourselves for what we really are. The mother is sometimes tough love. Where do you need to be better? Hopefully the Capricorn full moon shed some light on what you need to let go of so you can keep moving forward toward your higher self. That one was conjunct Pluto as well. Oof. Deep digging way down in the underworld of your psyche. I know some of you love that spooky shit lol, but some of us... damn.

That eclipse. The eclipse/new moon in Cancer. Where do you need to mother yourself better? Are you taking care of yourself? Are you punishing yourself for something bad you did a long time ago that you haven't let go of yet? Take the last bit of cancer season to flush out your emotional wounds with salt water. Our bodies are 70% salt water. We all possess the healing power of salt water within us. 

Many people feel bad. I feel bad too sometimes. All this retrograde action, the eclipses, transiting Pluto is conjunct my natal moon right now, retrograde Mars is conjunct my natal Saturn. It's a tough time for everyone. But now, it's time. Cancer season has washed you off with the ocean and this is who you are. 

This is who you are and now it'll be Leo season. If there's one thing you can learn from a Leo, it's how to use your heart to live your life out loud. It's how to be the most genuine, most authentic version of yourself and it's time to fall in love with that person. Whatever you found out about yourself in Cancer season IS YOU. And this is what you have to work with. Use your heart. Do what you love and keep doing that thing. Open your heart to everything and everyone. Keep what makes you happy. Accept yourself for who you are and work to make yourself better. Ask yourself, ""is this really who I am?"". Most of all, have fun! Leo season is homecoming for the sun. No more deep dark moody times. Everything is about to get light-hearted and joyful. Don't miss it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/90s6ss/closing_out_cancer_season_and_hello_leo_season/,104,what a great post üíõ ,2018-07-21 20:17:12
817,fcyfdq,False,,123,astrology and the COVID-19 virus,astrology,"well i‚Äôve been following this train of thought and i wanna hear what everyone else thinks about this. i‚Äôm not sure if this is insensitive..? so do let me know if it is.

but i feel like the coronavirus has some Saturn energy tied to it because of the vengeful nature that it has. because saturn is known for being karmic etc etc and for repaying what people give out. i‚Äôm not saying all the patients got it because of karma, what i‚Äôm saying is that the biggest stories that surface about the virus and the groups involved tend to have some sort of lesson to be learned from it.

for example, in singapore, there was some christian church group who talked mad shit about the coronavirus being some sort of ‚Äúdivine retribution‚Äù like a punishment from God because of the growing LGBTQ+ support in the country. and IRONICALLY, a while later, the group contracted said virus, and it spread to many members of the church. it was like a talk shit get hit kind of situation.

then, there was a korean christian cult that was rather notorious and they experienced the same thing. where a woman literally refused treatment to spread it to the rest of the cult because she believed that they were the chosen ones to go to heaven or something like that. don‚Äôt quote me lol.

there have been a few more instances of stuff like this that i‚Äôll get into if requested, because it‚Äôs a lot. and very complex too, and i‚Äôm a little too tired to type it all out.

can anyone give any insight into the karmic energy attached to the coronavirus? according to the timeline i think also the virus might have been born during Capricorn season, which is ruled by Saturn.

would love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fcyfdq/astrology_and_the_covid19_virus/,114,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

274,gc7mcd,False,,145,chat application that matches you based on astrological signs,astrology,"Hey everyone! 

I posted about creating an app where you can make friends a while ago on here lol. I thought of maybe having an algorithm where you can be matched with people who have compatible inner planets with you? This option can be turned off as well. You would also be matched with other things about yourself too!

Good idea or bad idea? Feel free to say what you think and why :).

I also want to reallyyyy avoid it being used as a dating app, its focus will be on making lasting friendships.

I'm new to coding, so the app will probably take a couple of years to put out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/gc7mcd/chat_application_that_matches_you_based_on/,331,"If you‚Äôre talking about something complex, that makes sense, but if it‚Äôs sun signs, I‚Äôll pass.

508,fe3eia,False,,27,JoJo (Singer) And the Blessing of the Saturn Return.,astrology,"Edit: Posted this on Twitter and JoJo read and responded! She found it fascinating and loves astrology ü•∞‚ú®


Random but it had to be written. UPROXX recently uploaded a short documentary on JoJo and it resonated so well with what I saw in her chart, rated AA. 

At 13, JoJo experienced massive success (2nd house profection year, hers ruled by expansive Jupiter, which trines her MC--more on that later), but was subsequently held hostage by a greedy (and now defunct) music label. As a result, she couldn't release music for more than a decade.

JoJo is an Aquarius Rising, and her Saturn is at 24 degrees of Capricorn, placing it in the 12th. When the ruling planet of the ASC is averse or ""hidden"" from the ASC, a theme of ""delay"" can prevail, as the steersman of your ship cannot see where it is going. Very frustrating. In JoJo's case, it is further compounded by the fact that her ASC ruler *is* the planet of delay and restriction. And that is further compounded by the fact that its a 12th house placement of loss. Whew!

In the midst of recording additional songs, her label dissolved (12th), yet she was still bound (Saturn) by the terms in her contract. She continued to record music but was not allowed to release any of it. **We need to note that JoJo has a massive 12th house Capricorn stellium--Mercury RX, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and NN.** That she was forced into relative obscurity reinforces 12th house themes of things hidden, things ending, doing things in secret. Music studios are also the 12th house--forced creative isolation. She remarked in the documentary that she would constantly read articles that proclaimed she must have died. She recalled how frustrating it was to see musicians who started after her start to pass and out-succeed her. (Personally, this is such a huge Saturn struggle. It is the bane of my existence. Anyway....)

JoJo has Neptune and Venus closely conjunct in the 12th. In the documentary, she was gaslit into taking medication to make her thinner, under the guise that her label just wanted her to be ""healthy"". The fogginess of Neptune playing out next to her creative planet, Venus, is also indicative of being sold a bill of goods that never comes to be. In the beginning, she was very glamourized by Hollywood, private jets, opening for Usher, etc.--but when the fog settled, she was completely and utterly screwed by signing that contract: Mercury RX in the 12th. RX Mercury begs of you to dive into the details, to double check, to be sure, transit or natal. And music contracts are complicated and obtuse already. Placed in the 12th, she became a victim of her own pen. (Not blaming her, by the way.)

What ensued were years of substance abuse, another 12th house theme, especially with Venus ad Neptune co present. Unable to release or perform music, JoJo became ""a shell of herself"" and had to be ""buzzed"" in order to function. Only the realization that her dad was an addict (who died of his addiction it seemed--went to sleep and never woke up) snapped her back into reality, and she begun to take control. She hired a lawyer and became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with her former label. Her Venus, in the 12th and conj. Neptune, rules her 9th house Libra of contracts, law, legal endeavors. So she was in for an uphill battle. But she has Mars square her ASC, which, yes, can render one a victim to martial energies from others (her label), but also energizes you for battle as a result. In Taurus, it also meant/means she has to fight for her art. 

In the meantime, she decided to release free mixtapes. A Saturn theme is stripping down to bare essentials. Ideally wanting to release music for profit, she had to settle for releasing music for free, and self-funding a lot of her creative endeavors. Though not firmly in her Saturn Return when she released these mixtapes, Saturn themes prevail for as it is her final dispositor. 

Anyway, the story gets happier. In 2014, she was freed from her contract. It was a 12th house profection year, and during Capricorn season. So matters of the 12th house were doubly activated. And Saturn lurked still behind it all. Mars trine Saturn natives also never give up no matter how steep the odds are stacked. Go JoJo!

*""Just imagine how the free bird will sing after being caged for so long,""* wrote one reporter. Holy 12th house! Only now, instead of entering a prison, she was leaving it. And thus began a new cycle for her, as she entered a 1st house year soon after. She signed to Atlantic Records. 

Despite being away for almost a decade, JoJo still had very loyal fans. During her legal battles ""#FreeJoJo"" was used on social media as a means of support for the singer, and many media outlets and blogs publicized her struggle. Fans and celebrities alike stood in solidarity. And when she was finally able to tour and release music again--she sold out shows, was streamed/downloaded tens of millions of times, soared to #1 on iTunes, and recouped all her expenses. Why? Sun and MC in the 11th house in Sag, ruled *and* trined by benefic Jupiter in Leo in her 7th. The 11th house describes the nature of our fans and friends. Though a ""victim"" of her business relationships early on, Jupiter in the 7th and ruling the 11th ensured JoJo would *always* have support from others. It also ensured that her public image, career, and reputation would always remain afloat and gifted positivity and expansion. The Sun and Jupiter also have mutual reception, each in the sign that the other rules. That's a wonderful tag-team to have by yourself to mediate the 12th house loss. Jupiter and Sun inflate you up again---and again and again. Jupiter also rules her second house so: money.

As her Saturn Return started, JoJo re-recorded and re-released her first albums, as her former label removed all of her music from the Internet. Having to go back and re-do everything, and with precision and perfection, (Mercury RX) is Saturnian, but JoJo found it extremely cathartic. She also changed some of the lyrics to reflect that she was in her late 20s now, and not an adolescent. Saturn as ruler of time and maturity.

As her Saturn Return became exact in early 2020, JoJo won her first GRAMMY for a comeback single released in 2019. She went on to be nominated for several other awards, and is slated for bigger things in the future. She announced a new album and tour for Spring 2020.

Whew, won't Saturn do it y'all! After he hits you with 2 by 4 after 2 by 4.

I hope this is reflection for people with heavy 12th house, and retrogrades, and heavy Saturn. Or people just curious/afraid of the Saturn Return. Mine is exact today so I found JoJo's story extremely resonate and because I'm also a trapped musician with Saturn in aversion to the ASC. Yes, shit does end up sucking hard---but never forever. And usually for the better. Saturn came back around for JoJo and as a result, all the planets in the 12th were loosened up to express more freely, retribution was delivered, debts were paid and money was flowing, and most importantly, life purpose was solidified and confirmed. 

p.s. One of her collaborators noted that she had a wise soul trapped inside the body of a young girl. Apropos for Saturn dominate people.

623,fyil51,False,,70,The Planet Jupiter,astrology,"I felt compelled to write about my thoughts on the planet Jupiter for anyone who might be interested- the good and the bad. 

Imagine you're staring up at the stars or standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon overlooking the *vast* expanse in front of you. It's *awe-inspiring*. It fills you with *wonder*. It makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self. The realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away. You look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope. You suddenly have a sense of perspective, understanding, faith, belief in something greater, something higher, something *more*\- this is Jupiter. It is epic in scale, legendary, mythic, beyond words. It fills you up and carries you on a high, makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what's out there, waiting to be uncovered and explored. It makes you seek out and discover, it gives you meaning and purpose in life, it's your compass. This is why it's the Greater Benefic. It rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars. Those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom.¬†Those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn. And Jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge, wonder, and blessings. Astronomically it's the Great Protector, its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the Earth and slinging them away into deep space. 

HOWEVER Jupiter can also become self-righteous, self aggrandising and self-mythologising. Like the Sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance, which with Jupiter can veer into ""I'm divinely chosen, my beliefs are the *right* beliefs, and I'm meant to do something great, it's my calling."" Jupiter can become a zealot. Jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded, not at all rooted in reality. The professor who lectures from their ivory tower, who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn't always deliver. Jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned, the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you. You'll see all these themes (the good and the bad) in the two signs it rules- Sagittarius and Pisces. You'll also see in them Jupiter's indulgence- its indulgence in experiences, alcohol, drugs, food, TV- whatever your vice is, Jupiter (when unhealthy) will want more of it. The expansiveness of Jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction.  

I wrote a bit of an essay there but I love writing about Jupiter. I feel I can speak to its nature with some authority because I have it conjunct my Ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart.

381,f3ay47,False,,33,How Aquarius Can Offer Us Our Best Chance at Love (Happy Valentine's Day).,astrology,"Hi everyone,

Ahead of Valentine's Day tomorrow, I wanted to re-share this researched dig into Aquarius I did last year. It seems that the Aquarius archetype is at odds with the lovey dovey commercialized Valentine's Day we know of now. But maybe it makes...perfect sense?

Enjoy below and enjoy tomorrow, whether you are coupled or single. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

 

**Reframing Aquarius: How the cool and detached offer us our best chance at love**

Like Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine‚Äôs Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more *romantic* days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story. ¬†You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine‚Äôs Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: *love!*¬† But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid‚Äôs foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.

Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy‚ÄîAquarius makes love *ideal.* In any working definition of the word *romance*, ‚Äúidealized love‚Äù makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the *idea* of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn‚Äôt altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love‚Äî who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it‚Äôll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren‚Äôt sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces‚ÄîAquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius‚Äôs love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are. 

Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine‚Äôs Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer‚Äôs daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer‚Äôs daughter, and signed it, *your Valentine.* Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God‚Äôs love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine‚Äôs Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign‚Äîthe push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine‚Äôs Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let‚Äôs mount more evidence...

In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with *Gamelion*, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to *Sacred Wedding* and *Divine Wedding.* These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of *fidelity.* Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality‚Äîtheir love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love‚Äîas when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, \*wink\*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers‚Äîa love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.

In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But as all things start with thought, this isn‚Äôt to be feared. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. Intellect has no bounds. Neither do the Aquarius flights of fancy. And because these ideas are *fixed,* good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and independence. To give love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent, is to experience ecstasy. 

Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn‚Äôs sign of exaltation‚ÄîLibra. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is a through-line connecting the idea of peaceful partnership and love to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love and romance to blossom perennially. 

In sum, I invite you to reframe what you‚Äôve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us our best chance at experiencing a true love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it all the emotional capacity apparent in any other sign. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius. It is this level of belonging, of feeling seen and heard, that allows unbridled love to flow. It could be that the Aquarius tendency for distance and austerity is merely erected as a means of protection. That the love they feel for others must somehow be contained behind a wall, less it completely overwhelm them, less their waters drown the world. But do not be mistaken‚Äîbeyond the ideas of coldness and detachment lies a soft, loving center. A sweetness disguised, but always alive.

*‚ÄúLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind*  
 *And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.‚Äù*

He's pretty darn self preserved and I was convinced for a time he just didn't have emotion.

Because the Moon (and lunations) can represent where intentions can emotionally resonate, and Jupiter is the principle of expansion, optimism and faith, I'm using the confluence of these two planets and their locations in your chart to construct some fairly simple intentions and affirmations to consider. Capricorn and Pisces also form a harmonious sextile, and the Moon will aspect the Pluto-Saturn conjunction through this sextile, something I think matters as we consider what awaits January 12th and the themes that are probably already presenting themselves. Though not as seamless as a trine, sextiles still provide ease and success when acted upon and acknowledged. The opportunity awaits to be seized!¬†

(I understand that some people will be getting shit faced tonight, but you can easily do these on New Year's Day too.)  


**Aries:** I intend to set time aside to visit and nurture my hidden parts. Time spent in silence and introspection benefits me as I move into 2020. In these spots between my thoughts, remarkable new ideas for my changing career and purpose will reveal themselves to me. I move into my position on the world stage with ease and grace, and with with the invisible powers of cosmic companions always guiding me. Any insecurity becomes my security, and any hardship is insurance for my benefit.

**Taurus:** I intend to find and spend time with the people who matter most to me, whose goals and ideas are congruent with mine, and who champion my growth. I excel in communities of like-minded individuals, and flourish when I challenge my own beliefs and worldviews. 2020 brings to me a refreshed set of principles and beliefs, foreign experiences, teachings, and hope. I look forward to sharing what I've learned and experienced in the spaces that take me as I am.

**Gemini:** I intend to plant wondrously imaginative seeds for my career and invest in opportunities and people who share my vision. As I skip into 2020, I am reassured knowing that all I need is there. Debts are paid, forgiven, and pave the way for my comeback. Financial strength is my birthright and easily achieved through the discipline I am being taught. I learn to share and trust others with my gems, immaterial or material. I move into vulnerability knowing that it is my greatest strength, and provides the biggest dividends for my dreams.

**Cancer:** I intend to form healthy boundaries with loving people, and enter into relationships with a sobered and practical mind. What I have learned from others, good or bad, only serves to strengthen my belief in myself, and my suspicion that life is indeed good after all. As I enter 2020, my faith, though perhaps battered and bruised, remains alive. My emotional immune system is strong. I open my heart to new ideas and ways of thinking, beliefs that soothe my soul. I open my arms to people who wish to bring new ideas my way. I easily let go of people unworthy of my deep running waters, knowing that they will be replaced in multitudes by softer and kinder spirits.¬†

**Leo:** I intend to form a healthy relationship to...health. I know that my body is sacred, and that the foods and tonics I supply it with serve to enhance my day to day life. I am worthy of a firm, robust body, mind, and spirit. As I enter 2020, it is knowing that the work I do on a daily basis matters, and that I have the power to change and inspire my everyday, turning what is mundane into something magical. I rely on my spirituality and the help of benefactors to change what needs changing, and to uplift what may feel deflated. I have sound financial acuity, and am rich beyond means in heart, warmth and joy. The Sun shines forth as I go forth.

**Virgo:** I intend to dream bigger dreams of love, romance, and partnership. As I enter 2020, I know that disillusionment is turned to diamonds--clear cut and beautiful. Where I may have been left adrift by others set me on the path to wash up on shore of a love and personal life I never thought possible. I am grateful for the wild ride, and look forward to relaxation. The people and partnerships I meet, form and continue in 2020 inspire me to create, to play, to have fun, and to just enjoy. I am reacquainted with my inner child.

**Libra:** I intend to grow wherever it is that I am planted. I know that the peace and security of home cannot be taken from me, and travels and flows wherever it is that I go. I am safe, I am stable. As I move into 2020, I know that my body is restorative and strong, that ailments act as a catapult to launch me into stronger and enduring vitality. My work in the world is shifting, but gathers purpose and meaning along the way, as long as I have faith that I am on the right path. I do not mourn anything that has been buried or come to an end, for I know that they were seeds, and the forthcoming blossom will be worth it.

**Scorpio:** I intend to honor my words, thoughts, and ideas. Where my communication and mental processes may have been wrought with difficulty or confusion, I now let move me into creative ways to articulate and express. I am allowed to be unique, to think differently, and to let pain inform some of my greatest works.What I say and what I think matters. The players in my everyday life are of benefit to me. My neighborhood, my commute, my siblings...they all conspire to fill my brain and my life with fresh new perspectives and inspiration. I am out from under the trap of intellectual expectation, and I brand my own version of intelligence. I am the playwright of my own life, and am joyously filling my pages.

**Sagittarius:** I intend to value myself and the creature comforts that bolster my self perception and self esteem. As I move into 2020, I see money as a currency. That is, merely a source of energy that can be expended however I choose. I move forward knowing abundance will find me even around the darkest of corners, and carry me through comfortably as I reevaluate what does and doesn't matter. As I invest in myself, I invest in my home, knowing that firm footing creates the foundation for all of the dreams I have. My family and/or chosen tribe is where I find compassion, solace, and magic. They have my back, just as I have my own.

**Capricorn:** I intend to look in the mirror with pride. Oh how proud I am of myself! The rocks thrown my way do not break me. Parts of me may be cratered, but they are as resilient and beautiful as the moon--enduring, never complaining, always shining. As I move into 2020, I am becoming more of who I always knew I could be, and looking upon my shedding layers fearlessly, welcoming in my sturdy new skin. I hold myself in high esteem, and communicate with myself with unending compassion. I am brave enough to throw away outdated behaviors and habits, and to replace them with newer dreams and visions. As I do, my life resets, and the people and places I share this new life with reflect back to me the beauty of my transformation.

**Aquarius:** I intend to know my worth. Behind every breath, every pause, and every brief moment of introspection, is a whisper of encouragement from the recesses of my soul. As I enter 2020, I marry the immaterial with the material, using the sacred information found in bouts of rest and retreat to move me forth into abundance, in the hand and in the mind. I do not fear what is uncovered, what is ended, or what is perceived. I know that I am big magic, the ultimate alchemist, turning rough metals, with time, into gold.

**Pisces:** I intend to dream myself into being and to become the walking manifestation of my goals. As I swim into 2020, I recognize that the communities, groups and friends that have seemed to block my flow, are actually dams that help my waters runneth over. Associates and associations may have left me wanting, working, or weeping, so I now choose to spend my empathy and compassion on worthy companions and causes. I fear not that I've wasted any time, and am grateful to have been steered into this conviction. I know that the goals I have are worthy and possible, and that the people I need to make them happen are on the way. I build the dream, and the dream team too.

814,bcuggp,False,,118,Moon in Cancer Overview,astrology,"Moon is in domicile in Cancer. This means that, since Moon is the natural ruler of Cancer, it feels at home with this sign.¬†Moon represents emotions, the inner self, our personality and needs and well as the feminine energy and the mother.

The reason Moon feels best when in Cancer is because Cancer embodies all the qualities Moon represents: Cancer is caring and emotional, introspective and (usually) family oriented. Cancer Moons are unusually perceptive when it comes to emotions, even more than Cancer Suns. They seem to instinctively know how you feel and what you need and will do their best to take care of your emotional needs. That is unless they are too preoccupied with their own emotions that they have to put you on hold until they sort their problems out. It's not that they don't want to help you, because they do, but their own emotions can at times be so overwhelming that they have to deal with them first.

If, on the other hand, a Cancer Moon native is not dealing with the intense emotions of their own, they are the best confidants you can find. They will listen to you and actually care about what you're saying. If you feel bad, they will feel bad, too (if they like you, of course). They have very warm and soothing energy unless they go into their crabby moods and start sulking. Nevertheless, their sulking behavior is not destructive and they will try to smooth things over as soon as their emotions are stabilized.

If poorly aspected, they are prone to pushing their way, sulking and pouting when things don't go as they wished. They want peace and harmony but on their terms. Luckily, because they do genuinely care about others, if you present them your case from the emotional point of view, they are likely to concede. The key with a Cancer Moon is always emotion. Because they see the world through the lenses of their feelings, they will be sympathetic to your feeling as well.

The biggest problem for anyone with strong Cancer influence, be it Sun, Moon, personal planets or Imum Coeli in combination with two or more of the personal planets/Luminaries, is the insecurity. That‚Äôs the main issue all the other issues stem from. Because Cancer is so insecure it very often results in all of the selfish and manipulative behavior. Let me be clear here - Cancers are not manipulative because they want to or because of some devious reasons. No. Cancers are manipulative because they don‚Äôt feel safe. If a Cancer would feel safe, all of this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

Moon in Cancer people are avid of love and acceptance. It‚Äôs not only that they want to receive love, but they also want to give love‚Ä¶ big time. They are very perceptive of other people‚Äôs emotions but because of the insecurities we mentioned before, a Cancer Moon person also tends to read into things that are not there, like taking a slight from a simple, misinterpreted look.

Depending on the rest of the chart, If the Cancer Moon native doesn't get the attention they need, they might seek it through passive-aggression. They will not be doing it on purpose or even be aware that they are doing it, but if they feel that the other person is not giving them the amount of attention they feel they deserve, they may either attack the other person (verbally) or sulk and pout until that other person does what they want.

Nevertheless, when they do care about you, they are capable of moving mountains for you. Because they are so intuned with your feelings, they will do important things for you that you haven‚Äôt even asked them to. They will take care of you and your emotional needs as long as you show them enough attention and love and, for them, it‚Äôs almost never enough.

If you find yourself in any kind of trouble, rest assured that these people will make their own personal mission to help you out, no matter what. Remember that video of a crab (animal) helping out his crab friend? Cancer Moon natives are like that - they might not know how to help themselves, but they will risk everything to help you if they truly care for you.

i'd say rule #1 for cancer moons is to realize and reinforce your emotional boundaries because things get messy and it's easy to feel at a loss if not clearly marked out ",2019-04-13 19:50:39

Time to take action to better your life & financial situation by manifesting your dreams and transforming your emotions.

Dream to your Highest power and speak it into existence (but watch how you speak it). Combine your 3rd dimensional world with 4th dimensional ideas to operate on a Higher level. Create a vision board and put intention into your thoughts & practices to create the path forward. Mercury is still Retrograde, so don't rush the process and take time to reevaluate, rethink before setting anything into stone. Allow yourself to build with clay before drying into bricks. Don't max yourself out, but remain focused on the tasks at hand. Pisces calls for us to go with the flow; allow the Universe to work through you for you. Give yourself time to relax and refresh to remain balanced in the journey ahead. Take time to meditate. Focus on your biggest dreams, set your intentions, and initiate the action so that the Universe may bring you upon your Divine calling. New Moons may make you feel tired, especially in Pisces, so allow yourself time to rest as a new cycle is beginning. The work begins now.. Manifest. The stars are the limit, and they are limitless.

411,hr743v,False,,32,A Beautiful Astrological Portrait Connecting Naya Rivera and Cory Monteith,astrology,"I want to preface this by saying that this post will be centered on celebrating the life of Naya Rivera, and finding cosmic catharsis about what Astrology can show us about this moment in time for her and her soul. I will be couching everything in my Aquarius brand of impartiality, which I hope conveys a spirit of education and understanding versus usurping a tragic moment for clout. Though, if you see it that way, I do understand. I figured that since now all the what if's and when's and how's of the event have been answered, it would be an ok time to approach this event from a spiritual POV, and add to the zeitgeist of the moment.

I won't be examining the death of Naya or the circumstances surrounding it. I instead was curious about the Astrological through-line between Cory and Naya, and how the day of her recovery marked 7 years since his passing.

One of their Glee costars stated that Cory, in spirit, helped find Naya yesterday, bringing closure and peace. That made me go ""hmm"". And instead of excavating the crude facts of the moment, I was curious to examine what Astrology had to say about more intangible things like spirit guides, or help from beyond, the soul, and other karmic resonances.

Naya's body was recovered at 9:10 am in Ventura, CA (Lake Piru) on July 13th, 2020. [source](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/naya-rivera-dead-glee-star-body-drowning-obituary?bfsource=relatedmanual)

For this, I want to focus on the NN (soul stuff), the MC (the most elevated part of the chart) and the Sun. Why? I figured that a recovery mission, something brought to light, would engage the planet of spotlight (Sun) and the highest moment in the sky (midheaven/MC). NN would point more towards the soul direction of a moment. I will also incorporate the 12th house--where things hide, and especially in water. Here is what I found:

\-The chart of the moment of recovery for Naya has the MC at 27 degrees of Taurus. Cory's Sun in Taurus conjuncts that point.

\-Cory's Sun in Taurus is also in Naya's natal 12th house. When you read this from a synastry POV, there are overwhelming themes of unconscious/subconscious bonds. Trouble, endings, loss. The Sun person illuminates the 12th house. Extrapolate if you will, to see Cory's Sun as helper/finder of Naya's resting place, where she lost her life, where she transitioned into the unconscious

\-The asteroid ""Cora"", closest to Cory (which I've learned is okay--to find the object with the name CLOSEST to the one you're looking for), is exactly conjunct the NN of the moment, 28 Gemini. Naya's natal Moon is also 28 Gemini in the 1st house. Cora, besides being facsimile for ""Cory"", is a name derived from the Greek goddess Persephone. She was goddess of the underworld, and represents the ""perennial change from life to death""

\-With the NN of the moment at 28 Gemini, exactly conjunct her natal Moon--we can see that the direction of karma in the moment related to her identity as mother. She put the responsibility of being a mother ahead of herself (Moon in 1st house). Reports are now showing that Naya used the last of her energy to boost her son up on the boat, unable to muster the energy to save herself.

\-In the chart of Naya's recovery, the asteroid ""Nayam"" was in the 12th house, and ""Nayan"" in the 7th conjunct Neptune, a planet responsible for drownings.

\-Cory's Cancer NN conjunct the Cancer Sun of the moment Naya was found

\-Seven years ago, Mars was at 29 degrees of Gemini, conj Naya's Moon. Conj. the NN of her recovery. Not sure what this means but wanted to make mention.

\-Naya's NN in Aries squares Cory's NN in Cancer almost exactly:

&#x200B;

>*""When one person's Nodes squares the other person's Nodes in synastry this will correlate to two¬† Souls who have been in some kind of relationship in which various dynamics and issues between them has caused them to separate from one another previous to the current life.  Coming into this life with that signature correlates to the intentions of each of their Soul's to 'pick up where it was left off' in order to continue to confront those issues so that the evolution together can continue in some way.""*

I find that to be very resonate, given that she was found on an anniversary of his death, and generally also died around the anniversary of his death. Both of their souls were working in tangent, but it is not up to us to clearly know or see how.

That is all I have for now, or perhaps forever. Without Cory's actual birth time and therefore house placement, there is only so much excavation that can be done. But I hope what I provided above helped you to be able reframe the breadth (and depth) of astrology, and see how it can be used to tie together resonance between two souls.

Thoughts? I'm 100% down with people thinking this is a stretch.

By [Ascendifi](https://www.ascendifi.com)

1.  **Face the Truth**: Has there been a situation in your life you have been turning a blind eye to? Neptune likes to keep the blinders over our eyes but since it‚Äôs Retrograde in its home sign of Pisces it is ripping off your glasses and pushing you straight into the sunlight. It may seem intense at first, but you can no longer hide how you feel about a person/situation any longer. Change is scary, but nothing is scarier than staying stagnant because it may be rough for an undisclosed amount of time. If you think back, weren‚Äôt you always happy you chose change over comfort?  


2.  **Tap into your spiritual side**: It‚Äôs time to take a hold of your anxiety and show it who is boss. Don‚Äôt try to fight these feelings but rather observe them and see what you can do to soothe yourself until the feeling passes. Meditate, ground yourself in nature, be present in the moment, get to know yourself again.  


3.  **Turn your vision into reality:** Neptune has been direct since November 27, 2019. How many of your promises have you kept to yourself? Have you worked on your dreams or even acknowledged them? Have you cut through subconscious thoughts and limiting beliefs? It is now time to look at your progress and make the necessary changes to heal and build your vision.

378,fgzusg,False,,42,Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison,astrology,"his chart is rated C, so take with grain of salt.

I was interested in examining his transits for today (and other timings techniques) versus a natal explanation (which has been done here, If you search there‚Äôs a really good one by u/SmoothieGoat) to see what planetary energies contributed to his sentencing. He will likely die in prison, as his lawyers said even 5 years would be a life sentence.

His birthday is March 19th. So I saw it fitting to cast his solar return chart. There, he is in for a Gem Rising year with transit Uranus and Venus in his 12th. He is being imprisoned for his acts of sexual violence towards women (Venus). Uranus there, to me, completes a sad story shown in his natal chart. He has natal Uranus in Cancer opposite his Capricorn Moon. His relationship to his mom and childhood was most likely cold, hardened, and erratic in some way, and that first relationship to a woman, for men, can indeed portend how one may treat women as an adult. Uranus in his Solar Return 12th, almost at the exact same degree, illustrates a disturbing culmination to that natal promise. And indeed, with all the planets that have and are transiting Capricorn right now, those issues are at the very least karmically highlighted for him if not literally. He has Capricorn moon in the 3rd, which relates to upbringing. 

His solar return Chiron is placed in the 11th (honors, fame) conjunct his Sun in the 10th. Soiled reputation. Chiron in Aries is also ruled by Mars, and his is natally precariously placed in square to Pluto. 

His natal 7th house (Taurus) becomes his SR 12th house (imprisonment revolving around personal relationships), and for what it‚Äôs even worth, his SR 5th house, Libra (sexual desires), is his natal 12th. Venus rules both Libra and Taurus. So generally just a lot of themes of sexual impropriety, women, relationships, prisons, endings, death, etc.

His natal 8th, the place of death and mortality, is his solar return 1st house. Maybe he will literally die. Who knows. But he is certainly in the last chapters of his life. His solar return 8th house is Capricorn, with all 3 malefics currently placed there plus Jupiter. Heavy 8th and 12th emphasis is going to make for a dark year. 

His solar return Venus (and thus transit Venus) is forming a trine with Saturn and Pluto. Retribution and punishment for crimes against women. 

His solar return Moon is in Aquarius in the 9th. Aquarius occupies the 4th house of his natal, opposite that ruthless Pluto conjunct MC in Leo. He will probably be coming to terms with his career, his role in his own demise, and likely through 9th house themes of faith and religion. It‚Äôs not uncommon that convicted criminals come to devote their lives to Jesus (or whatever and whomever) while incarcerated. A real test of faith is beginning.

Transit wise, Mercury direct in his natal 5th. Whatever legal deliberations were needed were carried through with the directness of a Mercury direct station. Inward analysis became outwardly expressed conclusions. Pisces occupies his natal 5th so: sex crimes and the general dark side Piscean gaslighting, seeing how far one can take things, zero boundaries, etc.

There‚Äôs something about his NN at 0 Pisces (conj Venus) and his Sun at 29 Pisces that is profound to me. I can‚Äôt articulate it but his soul incarnated for some challenged lessons around women, sex and pleasures. Yeesh. 

Interestingly but not exact, his natal progressed mars stationed retrograde and is marching backwards into his 12th house to join his natal RX Neptune and RX Saturn. While his natal progressed Venus is marching up into his 8th. 

His progressed Moon is also conjunct that natal Uranus I spoke about above. He is also in his 8th house year right now about to enter a 9th house one, where that Uranus and progressed moon are. 

A culmination of themes.

892,8xqk7w,False,,53,Jupiter is Direct Y'all. Let The Church Say AMEN!,astrology,"I'm interested in how Jupiter's retrograde worked out for you all. What did you learn, how did you grow, what did you acquire? And how will you use it to know go forth?

Jupiter RX'd in my 6th whole sign house, and stomped the breaks on my day jorb and to a lesser degree, my health. A raise I was promised was halted. I felt very stuck in my job and was considering all these radical (and nonsensical) ways to leave. My daily routines were becoming boring and borderline depressing and out of step. I hit a plateau in my fitness journey. I had health ""scares"" (mostly hypochondria), and my mental health plummeted. I had to take a break from my tarot readings. Money flow was TIGHT. SO TIGHT.

And because Jupiter was in Scorpio, I fell down a rabbit hole of examining everything to death, piecing together deeper meanings. It was a rich, introspective time that spawned from a lot of external turmoil.

Mostly what I learned was confidence in self and what I can offer to the world. I also learned not to rush things, as Jupiter RX makes luck and blessings seem THAT much more out of reach, and I was rushing around trying to create them for myself.

During the last few days and certainly today, I don't feel blocked anymore. I've been optimistically throwing my resume around, pitching myself for projects, creating random content and ideas. Most surprisingly (and a lil coz of Uranus), I got a lightening strike idea for a business I want to start, and am receiving help and guidance there.

Coincidentally, today I am finally seeing a new doctor (6th house!)--one who has compassion and bed-side manner through the roof. I've been seeing a really stoic, cold and clinical doctor for years who just throws pills and unhelpful advice at me, and today I am cherishing the chance to be seen by someone who actually cares. Thanks Jupiter!

I'm feeling very hopeful now, and in the midst of some upcoming eclipses on my Sun and money houses, the addition of Jupiter direct makes me feel like a turning point is truly on the way, and gives me an extra boost of joyful anticipation. A grand trine this week too.

864,eysxl7,False,,50,Rush Limbaugh Announces Advanced Lung Cancer. Saturn conj Pluto.,astrology,"His birthday was January 12. The day of the exact conjunction bearing down on his Sun in a Capricorn in the 12th house of endings, loss, misfortune. (The lunar eclipse that happened 2 days prior took place in his 6th house of health). He actually also said he knew something was wrong on the day of January 12th, when he experienced shortness of breath. 

His solar return for this year had the Saturn Pluto conjunction taking place in his 3rd house. While it may be a stretch to assign the function of breathing to the 3rd house, lung capacity and the actual mechanics behind talking goes hand in hand with being able to consistently communicate and verbalize ideas over a broadcast radio show. He said he will have to be off air and miss some shows in order to receive treatment. Chiron is also in his solar return 6th.

His solar return Moon in Leo is conjunct his MC. That he had to come out and make an emotional revelation that will affect his career is in direct opposition to his Aquarian sensibilities ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like making things about me,‚Äù he said in the release.

839,a7u4e9,False,,103,The Astrology of Racism,astrology,"I recently read a forum about possible placements and aspects that could point towards racist tendencies.

A few years ago, a study was conducted by a student from Purdue University on the birth details of members of the KKK dating all the way back to the early 1900s.

They found that 40% of the members in the study had their Sun in Pisces, while the majority of the remaining 60% had their Sun in either Scorpio, Cancer, or Capricorn.

They also found that only 8 members in the study, past and present, had their Sun in an air sign.

What‚Äôs with all the water? The thing that REALLY surprised me was the large percentage of Pisces.

I read some opinions stating that water energy in particular could be prone to getting ‚Äúmolded‚Äù by emotional manipulation. I suppose this would be especially true if an impressionable, sensitive child were raised by parents with racist mentalities.

637,erg3e4,False,,36,Understanding your chart using the Ship Analogy,astrology,"I read an analogy a while ago that helped me. 

Imagine your chart is like a ship. Your asc would be the bow of the ship, and represent the direction you are heading. This is your life path. Everything you meet in life, and everything you send out to the ‚Äúocean‚Äù passes over the bow. Lots of people call our asc our ‚Äúmask‚Äù but that‚Äôs not totally accurate, it‚Äôs more like a filter or lens. Yes, how the world sees you is colored by your asc, but your asc also tells how you see the world. Representing our direction in life, the asc is the most important part of the birth chart (speaking generally, there can be exceptions to any rule.)

Anyway, back to the ship, your Midheaven is your ship‚Äôs mast, it is the first part of your ship people may see coming up over the horizon, this is where your flag waves to announce to the world ‚Äúthis is who I am‚Äù and where the wind meets your sails to carry you forward.

Your descendant is like the deck of your ship, where people come aboard. 

Your IC is the bottom of your boat, hidden under the water. All boats are built from the bottom up, it is your past. It is the foundation that carries you along.

Your chart ruler is the captain of your ship! What state is he in? Is he restricted by Saturn or amped out by an unruly mars? Is he in a good position to see the direction the ship is headed? Is he shining in exaltation or hindered by detriment? His house placement tells us from what area of your life does he command the ship. Aspects to other planets tell us what crew members help or hinder his rulership. The zodiac sign tells us how he expresses himself.

Also every other planet near a key point of your ‚Äúship‚Äù carries extra significance. A fallen moon near your IC makes the bottom of your boat leaky, an exalted Venus at the Midheaven fills your sails with beauty.

I am a visual person so this analogy really helped me understand how my chart works together as a whole, and it also helped me figure out what my key planets are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/erg3e4/understanding_your_chart_using_the_ship_analogy/,158,So if I have Scorpio asc and Pluto in Scorpio... is that exalted?

848,b9gzr3,False,,113,Moon in Aries Overview,astrology,"When people think of Aries, the first thing that comes to mind is a high-intensity warrior who goes after what he wants without taking obstacles into account. They are goal oriented people with an instant gratification streak.
 
This is mostly true for the Sun in Aries people (mostly, because one‚Äôs chart is not composed only of their Sun sign), and even though it‚Äôs also true for Moon in Aries natives, it‚Äôs very different from the Aries Suns.

The greatest difference between a Sun sign and a Moon sign is that Sun is overt and Moon is covert. What I mean by this is that that you should see Sun as the character and Moon as a personality. Sun is seen by everyone (who get to know you a little bit, that is, because otherwise, the first thing people see when they meet you is your Ascendant), and Moon is seen best only by the people who know you well. Some people exude their Moon Sign characteristics more acutely than their Sun Sign but generally, this is the rule of thumb.

If we translate this to the Aries Sun/Moon, it goes like this: Aries Sun will be outwardly active if a little aggressive and pushy. Aries Moon will be like that on the inside while they may present a different exterior to the world (unless they also have Sun in Aries).

Moon in Aries people feel the intensity and impetuousness of the Aries on a much deeper level. They may not behave like an Aries, but they will certainly feel like one. Their emotions will be constantly in turmoil as they feel acutely about everything around them. Nothing is lukewarm with them. In that sense, there is a similarity with the Moon in Scorpio but unlike this Moon, Aries intensity is more positive and brighter. Though they get upset easily, they don‚Äôt tend to brood and ruminate like the Scorpio Moon. They get upset, go through that emotion with both intensity and velocity and once it passes, they forget about it. That the good thing ‚Äì Aries Moon natives don‚Äôt hold grudges and they generally forget things as easily as they get upset by them. It‚Äôs all flowing naturally and fast for them ‚Äì they are the fire that initiates (Aries is a cardinal sign) but doesn‚Äôt burn too long.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs not easy to have an Aries Moon. Because the Moon represents the inner Self and the emotions, taking things too intensely on a daily basis can be overwhelming. That‚Äôs why it would do good for an Aries Moon to do some sports, to vent out all those intense emotions they are having inside. They usually do have the inclination to do sports or do some other physical activity that will match the intensity inside. Even if they are not playing any kind of sports, you‚Äôll usually find them walking briskly and/or leading a fast-paced life.
 
Aries Moon is action driven and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs difficult for them to stay passive. Even if the life circumstances require them to lead a more passive life they won‚Äôt definitely be happy about it. They‚Äôll feel like a tiger trapped in a cage. Regardless of the rest of the chart, once they feel cornered they will explode in a frightful manner.

How strong the Aries Moon will manifest itself for the native and if there will be any issues, depends on the rest of the chart. Still, when we compare Luminaries (Sun and Moon signs) there are some Sun signs that can tolerate Aries Moon better and some that won‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs find out which Sun/Moon combination is smoother for the native and which one is more explosive.

I've definitely found this over the years. A few off the top of my head:

Gemini: Geminis have a strong self-righteous, argumentative, often bluntly rude aspect that is very overlooked. I've known many Geminis and not one hasn't had this. They really think they know best in most cases.

Cancer: I feel as if the caring aspects of this sign are highly over-played. I'm sure there are some very caring Cancers, but I've met maybe one, and only to her own kid.

Leo: Leos have a major quiet side that is often ignored. Even very gregarious Leos have the capacity to be extremely quiet and distant at home, or when they don't feel the need to perform.

Libra: I feel like the cardinal, determined aspect of Libra is often downplayed. And their love of trying to make people mad and being rebels.

Sagittarius: The Sagittarius description often reads like a clown, and overlooks their almost universal propensity for anxiety and intense spells of negative emotion.

Capricorn: I feel like the Capricorn love of creature comforts is often overlooked. It is an earth sign.

Aquarius: Yes, they are all a bit eccentric, but they are also capable of being quite calculating.

No to anxiety for Sags.

591,d9050q,False,,53,"I noticed something interesting about past libra seasons, and possibly this one as well. Could there be a connection?",astrology,"I should preface this by saying I know essentially *nothing* about astrology, so I have no idea if any of this could be related. But anyway, I happened to notice that some interesting events have happened during this time in past years.

**2014** - Hannibal Buress brings Bill Cosby's *many* allegations against him to light, bringing ***many*** women forward, ending with him in jail now.

**2016** - Trump's ""grab em by the pussy"" tape surfaces. This seemed to have no effect however, but it definitely showed his character much more clearly.

**2017** - the rise of the Me Too movement and Weinstein's fall.

Then, yesterday there was Greta Thunberg's address to the UN, and *then* impeachment hearings, as well as Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament being declared unlawful.

So now I'm wondering, could there be a connection between things like these in past years and it being the time of the scales of justice? I saw another post seeming to relate the impeachment with Saturn's position, but I wonder if this could also be a factor?

332,fhmr7m,False,Modern,41,Insights for those looking to astrology for signals about coronavirus,astrology,"Before I go further, I want to stress the important basics:

Stay grounded in the facts. Listen to local & national updates about the pandemic. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Don't touch your face. Quarantine if you feel ill. Take advantage of the newly launched coronavirus telemedicine services (like [Roman's](https://www.getroman.com/coronavirus/)) if you feel you may have it.

I love looking to the sky for answers, but to make good work of it, we have to keep our feet on the ground.

Okay - that said...I want to share some interesting finds.

Here are my two resources:

* [Llewellyn's 2020 Astrological Daily Planetary Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Llewellyns-Daily-Planetary-Guide-Glance/dp/0738749427)
* [New York Time's Official Coronavirus Timeline page](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html)

For a few years now, I've found Llewellyn's daily guide to be a poignant resource for tracking both the major and minor movements in the planets from week-to-week. I like that the book calls out the key information of what is happening from an astrological sense and then provides some loose interpretation on top of it.

The fact that it's printed and shipped ahead of the year also helps imbue me with a sense of wonder when it gets things right.

For 2020, the Weekly forecasts were written by astrologer [Pam Ciampi, whom I'm sad to say seems to have passed away in January of 2019](http://sandiegoastrology.com/past-president-pam-ciampi-has-died/). May it only add to our respect for her life's work that this allows us to know with some degree of certainty that she wrote these forecasts well over a year before 2020 began.

Below are the passages that stuck out to me - alongside the NYT Coronavirus timeline and with some of my own commentary added in where I have something to add:

\*Emphases are mine.

# January 6-12

""Get ready, because even though this is only the second week of the new year, it features two celestial attractions that could rock your world.  The first is a Cancer Full Moon/Lunar Eclipse on Friday, January 10, that makes up the first of a bookend of **Cancer Full Moons that begin and end this year**.  The second is the **Saturn-Pluto conjunction on** ***Sunday, January 12***\*\*,\*\* that spells trouble in a number of different ways...

...Because these two heavy-duty planets only get together about once every thirty-four years, the results can be life-changing, with long-reaching consequences. While Saturn is busy protecting and preserving security and order, Pluto is seeking to destroy and transform by ferreting out what lies hidden beneath the surface.  Let's look back at the beginning of the twenty-first century to examine another time when these two planets were aligned. The Saturn-Pluto ***opposition*** of 2001 foreshadowed 9/11, which was a day that rocked the world because it was the first time the US had been attacked on its mainland. The events of 9/11 brought chaos and upset, including the never-ending war in Afghanistan and the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2020, Saturn-Pluto are ***conjunct*** in **Capricorn**, which highlights the **stock market, world banking, government, and big business**. This large, slow-moving transition is expected to include a global conversion to a virtual form of money (like cryptocurrency or blockchains), trade irregularities, economic downturns, and serious corruption and misuse of power. One way to approach the stress that the Saturn-Pluto conjunction is sure to bring is to be ready for any challenge that comes your way...With Mercury sandwiched directly between Saturn and Pluto, **the impact of this conjunction will be featured in news cycles around the globe.""**

***From the NYT timeline:***

**January 11 - China reported its first death.** On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the [first known death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html) from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan, where the illness is thought to have originated, and he had previously been found to have abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. The report of his death came just before one of China‚Äôs biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.

# January 27-February 2

""Tuesday, January 28, is a low-energy day because that's when Mars, the action planet of the zodiac, makes a square to a **Neptune** that is overrun with negative feelings like guilt and shame \[*my note: this is due to some qualities of being in* ***Pisces***\]. Because this Mars-Neptune square also represents a **low immune function, go light on alcohol, eat well, get enough rest, and exercise regularly**. February begins with a square between the Aquarius Sun and Taurus Moon on Saturday, February 1, that brings a brief **tug between freedom and security**.""

***From The NYT timeline:***

**January 30 - The W.H.O. declared a global health emergency.** Amid thousands of new cases in China, a ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern‚Äù was officially [declared ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html)by the W.H.O. China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that it would continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to protect public health, and the U.S. [State Department warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/Coronavirus-travel-advisory-.html) travelers to avoid China.

**January 31 - The Trump administration restricted travel from China.** The Trump administration said it would [suspend entry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html) into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. By this date, [213 people had died](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html#link-6a63a9b7) and nearly 9,800 had been infected worldwide.

# February 3-9

""**Thoughts and communications get more emotional** this week, because on Monday, February 3, Mercury leaves Aquarius and moves into **Pisces** for the next **two months**. Pisces is a tough sell for Mercury, because it's hard for the most logical of planets to lose its common sense to Pisces's ocean of emotion...Because **Mercury** will turn **retrograde** later this month, **communication will be under the influence of this emotion-based sign until April,** which is much longer than its usual three-week tour.""

# March 16-22

""Communications have been more confusing than usual this year with **Mercury in emotional Pisces** for an unusually long two and a half months. **Saturn** makes a **major sign change on Saturday, March 21,** as it shifts from **Capricorn**'s old-school traditions to future-forward **Aquarius**...**Saturn** will return for a temporary tour of **Capricorn in July and reenter Aquarius in December** for the next two to three years. **Mars**, also in **Capricorn**, makes two once-a-year conjunctions this week that have very different effects on energy levels. A positive **Mars-Jupiter** conjunction on **Friday, March 20**, combines **confidence** and **enthusiasm** with **courage** and **bravado**, which makes it easy to take action and start something new...The second conjunction, late on **Sunday, March 22,** is a dangerous once-a-year **Mars-Pluto** meeting that brings **power struggles, ruthlessness**, and possible **violence**. Take action Wednesday and do your best to stay away from conflicts on Sunday.""

# My Interpretation

When the year kicked off, I really felt the doom-and-gloom was America-Iran's explosive conflict and the Australia Fires. However, that was clearly (for now) not the case - and in fact, Fire is not the element where all of this action is taking place.

The transformation is happening in ***Water.***

Oddly, this also came through on a Tarot reading I did yesterday on coronavirus in which the [King Of Cups](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/king-of-cups-tarot-card) was suspended between the [High Priestess](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/the-high-priestess-tarot-card) and the [Death](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/death-tarot-card) cards. That, along with some other cards in the reading painted a picture of deeply rooted transformation on the emotional plane - with specific relations to water and health.

It didn't quite stack up with how I've been logically feeling about everything, but these astrological insights help.

**Water Signs** are playing a huge role in 2020. Most of the action taking place right now is in **Pisces** \- and the year itself is bookended by Full Moons in **Cancer**. Both, water signs. The dance between the two is in the awesome and/or terrifying emergence of our hidden, inner worlds (Pisces) and our sense of self-preservation and comfort (Cancer).

There are two levels to what we're struggling with right now as a planet: The **Pandemic** (our health) - and The **Panic** (our emotions).

The other signs very much in play with Saturn's energy are **Capricorn** (Earth) and **Aquarius** (Air). Capricorn, which is supposed to be a grounded home where all is in order, has been a domain of chaos since Pluto entered it in 2008 (see: the last financial crisis).

# Where It All Goes

Overall, the Cancer Full Moon bookends indicate we're in this story until the end of 2020.

I think we're going to feel some **relief in April** when Saturn gets its a\*\* out of Capricorn for a minute, but we'll be right back in it for its gnarly retrograde from August through next January after it slips back in for a bit before finally moving off to Aquarius for the long term.

So perhaps we're going to see some indicators of **how to beat coronavirus** in the **last week of March**, but they'll be hard-won. I'm guessing that has to do with the **strict quarantines** we're about to implement (especially in the US where a number of states are headed toward a shut down) showing that we can truly [flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html). I think that ""solving it"" feeling is inside the Mars-Jupiter energy. The ugliness of the Mars-Pluto energy in the same week is probably people not handling quarantine measures well.

leo :: gimli ‚Äî loud and proud, warm-hearted and funny!!!! a little prideful and stubborn, doesn‚Äôt want anyone to see his failures or shortcomings so he puts up a lil bit of a facade but hes incredibly loyal and he‚Äôs willing to fight for those who he loves. HAIRY AF

I did not expect him to go out and buy one the next day but that's what he did. I told him he should wait for mercury to go direct and I would help him but he's not too into astrology...or wasn't until now. He is a Taurus rising so a bit stubborn about asking for help. 

The first computer had a cracked screen that was not noticeable until he turned it on at home. He went back to the store for an exchange, but they were out of that model. So he got a different model for the same price. 

The second computer has this horrible, very bad, nearly fascist OS called Windows 10 Mode S. Mode S means you can only install programs from the Microsoft store, which is useless. So he went back today to complain and got a refund and went to another store. 

At the new store he described exactly what he needs and specified no Mode S. The sales rep recommended a new model with Windows 10, no Mode S on the box. 

He got home and the third computer is also Mode S. He is not happy.

That‚Äôs the energy of Gemini NN to me haha.

On a societal level...

SN in Sagittarius: end of my way or highway soap-boxing, end of dogmatic thinking being accepted as Truth, the illusion of fake news lifting, losses to the way we travel globally, less my way or the high way

NN in Gemini: fact over philosophy and theorizing, able to hold many ideas at once, expanding on the ability to change your mind, common sense, letting new information in

In general, SN Sag is the archetype of a well-traveled and knowledgeable sage, in whatever field, seeking to share what they know. This archetype appears to know it all, about everything, and will make sure you know that. The plus side is what this placement does indeed have a lot to share. The downside is that they don‚Äôt listen to other people, factor in the details, and have a hard time separating their ego from their smarts. Marco Polos.

NN Gemini is seeking to be that better listener, to siphon through all the relevant details and facts, to be comfortable learning from others. This placement is community oriented and less about traveling far and wide. Time to be in the present moment, here and now, what matters this second.

On a personal level...

It depends a lot on what houses Sag and Gemini are for you. And if there are planets there.

My basic approach: SN DRAIN, NN GAIN.

So wherever the NN is where we can experience gains, and wherever the SN is where we can experience drains.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking.

**ARIES ASC**: gains in the third house, drains in the ninth. a period of community oriented endeavors, of letting new ideas permeate your daily life. less lusting after faraway places and lofty mindsets, but letting the here and now spark wonder

**TAURUS ASC**: gains in the second, drains in the eighth. personal income from your own personal endeavors. make right with what you owe people and get your head around your debt. retooling your beliefs around money and possession.

**GEMINI ASC**: gains in the first house, drains in the seventh. a period of coming into your own without seeing other people as a necessity in that journey. speaking up for yourself, face forward now, retooling which relationships are needed and which you can jettison

**CANCER ASC**: gains in the twelfth, drains in the sixth. the daily habits or jobs that once sustained you are becoming beige boring or broken. looking towards the metaphysical to bring back a sense of magic and wonder, and letting that seep into your routines

**LEO ASC**: gains in the eleventh, drains in the fifth. less about what personally makes you feel good and more about what you can bring to the community to make them feel good. creation needs an audience, be it a piece of work, art, a child or yourself. you may make lifelong friends and associates, time to find your tribe. mingle

**VIRGO ASC**: gains in the tenth, drains in the fourth. volume is turned up on your place on the world stage. opportunities to bolster your sense of purpose will be abound. you may have to say goodbye to staying small or staying hidden, and bloom past what your family expects of you. an end of the comfort zone.

**LIBRA ASC**: gains in the ninth, drains in the third. a period of travel, whether journeys of the mind or journeys in real life. commit knowing all there is to know and seeing all there is to see and practicing all there is to practice. this will expand your horizons. true wisdom requires time and a nimble mind. spiritual passages await

**SCORPIO ASC**: gains in the eighth house, drains in the second. your sense of personal insecurity will be made up for by the graciousness of others. a period of true sharing, investment, and resourceful intimacy. the ways that you waste money or valuables (your time and energy and patience too) will become apparent, and asking for help from others is your best bet

**SAG ASC**: gains in the seventh house, drains in the first. a period of relationships that can help you reevaluate who you are and where you‚Äôre going. not the loss of self sufficiency per se, but the ability to let others co-pilot this stretch

**CAP ASC**: gains in the sixth, drains in the twelfth. time to be more real world oriented. the isolation that serves you, the spiritual practices that unnerve you, these are to keep and help you become better in life, on the job, and for others. all the other psychic chatter, alienation, trauma, sabotage that does not bolster you must go. break down to build up, not to stay broken. this opens up new ways to be of service, to remain flexible in your duties, and to remain childlike and light as you approach each day

**AQUA ASC**: gains in the fifth, drains in the eleventh. social exhaust. extraneous friends. arsenals of acquaintances. groups and beliefs you have grown out of. time to spring clean your social networks. a true sense of belonging comes from authenticity of self, and all else that spring from that. opportunities for pleasure, joy, art, creation, romance and love remind you who you are and who is worth keeping around. your own best friend.

**PISCES ASC**: gains in the fourth, drains in the tenth. a place for solid roots, a home, a family. these are all themes that are of concern. it is less important that you be respected by the world, by your colleagues, than it is that you have a place to relax and retreat, to feel safe and secure, to delight in the smaller successes of comfort, a family dinner, a mortgage in your name, and a place to lay your head. you step down from an authority figure, and are content to just feel content. your mom, your dad, your home.

NOTE that the drain/gain paradigm isn‚Äôt black and white. There won‚Äôt be complete losses in one area so don‚Äôt expect that. Rather, a clearing up, drain, allows for the gains to have space to settle in. For example, Gemini rising draining of relationships that don‚Äôt serve gives Gemini rising the space to come into their own. Doesn‚Äôt mean all relationships are doomed.

The SN and NN work in tangent. No need to completely ignore or abhor or fear one in service of the other. The SN is the launching pad. The NN is where we go once launched.

Also remember that the Sag/Gem axis is one that is inherently cerebral in nature. It deals a lot with the mind. So Gemini information gather versus Sag ""I know it all"" is what is fundamentally at play here. At the end of this period, you will **KNOW** more about what there is for you to learn i.e. these changes could, for some, play out entirely in your brain.

607,ejmv7p,False,,102,Who/what is the Saturn in your life? Why it may not be as obvious and cliche as you think,astrology,"Approaching this upcoming notorious Saturn/Pluto conjunction, I have been seeing a lot of posts on different platforms talking about power and how to not give your power away to anyone else.  In other words, the real power comes from inside yourself, and anything coming from something outside yourself is limiting your own power.

At first glance, I always considered myself as someone who was ""above"" anything that would normally be perceived as authority.  For example, I have always seen my parents and older family members as equals to me.  And at work, I have always proudly considered myself to not be a victim of the manager's influence. Even when it came to taking drugs, I always knew confidently that I can live with or without them, and the choice was always up to me.

So when I would see these messages about not giving away your power, I would naturally think this doesn't really apply to me.  I could check that box off my ""to do"" list.

However, this past year, having done more internal work on my fears than ever before, I realized there had been an elephant in the room my entire life that I had been giving my power to.

The best way I can describe it is that I always felt I had been banished to live within certain limits.  Growing up in a lower middle class environment, I just always assumed that I was never going to be ""one of those"" people.  Some people lived a great life who got to have all of the nice things, with a family, a nice house, a nice car, and a job that they loved. But I was not one of those.

I created this ""phantom God"" in my mind, who limited my existence to where I could only live in apartments and work minimum wage jobs.  Maybe if I were really lucky, I would be able to even have a spouse that loved me.  But overall, I was to live in this small circle of limitations, and other people were living beyond the circle.

So when you think of who is really controlling you, it might not be as obvious as you think.  It might not be an authority figure that you can point to and say ""There! That's it!"".  It might be something much more ethereal and vague than you could have imagined consciously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ejmv7p/whowhat_is_the_saturn_in_your_life_why_it_may_not/,161,What does everyone think of Saturn in the 8th? ,2020-01-03 22:24:53

There is no much mistery about, I can resume in 3 rules.

- Don't lie to me. I don't like to lose time, have in mind that I'll try to love you. So be yourself. Don't try to impressionate me, I want to love you, cooperate. 

- I'm extremely monogamic, so don't cheat/betray me. I'm pretty much into anything that doesn't hurt this rule (everything has limits, and I don't want to use your toys). I'm yours, you're mine. Sound possessive, but I don't want control you, that's kinda much because in essence what turn me on is duality, duo, the couple idea. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Tristan and Isolde, I love the idea of partnership in love. So clingy girls makes me turned on. Well... Be ready if you are into me and is clingy... 

- Take responsibility for yourself. Or don't make me guilty for things that aren't actually my fault. Basically if something in me makes you feel bad indirectly, don't act like I'm guilty on your inner trauma. Ofc, I care a lot about how you feel, but I care even more about what makes you feel like that, so I won't be condecending. We'll talk and I'll try to understand you, help you and work on it with you. But you need to be honest with me and say me the truth on preference in a objective way, draw if necessary. If something makes you feel bad, I'll try destroy it at once. I want to protect you, so I think that act as a Terminator sometimes is good for that... Hasta l√° vista. 

If you're genuinely kind, you got 20% on way. 

Also, idc much about your body, you can looks like Jinx, Illaoi or Miss Fortune, just avoid be obese or anorexic, I'm not superman and neither want to break you. If you give me what I've wrote above I'll suck you mostly every day, just have hygienic habits, spend in soap, not in make up.

 I prefer if the girl is smart, has strong traditional values (I want a family, kids) and it's fair.There are some shallow stuff like be nerdy and wear glasses, but actually I'm mostly careless about (please, don't be dumb or shallow.)

966,9ha186,False,,17,Notes On The Upcoming Aries Full Moon and what it could mean for you (9/24/2018),astrology,"(I was inspired to make this a separate thread in response to my post in the ""what happened to the news!"" thread. I'm sorry if you're seeing this twice, but I've also added some new info).

I am looking forward to this Full Moon as a time of culmination and movement, but just as easily, for some, it could be a time to pause and reflect. Here's my take:

Happening at 2 degrees of Aries, opposing the Sun at 2 degrees of Libra, highlighting the axis of self and others. This will be a full moon that certainly deals with our relationships to others. Central theme: where do my needs fall in relation to the people in my life, where can compromise be made, what conversations needs to be had, what relationships need tending, and, what may need to end. Sounds dramatic, and opposing planets always kind of insert tension. Look to where Aries and Libra fall in your chart in order to get context. For example, the moon will hit my 11th house and oppose the sun in my 5th. A consideration for me: are the connections, groups and friends I have in balance with the pleasure and joy I seek to create and have? And it can happen in your life, or just be something your observe in others.

I'm looking forward to it especially because Mars rules this Full Moon, and Mars is finally direct. Where the summer had many of our desires and pursuits on pause (and for good reason if you used it as a time of planning and reflection), September 24th, to me, marks the official end of this holding pattern. Aries, cardinal fire, wants to start, to move, and its ruling planet is finally done taking a nap. I always set intentions for what I want to experience during any moon cycle, and for this one it is the courage to finally make some moves, have some chats, and get out there to get what I want (especially because its an 11th house theme for me). It brings a physicality to any manifestation work you've been doing during this summer of downtime.

(Remembering that Mars can rule the physical body and Aries has ties to the first house of self: will the relationship I've been desiring finally show up in the form of an actual human man?! Just a fun lil thought I'm having. What have you been trying to manifest into your physical reality?)

Retrograde Mars may have hidden our courageousness and assertiveness for some time, or just our passion/desire, and his implied marriage to this Full Moon could mark a return to feeling an emotional joie de vivre!

But anyway, Saturn, also newly direct, is in the picture as the focal point of a T Square between he, the Sun and the Moon. Sobering. But ensures a practicality. Mars is also in a nice aspect to Saturn, so it could be that actions taken are done so in a tactful way, with a dutiful eye on what the long-term implications will be (rather than just having rash Aries movement, Saturn tames the fire, but could just as easily douse the joy for some. Depends.). And then Saturn and Uranus continue to have a nice little tango. Marrying the Uranian nature of change and re-calibration, with the action of Mars and Aries, with the integrity and structure of Saturn says to me that whatever may be endeavored upon during this Full Moon will have legs, substance, and long-term dividends. Saturn being the focal point of the T-Square is also where we can look to ease any tension felt with this Sun-Moon opposition. So that is looking for your saving grace in being patient, mature, wise, and approaching whatever comes up with a healthy detachment and with a calm affect. Saturn is the long game. Full Moon emotions are transient. Let Saturn anchor you. If need be.

Two other things of note: Chiron and Mercury are also joining in on the conversation here. Chiron will be conj the moon, and Mercury conj Sun. Each forming vestigial little legs to the T-Square. Sun spotlights, and Mercury is communication. Again, what needs to be said, and to whom? Moon is emotional landscaping and Chiron are the wounds therein. Potential for hurtful communication, given or received? Yes. But also potential for HEALING communication, given or received. Or healing that eventually does come from a conversation had. Again, this Libra-Aries axis has me thinking this is relationship oriented. Mercury is also the mind, so these conversations could be happening internally.

Mars is also over the south node again, where he was for that Lunar Eclipse in Aquarius this summer on July 26-17. Very well could be a continuing theme for whatever was brought up then, and could be a time where it meets its ending and culmination. South Node again hinting to some emotional discomfort, but all the same an opportunity for healing and cleared karma.

Some logistical notes:

-This full moon may be felt more strongly by people with cardinal sign placements (especially personal planets) between the degrees of 0-9.

-A Libra New Moon is to follow on October 8th, providing fertile ground to begin, begin again or refresh any relationship woes (or relationship endings) that could be provoked by this Full Moon. Or, it may solidify and reinvest in what may have started. It will be ruled by a newly retrograde Venus. More on that later, maybe.

-This is a Harvest Full Moon, falling in line with the Autumnal Equinox. A new season, a new beginning. A Harvest Moon is, well, when things come to harvest, placing another emphasis on what is to be received, enjoyed, and started with this Full Moon after putting in the work, spiritual or otherwise. Time to eat the fruits of your labor after a nonsense summer!

I think that's it.  Thanks for indulging me this!

Thought I'd share this piece of art with you all.,astrology,,https://i.redd.it/56b97a9x2j221.jpg,256,I love this!! I make Natal Chart art for clients too. They are readings on their own too! I think it‚Äôs so helpful to have a visual of the vibes in our charts. Transit drawings are super fun too- they become an animation of the cycles in such cool ways! Do we know who the artist is?  ,2018-12-05 21:34:04
757,hhn3w9,False,,24,Sagittarius symbolism in hunger games,astrology,"I never made the connection before but it's so obvious. [Katniss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittaria) is a plant from the saggitaria genus. one of the movies is called catching fire. Also Jennifer Lawrence is a Sagittarius rising with her sun in the ninth house. Her character is a master archer who shoots arrows that are on fire. She has a dress that, when she spins, burns the dress scattering fire around her, transforming the dress (sagittarius is supposed to be mutable fire, or fire that has spread and is scattered, and is symbolized by the phoneix who rises out of the ashes) Thats all I can connect right now but I'm sure there is more symbolism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/hhn3w9/sagittarius_symbolism_in_hunger_games/,130,Thanks for the info I have not read the books !

791,90gwxo,False,,89,Why I absolutely ADORE Leos,astrology,"Maybe because I'm a Sagittarius! There are a lot of misconceptions about Leos. The biggest ones is that they're selfish, egotistical and only think of themselves. I haven't found this to be true. So many Leos I know are self conscious. They're warm, loving and caring. Where they want to be happy, they want everyone around them to be happy too. They genuinely feel when people aren't happy and it affects them very negatively. Leos are warm and compassionate, even if some of them don't always show it. They will literally do anything for those they love. I love Leos ‚ù§",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/90gwxo/why_i_absolutely_adore_leos/,120,Spot on description of a Leo! ,2018-07-20 15:26:32
934,fbjuy0,False,,91,Astrological indicators that can point towards someone being a procrastinator,astrology,"When I think of procrastination, I think of Mars in Pisces and Mars in the 12th house (low energy), Mars in Libra (indecisive), Moon in Taurus (slow to act, too comfortable, not motivated), Moon in Gemini (disorganized, not focused, wants to do everything at the same time).

What sign placements or house placements or aspects do you associate with procrastination?",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fbjuy0/astrological_indicators_that_can_point_towards/,94,"Neptune is a big one. I have mars in Scorpio in the eighth house as my chart ruler. This is supposed to give someone a really strong drive and endurance to do anything your passionate and committed to. However moon conjunct Neptune is one of my strong aspects (0 degree orb) and I have found this makes me COMPULSIVELY DAYDREAM about EVERYTHING I want to do more so instead of actually doing it. Pisces is also the ruler of my 12th house but I don‚Äôt really understand yet if that has even more significance with the moon Neptune aspect and it increasing procrastination tendencies. 
But moon conjunct Neptune makes for a very very sensitive person in every aspect and way there is to be sensitive. So in that case it can increase escapism behaviour - drugs, daydreaming, etc. 

However I have also noticed on the high side of this Neptune/Pisces aspect in a chart - if the person turns to surrendering to a higher power (which can be hard to understand until you actually experience surrendering to a higher power) amazing results can show in the persons life.
