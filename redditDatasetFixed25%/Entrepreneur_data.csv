928,9yk0u8,False,,68,Starting a Company is a lot like doing a PhD,Entrepreneur,"So I was recently talking to my friend who has her PhD in Engineering as well as has worked at several startups as a CTO. She hit me with a big analogy that rang true.

&#x200B;

Starting a company is a lot like doing a PhD you can sprint and try to be done in 3 years while being stressed and having no family or social life, or you can take 5 years and probably still get there while having a more balanced life.  Really the only thing that changes how long you like to stay broke and in bad working conditions.

I was recently at a large startup competition and I always ask fellow entrepreneurs how many hours do you work and it ranges from 40-80+ I always felt like I was on the low end usually putting in an honest 20-30 with perhaps 10-20 of administrative tasks anyone could do like booking tickets.   I was amazed and mortified of these guys I see who have way more roles and responsibilities than me.   Especially those that had a bigger team size.  


We were all in similar stages all in similar profits and revenue yet they were killing themselves and I feel the most fulfilled and happy overall I've ever been.  I learned in my technical career there there is just a limit to how much you can do of technical work be it financial statements, SEO or marketing or engineering or software dev.  Rather than try to load my schedule as much as possible I looked hard at automating the business and always finding people better to offload the tasks while I work one what I'm truly good at. I would rather focus and do 10 hours a week of amazing work, than 80 hours a week at 3 job functions I'm just descent at.    


I chose to take 5 years to build a company instead of 3 but I think we found the opposite, by delighting just a few customers and putting out really technical and great work (that probably took us a few months longer) we deferred a lot of fluff work that didn't  actually further the objectives. We are crazily enough ahead of schedule and budget even though we can only afford 1 full time engineer.  Also since I'm usually rested and low stress I have a chance to prepare for ""big client"" meetings and knock them out of the park.  


 Another entrepreneur said it best:  ""would you want to train your whole life for the Olympics and then the day before your event run a marathon?"" Many of us finally land big meetings iwth landmark customers, or investors or give talks.  Why would I want to work 16 hours the day before I had a big client presentation instead of taking 4 hours to tweak the slides and practice and calling it a day to go rest wit the family?

&#x200B;

I don't think I have a point or even a conclusion I just see a lot of people burning themselves out with work that doesn't actually further the business while I feel I'm doing more with less and still meeting the same metrics as our peers.  My biggest advice to fellow entrepreneurs is to be honest about what you're actually good at and do it as much as possible and differ the other work to those who are better ""but I can't afford to hire a full team""  You're right neither can I, my chief job is making the people on my team and customers excited, I can't compete with google and amazon for salary, but I can offer exciting work or find junior engineers stuck in corporate environments who want to expand faster than they could and give them work opportunities that they otherwise would have to wait a decade to earn in a big corporate.  Use your tools to your advantage they don't all have to be cash on hand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9yk0u8/starting_a_company_is_a_lot_like_doing_a_phd/,407,"When you work only 40 hour weeks and I work 80, after just 1 year of work you will never ever ever catch up to me.

516,32gwjj,False,,191,"April 2014 I started a trucking company while working a full time job, acheiving nearly $360,000 in annualized sales. AMA",Entrepreneur,"[Year Two Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4j7kcr/year_2_update_i_started_a_trucking_company_while/)

The entrepreneurial community tends to be very ""all or nothing"", and it's easy to see why; the risk and commitment required to build a successful business often requires everything of a business owner. However, in my opinion, this is not always the case. My business story is not all or nothing, but rather a highly stressful flirt with insanity that seems to be headed in the right direction. 

To provide personal background: I am 23 years old. In 2012, I graduated from a US university with a BBA in Finance and Real Estate; in 2013 I graduated with my MBA in the same fields. In 2014, I started full time as a valuation associate at a Mergers and Acquisition firm and, 3 months into my position, **I started a trucking company that posted 2014 revenue of $293,278.78 and 2014 EBIT of $26,589.82.** I invested no personal money (to start), had no credit history, no industry experience, and no clue if it would work out. This is the story of how I did it, where we are today, and where we are planning to go. 

**The Idea**

The idea started very basic, evolving the more I dove into the industry research. Originally, my plan was to operate as a broker for trucks that haul aggregate and other various loose materials. A broker, by definition, is a company who adds minimal value, but operates as a middle man between large construction companies and individual truck drivers. The brokerage exists because drivers cannot individually facilitate large contracts requiring 5+ trucks and cannot afford to be paid once every 30-60 days. As such, the drivers use a broker to find work and buy their weekly invoices (which are sold for 5% of total gross). Specifically, I was looking to target the construction industry as it is usually very local in nature, has long account receivable gaps (30-60-90 days to get paid), has high demand, and is very fragmented. My role would be to secure a line of credit with a local bank ($100,000-$150,000), hire a dispatcher to find work, and have the dispatcher send the trucks on routes.

I liked this business model quite a bit. My role would be minimal, simply managing Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. I could immediately grow the business up to $15-$30,000 a week in gross receipts (~$800 - $1,500 gross profit) and would have a very limited risk/work load. However, the more I looked into the industry, the more opportunity I saw in actually owning equipment and hiring drivers on my own. To gather data, I pulled my step-fathers numbers from the previous 6 months. I input these numbers in an excel model *(see model images attached)* for rough performance estimates, comparing them to what I could find on online forums and by asking around the industry. By November of 2013, I had a very developed excel model that projected a business with between 15-20% net profit in conservative conditions. 

**Beginning**

In January of 2014 I was hired at my first full-time, non-self-employed, job as a valuation associate at a mergers and acquisitions firm, which I still hold today. My role is to work directly with small business owners (average $4M in value) to create a professional financial model and pitchbook for an eventual sale. *Side note, feel free to ask questions about this as well. To date I have valued around 50 businesses, worth about $205,000,000.* My business took a back seat for my first month on the job, but I quickly picked up the pace and, by February, I was searching for financing. I prepared a very detailed pitchbook and set appointments at every bank in my home town. I met with about 5 separate banks, all of which had zero interest in lending money to a 22 year old operating in a historically high risk industry (most didn't even open my 20+ page pitchbook). Having struck out there, I looked online for construction equipment lenders. I found about 20 lenders and messaged each directly. To my surprise, about 3 wanted to lend to me. To my further surprise, each wanted well over 20% interest to carry the notes. Initially I was appalled that these rates were offered, but after further research my model said the payment was easily afforded, despite the high rates, and I pursued financing up until the closing table. 

Almost by complete chance, my father (who works in the construction industry) had a conversation with the financing department at Richie Bros (a heavy equipment auction company). That conversation led to me stalling the previously offered note and I eventually secured a 6% note with RB in the following 72 hours. During this time, I had been in contact with a close friend of mine who agreed to buy 10% of the Company for $10,000 in working capital, giving us the cash needed to get started.

**Establishing Connections, Purchasing Equipment, and Starting Business**

While originally against the idea, I knew that my father (connected in the industry and a great mechanic) was going to be a resource that I had to have 100% on my team. Until I started actively pursuing financing, he was wholeheartedly against me starting a business. I'm sure I'll receive flak for his role in the business, but I believe a good businessman leverages the strengths of those around him, and (if it helps) it proved to be an expensive relationship to have. To bring him on board, I had him create a separate equipment rental company. His role would be to purchase the trailers that I would rent and, in exchange, I would pay for all maintenance, repairs, and related expenses if he agreed to help me work on equipment. 

Having the financing and team in place, I purchased my first truck (2003 Mack CH613) in April of 2014 for $22,625.38 in an equipment auction, he purchased his first trailer (2013 Asher Belly Dump) for $33,356.97 around the same time. 

From there, I placed ads on craigslist looking for a driver. I hire all drivers on a 1099 basis, which allows me to avoid any employee benefits and tax obligations. I found my first driver very quickly, called a broker who I had established a relationship with (refer to my original idea, it's someone who does that), and let the broker dispatch my truck. My role from then on was very simple: I took calls from the driver, I paid/performed all minor to medium repairs, and I managed all invoicing. 

**Growth**

The business model was strong, quickly proving itself to be profitable for everyone involved. However, it was clear that there were major economies of scale benefits that we were losing out on. Specifically, we were losing 5% of gross revenue through the broker, we were losing 2% on our fuel bill by using the broker fuel account, and we were losing majorly in the form of downtime. As a general rule of thumb (referencing downtime), you always buy trucks in a set of three. If you own one truck, when that truck is down you lose significant money (you don't run and you pay for repairs). If you own two trucks, when one truck is down you break even. If you own three, when one truck is down you profit on the third truck. While not a perfect rule, it was very clear that it was proving to be true. We were profitable, but by my account we were leaving at least 10% of revenue on the table by not having the additional 2 trucks and by maintaining our relationship with the broker. At this point, however, I did not feel comfortable managing a fleet of three. So, in May of 2014, I purchased my second truck (father purchased second trailer), and we continued operations with the broker. The hands-off business model was still working and, having just hit stride in my new corporate position, I believed the 5-10% broker expense was justified. 

The next few months proved uneventful, but the numbers continued to improve. By September, I was preparing for further expansion and for my split from the brokerage. I again applied for financing through the same source as the previous two loans and was almost immediately approved (you'd be surprised how easy it is to find money once you prove your business model). I purchased my third truck (fathers third trailer) in October. By the start of November, I split away from the broker and was running a dedicated route for the company my dad works for. In just November of 2014, running at full capacity, my company earned over $20,000 in EBIT. The rapid growth and split from the local brokerage firm had paid off.

*Important note: this route is an arms-length transaction. My dad's company is one of the largest employers of trucks in the area. I'm paid average to below average rates on routes that are normally sent to brokers, I just offer to run them as a reliable, dedicated driver which is attractive to the client. My company had to prove it was capable, it was not handed to me in any way.*

**Greed Kills**

In November of 2014 I was pretty high on the horse. In just 8 months I had created a business that earned my two weeks corporate pay nearly every day. I was unstoppable.... and foolish. I purchased two more trucks on December 1, 2014 (dad purchased one trailer), bringing the total count to 5 trucks and 4 trailers. The idea was pretty simple: I'll have 4 trucks running and 1 truck as a spare, just in case any others go down for repair (they did quite a bit), which will significantly reduce one of my biggest expenses: downtime. At this point, I have a combined $208,869.73 financed at a weighted average cost of capital of 10.05%. It is now, with expenses at an all time peak, when Texas weather decided to absolutely shit on my dreams and produced one of the coldest, wettest winters in recent memory, effectively shutting the entire construction industry down. 

**Survival and Present Day**

Weather forced me into full survival mode. I had about $30,000 in the bank and another $10-20,000 available on various credit cards. I cut all spending that could be afforded and started to manage my budget very closely. From December to February, we saw the $30,000 dip to as low as $1-2,000 before work started to pick up again. In that time, I lost my best driver to other work, I flirted with insolvency, and I busted my ass at my corporate job to earn enough money for not only myself and my company payments, but to help out the remaining drivers if they needed a loan/advance. It was incredibly stressful, especially so because it was impossible to know exactly when the weather would break and demand would pick up again. 

Luckily, though, the weather did break. Mid to Late March 2015, everything started to look up, with demand showing glimmers of the previous high's just before December 2014. Currently, everything is on the up-and-up and, while the extra trucks were more burden than blessing during the winter, having the extra equipment is helping me quickly recover by fully taking advantage of demand. We're back to operating at normal levels, with weekly EBIT of about $2,000 - $3,000.

**Future**

For 2015, I am changing the direction of the company. While profitable, the time commitment of owning equipment and maintaining a full time job is proving to be far too stressful. As such, I've contacted dispatchers who are pursuing maintenance free routes (routes that I can put rental equipment on, that the rental company maintains) and I'm looking into going back to my original brokerage business plan. My plan is to build a significant cash cushion this summer to prepare for winter while expanding these two new business areas. These two new business models are not as weather dependent or capital intensive, which will hopefully mitigate the impact of Winter 2015.

Financially, I have an aggressive 2015 revenue projection of approximately $1,000,000; which depends heavily on me landing one of the new rental routes. Should I maintain my current business model, I'm projecting 2015 revenue of $750,000 and EBIT of $116,000. 

**Closing**

My advice: If you want to start a business, just do it. There will never be a right time to do something, you will never have enough data to support you, and you'll never be comfortable about the decision. Being an entrepreneur is about embracing the uncomfortable and pushing into the crazy. There is no right answer and it's not always ""all or nothing"". Work hard, do your research, and fill a need, that's how you'll find success.

878,5iaz5h,False,,176,"[AMA] We are three 21 years olds who started building speakers for festivals from our basement and now have become one of the fastest growing hardware startups, SOUNDBOKS. Ask us anything!",Entrepreneur,"SOUNDBOKS AMA
Hey guys, 

Fairly new to Reddit but have used /r/entrepreneur for tips for a long time. Don’t see too many hardware posts so thought it might be helpful to talk about our experience starting SOUNDBOKS.


**TL; DR** 
Founded a portable speaker company in our basement, got funded, Kickstarter got us a bunch more sales, and now we’re expanding to the US from Denmark/Europe.

&nbsp;

**Full story**
My name is Hjalte and two years ago I founded [SOUNDBOKS](https://www.soundboks.com) with two friends out of high school and about $5000. 


For a few years, my friends (now co-founders) and I had built our own speakers with car batteries and spare parts for our campsite at Roskilde Festival, a Danish music festival. We needed a speaker capable of powering an endless party and withstand rain, hot/cold weather, and the weight of a dancing man. At Roskilde, your typical mass market portable speakers don’t stand a chance. Each year, we would have to make new speakers for the occasion. 


This brought about the idea for SOUNDBOKS. What we needed was a durable, loud portable speaker that would last us for years.  What we found online were built with lead acid batteries that started dropping off after half a year or so. 


It only took **one craigslist ad to validate the demand**, advertising that we'd built Roskilde-ready speakers. We received a few dozen responses, which we really weren’t expecting. Sure there are tons of portable speakers, but we couldn’t find any loud enough to power a dance party. 


After producing the first 500 in our basement and selling to festival-goers we applied and were accepted to Y-Combinator in Silicon Valley. With funding and guidance from **Y Combinator**, a few prominent Danish businessmen, and Mathew Bellamy- the lead singer of MUSE, we were able to hire some great engineers, create some organizational structure, and launch the most successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/554939252/soundboks-the-loudest-battery-powered-speaker) ever for a Danish company.

I would say the best advice we received from the YC network, was that we were the best people to answer questions about product, and the direction of our company. This seems obvious, but it was important for us to hear it from successful entrepreneurs. Especially since we were so young and had missed college to start this.

Fast forward to the present- SOUNDBOKS launched the **most funded Kickstarter campaign in Danish history** and we’ve delivered to more than 5000 customers in Europe and America. In the process, we’ve had time to build a great customer support team, find new and better logistics suppliers, and create an appealing and consistent brand. We have also decided to enter the US market, and our flagship store will be opening in January on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles. We’re also in talks with US retailers like Guitar Center. 


**It’s our first retail store ever so any tips about running a physical store would be super helpful!**


My current role is the Chief Branding officer, although the CEO and CMO are all online. The team consists of a mix of ages between 18-49 and 11 nationalities spread over 25 colleagues based in Copenhagen, Los Angeles, and Shenzhen (China). To help answer questions, we'll have people from **engineering, logistics, marketing, support, and branding all online**.

It featured a SOUNDBOKS and has gotten millions of views so far. We’ve shot a lot of content around the SOUNDBOKS and have reposted a lot of videos made by our customers, so it was really cool to see one take off. 

A few weeks ago we agreed to give one of our speakers to the dancer in the video, Marquese, and helped him shoot some videos showing off the SOUNDBOKS. 

**Right now we’re definitely getting a lot of exposure, but we’re still figuring out how to get people to our site from the video. It's been hard contacting the media outlets that are reposting. Any suggestions?**

463,diapg3,False,Lessons Learned,108,40 Rules for Selling,Entrepreneur,"I work as a Sales Director and I wrote the following text in Spanish long ago. Some people considered it useful, so I translated it into English hoping it can help more people:

1. **Call more and call now.**
Prospect by default, but have in mind that every time you'll try to start prospecting your brain will make up a thousand excuses to convince you it's not the best moment to do it.

2. **It's easier to sell to those who already have your product or a similar one.**

3. **Use a script.**
Your key message must be delivered in your first intervention and be contained in no more than 3 sentences.

4. **Desensitize yourself to rejection.**
Every 'no' gets you closer to the next ""yes"".

5. **If the recepcionist doesn't like you, you'll never reach the decision-maker.**

6. **The quickest way to be liked is to ask for help.**

7. **Don't talk to nondecision-makers.**
Be nice to them, they can become referrers, but don't talk to them about your product or company. A nondecision-maker can't say ""yes"" but can say ""no"".

8. **There will be objections.**
If it doesn't let you to move forward smoothly, is and objection. It's trivial whether the objection is based on a truth or not. ""Send me more information by email"" is also an objection.

9. **Don't believe anything.**
(Almost) everybody lies, about almost everything, almost all the time; and the reason why that happens is irrelevant.

10. **Don't send presentations.**
No one reads them, and even if they did, you'd first need to figure out what your potential customer wants to know, and to figure out what your potential customer wants to know you need to have a conversation, and once you've had a conversation a presentation is no longer needed. Potential customers only use presentations to discard candidates, never to hire them.

11. **Work your eloquence.**
Be brief, be concise, don't digress, stay firm, don't doubt, be interesting.

12. **Don't be generous when it comes to availability.**
If it's scarce it must be good.

13. **Don't plan your meetings.**
No matter how many scenarios you think of, and how many questions you get ready for, every meeting will develop in a different way from what you imagined.

14. **Become friends.**
Under same conditions people choose their friends, and under unequal circumstances… also. It doesn't matter how good your product is if the customer doesn't like you.

15. **Shut up.**
Don't interrupt. Don't even nod. Just shut up and pay attention. If you talk more than 20 % of the time, you are doing it wrong. If you listen before pitching, by the time is your turn the customer would have already told you everything he wants to hear.

16. **Don't move.**
Don't nod, don't smile, don't force your laughter. Just look and listen.

17. **Don't try to convince.**
Great salespeople don't try to turn ""noes"" into ""yeses"" -that's impossible-, what they do is to quickly detect -and reject- those who won't buy.

18. **Don't say you are good, show it.**
Give hints and let the customer reach the conclusions, it's way more believable.

19. **Don't talk about yourself.**
Your product, your company, and your life are boring. Like everyone's else. Like mine. Don't tell your client what you do, tell him how his life will be after buying whatever is you offer.

20. **Safety and ego are heavier than features and benefits.**
When someone buys from you, he puts his job in the line, or that's what he thinks. Once the customer is not afraid of losing his job, admiration from peers becomes sexier than the pricest treasure.

21. **Kill presentations.**
If you are a great speaker, a presentation will disminish your value; if you are a bad speaker, it will be even worse.

22. **Unsell.**
Contradict your client, deny some of his requests, show disinterest.

23. **Learn to say ""no"".**

24. **Don't be a butler.**
Avoid those ""pleases"", ""thank yous"", and ""excuse mes"" that you wouldn't genuinely say to a friend. While you are at it, kill the ""are you busy?"" and, above all, murder once and for all the denigrating ""thank you for your time"".

25. **Brag about your flaws.**
Start by mentioning the drawbacks of your product. Most drawbacks become advantages once you brag about them, and when not, you'll be transmiting honesty and they'll remember you for being unique.

26. **Interested customers are the least interesting.**
A customer showing too much interest, in hurry, or who brags about how well one is doing, doesn't want to buy anything. Think of it, when you are about to buy something expensive, do you want the seller to know you are willing to do anything to get it?

27. **Best way of solving objections is silence.**
Second best, whatever that starts with ""That's exactly why"".

28. **Do not solve objections.**
What the customer asks is not what he wants to be answered to. Behind every objection hides laziness or lack of trust. To overcome the former there's nothing to do but insisting; to overcome the latter, the customer must like you. If you answer to what you are asked, you'll lose your chance to do either and the conversation will end.

29. **Ask ""why"" times fives.**
Soon, you'll find that what your potential customer wants is not exactly what he first said.

30. **After every interaction *you* say what the next step is.**

31. **Keep emails below 100 words and containing no more than one goal or question.**

32. **Always-fucking-deliver.**
Be puncutal, and if you agree on something, do your part exactly when and how you agreed.

33. **Don't customize your proposals.**
And keep them under 3 pages. Whenever you deliver a proposal you are delivering free work. The more free work a client feels you have given him, the less he'll value you.

34. **Persevere.**

35. **If in doubt, phone.**
I also prefer the email, but email is for cowards, and cowards can't sell.

36. **Ask for the close.**

37. **Network everywhere, with everyone, all the time.**
Go to events and introduce yourself to others, but leave twitter and those events in which everyone already know everyone. This is about making money, not about being popular among peers and competitors.

38. **Get your contacts to introduce you to their contacts.**
This will help your sales more than everything I said before.

39. **Almost-sales don't generate revenue.**
That's why you'll never say again that a deal is hot or almost closed.

40. **There's no sale until you get paid.**
The deal is not closed when a client says he wants to work with you. Not even when he signs the contract. Only a deal is closed when someone else's money gets into your company's bank account.

297,cap86r,False,Startup Help,250,Digital Marketing Agency Making Consistent $8K Per Month (No Course BS/No Buying BS) PT. 1,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I really miss the way this subreddit used to be. I swear to god I see someone trying to sell their services every week and I'm over it. Back to dropping as much knowledge as possible and I know some of you will say well why should we listen to your POV. Well, I'm an average Joe just like you and I feel I've made some headway.  

&#x200B;

I'm a long time avid Reddit reader and poster. I wanted to really go in-depth on how I created my digital marketing agency. The reason why I'm picking this topic is that I'm seeing more and more people trying to get into this field and the more people that get into this field the more scams, and ""gurus"" that pop up trying to sell their $999 course to you. I'm actually so over all these damn courses and everyone trying to just scheme off this industry. Its a real industry with a ton of value. I hope this post brings value. It's probably the same stuff as you would pay to get but free.    

&#x200B;

* Starting a Digital Marketing Agency - Logo, Website, Brand, SEO       

&#x200B;

When I started my digital marketing agency I quit my 7-4 job as a construction project manager where I was making $1,650 a week. It was a good job, but I couldn't stand waking up every morning making some other dude rich. Obviously, I talked with my wife and I got the OK, but I quit in March of 2018. I had 2-3K saved up and I was on my way to doing digital marketing. I knew a little about websites, SEO and presence on Instagram but nothing insane. My best advice to the newcomers. Save money, and go to Udemy/YouTube and learn about creating WordPress websites, and SEO tactics.     

&#x200B;

I went to ThemeForest and bought a $30 logo that I still use today. Again I'm trying my hardest not to do links or promote anything else. This is what I used for myself and it worked out extremely well. I bought a theme for WordPress off ThemeForest as well and customized it to my liking.    

&#x200B;

Now you have a website, make sure that you SEO optimize your website: H1 Tags, Meta Tags, Meta Description, Title Tags,  Alt Text, Keywords - Before contacting businesses to offer SEO services. I can't tell you how many people I've talked with that have shit fuck websites and are trying to sell an SEO package for $1,500. It's actually incredible.  

&#x200B;

* Starting a Digital Marketing Agency - Social Media Platforms  

&#x200B;

I've been asked countless times which platform is better for digital marketing. Some people say all of them, and some people say one platform. At the end of the day just choose a platform and work hard on it. Personally, I would recommend Instagram, and grow from there. A lot and I mean a lot of people underestimate the power of social media. I can't stress this enough.     

&#x200B;

In order to grow your agency and grow in general, you need to post content. I don't like the once a day method or once a week method. I'm talking good quality postings of 1-3 per day. Talk about your agency, and how to grow it. Talk about your techniques. At the end of the day give value over trying to get someone to buy a course for $300-999 dollars. I'm a strong believer in value > $.  

&#x200B;

This could be a whole segment on growing your platforms and will probably come in a later post.  

&#x200B;

* Start a Digital Marketing Agency - Branding  

&#x200B;

A lot of people overlook the type of brand they create. Try and come up with a name that catches people's eye. I get complimented almost every time I go to a meeting on the name I created for my agency. For Reddit purposes, I won't state the name here as I don't want any type of advertising.    

&#x200B;

Think long and hard about the name because this should be your name forever. Start the branding process on all social media accounts & website and start working.  

&#x200B;

* Start a Digital Marketing Agency - Getting Clients    

&#x200B;

I was going to leave this for PT. 2 of the post but I decided what the heck. When I first started my Digital Marketing Agency from Month 1 - 3 I had a ton of leads but I didn't close anyone. I half-assed my work and I thought I could easily get clients. My website looked like shit, and the way I went about it was I was trying to make this easy money. First things first it isn't easy money and the trick to succeeding in any business is hard work. You won't be an instant success in a week a month or even a year. It takes multiple years of hard work. I'm just being honest and that's probably the best advice I can give to anyone and HEY look at that it doesn't cost you a cent.  

&#x200B;

* Cold Calling - I know most of you dread this but giving someone a call and saying ""Hello my name is Joseph is the director of marketing or the business owner available?"" - ""What for?"" - ""Well I own a digital marketing agency in the local area and I was calling to see if they were interested in getting more clients for the business, a new website or any type of SEO services to rank you on the first page of Google"" - It's that simple. You can either get a NO, an email to link information which means a lead or a sure one second. I've gotten my first 2 big clients over cold calling. It works. You need to pretend you are a goldfish and forget if anyone is ever mean to you on the phone. Keep calling and keep working.  
* Email Marketing - Now Gmail puts a cap of 500 emails per day. I use Gmail. That gives you 100 emails of emailing business of not spam but give them actual knowledge of their business. Give them a Free audit report of their business, audit their Facebook/Instagram accounts. Give them value and stop trying to sell over an email right away.  
* Networking / Chamber of Commerce - Join your local chamber. Probably costs $240 to join but its worth it as you get to go to all these meetings and meet new people. Once again its about providing value. Don't instantly try and sell the first time you see them. Help people out.  

&#x200B;

The second part when I get some time will be what I actually do in my digital marketing agency explaining SEO, Web Design & actual marketing tips. Again this could be used for the average business owner who can't afford digital marketing services or people starting their own agency.

&#x200B;

417,6ztybx,False,How to Grow,98,How I attract high paying clients to my design & development agencies,Entrepreneur,"# Sideproject Marketing

After my ([previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6wz5d5/10kmrr_in_3_months_i_have_nothing_to_sell_you/)) I've been getting a lot of questions in my inbox from people asking me **How I get clients to my agency?**

So, right now I'm running a [Design firm  that offers unlimited UI design to tech startups & software teams](http://fairpixels.pro).

This isn't my first agency and I've been getting high-ticket clients for almost 8 years. For design AND development projects.

Instead of answering everybody individually, I thought I'd write a short post. The strategy I've been using to bring in clients does *not* include:

* Spending money on ads
* Spending years building a social following
* Going to networking events
* Cold calling

There's nothing wrong with any of these methods, but as a maker, I'd rather spend time... making things. So if you're a designer or a developer, and hate all of those things listed above, try out the following strategy to attract clients to your agency on autopilot:

It's called: **Side project marketing**

I did not invent this, do a quick google search and you'll find a ton of awesome articles on this subject. But basically this is what it's about:

1.  You build a side project, separate from your main/core business. The side project needs to be something that is 100% free, easy to build and provides massive massive value to your target audience. I'm not talking about an ebook (though you can do that), but a high value tool. It might even look like a full fledged stand alone startup company.

2. Then, instead of promoting your agency, you promote that side project. Why? Because it's something that (hopefully) provides instant value for free. People are more likely to share an awesome free and simple tool vs the website of your agency. So marketing the side project, simply by posting it on relevant forums, sharing it with bloggers, sending it to journalists to potentially write about, will make it a lot easier to drive traffic to those side projects.

3. On the side project, there's a link to your core business/service. A percentage of the traffic, will visit your core business and... if what you offer is relevant to that audience, convert to a customer.


**Here's a real life example**

So before we started offering unlimited UI design, we were just designing logos. That's it. We started out as a tiny logo firm. What we did was build a website called Logodust. Logodust is a website where we open source our unused logo designs. Then we posted it on Hacker News, sent it to a few bloggers, and before we knew it, Logodust was featured on Product Hunt, TheNextWeb and a bunch of other high profile websites.

A good chunk of the traffic, ended up hiring us for a premium logo design service. Until this day (this was about 2 years ago I think) we get clients on auto pilot, from that one side project. *Without* looking for clients.

**conclusion**

So... Use your making skills as your marketing skills. Build awesome free tools and services that are easy to market. Tools and projects that people are likely to share because they offer something unique and of high value. Then convert a small chunk of those visitors, to paying clients for your agency.

Let me know if this was helpful.

657,c4p8am,False,,85,Your idea is worthless and execution is everything - the story of Tom and John,Entrepreneur,"This is the (fake) story of Tom and John. Two men who run two identical lawn care businesses in two identical neighboring towns. They both have a book of 250 weekly customers. They both have 5 crews working full time each summer.

**Tom works 20 hours a week and earns $400k a year after all of his expenses are paid. John works 70 hours a week and earns $75k a year.**

Tom has a crew of good employees and John complains that hiring reliable people is impossible in today's business environment. Tom spends his time overseeing his crews and John has more turnover and unreliable workers so he spends most of his time on the jobs or putting out fires.

Tom is not particularly good at lawn care and hasn't been on a mower in years. John is really really good at his work. Hes the fastest in town and mows the straightest lines and does the most beautiful landscaping projects.

**Tom is a salesman and a communicator.** He focuses on bringing in new business and hiring/managing his employees. He knows what he isn't good at and outsources it. He outsources his digital marketing to a freelancer. He hired a great customer service and account management specialist as his first hire. He outsources his bookkeeping, compliance etc. **John is a jack of all trades**. He mows and then comes home and does billing and customer service. He sets up his marketing campaigns on the weekends and crams his bookkeeping at tax time.

**Tom turns down more business than he accepts.** He only does the job if it's profitable and it's what he is best at doing. **John says yes to most opportunities even if he knows it isn't what he does best.**

**Tom competes on speed and service.** He understands he won't get every customer so he closes 20% of his jobs at 2x the price of his competitors. He only wants the customers who are willing to pay more for better service. He doesn't take it personal when he loses bids. Its a numbers game. **John competes on price and complains about the craigslisters and fly by nights that underbid him and keep him from making any money.** John works hard to win every bid, often discounting services to undercut competitors. He closes more leads than Tom but at a lower price. For some reason the customers call and complain a lot more than Tom's customers do. They don't pay on time. They try to take advantage of him often so its a battle.

**Tom focuses on marketing that his competitors are ignoring.** He records videos and posts them to youtube when hes working on an interesting landscaping project. He writes articles attempting to help local home owners answer some questions about the local environment and lawn issues. He has his crews put yard signs in lawns. He sends hand written notes to new home owners after they close on expensive houses in town. He encourages customers to leave reviews with photos on Google My Business.

**John is too busy for that so he throws more money at his social media and Adwords campaigns.**

**When customers call Tom his staff answers on the first ring every time with a smile.** They get quotes out using Google Maps in about 20 minutes on average. When he's dealing with clients and bidding big jobs he goes out of his way to help them. He gains trust. He answers their questions and even tells some customers how to do parts of the job themselves. He offers first cuts for free to his customers so they can try out his service with no obligation.

**John is on the mower so his voicemail picks up most of his calls and he calls them back when he has a chance.** His margins are too low to waste time chatting or talking to customers who aren't buyers yet. He can't offer a free service and has to milk his early customers for profit to keep his lights on.

Since Tom charges 2x what John does he pays his employees more and can retain better employees. **Tom's crew has very clear tasks at hand and they know exactly what needs to be done. Everyone specializes in what they do best.** The office handles billing and customer service. The crew leader drives the mower. The second guy is on the trimmer all day. A separate grew does landscaping. **Johns crews do a little of everything because there is no-one else to collect payment on invoices or answer customer's questions about the service or a separate crew to do landscaping projects.**

When an employee asks **Tom a question he tries to teach that employee** how he would frame it and solve it. He asks them questions with the goal of teaching them how to think about it and how to solve the problem while supporting them and giving them the tools to make it happen. **John doesn't have time for that so when an employee comes to him with a problem it becomes his problem and he takes over.**

**Tom spends his time on stuff that is important but not urgent.** He makes decisions now and does work now that will remove 10 future decisions or 10 future tasks. Hes putting out fires before they start. John is running from fire to fire solving urgent problems. He has no time to prevent them from happening in the first place.

**Tom has a manager at his company that answers the hard phone calls and deals with 99% of the problems**. Tom invested a lot of time over the years training him and gaining his trust. When Tom leaves for vacation or goes out to quote jobs things flow along smoothly.

**John is where the buck stops at his company.** Every problem comes to him. Every question comes to him. Problems just pile up in front of him until everything comes to a halt. If he leaves his computer to go out on a job (which he does often) everything comes to a grinding halt. John hasn't had a vacation in 10 years.

344,4t9n76,False,,203,Every entrepreneur that is promoting his business online is making exactly the same mistake,Entrepreneur,"Hello /r/entrepreneur.

I would like to share with you guys something that I have noticed in past few weeks. I have started my own Social Media Management agency 3 weeks ago following advice from this subreddit. I have 6 clients so far and everything is going way better than I have expected and I have never been happier.

However, I have noticed something that is really bugging me. Every entrepreneur who is promoting his business, products or services online is thinking like this:

""I have such great products and amazing website!! I will make Instagram and Facebook account and I will share my awesome products every day so everyone can buy them!! Social media is great and I will make tons of money!!!!""

Once they figure out how to set up their social media accounts, they start wasting their time posting pictures of products even though they have 3 followers. After few months of working hard, updating everything few days per week and begging some of their clients to like their page (if they have clients) they usually end up with 100-150 followers/likes at most and usually 0 sales.

This is HORRIBLE approach. This is not how you want to promote your business online, especially on social media. Think like this. You are using tons of products every day (food, hygiene, etc...) Are you following your toothpaste brand on Facebook and liking all their pictures? Are you following coffee that you are drinking every day and liking their pictures? I don't think that you are. 

Why would you or anyone else subscribe to page that is offering them nothing in return except seeing poorly made daily advertisements of their products?

In order to grow your online presence - **YOU NEED TO PROVIDE VALUE** to your audience. One of my clients was promoting his online shop for 14 months. How many followers he acquired during that time? 160. How many sales came from his Social media page? 0. Engagement rate was almost 0%. (0.4% to be precise). I have started posting content that was entertaining to his audience and his potential customers. I spent a lot of time searching for his target customers and interacting with them by following them, liking their photos, commenting and building healthy relationship with them. In 3 weeks I grew it from 160 to 1600. No magic tricks, just common sense and a lot of hard work.

In order to grow your business online you need to give your target group something. You can post something that entertains them for example. If you are selling fitness products, post fitness motivation quotes, weight loss tips and stuff like that. 80-90% of all your posts needs to be content that is offering them something. Only 10-20% of your content should be products promotion. And when you are promoting products, it is nice to give your followers discount - as a reward for following you. They are 10 times more likely to buy something from you if they see that you have sale and that you are running discounts at the moment.

Please, try to engage with your audience. Build healthy relationship with them. Make them to like you and trust you. They are seeing, just like we are, hundreds of ads every single day. You need to stand out. There are thousands of people selling same stuff as you. Why would anyone choose you? 

You will need to spend a lot of time, especially if you are growing your accounts organically. (Like you should in my opinion). But it will be worth it. Even if you grow only couple hundred followers per month, in a year you will have few thousand followers who are interested in your services and who are following you because you have built friendly and healthy relationship with them. You won't need to spend dime on Facebook/IG advertising. 

Grow your brand awareness and don't rely on paid advertising only. It can give you instant results - If you somehow manage to optimize campaign properly, but this will be pretty hard unless you have experience in IM. Take a longer route and trust me, after few months you will thank yourself.

But **a lot of customers are super entitled and down right mean**. It sounds silly but some use controlling and emotionally abusive tactics to get refunds, take advantage or get their way. 

We had a customer who fell behind on rent. When we reached out she was upset about the lack of a rope hanging down from her unit door. Claimed she couldn't use it properly. Claimed we were discriminating against her for this reason or that reason. She continued to harass our customer service rep with a lot of offensive language and threats on the phone. I had our maintenance guy stop by and install a rope (this was her first complaint on the matter) and then I called her personally.

She insulted me. She spoke to me like I was 5 years old. She used a lot of profanity. She threatened online reviews. She threatened lawsuites. It was a wild conversation.

At the end of her lecture she demanded 2 free months of storage and a reduced rate moving forward. If we didn't comply she would sue us.

720,7vgbvf,False,Case Study,101,From $120/m to $5000/m - Part 5 of my Website Flipping Case Study,Entrepreneur,"Hey all, it's been a while since I last gave an update on this case study. A quick background for people who haven't seen any of the past updates. I bought a website for $1,250 in May of 2016 and the site was making around $120 per month. I started the case study to document the entire process of me buying, growing and eventually selling the site. I originally planned this case study as a quick flip (6-12 months) but soon saw there was a lot of potential here, so I decided to not flip it and instead focus on growing it more. The site has gone through a lot of changes but in January 2018 it made over $5000 in revenue. This update gives you a peek into how the site has grown so much and what I've been doing. I would highly suggest reading the past updates first so you have context for this update.

&nbsp;

As I do with all of my posts, I have formatted it all here on reddit for you to read without having to go to my site. However, for a better reading experience I would suggest reading the article on [my blog](https://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-flipping-case-study-part-5/). 

&nbsp;

********

&nbsp;

I have a exciting new case study update for you all today where I will show you how this site is now making over $5,000 per month. For context, a year ago the site was making less than $200 per month. The growth on this site has been amazing and I can’t wait to get into all of what has happened since the last update. Before I do, make sure to catch up on the previous case study updates:

&nbsp;

Reading those updates will get you familiar with the origins of the site and how things have changed since I purchased it in June of 2016.

&nbsp;

Now let’s hop right into this update!

&nbsp;

## Why the Increase in Revenue?

The burning question you are probably asking yourself is how the site has made a huge jump from less than $2,000 per month 3 months ago to over $5,000 per month now. The answer is somewhat of a letdown because there is no magical reason or special “trick”. This growth is simply from all of the consistent work we have been putting into the site the past 11+ months and we are starting to see some major growth. People always think there is a trick or some special tactic that people use to grow websites, but it really boils down to 3 things:

&nbsp;

- Create high quality content in high quantities
- Build solid links
- Monetize properly

&nbsp;

That is it.

&nbsp;

Do those 3 things consistently and you will find success with growing websites. Yes, there are other things that contribute to having success but those are the 3 pillars to success. This site is proof of it working. Let’s take a look at the traffic and revenue graphs to see the full growth history of the site.

&nbsp;

## All Time Traffic Stats

&nbsp;

Traffic Stats - [https://imgur.com/tsBbh3O](https://imgur.com/tsBbh3O)

&nbsp;

Consistent month over month traffic growth thanks to consistent content creation combined with a solid content strategy. It just works. A year ago, in January 2017, the site was getting around 2,000 sessions per month. Fast forward a year to January 2018 and the site is now getting 34,000 sessions per month.

&nbsp;

## Content Creation

To give you an idea of what our content creation looks like I want to give you a peek under the hood. Below you can see how many articles we are creating per month, total cost, cost per work, average article length and more. Click image for a better view.

&nbsp;

Content Stats - [https://imgur.com/VsyhfQE](https://imgur.com/VsyhfQE) 

&nbsp;

Here are the monthly averages:

&nbsp;

- Articles: 13.27
- Words: 17,125
- Total Cost: $517
- Cost per Article: $40.41
- Cost per Word: $.03
- Article Length: 1330

&nbsp;

On average we are publishing 13 articles per month and spending $500 per month on this content. Doing this steady for a year is the biggest reason for the growth in traffic and revenue for this site. Consistency is underrated when building websites. A lot of this consistency of published content can be attributed to having systems and processes in place that have allowed the site to continue to pump out content with minor efforts from myself. Hiring a project manager and implementing systems is hands down the best thing that has ever happened to my businesses.

&nbsp;

## All Time Financial Stats

As I have mentioned in past updates, revenue is the most important metric that I pay attention to when growing websites. Profit is important, but in my opinion you should be reinvesting all of your websites earnings right back into it. That is the quickest way to grow. Yes, your profit is not going to look fantastic during this growth phase but it will pay off huge later. That is what we have been doing for this site. Reinvesting everything back into the site and only focusing on growth, at whatever cost. 

&nbsp;

With that being said, below is our monthly revenue numbers since I took over ownership in June 2016:

&nbsp;

## Revenue Stats

Revenue Numbers - [https://imgur.com/SWaRyAt](https://imgur.com/SWaRyAt)

&nbsp;

The revenue growth has been incredible. I’ve seen this happen a lot on other sites where the revenue or traffic hits a plateau for a few months and then all of a sudden your break through that “wall” and move into the next plateau. From the chart above, you can see the first plateau was around $200 from October 2016 through March 2017. Then from April 2017 to July 2017 the revenue went all the way up to $1,800. It plateaued in the $1.8k – $1.6k range for 5 months and then in December 2017 shot up to $3.6k and now we are over $5.2k.

&nbsp;

It will be interesting to see where the level of the next plateau will be.

&nbsp;

## Perfecting the Monetization Methods

Testing, tweaking and trying new monetization methods can be one of the best ways to increase the revenue of a site in a short amount of time. If you recall all the way back when I purchased this site it was solely being monetized by Adsense. That’s it. My initial plan was to just optimize the ad placement and increase revenue that way. Doing that did increase the revenue, but I didn’t see a major boost in revenue until I tested other monetization strategies such as lead gen and affiliate content.

&nbsp;

To better illustrate how the income streams for this site have evolved and how they have improved the revenue per visitor over time I have created a chart below. 
The top part of the chart shows the revenue streams each month broken down by the type of revenue. You can see how the first 10 months we mainly used ads to monetize the site but once we started testing affiliate and lead gen strategies the total revenue went up AND the revenue per visitor did too. You can see the revenue per visitor over time in the bottom line chart. I’d suggest clicking on the image to make it bigger ans easier to read.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## All Time Expenses

Expense - [https://imgur.com/InGXRtO](https://imgur.com/InGXRtO)

&nbsp;

In the last update I gave a detailed breakdown of these expenses and where we are spending our money. Most of the expenses are for content and our project manager. You will see that we had our highest month ever in terms of expenses in January for a total of $2,649. The main reason for the increase in expenses was that we gave a $1,000 bonus to our project manager. So the actual expenses for January would have been around $1,600 without the $1000 bonus. I wanted to note that because the $1,500 $2,000 range for monthly expenses for this site is just about the ceiling. That range for expenses will be where we will sit for most months moving forward.

&nbsp;

This is interesting now because we have reached a point where our expenses are “fixed” in a way so our profit will continue to go up each month as long as the revenue keeps growing. In the past, our expenses grew with our revenue which made it so the site broke even each month. Now we are to the point where the site will actually start generating solid and consistent profits each month while still growing.

&nbsp;

## All Time Profit

Profit stats - [https://imgur.com/D05EOL6](https://imgur.com/D05EOL6)

&nbsp;

The graph above illustrates my point that I made earlier about the site now generating a consistent and solid profit each month. The site has now reached the stage that we have been trying to get it to for the past 9+ months. We knew that if we heavily reinvested all earnings back into the site we would eventually get it to a point where we would outgrow our expenses, which is where we are at now. I’m super excited about achieving this because we now get the best of both worlds. On one hand we get to keep growing it each month by investing around $1.5k to $2k per month but then on other hand we are also able to take a profit each month.

&nbsp;

## Current Site Valuation

This case study originally started as a “website flipping” case study because I planned to quickly flip this website within 6-12 months. However, I quickly realized that the site had too much potential to do a quick flip. Now the plan is to continue aggressively growing this site until we feel like we have reached the ceiling. Once that happens we will think about selling it. So looking at the current valuation of the site right now doesn’t really matter, but it is worth mentioning for the sake of the case study.

&nbsp;

To keep things as simple as possible, I will use the last 3 months average profit and a 25x multiple to find the valuation. In reality, a lot more factors would be considered and it would probably fetch a higher multiple than 25x.

&nbsp;

Site Valuation - [https://imgur.com/ABkaVii](https://imgur.com/ABkaVii)

&nbsp;

The valuation is also skewed due to how heavy we are reinvesting all of our profits back into the site. Which is why I don’t care to even look at the current valuation. If you take a look at the profit chart in the above section you will see that in November we actually lost $139. November numbers were used to calculate the valuation of the site, so you can see why the $38k valuation is skewed lower.

&nbsp;

Next month, assuming we make a profit of $2000 that would bring our new valuation to $55,883. Just to give you an idea how much the valuation can swing when you are growing.

&nbsp;

##What Have We Done Since Last Update?

To be honest, a lot of the same. Creating content, building links and testing monetization strategies. The things mentioned below are things a little more “out of the ordinary”.

&nbsp;

## Started Selling our own Product

This is the biggest thing we have done in the past few months. We have created our own study guide for a test that HVAC techs have to take. This took a lot of work to put together because we wanted to make sure it was top notch. We launched it a few days ago to our small email list and made a few sales, which is encouraging. This product is our MVP and now that we know their is interest in this area we will begin to promote it further and start creating other products we can sell.

&nbsp;

We eventually plan to build out a catalog of products that are our own and we hope that this will be a solid income stream for us in the future. I will talk more about this in a second.

&nbsp;

## Optimized Lead Gen Monetization

One of the biggest reasons for the increase in revenue has been due to the optimization of our lead gen affiliate program. I optimized content on the site to better convert readers into leads. I made changes to the 50+ pieces of content we have geared towards lead gen and this has a direct impact on our revenue. I’m very pleased with the results.

&nbsp;

##Started Building an Email List

We have started collecting emails and building out an email list. In the past it didn’t make sense to try and collect emails on the site for two reasons:

&nbsp;

We had no use for an email list
All content was geared towards lead gen or affiliate content, both more profitable to not try and convert readers into email subscribers
Now that the site has matured and we have more types of content where we don’t have a direct way to monetize it makes sense to try and convert readers into email subscribers. We are also now selling our own products which can be promoted via email. We now have a way to monetize this email list.

&nbsp;

We have started slow, but are up to over 100+ email subscribers and will continue to work on growing the email list. This could prove to be crucial in order for the site to take it’s next step towards making our own products a solid income source.

&nbsp;

## Future Plans and Goals

My plans for this site have continuously evolved. At first it was going to be a quick flip but then in the 3rd update I decided to take a longer term approach to the site. In that update, which was in in July 2016, I set my goal at $1,000 per month. It took one year, but in June 2017 the site earned $1,000. Then in the 4th case study update I upped my goal again, this time to $5,000 in a month. I set this goal in October 2017. A few months later I was able to reach that mark in January 2018.

&nbsp;

Now what? Good question!

&nbsp;

The new goal is $10,000 per month in revenue. I think reaching this mark will actually be easier than expected. We have been working really hard to expand this site into new areas that will allow us to reach the $10k mark. Some things we are working on are listed below.

&nbsp;

## Double Down on Amazon Affiliate Content

Content where we write reviews about various types of products has proven to be very successful on the limited sample we have so far. There are a lot of sub niches that we have yet to explore and a lot of untapped content we can go after. We feel like we can really grow this aspect of the website fairly easily so we will be doubling down on this type of content. You can see from the revenue numbers talked about above that Amazon has become a major part of this website’s income streams.

&nbsp;

One thing that is interesting about the AC/HVAC niche is that it is seasonal, but half of the products are popular in the summer and die down in the winter and the other half are the opposite. For example, heaters are poplar in the winter months but then AC is popular in the summer months. We are trying to create this content in a smart way so that we don’t see a dip in traffic as the seasons change.

&nbsp;

## Expand Product Line

Creating your own products to sell on your website is HUGE.

&nbsp;

You make your business a lot more sustainable by doing this because you are no longer relying on a 3rd party for your income. I really like the idea of expanding our products we create and sell in order to minimize our 3rd party risk and add another income stream for the site. We have only dabbled in this area so far with our first study guide, but the initial sales have been encouraging and we will begin to look for ways we can expand this part of the site.

&nbsp;

One idea that I think is really interesting is to eventually move into a more interactive “course” of sorts that will provide the user a variety of material that will help them pass the exam. We are still brainstorming ideas but we are eager to expand this area of the business. This will be important for the site to reach the next goal of $10,000 per month.

&nbsp;

## Test New Sub Niches

When I use the term “sub niches” I am talking about new avenues within the overarching niche of the website. This site started as mainly an informational website about HVAC, but once I took over I began to caover more sub niches such as product review content and local keywords. Both have been the main pillars for the site’s success so far. We have done a good job with these first two sub niches, but it is time we begin to look for new angles we can create content around in order to keep growing the site.

&nbsp;

As a recap, we have currently created content for the following sub niches of the main niche of HVAC:

&nbsp;

Product reviews
Local content for state specific content
Test study guides and practice tests
General HVAC info

&nbsp;

Some new areas we are looking to expand into include:

&nbsp;

AC brand reviews
AC troubleshooting content

&nbsp;

Both of these are very deep, meaning that there is a lot of content that can be written for both of them. There are probably at least 50+ pieces of content we can write between these two new sub niches. This is where a lot of our time and money will be spend over the coming months in terms of content.

&nbsp;

## Until the Next Update

That’s gonna do it for this update. Hope you enjoyed seeing how the site has progressed and grown since I first bought the site. You can probably expect updates every 3 months or from now on since there isn’t a whole lot of new developments on a month to month basis that would warrant a a new blog post.

479,3hlswi,False,My Success Story,263,"How I made $3,000 dollars a month while at University with placemat advertising",Entrepreneur,"Okay, so this may sound like one of those spammy internet posts, but I seek no financial benefit from this post, only to share with you an incredibly simple business idea I ran whilst studying at University.

During years 2-4 of my University studies I started a business with a friend called ""Adspad"". Adspad enabled businesses to engage with the student population by offering targeted advertising opportunities within the university environment. It did this by producing paper placemats which appear on trays in university canteens. 

The business was simple, we sourced a printing supplier (FSC certified paper to cut down environmental impact), set up a year agreement with the university to let us supply the university with placemats every month (pretty easy sell as we were students of the university and they wanted to support a uni startup), and then sold advertising space to local and national businesses who wanted to promote their products & services to students. We started off with one university and grew to two within a couple of months.

Each individual advertising slot was sold for $150 and clients could merge slots for bigger adverts. We had 10 slots per university per month so if we sold all our spaces at both universities we would turnover ~$3,000 per month. Printing costs were low, around $600 per university per month. 

It was a nice little business and certainly beat working part time in a bar. Idea was really simple and required little to no startup capital to get it off the ground. After University I sold the business and a few years later it closed down as the new owner moved onto something else, but can't see any reason why someone else cant replicate the idea in their campus.


Here is an [example of one of the placemats](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_45tUS4UTHzs/SxKgNb_wUSI/AAAAAAAAAZc/4cEwENXnrII/s1600/untitled.bmp.)

So why don't we use the revenues from data as a means to fund everyone's personal causes by redistributing it to people as a market incentive to drive content, market research and commerce?

521,626r7n,False,,139,How I started an Amazon FBA business for about $500,Entrepreneur,"I'll try to make this short and leave details for questions in the comments I am hoping that I am able to create an free resource for people looking to start selling using Amazon FBA. Do not waste your money on a course when you could spend that on product. Personally, I think it is better to watch some YouTube Videos, read a couple of blogs and just getting started on a smaller scale. You’ll learn more from doing than you will from any course out there, when you could spend that on product.


This isn’t rocket science, you can do it with less than  $500 and in about a month without Harvard MBA, million dollars on yor bank account, reinventing the wheel, all you need is common sense, some work hours and as I said $500 of initial investment.


This is how to it, step by step, with sample product.


Here’s a quick breakdown of costs for my first batch of 100 units ordered:


* Manufacturing costs: About $280
* Shipping/Freight costs: $150
* Photo editing: $20
* UPC: $8 from Ebay
* Amazon monthly subscription fee: $40


With some quick math, you can see my total costs are about $498


**PROCESS**


* **Product research**

Product that meets the following basic criteria:

* Obscure, boring item that sells well

 * Existing demand on Amazon (we do not want to try to create demand, just leverage existing demand)

 * Product without too much competition. Where there aren’t a lot of items with hundreds of good reviews competing for the top spot (1 product with 1,000+ reviews? Bad. Only one product sells. 5 products with less than 100 reviews? Good. 5 listing with 1,000 reviews? Bad, competition is too high. 6 guys with 10 reviews? Bad, no demand)

* A national brand name does not rule the market

* Lightweight and small products are preferred The ideal FBA product takes no storage space and sells within a month. The further you get from that ideal the less likely you are to make a profit.

 
*  **Alibaba: order a product**


You can go to AliExpress and order several units to test the market with minimum financial risk but I suggest, go directly to Alibaba and order 100 units due to better rates. Delivery time is 3-4 weeks.


Now look arround your house and try to get an idea. Browse Amazon for each item you see no metter how obscure item is. Let’s say, I saw stretch lid and decided to compete with it. (Tip: do not compete in things like phone chargers (two much fake products, you can face with numerous refunds and get your account banned) and phone cases (too much competition, gross margin and ROI are disaster).


How do I do it:


* Search “stretch lids” on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=stretch+lids&sprefix=stretch+l%2Caps%2C339&crid=2MOA0OEV3SUIQ)


* Check out the first page listing, how many reviews they have, photos and price of course. Seems like the 6 pack set is about $13-15. Sales price is determined by our competitors, so we will set our price at $13-15.


* Search “stretch lids” on [Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&IndexArea=product_en&CatId=&SearchText=stretch+lids)


After several messages I received an offer for a nice looking, FDA and LFBG approved, made from food grade silicone, BPA free, dishwasher and freezer safe, flexible 6-set silicone stretch lid. $2,8 per set for, minimum order quantity – 100 sets.


This price difference looks great but there are some other costs to consider. Shipping and Amzon fees.


Supplier can organize aircargo+UPS delivery for $150 ($1.5/set costs to ship from China). So that’s $4.30 per set. Amazon then takes a their cut and for this particular product their cut is $4.53. You Amazon fees you’re gonna use Fulfillment by Amazon Revenue Calculator.


As you can see a product that costs $2.8 will actually cost almost $9. That’s three times more than you saw on Aibaba. In this example we’re making a $3-5 profit/item. Not much all but eventually you’ll see that better selling products have even lower profit margins.


I know, when you sell all 100 units it’s only $300 of profit but you can’t expect to earn more with such a low initial investment.


General milestone that Amazon sellers seem to strive for,  is reaching $1000 a day. You may think that you do this by launching a hugely successful product and yes you can do it that way but it’s actually the hard way. You would need a product that makes $30,000 a month. The problem with most $30,000 a month products that have any kind of profit margin is that they will be highly competitive. Second problem is invetory. The simpler way is to aim for a product that sells 10 – 20 units a day and sells for between $15 and $25. Once you have this product up and selling on amazon you can start to expand into other items in this category which will lead to a reduction in your shipping costs in the long run. To get to the magic number of $1,000 a day you would just need to duplicate what you did with this product with 2 other products. Or 4 or 5 other products that sell between 5 – and 10 units a day.


**Waiting for product to arrive – what to do?**


The most important parts of your listing are your photos and your title. Many people won’t even get past your main photo. Instead of hiring a product writer on Fiverr I suggest you write your own descriptions, bullets, title, and keywords buton the other hand taking your own pictures is bad idea if you don’t have a professional camera, lightbox and Photoshop skills. Photos could increase conversions by quite a lot, so hiring a professional for photos is one of the best investments for a successful product line. Additionaly, you should research PPC, track your competitors (analyze their sales, keywords and targets) and lastly, look at your pictures once again and ask yourself, could they be better. If they can, retake pictures.


**Product lunch – strategy**


Product have arrived at the Amazon warehouses. Our listing is officially active and live, now what? Get reviews on the product anyway you can and as soon as possible. This should be your main focus because reviews are KING but it is very difficult to get organic reviews. Last year Amazon banned incentivized reviews so you have to think out of the box here. Ask your friends, neighbors, family to find your product manually on Amazon and buy it at full price, hire someone (fiverr, Upwork, bartender from a local bar, your dentist…just find someone) to search for it and buy at full price. You’re noticing a pattern? Don’t send a link to your product – let them find it manually. Amazon will rank higher your product for that particular search terms. Let them buy at full price, so you won’t have any problems with Amazon and incentivized reviews. Additionaly, along with review other potential customer will see it’s a verified purchase and you’ll have social proof. This is against Amazon TOS but trust me, without those initail sales and reviews your product will just sit and collect dust in Amazon warehouse.


That’s all folks, now you have started your own brand.


If they sell, don’t take money out of the table, re-invest into more inventory, decrease shipping costs, move on to a new product and start the whole process again. Except this time it should go much smoother and easier and eventually you’ll have your own company, your own small business.


If you want to invest more, I would buy 4 or 5 different products rather than a lot of inventory of one product. You’ll maximize your chances of success by having multiple possibilities for success.


I run an email list that alerts people on new profitable Amazon products.

934,6kdae6,False,,111,"After 10 years, Eroshare.com is going down today - a nsfw website born and grown from Reddit",Entrepreneur,"Not sure how much users in this sub penetrate the darker, nsfw side of Reddit, but eroshare.com is basically ""imgur for hardcore amateur videos"" and has become the go-to place to self-host your nsfw naughty content for people posting that sort of stuff to Reddit.

As per [this article on Vice](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbj3mx/amateur-porn-platform-eroshare-is-shutting-down), at the start of June, the platform announced it would be turned off today due to explosive, unsustainable growth.

Which begs the question - how could they not be making money?

There are a few other threads on reddit discussing the ins and outs of this, but as far as I can see it comes down to the fact that:

* They (admirably) wanted to create an ad-free environment

* They don't (as far as I can see) have a subscription model to support the site

* They're not (as far as I can see) making sufficient $$ selling the data from the site

To me, it seems like a prime target for acquisition by Pornhub, and I'm a bit surprised we haven't seen anything announced in that regard. The amount of original, amateur content the site has collected would surely be worth quite a bit to their brand. I also suspect that if Pornhub did a spin-off site now that was exclusively branded towards self-publishing your own content (compared to their existing model where amateur/community content is still under the primary site), they'd probably have a huge win.

Similarly, given how firmly rooted in Reddit culture they currently are, I'm surprised that the userbase of reddit hasn't come together to fund the site. Although it looks like our [datahoarder homies are on top of preserving existing content](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/6g4c3p/erosharecom_nsfw_shutting_down_june_30th/)

It would be awesome if /u/paulwild or /u/eroshare came on and did an AMA about the business logistics of running a site like this, and some of the background to how it all operates. It sounds like there's an awesome story there, right from their initial launch 10 years ago when they wanted to be a NSFW alternative to youtube

881,4ashqq,False,,58,5 things I learned as a startup founder with zero marketing background,Entrepreneur,"*(For the original article, [click here](https://medium.com/@FranklinAcosta/5-things-i-learned-as-a-startup-founder-with-zero-marketing-background-cb6f7aa12e7b#.9gario7we))*


I made that mistake before of leaving all marketing related decisions to my co-founder because that was his background. So after launching my startup, I took a break from fixing bugs to learn as much as I could about advertising on social media, composing website copywrite, email marketing, and more to help build traction for my product.

Even though my journey on becoming a marketing jedi is far from finished, so far, here is what I’ve learned.


**1. Think in the perspective of your customer.**

This is #1 for a reason; it’s the most important one.

Nearly every sentence on your landing page should answer the question, *“so what?”* Communicate in terms of what **value** your service provides, not **what** it provides. A new customer does not care about what your product does… all they want to know is what is in it for them.

It seems that so many startups think they’re supposed to describe what their product/service is. Too often I see website taglines say things like, “The AirBnB for Pets” or “The Best Digital Marketing Agency For Your Brand”. *Who the hell cares?* The truth is that nobody knows who you are so, honestly, nobody cares. **Instead, tell them why they should care.**

Let’s imagine a website for a product that manages the room temperature throughout your home and use that as an example.


BAD: “Automated temperature monitoring for your home”

BETTER: “Lower your monthly bills and worry less with the perfect temperature in every room”


*Automated temperature monitoring for your home* (so what?) means absolutely nothing to a potential customer. In other words, there is no clear value as to what value the product offers. However, the 2nd line clearly states the benefits of the product to the consumer.

Use this method of thinking for your marketing emails, social media marketing, copywrite, videos, and almost everything you could think of related to selling your product. When you think you’re done, give it to someone else (not mommy and daddy), and ask them: *would you buy this?* Heck, just [tweet your link to me](https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%40FranklinAcosta_,%20would%20you%20buy%20this?%20%5B%5Blink%20to%20your%20product%5D%5D) and I’ll tell you if I would buy your product/service based on your website copy (I’ll do this free, of course) :)



**2. Go to where your customers are.**

Whether your startup is B2B or B2C, your job as the salesman for your product/service is to present solutions to people **that may actually experience the problem you’re looking to solve**. Your job is also to find where this community of people are and go straight to them.

Hugh Liddle from Red Cap Sales Coaching once put it perfectly; his friend, let’s call him Bob, sold a product in the agriculture industry. Instead of going farm to farm (which can be very time consuming), Bob discovered that every morning at 8 am all the farmers in a certain town visited a local coffee shop to get their morning cup of joe. Well, guess where Bob was every morning at 8 am.

While your customers may not all be in a coffee shop like Bob’s was, they may be on an online forum, a subreddit, an online chatroom, a live conference or trade show, a local market, or even the unemployment line at your local welfare office.

When you find them, make sure to follow point number 3 (below).



**3. People don’t want to be sold to.**

I don’t know a single person that likes it when someone tries to sell them something. As soon as I hear something along the lines of, “Do you experience back ache in the morning? Do you wish your bed was more comfortable?”, I immediately look the other way because it sounds like a sales pitch. If this sounds like something you do, stop it now because it’s hurting your sales.

Last week a friend on Facebook sent me the message below after I posted a status about entrepreneurship.


> **Her:** Hello. I came across one of your posts on my newsfeed and I thought it was great. I like some of your posts and I actually just wanted to run something by you. I’m not sure if you’re open but I am working with a group of millionaires on a billion dollar idea and I am looking for people who want more than what they are currently getting right now. Would you be one of them? Yes or no?

> **Me:** Hey [friend’s name]. Many entrepreneurs are working on what they perceive is a million or billion dollar idea ;) What is the idea that you’re referring to?

> **Her:** Well that is true but our actual company growth is headed into that billion dollar direction! Let’s exchange contact info and I’ll be happy to show you what were working on!


I didn’t respond to her after that.

Let’s be honest. Would good ol’ YOU actually reply to her saying, “Yes OMG I definitely want more than I am getting right now”?

I’m not going to get into the specifics of all the things wrong with this message but it’s obvious that she wanted to sell me something and that’s all she cared about. Her interest wasn’t really to “help me get more than what I’m getting”. It also sounded like something straight out of a flowchart from the sales training class of her “billion dollar company”.
Be human. Be authentic. When reaching to customers/businesses just use natural language. **People want to feel important.** If you speak to customers in cheap-car-salesman lingo, you’re not making them a priority. You might as well be a robot.



**4. When sending cold e-mails make it personal and straight to the point.**

Again, follow point number 3 especially when looking for cold leads via e-mail.

If your startup is B2B, make your e-mails to potential clients personal. Don’t make your e-mail seem like a canned response or template. Nobody likes that and most people will not read it. Remember, **people want to feel important**. Instead, tell them exactly why you *know* **they** will specifically benefit from your product/service.

Also, make the e-mail short and sweet. Don’t get into details about your product/service or attempt to sign them up immediately. Right now all you need to do is get them interested and set up a follow up call to talk more.
Try to make your e-mail super short. It shouldn’t look like a letter and it shouldn’t be more than 2–3 paragraphs of more than 2–3 short sentences each.

Get them interested. Talk details later.



**5. A 5-year old should be able to understand what you do.**

Without scrolling or clicking anything, your customer should at least have a clear idea of what your product/service is about within 15–20 seconds of visiting your website.

The attention span of a new customer can be very low so you should communicate your message in the simplest words possible. I learned somewhere (if I remember where, I’ll update this) that your landing page should be able to explain what you do to a 5 year old. I use this concept all the time when making landing pages. Here’s why:


Nobody has time to decipher your message. Give it to me straight.

Make it super simple. Here is how:

* Keep your message short.
* Use words that flow well together in a sentence (match syllable counts when possible). No, I’m not talking about making your website a rap song or haiku ;)
* Use words that even a non-native speaker of your language can understand.
* Do not use English phrasal verbs. Here is a [list of a few](https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/phrasal-verbs-list.htm). Not everyone understands what these may mean and a 5 year old probably won’t either.


BAD WORD CHOICE: establish

BETTER WORD CHOICE: prepare, create/make, build, deliver, give


BAD WORD CHOICE: come upon, identify

BETTER WORD CHOICE: find, explore, discover


If you’re not sure what alternative word to use, look up the word on thesaurus.com and keep it simple! :)

340,d6rc4w,False,,253,[NEWS] PayPal Decides To Keep Transaction Fees If You Process A Refund,Entrepreneur,"Super predatory practice going on at PayPal right now and the email they sent out is fucking really sneaky.

They decided to change their payment processing terms of service where if a customer needs a refund or to cancel an order if you refund them they keep the 3% transaction fee + 30 cents.

So if you sell a computer for $1000

Paypal would get $30

Let’s then say the customer decided they ordered the wrong item or found it cheaper elsewhere and they need to cancel.

Boom you just lost $30 for absolutely nothing!


Meaning essentially a competitor could come to you with PayPal and just place a ton of orders and cancel them to drain a you in fees just for fun!

Stop using PayPal if you aren’t already. No other payment processor does this it’s extremely predatory.

My name is Ryan Grant and I run an online retail business selling on Amazon, eBay, Jet.com, and our own websites.

Here's a screenshot taken this morning of our Amazon Sales dashboard: https://imgur.com/a/yYIKZ

Almost exactly 4 years ago I quit my job as an accountant to pursue selling online full time.  I have been selling online in some capacity since 2008 when I was a freshman in college, and it has been my full time business since September of 2013.  

I now have a team of 10 that help me run the business. The individuals on my team handle the bulk of the day to day operations and I am able to focus on how to grow the business.  

We source products via a variety of methods including retail arbitrage, online arbitrage, wholesale, as well as import products directly.  We now are focused primarily on growing the list of wholesale brands that we work with.  

I have documented my journey from quitting my job to growing this business on my website: www.onlinesellingexperiment.com.  For the first 21 months I shared all of my income reports breaking down exactly what was coming in and going out each month.  

Through the website I have also built up a consulting/coaching business that has grown to provide a nice additional income stream.  The onlinesellingexperiment site is monetized as well.  

I will be answering questions for the next couple of hours, and will check back periodically throughout the day as well to answer any additional questions that come in.

348,586ofh,False,,109,This Is Why I'm an Entrepreneur,Entrepreneur,"I recently started a full-service digital advertising agency. We build websites, run social media campaigns, make videos - if it's on the web, we do it. I'm not gonna lie - it's been pretty rough at times. I find myself wondering if I made the right decision in leaving my cushy 9-5. I've had to drastically change my lifestyle to make this work, and even then I'm barely staying afloat. 

This afternoon, a client and I were discussing a project we recently completed for him. When we kicked things off, we had agreed to make just one single overview video for his business, but after an initial draft and looking over the amount of footage we got, we collectively decided that breaking it up into 2 to 3 would deliver his message much more saliently. While on the phone, he told me to include whatever up-charge there was for breaking up the video into the final invoice. I told him no - this is what we agreed to, and delivering a quality product is more important to me than a extra few hundred dollars. I jokingly told him that as long as we move forward with a retainer agreement for us to handle all of his marketing, there's no need for an up-charge. 

He then told me: ""There's no if - we're absolutely moving forward with whatever retainer agreement you propose. You're the first person I've ever worked with in this space that I trust, and I know that you have my best interest at heart. You just tell me what you think we need and how much that is, and you got it.""

I'm not gonna lie, I got emotional. For a few seconds I couldn't even say anything. Everything I've been doing, everything I've poured into this business and the work I do for my clients, all of it was justified by just a few sentences. 

I started this business because I saw an opportunity to create a digital marketing company that people could trust. I was so sick of the bullshit my previous employers would pull; locking clients into unfair contracts and recommending different type of online work for the sake of the number on the proposal, not for what the business needed. This will probably come off as self righteous, but I believe that doing right by people is always going to benefit you in the long run. While that belief has been shaky these last few weeks, today completely reinforced it.  

Anyways, I just wanted to share my story. If you're feeling down about your business or aren't doing as well as you'd hoped, maybe my story will make you feel a little better. Never stop improving, never stop learning, and always consider your clients needs first.

199,axncm4,False,,152,15 lessons from our first $15 million in recurring revenue,Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit,

I wrote this post for my blog, but thought you might all find it interesting. Happy to answer any questions!

Last week we crossed $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) for ConvertKit, my email marketing company. My original dream was to get to $600,000 in ARR, so I'm pretty thrilled! Over the last six years I've learned and written about quite a few lessons, but it's always fun to reminisce on the highlights, that oddly enough mostly come from the hardest times.

## 1. Focus is everything

It's fine to start something on the side, but if you want to turn it something real it needs to move to the center of your focus. Years ago I decided to [go all in on ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/doubling-down-on-convertkit/), moving it from a side project to my only project.

Without that decision ConvertKit wouldn't be here today.

Anytime someone brags about how many businesses they run I cringe. I'd far rather take one thing and do it really well. I'll leave the serial entrepreneurship for the scattered, the wannabes, or those who are truly far more talented than I am.

A friend told me the other day that he was surprised I still only did ConvertKit. At this point we have an incredible team, available capital, and the leverage of an audience. Why not start something else and run it in parallel?

Because I know myself.

Focus is where I thrive. Focus is where I get results. Focus is everything.

## 2. Choose a niche

Choosing a niche is the easiest advice to give and the hardest advice to take. When you don't have traction, it feels like choosing a niche will exclude the few people who are coming in the door. In reality when we chose *""email marketing for professional bloggers""* everything changed.

Messaging became clear, the product roadmap was trimmed, and the prospect lists practically wrote itself.

Without that change—without excluding everyone who didn't fit into the blogger bucket—it would have been incredibly hard to get off the ground.

We eventually expanded to ""email marketing for creators,"" which now includes podcasters, actors, YouTubers, authors, artists, musicians, and so many more. Even with growing into that larger audience we are still so much more focused than our competitors who target all small-businesses.

## 3. Use sales to kickstart word-of-mouth

Word-of-mouth is the best way to grow a company, but you need traction for the referrals to start. That's where direct sales come in. By choosing a niche, listing out your prospects, and getting in touch directly you no longer have to wait for them to come to you.

Each conversation—even though most end in rejection—will teach you so much. At first it's one customer. Then five. Then ten.

Immediately you'll notice something crucial: the customers you recruit are higher quality than the ones who just walk in the door. Why would you leave the future of your product up to just anyone who stumbles across what you create?

Instead go out and sell to the customers you want. Then ask them for referrals. Finally, when the word-of-mouth referrals kick in, they will be to the right people.

## 4. Do the hard work that doesn't scale

Each sales call would end the same way: ""I love what you're doing and I'd love to switch...but it's too much work. Sorry.""

Ouch. No matter how much convincing I did I wasn't able to overcome that objection. That is until I offered to do the full switch for them for free.

That meant getting their account access, moving every form, copying and pasting every sequence email, exporting and importing their subscribers, and so much more! It was terribly unprofitable to do that for a $79/month customer. But early on that was how we got momentum. Every customer matters.

So many people told me that wasn't scalable. I needed to use paid ads, SEO, or some other scalable way to acquire customers. That's great if you can make them work, but many can't. So I did the work that no one else was willing to do.

John and Patrick Collison famously did this with Stripe. Rather than waiting to follow-up after a promising conversation, they would migrate other startups to Stripe on the spot.

Don't wait for the follow-up or have the customer do all the work. Do the hard work that doesn't scale.

Today we still offer a free concierge migration for anyone over 5,000 email subscribers. Many of our competitors have copied it and offer it as well.

It feels good to make them react to us.

## 5. Find what works and repeat it

Webinars were the first scalable growth channel we found that really worked. My first thought was to do those and keep searching for the next thing...but then I realized that we should focus on what's working. We test and iterate like crazy, but then once it pays off we go all in.

Over the last three years we've done hundreds of webinars with an incredible number of affiliate partners. They are hard, time consuming, and exhausting. But they work.

Run all the experiments. Test. Analyze the data. The when you find something that works be prepared to go all in.

## 6. Building infrastructure to support growth will take far longer than estimated

We spent our first company retreat fighting fires and rebuilding our server infrastructure. What was supposed to be a time to just connect, plan, and get to know each other turned into an all hands on deck fight to keep our product online.

I thought we'd spend nearly all our time building cool new features for customers. But instead the work was in doing what customers care about most: making sure the basics work well. Emails need to send on time and subscriptions need to work flawlessly.

There's a lot of software that when it goes down, you just work on something else. Not email marketing. It's core to the entire business and reliability is everything.

The infrastructure that was built to support 1,000 customers will break at 10,000. It's crucial to dedicate time to support the growth.

## 7. Funding is optional

Right about now we should be raising a $25 million series A. Or at least that's what our peers are doing. Instead we haven't raised a single dime of outside capital. I put in $5,000 to kick things off, then another $50,000 when I doubled down on ConvertKit.

Getting rejected by venture capitalists is one of the best things that's ever happened to me.

We built ConvertKit our way, at our pace, and with our values. Every line of code is funded by the creators we serve. I wouldn't have it any other way.

## 8. It's possible with a smaller team than most people think

Today at ConvertKit we have 38 amazing team members. At $15 million ARR that is nearly $400,000 per team member! A much higher ratio than any of our peers. At this stage 75 employees would be normal.

Instead of hiring as quickly as possible to solve every pain, we are deliberate about working on the right things. The constraint requires us to say no, not spread ourselves thin, and only do the highest leverage work.

It also means that we can invest in each team member more and carefully craft the culture we want, rather than simply focus on reaching headcount goals.

There are always tradeoffs, maybe we could move faster, build more, or support customers better. So we are still striving to find the right balance between team size, efficiency, and total output.

## 9. Culture is everything—and it's not what you think

We have so many weird habits as a team at ConvertKit: talking about someone in the third person as if they're not there, long walks in pairs where only one person is allowed to talk, starting meetings by asking, ""red, yellow, or green?"" and diving directly into the hard conversations.

That's because to us culture isn't bean bag chairs and free lunch, but instead an environment where conflict is kind and direct, expectations are clear, and trust is most important.

Our version of culture has turned ConvertKit into a place that we all want to come to work.

## 10. Share the profits

There are two important factors for running ConvertKit as a financially efficient company:

1. **Transparent financials.** Every dollar spent is visible to the entire company through our open books.
2. **Profit sharing.** We share more than 50% of the profit in the company with the entire team.

The result is that everyone is incentivized to spend money efficiently.

We once asked the team: ""would you rather go to San Diego or Costa Rica for the next team retreat?""

Everyone said Costa Rica.

So we did the research and found that Costa Rica would cost about 50% more because of higher housing costs and additional travel logistics. With the complete picture we asked the team again.

This time San Diego won by a landslide.

That attitude carries over to everyone when they use their company credit card. It's not just the company's money, it's their money. And they spend it accordingly.

In the last few years we've distributed over $1,000,000 to the team in profit sharing. All while spending aggressively on growth. That's a number I'm really proud of!

## 11. Always pay your debts

No, I'm not talking about Game of Thrones, or even financial debt. There's another kind of debt more devastating to software companies: technical debt.

The code that worked fine at $15,000 in revenue looks like a joke at $15 million. Not to say you should have spent the time to build it perfectly from the beginning—that's a fools game to try—but instead that every shortcut you take is building more debt. The longer you wait the more interest accrues.

We've had to spend a significant of time and money refactoring all of that old code. It's part of scaling. Every software company has to do it, but it would be so frustrating if we didn't expect it and have a plan to pay it back systematically.

## 12. As you grow, your company’s name builds equity. Don’t take that for granted.

For years I've wanted to build ConvertKit into a global brand and I thought that meant changing the name to something more brandable. While being focused on this new change I completely missed the trust, care, and love our customers had for the name ConvertKit.

You just quietly enjoy the status quo. People only talk about what they want to change. It would be weird to send an email to Patagonia saying, ""I really love your name, please don't change it.""

So when we would receive emails every month from creators who thought ConvertKit was too salesy and they didn't want to be associated with the brand, that wasn't balanced by all the people who had quietly grown to love our name and the brand it represented.

Ultimately we decided to stay as ConvertKit, which is a long story that I promise I'll write in full at some point.

## 13. You don’t have to be an asshole to build a successful company

Being an asshole is *one* way *some* entrepreneurs have been able to build big companies. Assholes are often loud about their own success, so we hear about them more than we should. But there are a bunch of good people building exciting companies too. Good people who care for their team, their family, and their customers.

Ignore the entrepreneur media.

Don’t be an asshole and don’t settle for working for one.

## 14. Surprise launches aren't worth it

A surprise launch or release is fun for you… until it isn’t.

I love having my Steve Jobs moment by unveiling a new feature to the applause of a crowd. I've done it the last two years at our conference, [Craft + Commerce](http://conference.convertkit.com/). But behind each of those moments is weeks or months of pushing hard to make a deadline. Trimming the project scope, reprioritizing backlogs, and hoping that everything goes well in the live demo.

But that's only part of it. What follows is releasing to customers, which is really painful if you missed the mark on any of your designs, planning, or timelines. That means a ton of tickets in the support queue, frustrated users, and losing confidence in the product.

Now we've moved away from launching these big surprises. Instead we work with smaller groups of customers to understand how a new product or change will affect them. Then we use that information to build a smarter launch and rollout plan. A plan that usually involves methodically rolling out to a few features at once.

We're still be able to make a splash, but we are able to do it with more confidence and a lot less stress.

## 15. I felt most successful after the hardest decisions

While skiing a few weeks ago my friend [Anthony](https://www.breakthetwitch.com/) asked the group, ""do you feel successful?"" It was a great question to reflect on while riding the chairlift. I'm always striving to learn more and grow the company, so it's foreign to pause and feel success. That feels like settling when I know I'm capable of more.

Overall, I do feel successful, but I was surprised to realize the moments I felt most successful weren't after hitting a major revenue milestone or landing a famous customer.

In hindsight, the times I felt most successful were when I leaned on my principles to make the right decision, even though it was incredibly hard.

Letting a senior leader go. Rolling back a name change I'd worked on for two years. Restructuring the company.

I wrestled with each one. Struggling to have the courage to make the decision I knew was right. But with principles to guide me I could make the decision with confidence.

To me success knows that I've built the courage to make the right decision, especially when it is painful and expensive.

900,f87yc6,False,,56,The Dracula Strategy: Generating B2B leads on LinkedIn by leeching the network of influencers.,Entrepreneur,"Hello guys,

I'm a growth marketer and my expertise is content. I'm doing this strategy on LinkedIn recently and getting a lot of traffic to my blog. Even got some hot leads out of it with zero budget.

It's a very short and potent 3-step strategy. Here I go.

\--

With Linkedin came new influencers and experts. Whatever industry you are in, it has, for sure, an influencer that inspires your audience.

These people are super influential. For Growth Marketers, they’re precious resources to spot audiences that are active on LinkedIn.

What if you can tap into this audience and surround yourself with them? It would be easier for you to open conversations, get engagement and create new business opportunities, right?

This is what our Dracula strategy is all about. Generating leads on LinkedIn by leeching the network of influencers.

# Three bites of Dracula: 

The Dracula strategy is an easy to execute strategy compared to our other playbooks. You have three steps to follow.

1. Find the vessel.
2. Feast on the comments.
3. Steer the attention.

# Step #1: How to find a vessel?

You need to find the most famous person in your industry. You know that type. When they post content, they get engagement showers. 

And that’s what we’re looking for. Mainly comments.

This person is an influencer or your competitor in your industry. And thanks to LinkedIn, finding them is easy. 

All you have to do is to know your audience’s problems. The keywords that they’re already searching for on Google to find answers to their problems. Our keyword will be “LinkedIn marketing” this time.

Go to LinkedIn search and click on content.

Then type your keyword and click. You'll see a list of people with hell a lot of engagement.

I have 900ish comments (total of 5 different posts) in here sitting in front of me. 900 people that potentially will be interested in your LinkedIn marketing service or product.

These people share content daily. They could be gold mines for your business and this is the beauty of growth marketing here. Even if you don’t have the resources and an army of employees, you can still outsmart your competitors.

This was our 30 seconds quick search. You can go more in-depth with different keywords and find influencers in your niche. 

But you got the idea. Now we’re hungry, let’s head to the feast of generating leads on LinkedIn.

# #2: Feast on the comments.

Here you’ll scrape all the profiles in the comment section of the LinkedIn post. If you don’t know how to scrape here is a video crash course:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23e1RHpE5iQ&t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23e1RHpE5iQ&t=10s)

Note: Dataminer sometimes doesn’t work on LinkedIn pages. We don’t know the reason but the solution is to create a new user in your Google Chrome.

After you scrape the comments, you’ll have all the profile URLs. Keep in mind, you can also scrape the people who liked the post if you want to reach more people.

But people who commented are more qualified because they’re engaged with the topic and have an active user status on LinkedIn.

Now, what are you going to do with all these comments? 

# #3: Steer the attention

What is your goal? You can redirect the attention however you like.

* Do you want to promote your SaaS product?
* Do you want to use these people as a traffic source?
* Do you want to make people download your eBook?
* Or do you want to send them your presentation?

You can do anything you want. In our last campaign, I've sent our latest blog post to 1300 people. We used it as our content distribution channel.

We provided a free playbook. But in the playbook, there were CTAs to our products and other eBooks. And it performed well.

We got a little organic traffic jam on the website, had dozens of qualified leads and two customers. All with zero budget.

If you’re a small business with no to low site traffic, you can do the same. 

There are two approaches to send messages. 

**#1: Pull approach**

Here is the message I wrote

>Hey ""Name"",  
I saw you commented on X's post about LinkedIn lead generation. I'm also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with likeminded people like you. Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, let me know if you want to read it.

**Why is this message so effective?**

*“I saw you commented on “X” post about LinkedIn lead generation.”*

It makes my message more credible and personal. We share similarities and I’m using it to my advantage.

*“I’m also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with like-minded people like you.”*

I’m straightforward here. That’s true I want to learn more and expand my network with people that share the same goals.

*Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, let me know if you want to read it.*

This is where I pull. Yes, I wrote something for him but I’ll not throw it to his face. I’ll not enter his territory before he let me in.

Here you give an option to the other party to accept you. And once you let them decide and don’t cross the boundaries, people are kind.

This respectful approach is a good first step to maintain a relationship and start the conversation. 

The result? He liked it and shared the article with his WhatsApp group.

After this point, you can proceed to the next steps. You can ask him if he wants to join the weekly newsletter etc.

With this approach, you need to follow up manually to send the link afterward. 

**#2: Push approach**

With the push approach, you don’t need to follow up manually because you’ll share the link with the first message. Like this.

*Hey Jason,*

*I saw you commented on X’s post about LinkedIn lead generation. I’m also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with like-minded people like you.*

*Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, if you would like to read here is the link.*

[*www*](http://www/)*. blahblah. com*

This looks a bit more spammy and can backfire. But then you can automatically send all of the links and don’t have to look back.

**3 compelling message templates for your next campaign**

**1. Salesy and honest reach out**

This is a straight forward message about your intention. People usually accept this kind of invitation because you’re not trying to sell anything to them.

Here is a message template we shared before, which is pretty personal and honest. Ready to be sent.

*Hey #firstName#,*

*Sorry to message you out of the blue. I have this idea that solves X problem for content marketers. I’m trying to connect some like-minded people to talk and get feedback.*

*Would love to know what you think of the idea. Please let me know if you’re interested.*

You can customize this message a bit to your taste and needs. Then you can send your free trial, eBook, service, product, landing page, briefly anything you want.

Or you can push the link in the same message. Our personal favorite is the pull approach though. 

It definitely takes more time with manual work. However, it’s definitely not a waste but an investment.

**2. Straightforward reach out**

This is a straightforward message about your intention. People usually accept this kind of invitation because you’re not trying to sell anything to them.

Hey #firstName#,

I hope you’re having a great day. 

I’m trying to learn more about content marketing and expand my LinkedIn network. Right now, I’m looking for smart and like-minded people on LinkedIn to follow, learn from and exchange ideas.

I thought it would be great to be your connection,

**3. Promise valuable content for them**

Hey #firstName#,

I’m trying to be more active on LinkedIn and connect with like-minded people. I’m planning to share unique content about “X” every week. As a content marketer, I thought you could find some value in them.

Would you like to stay in touch and exchange ideas?

Lastly, add them as your connection and send the message with Phantombuster. 

[Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/) is my favorite growth hacking tool. You can scrape data, add people, like, comment or message your prospects on different social platforms all automated.

(You can use it for free btw)

Here we’ll use it to add people and send them automated messages.

You have two options here.

1. LinkedIn Network Booster phantom: with that phantom, you can add and message your prospects. But you can only add 80 people per day.

 2. LinkedIn Message Sender phantom: You can send hundreds of messages but you can’t add them.

It's quite simple to use. Just go to the desired Phantom and follow the instructions.

After you chose one all you need to do is to paste that spreadsheet that you have from Dataminer. Then customize your message.

Note: Don’t forget the write the name of the column that contains the LinkedIn profiles in the Dataminer spreadsheet to “Column name from which to get profile URL’s”. That will indicate Phantombuster where to extract data.

Don’t forget the daily limit. Set it to 10 people per launch and 8 times a day.

Run your phantom and get ready to generate leads on LinkedIn.

This is it.

The Dracula Strategy is a flexible one. What you can do is all up to your end-goal and creativity.

373,flym8l,False,How to Grow,72,We just compiled a huge list of learning resources for digital marketing. We thought this sub would appreciate it!,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys! With the whole self-isolation thing going on, it’s an awesome time to learn a new skill (or ten). I've been hoarding some of the best guides / resources on digital marketing for the past \~5 years or so, and recently decided to transform it into a guide.

To make it an awesome read, I also created learning paths for most of the digital marketing channels. So, it's not like, ""go read 4835 articles,"" but more like, ""Read A, then B, then C,"" and so on.

Enjoy!

# Before we start talking about specific channels, though, let's discuss HOW you can learn digital marketing best.

 First things first - you need to decide which channel to start with.

If you have a knack for writing, we’d recommend going with **Content Marketing** or **Copywriting**. On the other hand, if you’re more analytics-oriented, go for **Search Ads** or **PPC**.

As a given, you DON’T have to learn all the channels. You can just pick one that you like, and specialize in it!

Once you’ve decided on which channel to roll with, you should also establish a learning methodology.

As with most things in life, reading on digital marketing won’t take you far. You need to also put everything into practice.

We usually recommend going with one of these 4 options: 

1. **Create a test learning environment**. Basically, you create a website for a basic product or service (heck, even a blog would do!), and start applying whatever you learned about digital marketing to get leads and customers. Even if you have ZERO budget, this can be an interesting learning experience. And yes - it’s possible to start w/ a zero budget. 
2. **Get an internship**. This can be a bit painful if you’re in the middle of your current career, but hey, swallow the pride. If you do your best, you’ll be doing some real work 6 months after the internship.
3. **Offer a local business to help them with marketing for free**. Find a business you think you can help in your area and reach out to them! 
4. [**Create an affiliate blog**](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/affiliate-marketing-blogs/299053/). Pick a niche, create an affiliate blog, and start pumping out some content. This is mainly relevant if you want to learn SEO or content marketing.

And here’s what you ***SHOULD NOT DO***:

>*Read a guide or two, buy a course, whip out your own website, repurpose the course and start pretending to be a marketing expert to potential clients.* 

There’ are way too many people doing this as-is. Please stop! You’re setting yourself up for failure. 

You’d be surprised how many people we see on Facebook Ads groups asking, *“hey guys, I closed my first client, now how the heck do I deliver on my promises?”*

...Now that we got that out of the way, let’s get to learning some digital marketing!

# How to learn content marketing 

Most traditional advertising channels are focused on directly selling a  product. If you turn on the TV, you’ll see a TON of ads for this product, or that product or service.

Content marketing is a form of indirect advertisement.

The idea here is, instead of directly pitching your product to your target audience, you create content (article, video, infographic, etc.) around the problem your product solves, and pitch that instead.

To make this a LOT clearer, here’s a practical example.

Let’s say you’re a marketing agency that specializes in helping SaaS companies with their digital marketing (meta, right?).

Instead of directly running ads yelling “We help SaaS companies!” you create a mega-guide on the topic and advertise that.

...Which is what we did.

We created a mega-guide to [SaaS marketing](https://apollodigital.io/blog/saas-marketing) and promoted the hell out of it all over the web. This netted us around \~10,000+ traffic and 15+ leads in the first week, and we STILL get traffic to the piece, 2 months later.

We even posted it on this sub and got around 600 upboats.

Sweet, right? 

Now, you’re probably wondering, is this option better than just running ads to your service / product?

Yes, yes it is. Here’s why:

1. **It’s free (ish).** The only resources it took was our time to write the post, edit it, and promote it. Ads, on the other hand, can be super expensive.

**It builds your brand authority.** Who’d you trust with your marketing? A random guy that popped up on your Facebook newsfeed, or the guys that wrote the most comprehensive guide to SaaS marketing you’ve ever read? Exactly! 

If you want to learn how to do content marketing, here's what we recommend:   


1. **First, learn the basics.** You can find a ton of online courses or articles on this. Here are some of our favorites:
   1. [HubSpot’s Academy content marketing course](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-marketing)
   2. Neil Patel’s guide to [content marketing basics](https://neilpatel.com/what-is-content-marketing/)

   2. How [Mint grew to 1.5 million users](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-mint-grew/) (a big chunk of the credit goes to content marketing) 

### Learn SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is another super popular digital marketing channel.

In a nutshell, SEO is the act of optimizing your web pages and content for Google so that your website pops up when people look up certain terms.

For example, let’s say you’re a project management software. Would it benefit you if you popped up #1 when people Google for your keyword?

Yes, yes it would. You’d be getting **highly qualified** leads for your software every day, for free, with ZERO ad spend.

Cool, right?

Here’s what an SEO specialist does on a daily basis:

* **Content Creation** \- Create SEO content (or work with freelance writers)
* **On-page SEO** \- Make sure that all content on the blog is optimized for Google and interlinked to each other 
* **Technical SEO** \- Make sure that the web dev team is following SEO best practices when working on the website
* **SEO Strategy** \- Doing keyword research and finding new web pages and content to create
* **Link-building** \- Conducting link-building (or supervising outreach specialists).

331,9hd5f7,False,Case Study,136,How I got 48 YouTubers to agree to review my product,Entrepreneur,"I previously wrote about an [experiment where I spent $13,867 on YouTube ads](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/what-i-learned-advertising-on-youtube) promoting Candy Japan, a Japanese candy subscription box I run. Many suggested that instead of spending money on ads, I should have just sent samples to YouTubers to get them to cover the service for free.

That was a good suggestion, so I decided to try it and do a writeup here (and also [as a blog post](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/ab-testing-contacting-youtubers)) about the results.

## Gathering a contact list

Being new at this, I decided to start by contacting a larger number of small YouTube channels to learn what kind of an approach would work the best. 

I assumed the response rate would be low, so I would need to find a lot of channels to contact. I wanted them to be relevant to people with a strong interest in Japan, and after several evenings of work managed to put together a list of several hundred small cosplay channels. At this point I only had their channel URL, but no way to contact them.

Many list their email address directly in their YouTube profile, while others only have a link to their Tumblr page for example. That page might then link to their other social media profiles, one of which might eventually have a way to contact them. Besides just finding an email address, I also wanted to find names. I read all channel descriptions and watched the beginning of video introductions to make sure I was addressing each recipient appropriately. 

This was mind-numbing work that took me close to 10 minutes per channel initially. It's also distracting work in that I needed to spend a lot of time on YouTube and in various social networks without getting sidetracked. To be able to focus, I turned it into a little game for myself. How fast can I go through the next 20 channels? What can I do to improve my time? In the end I had improved enough that I was able to find the name and contact information for a channel in less than 2 minutes.

A little setback happened along the way: [Google removed private messaging from YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955?vid=0-997051002115-1537321334743).

I had hoped to use YouTube private messages as a fallback for channels that don't list their email address anywhere. Just as I thought that I had gathered enough channels to contact, private messaging became impossible, and I had to redouble my efforts to make up for all the channels that had now become unreachable.

In the end I had a spreadsheet of 180 cosplay YouTubers with a way to contact each. The average channel in the list has less than 4000 subscribers, with a total of 664k subscribers – power law at play here, combined these roughly match a single popular YouTuber in impact. I wasn't sure if a tiny channel could send enough sales to exceed the cost of sending them a sample, but if it did, that would scale nicely as I could keep sending more and more samples to similar channels. 

### A/B testing message content

I decided to amuse myself with a little multivariate test and send everyone a slightly different message to learn what works best. 

#### Choosing a title

I tried two different subject lines for the email, but the difference was minor. The worse one turned out to be ```""Want a Japanese candy review box?""``` and the slightly better one ```""Free Candy Japan sample for unboxing video""```. Of the people who received the former, 25% agreed to do a review. Of the latter, 28.26%. 

#### Message body

I started each message with:

```
Dear so-and-so,

Would you like to receive a Japanese candy review box for your YouTube channel?
```

I created five snippets of text, randomly including them in the messages I sent out. Below you can see each snippet, along with what the response rate was when each was absent or present. 

**Snippet 1: clarifying what I want them to do**

```
I was hoping that if I send you two boxes, you could unbox and try the candies and introduce the service to your subscribers.
```

With the above snippet included, 29.55% agreed to do a review. Without it, 23.91% agreed. Takeaway: be clear about what you expect people to do for you.

**Snippet 2: longer self-introduction**

```
I run a site called Candy Japan, which sends surprise boxes of Japanese sweets to members twice a month.
```

With the above included 27.63% agreed, without 25.96% did. Takeaway: including an elevator pitch of your service may help.

**Snippet 3: appealing to popularity**

```
These types of ""trying Japanese candy"" videos tend to be very popular, many having millions of views. 
```

With the above included 24.72% agreed, without 28.57% did. Takeaway: don't be patronizing?

**Snippet 4: offering their viewers a discount**

```
I can also give your viewers a discount coupon.
```

With the above included 27.38% agreed, without 26.04% did. Takeaway: it doesn't really matter if you offer a discount or not. In the end I still gave everyone a discount coupon anyway.

**Snippet 5: call-to-action**

```
If you would like to receive a review box, please let me know your mailing address.
```

This had the highest impact: with the above included 21.11% agreed, without 32.22% did. Note that even without this line, in the end everyone still gave me their mailing address, so this only means that it's better not to ask for it right away. 

I can think of two reasons for this. Either people need a bit more back-and-forth before parting with such personal information, or possibly it's just more work to reply to this email, so more people will think ""I'll reply later"", and then forget about it.

**Include image or not?**

Another variation I tried was attaching [an image of the Japanese candy](http://www.candyjapan.com/static/candy_japan_october_2017.jpg) I might send them. I expected this to be a no-brainer in that having the picture would be better, but this actually turned out not to matter. Out of those who got the image 26.97% agreed vs. 26.37% for those who did not get it. 

My guess here is that it may actually be beneficial to have the image, but that it is balanced out by more of these emails ending up classified as spam.

## Overall response rate

I sent out 180 messages, and guessed that perhaps a dozen people would agree to do a review. In the end 48 YouTubers sent me their shipping address. Only 5 people outright refused to do a review, and even they still wrote polite responses. 

Having 26.67% agree to do a review was a much higher rate than I had imagined, and I ended up annoying my wife by having a larger than expected pile of samples in our apartment. I was taking the samples to the post office by bicycle. For some reason it takes close to 30 minutes for the local post office to process each batch ([pic](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/pile_of_boxes_at_japan_post.jpg)), the UI in their POS must be pretty terrible.

One wrong assumption I had was that more popular YouTubers would be harder to get to agree to do a review. Splitting my list of YouTubers evenly into ""less popular"" and ""more popular"" groups of less or more than 2290 subscribers, the agree rates were 27.78% and 25.56% respectively – a difference of only two more YouTubers agreeing in the less popular group.

## Thanks for reading

It is a fair amount of work to find enough relevant YouTubers to contact, to correspond with them and to actually ship samples.

If you need to ship a YouTuber a physical product sample, don't ask for their address until after they have replied to the initial email. Include an elevator pitch of your service and be clear what you want them to do in the video.

With this approach when contacting relevant less popular YouTubers, you may expect around 30% of recipients to agree to do a review.

I have now sent out most sample boxes, but not everyone has made their videos yet. It will also take some time to know how popular the videos will turn out to be. I will post again once I have data on how many sales these videos actually resulted in. Until then 👋

911,8diejt,False,Case Study,106,"8 months and $547,600 in revenue. Overview of starting my own freight brokerage.",Entrepreneur,"For people not involved in transportation & shipping, a freight broker is an intermediary between a shipper who has goods to transport and a trucking company who has capacity to move their product from point A to point B.

&nbsp;


**Background** 
I’ve worked for 7 years in freight brokerage prior to starting my own shop and I was able to manage the department and moderately grow from $100,00 per year in gross revenue to 15 million in my final year. I was lucky enough to have a great mentor and hardworking coworkers and gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and wherewithal in the industry. The summer of 2017, I was getting burnt out from the hours and travel, so I decided this would be the best time for me to try this on my own and see if I could make it work without a large asset based transportation company supporting me.

On July 31st, I gave my notice and the next day started the LLC.

&nbsp;


**Setting up** 
For as many rules and regulations the federal and state governments put on transportation, it was a surprisingly quick and simple process for an industry that is heavily regulated. I formed an LLC, applied for the brokerage authority through DOT and purchased a brokerage bond and insurance. From the day I quit to officially open for business was 10 days.

&nbsp;


Our costs for initial setup was $4,490.52 (insurance, bond authority, LLC, software) and our recurring expenses (dispatching software, insurance, phones, etc.) is $770.00 per month. As a new transportation provider with no history of credit, I had to partner with a factoring company so that we could pay our transportation carriers immediately so I wouldn’t have to wait 30-45 days to get paid from our customers and to then pay them. They take 3.75% off of the gross revenue for each invoice but I am hopeful sometime in 2019 to ditch the factoring company and use my own cash flow to manage AR & AP.

&nbsp;


**Monthly Revenue**
(Aug 1st – March 31st)

I wasn’t required to sign a non-solicitation agreement at my prior company, so I was free to target and work with who I wanted and knew. Unfortunately I misjudged how much pressure my former employer would use against all customers that I had previously worked with, and after the 2nd month, none of my accounts that I brought with me were using me for fear of losing the services of my previous company. After a year in business I will have the opportunity to win some of those accounts back but I am moving forward with the mindset that they are lost forever. 

I am slowly building up new customers and exploring ways to get my name out there. 

Revenue | August | September | October | November | December | January | February | March  
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Gross | $50,800 | $205,000 | $52,100 | $36,400 | $50,800 | $62,300 | $42,900 | $47,300
Net | $6,900 | $29,500 | $7,200 | $5,500 | $5,500 | $6,200| $8,100 | $5,400

Since Merch by Amazon (the program I was using in the old post), is still on lockdown, I am going to show you step by step how to take graphics/designs, and sell them on Amazon on 10’s if not 100 different kind of items by using the new Shopify Amazon integration combined with print on demand services to fulfill your orders. This means you can take action TODAY.

Before any of you get on your pedestal about self promotion, yes, this did come from the [Merch Informer blog](https://merchinformer.com/shopify-amazon-merch-no-inventory-integration-guide/), and yes you can do this method I am about to lay out for you 100% without using any tools. If you want to learn something, continue reading. If not, continue on with your day. Let’s do it.

**What Is Merch?**

If you have been reading what I have been posting this last year, you may be thinking about Merch by Amazon where the focus was just t-shirts. Merch, however, goes a lot more broad than that. This can include anything from funny novelty t-shirts to flags you hang on your wall, to the yoga pants that are worn to the gym and everything in between.

If you have sold on Amazon before, or pushed t-shirts and realized how many customers you have access to, then you know how lucrative it can be. Shirts are just the tip of the iceberg though. If you could start selling beach towels, coffee mugs, yoga pants, flags, and any other type of merch without ever seeing or touching inventory on Amazon, imagine how your earnings would explode overnight.

**Why Merch?**

[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png)

As you can see from the image above, Amazon is doing it’s very best to capture as much market share as it can. That is literally all they care about, grow bigger than everyone else! At the very end of 2015, they opened yet another program to attempt to take over another sector of the market: Merch by Amazon. This program was aimed at dominating the print on demand (POD) niche, and it was an overnight success.

This program allowed everyday people and designers like you and I to put up original artwork and funny says on novelty t-shirts and sell them to Amazon customers without ever dealing with customer support or touching the actual product. Amazon sold, packaged, and shipped your products and gave the designer a royalty. Earnings from early adopters were absolutely massive and in some cases into the 100’s of thousands of dollars.

Unfortunately, Amazon did not expect the monster growth of the Merch by Amazon program and quickly turned it into an invite only program. Recently they have been processing so many orders that they have completely stopped accepting people to the program and people who do have an account are not allowed to publish or are allowed to publish with restrictions.

[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png)

You can see that if you want to make money online by selling apparel, you NEED to be selling on Amazon. There is really no other way around it. By 2020 they are going to be absolutely dominating the online market place and you have the chance to be a part of it.

With Merch by Amazon closed to the public, and not wanting to deal with shipping items from China or dealing with a print shop for every order, what can be done?

Fulfillment by Amazon is an option, but from our experience, not a very good good one. You would have to buy the products a head of time and send them to a ware house. With Merch by Amazon, we clearly know that selling Merch hands off is the way to go!

**Use Shopify To Sell Your Merch!**

Many of you reading this are at least familiar with Shopify as a content management system and online store payment processor. From here, you will be able to put your products up for sale and sell them to customers who visit your site.

With recent changes and Shopify integrating with Amazon, this 100% the way to go. Why?

You will have access to not only T-shirts but….

* 	Tank Tops
* 	Phone Cases
* 	Beach Towels
* 	Coffee Mugs
* 	Cutting Boards
* 	Stickers
* 	Long Sleeves
* 	Hoodies
* 	Dog Bowls
* 	Flags
* 	Blankets
* 	Mouse Pads
* 	Shower Curtains

and much more!

Are you starting to see the big picture here? You can take the artwork that you created for shirts or other mediums, and turn a single image into 10s if not hundreds of different products that you will sell ON Amazon.com. No more handling inventory or trying to drive traffic to your store anymore.

This is going to be a long one, so strap in, and let’s go over step by step on how to set up everything so you are no longer held back by Merch limits.

**Shopify Amazon Print On Demand Method**

To make this method work for you, you are going to need 4 things.

* Understand Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank) and what sells best on Amazon
* Designs/Artwork
* Amazon Seller Account
* Shopify Account

Let’s go over how I get everything set up and then we will tie them all together.

**Understanding What Sells on Amazon (Best Sellers Rank)**

The very first thing you need to do before you start your journey is understand what sells best on Amazon, how to spot these items, and how to properly research the different niches you want to create merch around. There are two very key aspects that you need to have a solid understanding of to have any success. These are Amazon BSR or Best Sellers Rank, and the second is understanding Copyright/Trademark.

**Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank)**

Every single product that is sold on Amazon has something in the product information called the Best Sellers Rank or Amazon BSR. It will look very similar to this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BSR.png

The BSR is a representation of how well that item is selling in its respective category. The smaller the number, the more items they are selling. The higher number, the fewer items they are selling. For example, if a shirt were to hit number 1 in clothing, it would be the most popular shirt selling on Amazon.

From my experience selling, a BSR of around 100,000 in clothing equates to around 1 sale per day. This is not set in stone, but 100k BSR is usually what I focus my sites on when doing niche research.

**Copyright/Trademark**

You also need to have a full understanding that you are not allowed to infringe on someone else’s copyright or trademarks. This means that you are NOT allowed to simply copy someones design and put it up on another piece of merchandise. Doing so would be breaking copyright laws.

If someone has a particular saying in their artwork that is selling particularly well, they might decide to trademark that term. This would mean that you are NOT allowed to use this term in any of your designs even if it looks completely different.

Copyright and Trademark are both different beasts so make sure you are not infringing on someone else’s intellectual property. A lot of times, you might put something up on Amazon which then gets trademarked later on down the road. They can then use this trademark to come after you and the items you put up causing infractions and an entire mess. If you have thousands of products up like we do, this can be almost impossible to keep track of. If you are at all concerned about this, make sure you are checking daily.

**Getting Designs/Artwork**

When I first started, I created some designs myself. Since I am not a designer by trade, this took a lot of my time up and I had to actually watch some tutorials on YouTube to make sure I was using Photoshop correctly. Once I saw just how well my designs were selling on Amazon, I started to scale up very quickly and this meant getting a designer (or 5), on board to start cranking out original designs. 

Finding a good designer can be extremely hard. You want one that you can count on to be on time, every time. You also want a designer that has some integrity and will be original when you send them ideas. I have managed to hire my entire team of designers at full time for $4 per design each. This may just be personal experience but a lot of them from the Philippines and this really ads up to a great wage in that part of the world.

I have found excellent success by using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com). Upwork is a marketplace to post jobs you are interested in completing and then hiring freelancers. Below is the script that I used to hire each one of my designers.

Hey, I am in need of 400 t-shirt designs in the time period of 2-3 months.

> Your task will be pretty basic, I will send you ideas of t-shirts I want to make and you make them yourself in your own unique style. For example, I might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and I would need you to be inspired by it and create a better version that is in your own creative style.
> 
> I will leave a lot of 5* reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a long-term position. Once we have done the first batch of 400 – around 4 per day, we could continue if everything looks good.
> 
> I look forward to doing business with you!

This works well for me because I always have a lot of designs for them to do because I am quickly scaling up so they will have some long term work from me. It also works well because a lot of very talented people are new to the Upwork platform and are trying to build up their profile to find other jobs. Lots of great reviews from you as a satisfied client can help them in this journey. What this means for you is that they are going to put the best effort forward in order to earn those 5 stars.

**Quick Note: Weeding Out Bad Designers**

When I first tried to hire someone to design for me, they stole images and straight up copied designs. This is wrong, and will get your Merch account banned. I was not able to use any of these designs.

When I first hired someone, I let them know that they cannot use any images which are Copyrighted, or infringe on any Copyright someone else owns.

Then, I will send them a T-Shirt idea that is very clearly Copyright infringement. If they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use, I will immediately get rid of that designer (and that design). The design may have cost me $4, but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats!

**Amazon Seller Account**

The next piece of the puzzle that you are going to need is is an Amazon seller account.

This will ask you to sign into your Amazon account and if you do not have one already, simply sign up for one.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sign-up-for-Amazon.png

Once you are signed up and logged in, there are few things you are going to want to do.
First you will want to navigate to the upper right hand corner to “Settings” and then Account Information. It will bring you to a page that looks like this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/information.png

Fill out the Deposit information so that you are going to get paid, and the tax information. Feel free to change any of the other information but for now all that you need to change is how you get paid, and the tax information.

Next, navigate to the left hand corner of that page where you should see a “Your Services” box.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png

Click on Manage and then upgrade your account to a Professional Account.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png

This offers you multiple benefits. It will cost you $39.99 a month, but…

* 	No $0.99 Closing Fee for each item sold, only a monthly $39.99 subscription fee, referral fees and variable closing fees
* 	Ability to collect US sales and use taxes on your orders
* 	Customize your shipping rates and services levels for all products (except Books, Music, Videos and DVDs)
* 	Manage your inventory using feeds, spreadsheets, and reports
* 	Manage orders using order reports and order-related feeds
* 	Access Amazon Marketplace Web Service to upload feeds, receive reports, and perform other API functions
* 	Ability to offer Promotions and Gift Services
* 	Eligibility for Featured Merchant status and listing placement in the Buy Box.

Simply put, If you are selling more than 40 pieces of merchandise a month, you are much better off get a pro account so you have higher profit margins. For this method to work with shopify, a Pro account is REQUIRED.

**Shopify Account**

Getting a Shopify account is extremely easy and they have a 14 day FREE trial.
Head on over to [Shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com/) and click on the get started box in the upper right hand corner.
 
You will then just need to fill out your email address, password, and the store name you want to create.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/set-up-shopify-store.png

Click on the big green create your store button and Shopify will start setting itself up.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-a-store-300x177.png

**Connecting Shopify and Amazon For No Inventory Fulfillment**

Now that you have a fancy new Shopify store for free for the next 14 days, it is time to start taking advantage of what it has to offer. At first, your store will look just like this when you log in.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brand-new-created-store-1024x631.png

In the lower hand corner, you will see “Apps”. Click on this.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apps.png

What we are looking for here is an App that will fulfill all your orders for you. This is how we are going to print on demand without holding any inventory ourselves.

Search for Teelaunch. It will bring up the page for this app that looks like this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-app.png

Click on the big green “get” button to install this app. You will need to quickly confirm that you want to install it on your shopify store.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/install-app.png

Click on Install App and let it do its thing. Once the app is installed, go back to the left hand side menu, and click on Apps again. We are about to set up this app and add our first product.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-1024x164.png

Once you click on the app, you should see this dashboard:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-product-1024x303.png

Click on the Account button in the upper right hand corner. We want to make sure everything is set up to auto accept and fulfill orders.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account.png
https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account-1.png

Fill out this page making sure that the top box says “YES”. You will need to add a credit card for the orders that you send Teelaunch. While you will be paying them the base price for the shirts and other merchandise orders you send them, you will be collecting the money from the sales in the Amazon central account.

You will also need to set Shopify to NOT automatically fulfill orders. To do this, go into your Shopify settings -> Checkout and then in the Order processing section, unselect to automatically fulfill the order items. In most cases “Do not automatically fulfill any of the order’s line items” will be selected which is the setting you want.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/auto-fulfill-1024x513.png

**Adding Your First Piece Of Merchandise**

Now we are finally ready to add our first piece of merch. From the teelaunch app, you will want to click on “New Product” on the bar near the top of the page.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-choices-1024x425.png

This is where you can see all the products that are available for you to put your designs on! Not only can you do shirts (which is what this entire tutorial is going to go over), but as mentioned above, there are so many other pieces of merch you can print and send to customers on Amazon. All without lifting a finger for the products yourself. Teelaunch will take the orders and ship them for you while you sit back and collect money off the designs and products!

For this method, we are going to be using the Gildan Unisex shirt. As you can see I have chosen that one on the screen. Once a product is chosen, scroll down to the bottom and click on “Start Designing”. This will bring up the product information and give you a little information about the shipping costs. This is also the space where you can upload your artwork to the shirts and pick what sizes and colors you want the shirt to be available in.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/publish-design-1024x536.png

As you can see, using this shirt, it will cost you $8.50 as a base price and $4 shipping.
Click on “Choose File” to upload your design and then play around with dragging and dropping it as well as dragging the edges out so it displays properly on the shirt you want to list. I just took one of my Merch ready shirts to display how it would look. Pick a few colors and a few sizes.

**Important**: You will need a separate UPC code for every single color and size variation you pick. I will go into this in detail further down, but it is best to not automatically select every color and every size.

Once the design is looking good, click on Review and publish Designs. This will bring up a page where you can add product tags, add your selling price, title and description.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-shirt-1024x535.png

Once you are satisfied with how everything looks, go ahead and click on publish at the bottom of the page and your shirt will start processing in all the colors and variations that you have picked.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/processing-to-store-1024x328.png

This can take a little while if you pick a lot of sizes and colors. As you can see from the above picture, I have 48 different variants of just this one shirt! Once it goes through all of them, your shirt is now published in the back end of your shopify store.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-uploaded.png

The entire point is to publish your goods on Amazon though right? To do this, we need to connect them now.

Go back to the main shopify menu and click on “Add a sales channel”. This is BRAND new from Shopify and why I am so excited!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/main-menu.png

You can also find the same thing from the home page. It will be at the bottom. From the screenshot here, you can see you need to hit the install Amazon button to add this as a sales channel to your site.

If you are new to shopify, you do NOT need to create an online store since we are interested in only selling your products on Amazon using a print on demand service (teelaunch).

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Channel.png

Once that is installed, you should see the sales channel added to the menu.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-sales-channel.png

Go ahead and click on it and it will more than likely ask you to update Amazon. This is what you want to go ahead and update the sales channel.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/update-amazon-plugin.png

Once it is updated, you will be able to access the page. From here, you want to be able to connect shopify to your Amazon sellers account we set up earlier.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/connect-Amazon-account-1024x176.png

Click on Connect to Amazon. There is going to be a popup about Amazon MWS. You will need to agree to this. Essentially this is giving Shopify access to your seller central account so they can interact with each other properly.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/agree-to-Amazon-MWS.png

Once these are connected, you will see a screen that looks similar to this. You will see that the account is connected properly:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/account-set-up-1024x544.png

Click on the Listings in the left hand corner. We want to take the shirt we just put online and then put that shirt we created in Teelaunch onto Amazon.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sell-on-Amazon-1024x405.png

Click on the sell on Amazon button. This will bring up a list of the products that you have on Shopify that you may want to sell on Amazon. Since we used Teelaunch to create a shirt, this is what is going to come up in the list.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-product-1024x419.png

After you select the product that you want to list on Amazon, they are going to ask you if you are selling a product from another brand, or from your own brand. Select your own brand.

**Note:** For all the Merch by Amazon users, this is your first real opportunity to build a coherent brand and put work into growing your brand on multiple sales channels. You have full control here and will even be able to respond to the reviews you get!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-your-brand-1024x326.png

When you pick that the product is made by your brand, you are going to come to the Amazon listing details. This is going to look very familiar to you if you have sold shirts on Merch before.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Listing-Details-1024x540.png

Enter in the title, your brand name, the bullet points, and description. You will need to pick a category and will notice that you cannot sell the shirt for both genders at the same time. That is perfectly fine, you can go back after the shirt is live, and then sell the other genders version under the same listing.

Finally, when you scroll down, you will see variants that you have chosen when you were creating the shirt. There will be one for every color and size combo that you created.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shirt-Varients.png

For each variant, go through and make sure the correct colored image is showing up for the title of that variant. As you can see from the above screenshot, I made sure the Royal Blue image is showing for the royal blue variant of the shirt.

**SKU**

You will need a unique sku for every single varient of your shirt. Your visitors will never see the SKU or the UPC, but Amazon requires you to enter this information in for every shirt Variant.

For the SKU, head on over to [https://www.random.org/strings/](https://www.random.org/strings/) and select the following options and click go. You can generate however many strings you need by modifying the first box.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-for-SKUs-1024x622.png
 
You can use each line as one of your SKUs.

**UPC**

Each product and variant must have its own UPC code. These are 12 digit codes. If you have sold on Amazon FBA before, you may have used EAN. So far with the Shopify integration, these will not work so you will need the 12 digit UPC. I highly recommend buying these on Ebay. You can get 1000’s of them for only a few dollars. Once you have them, enter a unique UPC for every variant of the product.

**Clothing and Apparel Category Approval**

You will notice that Shopify tells you that you need approval from Amazon before you can list in this category. Click on the “apply to sell in this category” link and open it in a new tab.

Make sure you answer truthfully to these, but you will be auto approved in the end!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category.png
https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category-2.jpg

The next step is going to be answering some questions about the images you will use. Go through the questionnaire and make sure you answer them all properly. Remember that the images you will be using are being pulled from Teelaunch so they are all good to go with Amazon’s requirements.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-image-requirements-1024x515.png

After that is complete, fill out the information and submit your application!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/submit-clothing-application.png

After you hit Submit Application you will now be instantly approved and can go back to your shirt listing you were working on in the other tab!

**Finishing Amazon Listing**

Now that you have your SKUs and UPCs listed on each variant of the product, it is now time to submit your product listing. If everything has been entered properly, your listing will go through!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/listing-created-30-min-to-live-1024x173.png

As you can see from the image above, the listing has been successfully submitted to Amazon. Your listing should be listed in a pending status. This generally will change within 30 minutes to live and you will have a link to your product on Amazon.com.

**Note On Shipping**

When your product finally goes live and you check it, you might notice that the shipping is higher than you expected. Well, you can change this! The shipping is all controlled within your Amazon seller central account.

Head on over to your Amazon account and find the Shipping Settings and then Shipping Templates. Click on Edit Template and then you will be able to pick what type of shipping you will charge your customers.

As you can see from the screenshot, I decided to change shipping from $4.49 for everyone, to $2.99 for the lower 48 states.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shipping-times-1024x461.png

**ROI Calculations**

This is going to vary per shirt depending on what you price at. Keep in mind that with certain products you may be making a lot larger percentage. You might be making 100% ROI with yoga mats for example.

For shirts though, if you are pricing at 17 dollars, and charging 3 dollars shipping, then the total charge will be around $20. With Amazon fees around $3, and the t-shirt costing you $12.50 (cost of the shirt plus shipping) and a 30c Shopify fee, this leaves you around $4.25 profit for something you never touched! Scale that up by a few hundred if not thousands of shirts you are making great money.

Scale it up even further with the multitude of products you can reuse your designs on, and now you are talking about MASSIVE money, all from your original designs.

**Getting Your First Sale on Shopify with Amazon**

Now with your listings live, you are probably going to get some sales. When you get a sale, they will show up in Shopify (as well as seller central). Make sure you are only dealing with the orders through Shopify though.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/first-order.png

Getting your first order feels great! What is even better though is that from here it is 100% hands off.

If you go back down to apps and then go into the Teelaunch app, you should see this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-production-1024x360.png

Without touching it, your shirt is now being made with Teelaunch and will be shipped to your customer as soon as it is complete. This is possible for t shirts and all other products that teelaunch offers.

**Fulfilling Orders Manually**

If your orders are not automatically going through to Teelaunch, you will need to do them manually. The only reason this may be happening is that the Shopify/Amazon integration is BRAND NEW and I have been assured by higher ups that this is being worked on and will be fixed soon if anyone does encounter it.

**Getting Revenue From Amazon**

In order to get your money from your seller account on Amazon to your bank account, you need to have a few things.

The first thing is that you must have valid credit card information on file for verification and billing purposes. This is why you added this when you set up your seller account.
The second thing you must have is valid bank account information so a transfer can occur. This can be added in the “my profile” section of your seller central account.

Basically the way it will work is that after you get a sale, it will show up in your Shopify account. Once the order is marked “fulfilled”, the buyer will be emailed to let them know that their product is on the way. The funds held within Amazon will be deposited to your account every 14 days. The good news is that you can request funds faster than that! Here is what Amazon has to say on the subject.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amazon-payment.png

**Wrapping It Up**

The Shopify/Amazon integration represents a REAL massive opportunity in the print on demand space and is going to see plenty of people make millions of dollars a year. In order to take advantage of this opportunity successfully you need only a few things:

* 	Know what sells on Amazon
* 	Be willing to WORK and scale your business
* 	Know how to properly optimize your Amazon listings

If you are not hopping on this opportunity today, you are 100% leaving money on the table that is there for the taking. There is zero need to run traffic, zero inventory to hold, and 100’s if not 1000’s of possibilities for making money with the crazy selection of products you can now put for sale on Amazon.

That about raps it up ladies and gentlemen. Any questions ask them below.

Here's 10 things we've learned.",Entrepreneur,"This is the story of how [me](http://www.twitter.com/visakanv) and my partner Desmond created a six-figure ecommerce store entirely in our spare time while working full-time jobs. (We're currently working on [Candybar, a digital loyalty app](https://www.candybar.co/?ref=reddit) for offline stores.)

 We did it by tapping into 2010's Singaporean pop culture just as it was beginning to emerge. 

**[Statement](http://www.statement.sg)** began as doodles in a notebook, and has since done some pretty cool things – showcases at design festivals, [regular features in local media](http://www.statement.sg/pages/about-us/) and a nice passive income stream for the two of us, as well as the opportunity to do all sorts of cool experiments we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do.

###Here are the lessons we’ve learnt along the way.

# Lesson #1: Start quickly by testing the smallest version of your idea

I’ve always been a little too perfectionist about most of my ideas, but in this case I was happy to mess around because I didn’t seriously think I had any chance of going anywhere with it.

So one day when I was a little bored, I decided to [post the ideas on Facebook to see what my friends thought of them](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150340477698915.356918.650823914&type=1&l=eab8a039f1).

On hindsight, this was a very important step, for several reasons:

* “Writing down” my idea to share it with others forced me to make it “real”.  Putting something out puts a stake in the ground for you to subsequently rework with. A crappy draft of an idea is more actionable than a perfect-but-imaginary one.
* Learning that people were interested in my idea motivated me to move forward. I didn’t have ANY of the skills needed to build or run a t-shirt company, and I definitely wouldn’t have felt motivated to learn them unless I knew that people were interested in buying what I had to offer.
* I got buy-in from the guy who’d become my partner. Having somebody else who’s also interested in driving your project forward makes it feel much, much more real.

# Lesson #2 – Get feedback and buy-in from customers ASAP

So great, now I had someone who wanted to help, and he had some visual design skills. He could help me do [mockups in things that weren’t MS Paint](https://www.facebook.com/visakan.veerasamy/media_set?set=a.10150540170793915.387113.650823914&type=3).

These got us from “hey, those are pretty cool ideas, I’d probably wear something like that” to **“How much is this t-shirt and when can I get it?”**

Knowing that people wanted to actually buy these theoretical t-shirts got us motivated to figure out the t-shirt printing process. I don’t think we’d have bothered to go through all the hassle otherwise (and it would’ve been tragic if we did that, only to then print t-shirts that nobody wanted.)

# Lesson #3 – Learn from others in your field – they know more than you and can help you out.

**Ask, ask, ask.**

How do you go from an idea to having actual t-shirts printed? We didn’t know, so we decided to ask someone. Specifically, we sought out an older acquaintance who already had some experience selling t-shirts, and bought him dinner in exchange for his thoughts. He not only shared his experiences (successes and missteps), he gave us the contact to his t-shirt printer!

Note: Please don’t be self-obsessed when you do this. What’s in it for them? How much time will you need? What exactly do you want to ask them about? What questions do you need answered? Show that you’ve done your research. And pay for the drinks or food.

**Be visible**

This would happen again and again in the history of our business: We’d be selling t-shirts at some flea market and have someone approach us offering to re-sell our products, or feature us in some publication. Some of these folks have gone on to become critical partners in our business – our best resellers and our current printers were all people we met in person while selling t-shirts at some event or another.

So ask people out to coffee. Talk to suppliers, vendors, event organizers – and get to know them personally, ask them for their opinions, be genuinely curious. They will have all sorts of interesting information for you. One of our resellers opened our eyes to the wonders of courier shipping, saving us a ton of trouble.

# Lesson #4 – Start exchanging product for cash as quickly as you can

**We literally started out selling t-shirts directly through messages on a Facebook page.** We didn’t have nice pictures or a “Shop” segment when we were starting out, but still managed to sell hundreds of t-shirts.

We would get messages from people on Facebook and we would track their orders in a Google Sheet. It took us a while to figure out the concept of an SKU – we just used different rows and columns for different sizes!

This worked fine when we were selling a few t-shirts a week, and it was possible to respond to everybody on Facebook. But once we started getting dozens of t-shirts a week, we realized it wasn’t going to be sustainable, and so we set up a “proper” ecommerce store on Storenvy.

Getting cash from your first sale is a huge rush, and the sooner you get it the better – because it’ll compel you to do more. The longer you defer this, the likelier you are to get bogged down with details.

# Lesson #5 – Focus on a niche

I never set out to be a “Singaporean” brand – I just wanted to make t-shirts that I liked. But it just so happened that some of the t-shirts I wanted had a local flavor to them, and those were the t-shirts that resonated resoundingly with people.

So we followed the money and doubled down on that, making more and more t-shirts in the style that our customers wanted (while continuing to establish our overall brand),

The litmus test is this: **what can I say to one person about my t-shirts that would get them excited enough to tell somebody else about it?**

# Lesson #6 – Celebrate your customers and they’ll adore you for it

This came very naturally to us – we were very excited to see that people liked our t-shirts enough to post pictures of themselves wearing them, so we were eager to share and celebrate that success with the rest of our page, as well as on Instagram.

We started getting a lot of word-of-mouth. People would literally ask their friends on Facebook “Hey, where’d you get that shirt?”, and the wearer would tag us in the comments, and we’d get an order (or five) from the friend.

# Lesson #7 – Prioritize a few essential things

You DON’T need to do EVERYTHING. There are a lot of extensive guides available online with a massive list of all the possible things that you could do. But it’s entirely possible to make several thousand bucks with just Facebook messages and a Google spreadsheet.

You don’t need to be on all the channels – it’s much better to focus on one or two channels and really build great relationships with customers there, than to try and be everywhere all at once.

One thing we did always prioritize was giving our customers the best experience we could. In the early days, we’d  often go out of our way to help people with replacements and urgent deliveries if possible. We couldn’t sustainably scale that, but it definitely made an impression on our earliest customers and got us a lot of positive word-of-mouth.

# Lesson #8 – Value your time, pay for useful services.

We also setup a proper ecommerce store to save us the trouble of having to manually enter sales data – we started out on StoreEnvy because it’s free, and then moved to Shopify because we wanted more features and functionality.

With the benefit of hindsight, we’d have gotten onto Shopify earlier – we were uncertain and broke so we were very skeptical of spending any sort of money, but the time and energy it would’ve saved us would’ve been worth the cost. Having all the customer data managed for you in an accessible way ALONE is more than worth the cost. Having “proper” business expenses also has a psychological effect of making it “serious”.

Things we’re glad we paid for, and wish we paid for sooner: Shopify, WaveApps, Receiptful.

# Lesson #9 – Delegate! Figure out tasks that other people can do for you, and compensate them for it.

When we started getting more orders than we could handle, we ended up hiring interns to help us out. We felt awkward at first – are we employers? Do we know how to manage other people? We basically copied what the best practices were at work – we used a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks we wanted to do, and we had fortnightly 1-1s with our interns.

Different interns brought different things to the table. One helped us do photoshoots with their friends as models. Another helped to codify our processes and customer service protocol into Google docs.

# Lesson #10 – Write down your partnership agreement, and manage all your bills and paperwork properly, and do weekly or monthly reviews.

**Seriously, write down all your shit**

This is something we DIDN’T do, and regret. Just because you’re running a side-business doesn’t mean you can be totally lazy about it. We each put in a couple of hundred dollars to pay for the first round of t-shirts, and thought it would probably make us a couple of thousand bucks – negligible amounts we could write off. So we didn’t bother much with keeping track of the paperwork. But it’s grown to over $100,000, and figuring out all the accounting inconsistencies was a nightmare. We've actually lost several thousands this way (paying for things we didn't need and so on). Painful lesson learned! 

**Have good meetings regularly**

We also didn’t meet as often as we should’ve, which meant that our business grew more slowly than we’d have liked. Having regular meetings also helps you get re-aligned on multiple things – why does your company exist? How are you making progress towards your goals? Asking these questions is a great way to stay focused and motivated. You don’t need to have meetings that go on for hours – a quick 20 minutes catchup with your co-founder can make all the difference.

# Questions I got from friends on Facebook:

## When should you set up a formal business entity?

You don’t need to set this up from day 1 – that’s just a tedious distraction from the most important thing, which is making sure that people want to give you money for whatever you’re making. 

My recommendation is that you start thinking about it once you’ve made about a thousand dollars. In our case, we didn’t bother until we needed a company bank account to receive payment from some particular vendor.

## Should you use accounting software, apps, etc?

Yes! It took us way too long to bother with this because we were trying to keep our costs low, but this is a bad place to try to cut costs. 

Keeping rigorous track of your invoices is crucial – it gives you peace of mind, it helps you understand your business better, etc.

## How do you run meetings?

There’s a lot of meeting hate in the world, but it’s really bad meetings that are bad. Effective meetings can be short, snappy, energizing and even exciting. We resolve things together and we have new ‘next actions’ to drive the business forward.

## How do you move forward when you don’t know what you’re doing?

Seriously – just try something. Ideally you'd have a list of ideas, and a framework for prioritizing those, but if you're feeling stuck, just go with whatever you feel like doing! **Do what you're curious about and excited by, it's a critical part of staying motivated.** 

We never really bothered doing any serious marketing – we took a lot of pride in spending as little time and energy as possible on the project. But looking back, we could’ve done more even with the little time that we spent, by being a little more focused. 

Now we have to figure out what the next wave of products will be – which is a fascinating intellectual challenge – but we could’ve extracted more value, which would’ve given us more $$ – which we can then deploy towards interesting projects of our choosing.

## What did you learn from your customers?

**IRL:**

When we were selling t-shirts at flea markets, we initially tried to persuade people to buy t-shirts for themselves. Those people rarely needed much persuading – they either immediately noticed something they wanted, or they’d just scan everything idly and move on. We noticed, however, that quite a few groups of friends would point at some t-shirt or other and say, “Haha, that’s so John!”, or “This is totally Sally!”

We realized that people liked buying gifts for friends, and so we changed our pitch from “See anything you like?” to “Do any of these remind you of our friends?” We started converting people much better, and this influenced how we sell.

**Online:**

We'd often get emails saying things like, ""Can I get this within this week? It's for my brother's birthday party on Saturday"", or ""It's to wear to my class reunion on X date"" – which gave us a much better sense of the ""Jobs-to-be-done"" aspect. 

## Any questions? Happy to answer!

814,4skt0t,False,,127,How long does it take to create an overnight success? For John Hanke it’s taken him 20 years to create Pokémon Go.,Entrepreneur," This week, the Pokémon Go app has broken all records, with 10 million+ downloads in the first week, exceeding Twitter in daily active users, and with higher average user time than Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram & WhatsApp.

How did John Hanke create such a massive overnight craze? Here’s the 10 times he levelled up in his lifetime to reach Pokémon Go:

1st Level up: In 1996, while still a student, John co-created the very first MMO (massively multiplayer online game) called ‘Meridian 59’. He sold the game to 3DO to move on to a bigger passion: mapping the world.

2nd Level up: In 2000, John launched ‘Keyhole’ to come up with a way to link maps with aerial photography, and create the first online, GPS-linked 3D aerial map of the world.

3rd Level up: In 2004, Google bought Keyhole and with John’s help, turned Keyhole into what is now ‘Google Earth’. That’s when John decided to focus at creating GPS-based games.

4th Level up: John ran the Google Geo team from 2004 to 2010, creating Google Maps and Google Street View. During this time, he collected the team that would later create Pokémon Go.

5th Level up: In 2010, John launched Niantic Labs as a start-up funded by Google to create a game layer on maps. John explains why he called it Niantic:

“The Niantic is the name of a whaling ship that came up during the gold rush and through a variety of circumstances got dragged on shore. This happened with other ships, too. Over the years, San Francisco was basically just built over these ships. You could stand on top of them now, and you wouldn't know it. So it's this idea that there's stuff about the world that's really cool but even though it's on the Internet, it's hard to know when you're actually there.”

6th Level up: In 2012, John then created Niantic’s first geo-based MMO, “ingress”:

John explains: “In the case of Ingress the activity is layered on top of the real world and on your phone. The inspiration was that it was something that I always used to daydream about while I was commuting back and forth from home to Google.""

""I always thought you could make an awesome game using all the Geo data that we have. I watched phones become more and more powerful and I thought the time would come that you could do a really awesome real-world adventure-based game.”

7th Level up: In 2014, Google and the Pokémon Company teamed up for an April Fools’ Day joke, which allowed viewers to find Pokémon creatures on Google maps. It was a viral hit, and got John thinking the idea could be turned into a real game.

8th Level up: John decided to build Pokémon Go on the user-generated meeting points created by players of Ingress, and the most popular became the Pokéstops and gyms in Pokémon Go:

As John says, ”The Pokéstops are submitted by users, so obviously they're based on places people go. We had essentially two and a half years of people going to all the places where they thought they should be able to play Ingress, so it's some pretty remote places. There are portals in Antartica and the North Pole, and most points in between.”

9th Level up: John raised $25 million from Google, Nintendo, the Pokémon Company and other investors from Dec 2015 to Feb 2016 to grow a team of 40+ to launch Pokémon Go this year.

10th Level: John and his team launched Pokémon Go on July 6th in USA, Australia and New Zealand. Since its launch, Nintendo’s share price has risen $7.5 billion, and the app is already generating over $2 million daily in in-app purchases, making it an overnight phenomenon.

The overnight success of Pokémon Go has taken John Hanke 20 years to create. Throughout these 20 years, while he had a big vision of a game layer over the world, he didn’t know what form it would take. At every step, he just focused at his next level up.

At each new level, he had new powers, new team members, and new items in his inventory…

Are you, like John, treating your own entrepreneurial journey like one big MMO?

Keep the end in mind, but focus today on simply levelling up.

At every level, grow your powers, your team, and your luck.

And know it takes many levels to win the game.

840,345onz,False,,244,The Cannabis industry: It's the smallest it ever will be.,Entrepreneur,"""It's the smallest it will ever be.""  A statement that I'm just now comprehending about the cannabis industry.  Last night I attended a [Boulder Cannabis Industry](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Cannabis-Industry-Meetup/) meet up at a place called [Canopy Boulder](http://www.canopyboulder.com).  The first of its kind, Canopy Boulder is a startup incubator specifically for the cannabis industry.  A few weeks into their first round, they have 10 startups working diligently to change the landscape of the cannabis industry.  We live in exciting times.

A whole room of people dedicated to education and utilization of cannabis.  I'm unsure if there were 100 people there, but if not that many we were quite close to filling the room.  The first takeaway for me was the sheer amount of people in suits.  Respectable business men and women, startup founders and cofounders, and many local business owners.  Not a single person in the room would have fit the stereotyped public perception of ""the stoner"".

From HR services, to online sales catered to a more premium market, and even [bed and breakfasts](https://budandbreakfast.com/) catered to cannabis users, the startups and businesses in the room represented a wide array of opportunities in this **budding** industry.  If ever there were doubts about the future of the cannabis industry, Canopy Boulder is a shining seed of the future.  The industry really never will be this small again.

I encourage you to check out Canopy Boulder's site, and more importantly their current [list of startups](http://www.canopyboulder.com/about/portfolio/).  Also if you are in the industry or plan to be, they are currently accepting application for their fall 2015 session.  The benefits include $20,000 in seed funding, 13 weeks of an extensive ""business bootcamp"", access to 100+ mentors, and exposure to at least 1000 investors.  Not a bad deal for a budding industry!

The entire paradigm of the world of cannabis is shifting.  We are heading towards a future where it isn't risque to partake in cannabis.  A future where businessmen and college kids alike may freely utilize the benefits of one of mother nature's greatest gifts.  No longer do we need to don tie dye and dreadlocks in order to be a part of the cannabis world.  Together we can educate the world and help millions of people lead healthier happier lives.

Tie dye and dreads are still cool though!

*Full disclosure, I have a blog called [Reefer Fitness](http://www.reeferfitness.com/) dedicated to living an optimum lifestyle utilizing weed.  Probably too many self-help posts atm.  This is an entire article.*

**I am very curious to hear from /r/Entrepreneur  about your cannabis related start up, ideas you've had, or just your opinions about the industry.**

****EDIT: Wow, this took off.  A lot of great comments from business owners, industry people, and those curious. We could almost have a cannabis industry AMA post soon.****

*****EDIT:  http://i.imgur.com/Pz3uF4T.png I'm sorry but it had to be done.*****",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/345onz/the_cannabis_industry_its_the_smallest_it_ever/,433,"Sounds like pot smokers amping up other pot smokers. 

Results from states are coming in and they're not dramatic or impressive.  It's hard to get people out of underground economy, and people don't want to pay high taxes to do so.  (Similar to how people smuggle and buy untaxed cigarettes, except that the whole system already exists for pot.)  

I do think wide spread legalization is coming, but what that actually means is unclear to me.  The double tax situation sucks right now and it will suck for the foreseeable future.  

I've seen what happened to cigarettes.  A popular legal mega industry was not only pushed out, but lost its appeal.  Why is pot any different?  Smoking up joints instead of cigarettes... is that supposed to be cooler or feel better?  Ehhh...  

Are the opportunities?  Hell yeah.  But there are opportunities in a lot of thing and you don't have you touch substances of questionable legality and tax situation.  The amount of opportunity in Pot is most definitely offset by the amount of uncertainty.  

I also suspect it's like the photography business.  Every kid with a camera wants to be in the photography business.  There is demand, but not that much demand to absorb all these wannabes.  There's a ton of pot smokers who probably have the same dreams, not realizing that the demand isn't going to support them all.   ",2015-04-28 14:36:33

**If you are an eCommerce owner, you probably know how big of a buzz is about Facebook ads.**

-

-
I was annoyed by this fact when I started working with eCommerce clients so here I’m writing everything I learned from my eCommerce campaigns.

High-level strategy
======


**Why are FB ads good channel for eComm businesses?**

-
When you are looking for a marketing channel for your eCommerce business you usually look for three things:

-
1. Is your market on that platform?
1. How much can you scale?
1. What’s the initial investment to enter the channel?

-

Despite Facebook becoming overcrowded, it’s still a great channel for eComm businesses because it fits all three criteria. 

-
You can start advertising with very low budgets and get the initial results really fast (IE generating sales).
And at the same time, you can massively scale this channel to 6-7 figures a month in revenue.

-
To get more tactical, let's cover the basic high-level framework of FB ads for eComm businesses.

-
**Frameworks**

There are many different frameworks and goals you can set for your campaigns but here are the three most common:

-

*Day 0 - ROI positive*

This is usually the case when FB ads are the main channel for acquiring new customers. If this is the case, you need FB ads to make you profit. 

This is simple math, taught by most of the experts, etc.
If you have $50 NET profit margin on your product, your goal is to have CAC of $25. This means that for every $1 spent on ads you make $1 profits.

-
*Day 0 - Breakeven*

This scenario is used when a company wants to use Facebook as a channel to grow their customer base. In this scenario Facebook ads are self-funding, meaning that you don’t need outside capital to expand your customer base. It allows you acquire massive amounts of customers and be open to the potential upside if you have some operational efficiencies coming up that will reduce your COGS.

-

Coming back to the 1st scenario: if you have $50 NET profit margin on your product, your goal is to have CAC of $50. This means that for every sale you make you are on break-even. (NOTE that your ROAS will be higher than one as you need to include COGS into the equation)

-

*Day 30 - Breakeven*

This is the most aggressive scenario that some companies use for massive growth. You will need to have very developed systems and analytics to make this work, as well as significant access to capital to fund for this money lost period. 

In this scenario, you are relying on your LTV calculations and average customer profit after 30 days.

-
So if you have $50 NET profit margin on the first sale, and you know that after 30 days you AVERAGE customer makes you $100 in profits, you aim for CPA of $100 that will make you break-even on day 30.
(NOTE that this is more common for SAAS companies as they have more predictive 30-day revenue projections than eComms, but having substantial loyalty and referral campaigns can make this strategy work)  
 
-
**Social network aspect**

-
Facebook is a social network. And if you are to advertise on it, you need to accept this as a fact and put that into consideration.

-
You don’t need to game the algorithm; you need to feed it with what it wants.
 
-
People are on Facebook for two reasons:

* To engage with content they are interested in
* To connect with people they like

-
So when you are promoting your product, there has to be something unique about it. It needs to build a narrative and tell a story. You can’t sell commodities on Facebook as opposed to Google. 

-
If you have a new and unique product - your ads can be pretty straightforward, but the emphasis is that at least SOMETHING has to be unique. 

-
For example: 

* Product
* Brand
* Cause 
* Personality 
* Humor
* Story 

-

**Product**

-
Before we even begin to go into details about ads itself we need to address the element of the product. 

-
Your advertising success is 50% the quality of your product!

-
Regardless of what anyone is telling you, the product is BY FAR the most important part of your advertising. By quality I mean: is there mass appeal and desire for the product that you are selling?

-
If people don’t want the product, don’t have the need for the product, you WILL fail. Period. 

-
If the product is excellent, it does the marketing itself. You really won’t have a hard time creating promos around the product that people are eager for and spending money to get it.

-
If you don’t have access to unique products (dropshipping or reselling other people’s products), you need to create unique marketing that will be appealing to your market. Meaning, they need a story or some different kind of value provided as for why they should buy the product.

-
Now let’s get into the weeds!
&nbsp;

Types of traffic
====
-
**How they differ and how to approach each.**

-
When it comes to types of traffic, on Facebook, you can literally do anything from upsells, cross-sells, loyalty, retention, referral campaigns, etc. But here I’m just going to talk about acquiring new customers.

-
When it comes to acquisition, there are two main types of traffic

* Retargeting (IE Warm traffic)
* Prospecting (IE Cold traffic) 

---
##**Retargeting**

-
**Setting expectations**

-
Retargeting existing website traffic or email list that you have is usually the best way to start advertising your store. 

-
Retargeting can be very powerful for stores that are driving other sources of traffic (content marketing, affiliate, influencer traffic, SEM) as you will have a lot of people that didn’t convert on their initial visits and you can follow up with them on Facebook. 

-
Your expectations need to be higher for this type of traffic as these people are on a higher level of awareness (Will discuss later in detail). So your goal with RTG traffic should always to be profitable for two reasons:

1. The scale is going to be limited by the amount of traffic you have
1. These people showed interest, which means they are much more likely to buy

-

**How to segment it**

-
####Dynamic: 

The reason this is called dynamic is that people get shown specific ads based on their behavior on the site. 

-
Using Dynamic Product Ads (DPAs) is the effective and simple solution for people who have a lot of products in the store. 

-
Usually retargeting people who have visited specific product pages in last seven days OR who have added to cart is the most effective. 

-
DPAs are arguably the only campaign that you can set-and-forget on Facebook as you don’t have much room to optimize (other than the text copy) 

-
####Static:

-
There are a lot of options, variations, and segmentation  you can do here so here are a few rules of thumb that I use to make decisions:

-
*Potential upside* - 
if you have some segment of your site that is generating a lot of traffic and attention, it’s worth to try segmenting this section (example: your blog is generating 10,000 organic visitors a month - you will want to figure out a way to monetize that interest)

-
*Low hanging fruit* - when you look at the behavior of the customers, can you identify someone that is more likely to buy than others? (example: people who have initiated checkout in last 1-7 days)

-
*Results of initial test* - as we said earlier, the scale will always be limited. So you want to get the results from these campaigns ASAP. Meaning, if the initial campaign for the specific segment isn’t producing good results right off the bat, it might be a good idea to backlog this segment - you only have limited time resources, and you don’t want to waste it on some part that will have little impact on your campaigns. 

-


**When there is too much segmentation**

-
Two rules apply here to identify when you have segmented too much:

* Budget allocation and results
* Time allocation

-
If you are spending a small percentage of the budget on RTG, that is NOT producing the results you want; you might be overcomplicating and not cutting unnecessary segmentations. 

-
Time allocation is the second rule: if you spend a disproportionate amount of time compared to the budget you are spending, you need to simplify.

-
**Creative aspect**

-
Ad creatives will usually be much different for RTG traffic. Your primary job will be to show the product in action, customer reviews, address any sales objections your customers might have. 

-
Your ads and creatives will have much more engagement and better Click-through rates because people are already familiar with your brand/store.

---
##**Prospecting**

-
**Expectations**

-
It’s challenging to set expectations for cold traffic because there are so many variables you need to take into consideration. Even looking at your competitor and seeing what they are doing might not give you a good picture of what you can do. 

-
That’s why you need to set the system in which you will benefit from the volatility. (the concept of [convex tinkering](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility) introduced by Nassim Taleb)

-
Meaning, knowledge is a poor substitute for trial and error process.

-

This practically applies like this: You need to create a very large amount of small tests (bets) based on your assumptions and expose yourself to the potential benefit of big upside.

-


**Mind-shift from RTG traffic**

-
The important thing is to realize that Cold traffic reacts and acts much much more differently than RTG traffic. 

-
You are trying to get people to buy from you in their first interaction with your brand. 

-
So you need to think about what kind of emotional and psychological processes are happening in their head and how to channel those to your product.

-
Cold traffic is much more about tapping into the consumer psychology and really understanding your market through trial and error process.

-
**Audience aspect**

-
Audience aspect is a massive part of cold traffic. 

-
Your products might be appealing to a type of people that might be counterintuitive for you in the first place. 

-
So your convex tinkering model will help you to tap into these parts of the market.

-

**Creative aspect**

-
Creatives that have worked for RTG will usually not work for cold traffic. 

-
Your ads need to do a vast majority of the selling before prospects even land on your page. 

-
**Media Buying**

-
With RTG, you will not have that much of issues with adequately structuring your campaigns to ensure that you get the best traffic available. But with cold, quality of traffic can vastly influence your results - therefore you will need to pay much more attention to it. 


-
I’ll write about this in more detail in a specific section.

On-site optimization
====

AKA Websites

-
Your landing pages need to have few key conversion points. Your funnel is not that crucial part of the equation as people will often buy even if you didn’t do a great job designing your store.

-
There are few key components that your site needs to:

-
* Trustworthy (guarantee badges, secure badges, SSL, etc)
* State the benefits and features of the product
* Be clear (price, product, shipping)
* Have reviews 

-
**Number of steps before they make a purchase**

-
This is essential conversion factor. The fewer actions your customers need to make, the higher conversion rates you will have. 

-
For example:

Product page → Cart → Checkout → Purchase

VS

Product page → Checkout → Purchase

-
The less room for drop off, the better conversions. It’s vital when it comes to paid traffic as you are paying to get that visitor, so you need to have a clear and straightforward way of monetizing this traffic. 

-
Let’s get into details about landing pages. There are three types of pages that we found are doing great.

-
##**Product pages**

-
Static old-fashioned product pages still work. There is nothing new here, and the standard applies. You need to have:

-
* Product name
* Product description
* Great images
* Reviews
* Mobile-friendly optimization

-
##**Traditional funnels** 

A landing page designed for FB ads

-
Here we go a little bit deeper to extract more conversions. Usually, those are landing pages with much more content and different options. 

-
The main feature of this type of landing page it that you can customize pricing, bundle products and create special offers as you wish. It gives you better control over conversion rate and AOV. If you can sell products in bundles, you can test which bundle works the best, which offers work the best, etc. 

-
Long form sales page

They rely on content, here you have the chance to really introduce customers to your products and your company, which will inevitably help you with conversions if you can put in the personal touch. 

-
VSL

You can also have a VSL type of sales page. But this requires better video production abilities, and it usually doesn’t improve conversions that much (as you’ll see, the video is best used right in the ad).

-
Special offers

The obvious example here is Free + Shipping offers. You want to create an F+S offer on a separate landing page, so when your prospects visit your site, they will see that the product offered with Facebook ads is only free if you land on that specific page - which will increase trustworthiness and conversions.

-
##**New types of funnels**

-
Now, good old product pages work well, but you need to have a unique product to do REALLY well. 

-
Traditional funnels work even better.

-
But the newest trend and the best funnels are new hybrid funnels. They have this content aspect that significantly helps conversions. 

-
There are a couple of versions:

-

* Listicle

Buzzfeed style article with 5-10 bullet points. People love this kind of content, and you will get much cheaper traffic. You can also optimize the content in a way that will address all the objections your customers might have and make the purchase much earlier than you expected. 

* Quiz funnels

Create a quiz where they will answer a couple of questions and end up on the sales page.

* Build a box

Fun funnel if you have options to bundle your products. This requires more tech support, but it can be great.

-
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This covers the introductory section and foundations to running any successful Facebook advertising campaign. 
Now we’ll move into the section about FB ads itself.
-

I like to split FB ads into two sections that are equally important to success. This split is made to make sure that I always know what I need to improve on and how to achieve my goals. 

-

It’s split on:

* Ad creative
* Media buying

-
##**Ad Creatives**
====


Ad creatives are essentially ads that you are running on Facebook. 

-
Ad creatives will have a direct impact on the price of your advertising by CTR (click-through-rate) and Conversion rates.

-
So your ads job is to sell the click - to get the traffic to your store - BUT at the same time, it needs to prequalify and sell your audience even before they land on your page. 

-
It’s split into two segments: 

* Visual
* Ad copy

---

##**Visuals:**

-
**Videos**

Since the introduction of video in FB ads, this has been a game-changing feature that businesses needed to use. They are particularly effective for physical products as you get a chance to show what your product does in a clear demonstration of the features and benefits. 

-
Here are the types of the video ads:

-
* Short videos (snippets) - 0-30 seconds
* Traditional style ad - 0:30-2:00
* Long videos (edutainment) - 2:00 - 6:00

-
General content guidelines:

* Keep it short as possible for FB
* Think like silent film artist (85% of video views happen in MUTE)
* Incorporate design to make your videos look like high-quality production (example - slow-motion)
* Create educational and inspirational videos

-

FB video ads have three distinct parts:

-
**First 10 seconds of the video:**

This is the most important variable of the video, and something would be good to split test and figure out how to attract the attention. 

-
**The Meat:** After 1st part, your video needs to:

* Educate
* Entertain 
* Demonstrate 

-
You can pick and choose one of the variants that suit your brand; it’s not necessary to use all 3.

-
**CTA:** A good Facebook video ads CTA is fluid, natural, and a logical next step to the viewer.

-
There are 2 ways you can transition to selling:

1. Hard CTA (buy the product) 
1. Soft CTA (Learn more, take a sample, etc.)

-
Here are some content ideas from the videos that have been performing well lately:

-

* Product demonstration 
* Celebrity endorsement and testimonial 
* Customer testimonial 
* Unboxing of the product 
* Animated demonstration of the product and benefits
* Interview a person who helps make the product
* Show how the product gets made
* Do a how-to video featuring products

-

If your product has a very appealing use and it’s entertaining and beneficial to users, by all means, invest in creating video content specific for FB ads, you will reap massive ROI from having those videos. 

---
##**Images**

-
Go for metaphor instead of logic. People are more naturally inclined to paint the picture themselves, so it creates much more powerful impact

-
Ex. If you are selling some kind of supplement, use milk and cookies as a metaphor (milk supplements cookies)

-
**How to think** when choosing images:


* If Facebook didn't allow me to use text, what would I use to illustrate the solution?
* Tell a story and stand out
* Think about the end goal, not so much the process

-
Ex. Coca-cola does an excellent job of building emotions that they connect to the product.

-
**Product images in ads**

If the product is self-explanatory and visually appealing (but don't fall into the trap “if I think it's explanatory, the audience will too), you can use simple product images to treat extent. No need for any fancy design or anything. This actually works very well lately.


-
If it's not 100% clear what your product is or does - it's it's best to use the images of the product in action that demonstrates what it does and how.


-
**Types of images:**

-
There are three types of images that are working really well:

-
* Professional images
* UGC - Any images created by the customers themselves are the perfect asset
* The amateur images on purpose - when you use your phone to take images of the product. It works really well if it matches your brand and suits your audience. 

---
##**Copywriting**

-
Copywriting is as old as advertising. And the same rules apply as they did in the early 1900s.

-
Here are some important pointers:

-
**Battle for perception**

-
Advertising and marketing is battle for position in your prospects mind.
Remember that there is no reality, only perception. And if you can win that perception battle among tons of other contents pieces on Facebook, you will win.

-
You need to find a unique position where there is fertile ground for the idea you are trying to plant. People need to be ready to accept the ideas you want to share about how your products will fit into their daily schedule. 

-
It’s straightforward to see if you got this right - your CTR and conversion rates will be much higher.

-
**Market awareness**

-
This is from the book Breakthrough advertising, and it's it's very relevant for eCommerce advertising.

-
It stands for the level of awareness your audience has about the solution and the “problem” your product is solving.

-
It’s divided into five stages:

-
1. Your solution aware
1. Solution aware
1. Desire aware
1. Problem aware
1. Unaware

-
You need to know exactly what segment of the market you are trying to address. For cold traffic and bigger scale, you will need to talk to third to the fifth level of awareness as that’s much larger segment than 1st two. 

-
**Conversational Tone**

-
You ALWAYS want to have a conversational tone in your advertising. Especially on Facebook; you need to have developed a brand voice, something people can relate to.

-
You can use humor as well, be witty, engage in conversations, as there are many brands out there that are actively doing this and it creates certain expectations from customers (this is excluded in luxury items as you need to keep this high-class perception)

-

**Types of copy**

-
Here are most commonly used types of copy:

-
*Short copy* - 2-3 short sentences with clear product descriptions, benefits, and features.

-
*Just stating USP* - if you have a really unique product that didn’t even exist before (Introducing: AAA battery that has 500 active hours lifespan)

-
*Long copy* - here you have more opportunity to tell a story about your brand, your customers and talk about the benefits of the product in more detail.

-
*Claims backed with proof* - (The best Chocolate cookies in Midwest - approved by 500,000 customers) 

-
**Angles**

-
Angles are ways that you will try to enter perception of your market. Usually, you will need to create associations with what is already in the mind of your customer if your product is entirely new.

-
**Discounts and offers**

-
If you are offering big discounts, you need to have a damn good reason why. It works well, but without reason, it's just plain sketchy.

-
Creating discounts can be a very effective way to attract new customers. You state the benefits, the features of the product and invite them to try the product as you are offering xx% discount for first-time customers as you know they will love the product.

-
**Special offers** - 

-
An incentive why they should act NOW - very important as you are paying for that visitor.
This area is very borderline all the time. You need to give your customers an incentive to act now (scarcity is usually the best), but you can’t deceive your customers. 

-
Sometimes maybe you are low on stock, or you are running a limited promotion with a fixed expiry date.

-
The best would be if you could point out the fact that they should’ve started using your product yesterday - if not yesterday, the second best option is today. 

---
**Creative testing process**

-
As the quality of your creatives is vital to your FB success, you need a very efficient way to test creatives.


-
Here's the process I use to find winning ads quickly:

* Establish benchmark (CPC target that you want to lower)
* Create 5 ad sets with 5 different audiences (LAL or Interests)
* Run with $10-day budget 
* IF CPC is below the benchmark for ANY given ad set - keep running 2 more days to get enough sample size for Purchases
* After 3 days, winning ad set should get a sale (depending on your CPA + improvement on CPC
* Test 2 creatives at the time (every 3 days - Monday / Thursday)
* One should be similar to baseline ad (the one that is currently your best-performing ad at the moment) - one or 2 variables different
* One should be vastly different - all variables different


What is considered as a successful test?

-

* Improvement on CPC benchmark on at least 3 audiences
* ROAS positive ad

-
Remember - your goal is to get lower CPC - When you do get a new ad, use it in the rotation in your other ad sets where you can see that CPC is getting higher. 

---
---


Media buying
====
**Audiences AKA targeting**. 

-
This is how you will target buyers.
You will spend most of your time on Facebook just managing the audiences. Trying out new ones, killing bad performing ones, finding new interests, etc. This is the reality, and there’s no other way around it.

-
There are no specific rules what will work or what not. Here are only couple of pointers that could lead you right way:

-

* Lookalike - aim for at least 1000 people in seed audience
* Start narrow and go broad - whenever you are starting a new campaign or new product - go with an audience that is most likely to buy (usually narrow audience). This works in 80% of the time
* Bundle interests and Lookalikes - Sometimes bundling interests into one ad set gets you better results if you split them into separate ad sets. (Reason this is is that Facebook likes larger audiences with a bigger pool of people to choose from)

-
*Audience saturation*

-
Note that you will soon get to audience saturation phase depending on your budget (especially if you are running small audiences (10,000-500,000 are relatively small audiences)

-
When your audience starts to saturate, you will first notice a drop in CPA, and then you will begin to see frequency points increase. The solution for this is either rotating ads within the same audience or just changing up the audience and moving on. 

---

##**Being clear about the numbers**

-
This is a vital part of Facebook ads. You **NEED** to know your numbers. 
There are three most important numbers that you need to have in mind all the time:

-
CAC - Customer acquisition cost

AOV - Average order value

COGS - Cost of goods sold

-
So you need to know:

1. How much you are paying to acquire one customer
2. How much does that customer spend per average order
3. How much profit margin do you have per one sale

-
*I was stunned when I realized how much people don’t know their numbers.*

-
When you know your basics, you need to know some other numbers that will tell you how your campaigns are performing and how to improve them.

-
When you look from a higher level, there are two types of metrics:

* KPIs
* Input metrics

-
*KPIs*

In any simple eCommerce campaign, there will be only 2 KPIs

* CAC - cost to acquire a customer
* CPC - cost per click

-
These are essentially two metrics that are determining how well is your campaign performing at any given time. You need to know how much are you paying for a customer and how much you are paying for the click.

-
*Input metrics*

-
Input metrics are metrics that create those KPIs

They are for CPC

* CPM - Cost per 1000 impressions (what you pay to Facebook)
* CTR - Click-through rate. What’s the percentage of people clicking on your ad? 

-
You have much more control over CTR as the quality of your ad determines this. You can only change CPMs by switching your audiences.

-
For CAC they are:

* CPC - Cost per click
* CR - The conversion rate of your website.

-
The way you can change your conversion rate is by doing CRO experiments which I won’t talk about here. OR by changing the audiences - some audiences will be more inclined to buy so you will have a better conversion rate. 

-
*Advanced metrics:*
-
***You can skip this part if you are not already spending a decent amount on FB***

-
Blended CAC

Blended CAC is what you need to calculate when you have a multi-touchpoint campaign. 
You need to get into consideration all the numbers and money that you are spending to acquire one customer.

Meaning that the end campaign is just one part of the equation, you need to add in the costs of the first touch.

-

If you are doing this multi-touch approach, you probably noticed that your economics are a little bit harder as you will need really good frontend and backend numbers to make this work. To get that numbers you need to have a really awesome content piece that is:

1. Attractive to a cold audience - it needs to be attractive to get you cheap video views/clicks/engagement for economics to work
1. Warming up the audience - The people who have viewed this type of content need to convert much better than any cold or warm audiences to have the economics work

-
As I said, this is the difficult approach, but it’s worth it when you are scaling to 6-figures a month in ad spend. 

---
##**Placements**

-
Facebook offers you a variety of placements, and it can be difficult to choose from. Here are the rules we use for placements

-
*Start broad and narrow down*

Start with automatic placements. It will give Facebook room to put your ads to audiences all over their network and give you initial data what’s right for you and what not. 
Usually, I see that automatic placements work much better than narrow ones lately

-
*Narrow down if you see a pattern*

If you notice that one placement is outperforming everything, or that one placement is just not giving you anything, focus on using or killing that placement.

-
*Blended conversions*

-
Facebook uses different placements to show your ads to people and increase conversions. So in a way, you can have assisted conversions with different placements. Facebook might show your ad to your audience on Audience network placement where it’s much cheaper, and then show them the same ad on the Facebook news feed. This way the ad will look familiar, and people are more likely to purchase if something is familiar to them.

-
**Keep this in mind when choosing placements.** 

-
*Preferred placements -* 

-
Facebook always has one placement that it prefers. When they roll out new placement for the ad, they will usually give you lower CPMs to get advertisers to hop on this placement.

-
At the moment of writing this, Instagram stories are still an underpriced asset and if you have creatives suitable for this placement, by all means, use it. 

-
New placement they introduced is Marketplace ads. Didn’t use it yet, but I suspect that it will be beneficial for local businesses and stores to utilize that placement early on.

---
##**Bidding** 

-
Old manual bidding is gone. But there are still some rules you can apply to get the best out for your money. 

-
You need to remember that Facebook as a platform still works as an auction process. This means that you are competing with other advertisers, and some markets might be more saturated than others.

-
There are two types of bid available as of writing this:

-
* Lowest cost bid - Facebook will try to get you as many conversions as possible for the money you spend daily
* Target cost bid - Facebook will make sure that throughout the conversion window you are getting a conversion at desired cost. 

The main difference is: 

* With Lowest bid cost Facebook will spend all of your daily budgets regardless of conversions
* With Target bid cost Facebook will only spend money if they can get you conversions for the desired price. 

-
This is the general rule, and it’s not applicable all the times, and in all situations.


-
##**Number of ads in an ad set**

-
Couple of rules of thumb - as you increase the budget on the ad set, you will want to have more working ads.

-
What seems to be the sweet spot is having four ads in one ad set. This by no means you need to have four ads and stick to this rule religiously. Sometimes for one ad set, you’ll only have one ad that is working well, sometimes you’ll have all four working well.

-
The general rule is that you will go over 4 in very rare cases - when you scale the budget very high or have a high frequency on a particular audience. 

-
Usually, it’s not the best to have 1 ad per ad set, as you are dependent on the performance of that one ad.

-
##**Decision-making framework**

-
You need to have a system that is easy enough for a noob to use. This will be based on the numbers that you can produce and your goals.

-
It goes like this: 

-
1. Determine and define your main metrics and proxy metrics
1. Determine how much are you willing to spend for exploration
1. Create custom preset in ads manager that will give you only the desired data
1. Set rules for certain situations
1. Automate rules using FB rule tool or 3rd party tool

---
##**Optimization**

-
Optimization of your campaigns is nothing more than identifying what numbers can you improve on, what are growth potentials, and what ads to kill (cutting the fat).

-
*What can you improve?*

So when you know What numbers you want, and you know what numbers can be improved upon → you allocate more time, resources in improving those numbers.


-
*What are the growth potentials?*

When you identify something as an obvious growth potential - like New retargeting audience segment (say blog) or a bunch of video views on one video → you allocate more time and resources in taking advantage of that opportunity.

-
*What ads to kill?*

And the biggest part of optimization is killing the bad performing ads and audiences. This is known as “cutting the fat,” and it’s essential to do. Your overall performance will be dragged down by bad performing audiences, so if you identify them early and kill them early once they haven’t spent much money, you will help yourself big time. 

-
I like to look at proxy metrics when deciding to kill ads as they will show you a better picture before KPIs. 


One of the metrics that I watch regularly is Cost per initiate checkout. Usually, my best performing ads will have great CPCheckout, and the ones that have slightly worse metrics, typically are bad performing ones. So when I notice that an ad set is performing slightly worse, or just plain bad on this metric, I will kill it. 

-
Looking at different time windows. Sometimes an ad set can seem to have a decent performance over lifetime period - but when you look at the seven-day window, and it’s not performing well, you need to cut this as this is another piece of fat that is reducing your overall efficiency of the ads. 

---
 
##**Scaling**

-
There is only one general rule for scaling - do what works for you. There are many strategies, but they don’t work all the time, for all the markets and all the messages.

-

###**Budget Scale**

-
Scale you campaigns by increasing budgets on your best-performing ad sets. There are a couple of ways to do it:

-
* Slowly increase the budget for the best-performing ad set (10%-15%) a day
* Ad set duplication


Duplicate winning ad set and slowly increase the budget

The best practice is to use another ad account

-
* Fast budget increase


Ex. Increase immediately from $20 - $100 

Leave for few days to optimize

-
* Immediate scale


When you know that you have a winning creative and audience

Put 3 ad sets with same targeting and copy and high budget ($500)

Leave the best performing, kill other ones

---
###**Audience scaling**

Sometimes increasing the budgets will mess up the performance of your ads. Meaning you will be back to square one. In this situation, you want to go horizontally and explore as many new audiences as possible to increase total budget spent. 

-
* Additional interests

Find additional interests similar to winning one's (Audience insights)

Use your buyer’s list in Audience insights to find more interests

-
* Lookalikes and additional lookalikes

Aim for at least 1000 buyers before creating

This is really the segment where you will find the most of new audiences

Get creative (highest value buyers, Cart abandonments, email list, multiple buyers, specific date range buyers, pixels, page visits etc.)

-
* Lookalike expansion

Go to 2% of the best performing 1% lookalikes

Up to 10%

-
* Pixel optimized audience

No targeting, just optimize with data from the pixel

Statewide, worldwide, regionwide

---
###**Optimization scale**

-
This is one of the advanced scales which is coming in the later stages. It works by either changing the objective of campaigns or changing the messaging of your ads to reach broader market:

-

* Change campaign objectives

Switch to clicks optimization

Go to Page post engagement (!)

Only with proven audiences, creatives, and funnels

-
* Messaging

Your message is only attractive to a certain part of the audience

Reach other parts of the audience with different messaging

---
###**Portfolio theory** Based on [Social Fulcrum](https://socialfulcrum.com/blog/tactics-sophisticated-marketers-portfolio-theory-audience-bidding/) 

-

Similar to investing portfolios. Instead of putting all of your budgets into one ad set - split it into segments:

-
* Different interests
* Age ranges
* Geography
* Messaging

-
This way you will have much more controlled CPA as you can reallocate the budget from bad performing audiences to the ones that are good. 

-
The main benefit of this strategy is less volatility if you need to be careful with your losses.

---
###**Automated rules scaling**

This one is a little bit technical. 

-
You want to take 10 (or any number of audiences you have working) of your best-converting audiences. Spread them into ten different ad sets. Set a very high budget (anything that you are comfortable with). 

-
**Set up automated rules to kill ad sets that didn’t have purchase within your KPIs** (you can be more aggressive here if you want to play it safe. Run the audiences for the day


-
This way, you will only have audiences that are producing positive ROI spending money, and the ones that aren’t converting that day will be killed early. 


-
At the end of the day, reset the audiences and repeat this next day.


-
The goal here is to go with really high budgets that you are willing to spend as you know that if it stops producing results, you will be profitable. 


-
This is an excellent way to scale as you will limit your potential downside with killing ads early if you don’t have conversions, and you will be open to the massive upside if Facebook can find people that will convert

931,4dmwqf,False,,190,"How blowing $20,000 made me learn to code.",Entrepreneur,"I thought my story would benefit some of you. 

Here's the link to the original article on [Medium](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-i-blowing-20-000-made-me-learn-to-code-84c05499b9d5#.7fch5hrb1).

Two years ago I started a company called NextMover. We were the first mover — pun intended — in the Uber for moving space. I’d won Startup Weekend Santa Barbara and raised $65k in seed funding at the event.

With tons of great momentum, we set out to get our first version of the product to market. We started with simple landing pages, spreadsheets, forms, and used Venmo and PayPal for payments. It was a pretty manual process but we were able to get our first customers and learn a lot.

**No one on my team knew how to code.**

We decided to hire a rails developer to build our first product.
Our developer assured us that he could build our app based off some mockups we gave him. We liked him and decided to move forward.
I’d never worked with a developer and didn’t understand exactly what I was asking him to build. I had no way of knowing if his quotes were reasonable or if the code was being built properly.

Every time we needed a change, it took way longer than I thought it should to put in place.

It felt like a game of telephone — everything got lost in translation.
Part of the problem was my inexperience. We created what I call “developer whiplash” with too many changes to the product specs. Seeing that something wasn’t working I decided to do my own digging. I recognized I needed to get more educated on what I was asking him to build.


As bad as it sounds, I’d never logged into GitHub.
I just didn’t realize how it worked. Ninety percent of the contributions on GitHub we’re not him. He’d been outsourcing our product to some guy in El Salvador.


**Queue cold sweat #1: We’d just lost $20,000 building a shit version of our product.**


**Mistake #1: Hiring the wrong developer and not knowing how to manage him.**


Even after taking such a big loss it didn’t really sink in just how badly we needed this skill set until I reached out to one of my mentors, Steve Blank.


Steve is an eight time serial entrepreneur and is a leading mind in the field of startups and innovation.


I was lucky enough to get him on the phone for about 30 minutes.
I walked Steve through all of the challenge we were facing when he stopped me to ask about the team. I said we didn’t have anyone who knew how to code and he cut me off.


“Alex… you don’t have a business… you have an idea on the back of a napkin…”


**Queue cold sweat #2: My business was just a napkin.**


As hard as it was to hear, I knew he was right. Not having the technical skill on our team to build our product was a deal breaker for any investor and for our business.


We didn’t have the skills on our team to prototype new ideas cheaply and all the evidence pointed towards a business model that wasn’t viable. We decided to cut our losses and close down the company.
Everyone went their separate ways and remained friends. I remain close with my angel investors and am so thankful that they gave me this opportunity. The lessons I learned while building Next Mover guide me everyday.


Lessons Learned:


Have the skills on your team to execute your vision.
Know enough about coding to hire right and prototype your product.


What I’m doing today.


I spent the next 2 years learning how to code. I built my first app in just 30 days and continue to test new ideas. Entrepreneurship and education are my passions. Thus, most of the products I’m building focus in these two areas. The hard lessons I learned motivated me to gain a new skill and led me to an amazing team at OpusLogica. I’m currently an Entrepreneur In Residence working with the Opus team to build SaaS business.

**Wow thanks to u/Rouxmire for awesome and insightful advice**

A bunch of people have been asking about my experience learning to code.

1. I used these services to learn Ruby on Rails. [One Month](http://mbsy.co/onemonth/18685779) then go to [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and then [GoRails](https://gorails.com/) these are my favorite courses that I've tried. If I had to start over I'd still do most of these courses but I'd focus more time on learning JavaScript. 

2. I think I'm close to intermediate level with my dev skills. While I'm far from an expert, my skills have helped me build the first version of my next business with out spending any money. With this product I'm getting my first customers and revenue. More importantly, and to some of the comments below, I've been able to inspire some very experienced software developers to join my team because they can see that I have traction and that I'll be able to communicate what I need built with them.

107,chj2vk,False,,292,"Side Hustle: How I'm making over 1,000/month calibrating TVs for middle aged wealthy people",Entrepreneur,"Just thought I would share this method since I'm pretty sure most of you won't bother actually trying it anyway. (No self-promotion)

It all started late last year when I was looking to buy a new tv for my room. As I browsed through all the major retailer websites I noticed an add-on service that best buy offered. **TV calibration** for **$250**. I was blown away. How could that possibly cost so much? Well apparently Best Buy has certified Geek Squad techs drive out to your home to calibrate your tv with some special equipment. I knew that I had to get in on that one way or another.

Later on I finally chose the tv I wanted (not from best buy) and when I went to set it up in my bedroom I gave more thought as to what it really would take to get the best picture quality. I then spent days going through youtube videos, blogs, forums learning as much as I could about tvs (I love watching movies). I ended up calibrating my tv the slow way-- going back and forth with the settings.

I was terribly curious about some of the tv calibration kits online. So using the justification that I would purchase one with the intent of becoming a professional tv calibrator I bit the bullet and bought one after doing my research.

When It finally arrived I began by resetting my tv to factory and using the device. It was much quicker than just eyeballing it and perhaps a bit improved over what I had thought was the optimal setting. So I then went one by one to family members houses and started adjusting their tvs. I learned a few tricks and became more comfortable using the equipment so I knew it was time to get in to business.

The first thing I did was design a few **facebook ads** with photoshop. The premise of the ads was to show side by side stills from movies and tv shows. One would be an ""HD"" still with the ideal color balance and next to it would be the same image but washed out (another version was an HD image side by side with a darkened still). I then posed the question ""Are you sure your TV is set up properly?""

The Ad then takes the individual to a landing page where I had visuals with more ""before and after"" calibration imagery but this time in the form of a youtube video. I also made it clear that my services included some cable organization, installing soundbars, WiFi troubleshooting (Thank God for Powerline Adapters), cord cutting solutions, and even streaming service selling^*

I made it clear what my competitor charged and how I was a local small business offering a great deal: **$150**.

Also a money back guarantee if they were unsatisfied. 

My ads targeted homeowners in wealthy neighborhoods (not middle class) People 40+ years of age. I have gone back and forth targeting men vs women but it seems women convert at a slightly higher rate (even though once in home the story usually goes ""my husband always complains..."")

In terms of delivering service I always make sure to finish up by comparing what the picture quality looked like before I got started vs after. I think its also pretty important to show the customers some basic functions of how to adjust the tv as the reality is you'll probably need to switch modes depending on how much light is in the room when you're watching something.

Its not enough to quit my job but I normally spend less than an hour in someones home and I usually do 2 per weekend so its definitely worth it for me.

I think the lesson here is find something a big business is doing and offer it to people in your area for a better deal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/chj2vk/side_hustle_how_im_making_over_1000month/,1126,Do you offer to refill their blinker fluid while you are there too?

For me it was an entirely positive experience and loved all parts of it. They've got their shit together and they treat you fairly.

**The Start**

So, the process from beginning until airing is a very long process. We submitted an application to the producers in September 2013 when we were doing $28k/month in sales. I then headed to Austin, TX in March 2014 where they had an open casting. We still had not heard back from the production and were planning on also attending that, but at the last minute decided not to. From talking with others, those open casting events are where they try to find the ""unique"" businesses. 

I'm glad we didn't sit in line for that, because about 2 weeks later the team from Shark Tank reached out to us and started the process of getting ready to be on the show. We didn't beg, or send multiple emails trying to get on. It was that one attempt with a compelling story and a successful business. We planned to move on with our lives if nothing happened. Can't build a business on a lottery opportunity.

**The Process**

Shark Tank is like the fight club. Once you start the process YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE SHARK TANK. You are signing more documents than when you buy your house. There are clauses in there to make you hurt for spoiling the show. So, DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT or you will ruin your chances of getting on the show. 

I'm not going to go into too many details about everything that is involved in the process, but basically Shark Tank want's to keep a positive image and be well regarded. They don't want some renegade entrepreneur going off shouting about how bad they are and how bad they got screwed. If you a reasonable entrepreneur, you should be able to comprehend the risks and weigh the rewards. If you can't, I'll lay it out for you.

**The Risks**

* You will spend hundreds of hours of your life, many resources, and never get on the show.
* You may get on the show, but they may not accurately portray what happened in the tank.
* You may not be able to handle the stress of the Tank and that gets shown publicly to millions of people.
* You may get the opportunity to be on another reality TV show and they can prevent you from doing it.
* The sharks could bash everything you've worked so hard to build - on national TV.
* Shark Tank tends to bring on companies without established brands, we didn't want to appear like a company that was just about the product.

**The Rewards**

* You could bring on a business partner who has more clout than almost all other investors in the world. 
* You get to tell your story to millions of people.
* You get to prevent your competition from getting up there and telling their story to the world.

**The Process Continued**

So, if your business is selected to move forward, you will need to do presentations to sell the producers on the idea of filming you. You've gotta have a lot of energy and make it look like you'll be good on TV. Crank it up a notch over comfortable. But you still need to be yourself and be comfortable. 

Invest in good sound and good video for these recordings. It doesn't have to be studio quality; but don't leave them struggling to hear you, or see you. My YouTube experience helped a little bit with this. If all looks good, you'll need to record your pitch and they'll help you write it and compress it.

Take the advice of the producers. Look, these people know what they are doing and they know what makes for good TV. If you make for good TV then you'll get on TV. Check your ego and listen to their advice. They've had 100's of entrepreneurs come through the door. Your producers are your friends. I still stay in touch with mine and love those guys. 

**The Pitch**

You are responsible for your stage & pitch. Because of the risk of not getting on TV, we decided to keep our stage pretty small. We rented some tables and shipped over a few boxes of products. Shark Tank supplied the TV. The table rentals and product shipments probably cost us about $500 all together. I wanted the focus to be on me, not the stage. In addition to that, the more simple I make something the less stressed out I'll be - thus more comfortable come pitch time. I let the Shark Tank team setup my table, even though I had full control of how it could look. I trusted them and they did way better than I could have.

So to prepare for the pitch I worked with our law firm who did research on our business, our competition, and what other entrepreneurs have done for deals. That firm who works with Microsoft, Alibaba, Amazon, and other notable companies valued our business at $4 million to $8 million. I also talked with other entrepreneurs, local VC individuals, and business partners. From that crowd we validation for the business to worth around the $6 million mark. I also factored in getting an offer for our business when we were doing $30k/month in sales and had us valued at $1 million.

So with those numbers, we took into perspective the unique opportunity a shark brings and dropped our valuation to $2.6 million with room to negotiate if they were interested in our company. With the 2 minute pitch you'll want to leave some teasers in there that leave them open to asking questions.

**The Sharks Questions**

So, you guys saw about 6 or 7 minutes of my time with the Sharks, but I actually spent around 45 minutes with them. I had them at the end of the day after they had already seen 10 other entrepreneurs. I got a sense that they were slightly tired, and they wanted the day to be over. 

Most of the questions were about the products and it's a bit of madness in there. The best way I can describe the Sharks is like a kid in a candy shop. Right after my pitch all five of them will ask questions simultaneously. If you have a preferred shark you want to partner with, you might want to give them top billing when answering questions. 

They get easily distracted and you need to reel them in and keep the conversation in control. You'll see on my pitch that they were really focused on the kit but I wanted to bring them back to the core product. They spent the majority of time just thinking the Beardsman Kit was what we were all about, but we brought that to help show our full product line. 

In hindsight it might have been better to just focus on one product and really win them over with that, rather than trying to sell the whole company. They aren't prepared to understand a company who is successfully branding because they never see that. My numbers rocked, and we spent very little time talking about the numbers. I felt very confident backing up our valuation, but the sharks didn't seem too interested in the market. I think Lori summed it up best when she said she can only imagine Amish as the target market. It's clear they don't interact with a lot of beardsmen on a daily basis.

**The Results**

Well, there are a bunch of theory's about how to take advantage of a sudden influx of visitors. I spoke with others who suggested doing a pop-up to collect email addresses and throwing out discounts to get sales. We felt very uncomfortable with that - as we've built our brand on quality pricing and non-intrusive shopping.

Yes, we are probably turning away thousands of dollars by not having a totally ""optimized"" website - but we think there are some intangibles that will play a role in the long run. We didn't want thousands of people's first impressions to be that we discount our products and that we annoy them with popups. 

In addition to that, I hear that companies who don't get deals don't have as impressive results as those who get deals. So take these numbers as a ""worst case scenario."" We also had our episode aired on a holiday (Halloween), so viewership was probably down.

So what did all this hassle do for our business? Well, why don't you see for yourself.

**Bullet Points**

* We've gone from about $4500/day to about $12k/day
* We got 20k visitors on Friday and Saturday of the show (40k total)
* Most concurrent visitors we had was during the East coast airing with about 6300 visitors

I don't know if this will be our new floor as it's only about 1 week after the show, but I'm hoping it is. If you have any questions, ask away and I'll answer if it's possible. 

There are a lot of more details that I can talk about, but don't want to write a novel. From here it's best that you ask questions and I'll answer them like I always do.

**TL;DR** I was on Shark Tank and made lots of money.

88,4uexyw,False,,263,"9 years after starting my first biz in my mom's basement, and 4 companies later - these are my biggest takeaways so far...",Entrepreneur,"It's hard to believe it's been 9 years. But it's been an epic journey, and as I start my 4th business I have been reflecting a lot. I started writing this for myself as a journal entry of sorts, but thought some of it may be of value to those of you who are just starting out. 

But first, a bit about my history. 

I have been the founder of 3 companies, and a partner (but not a founder) of one.

* An 8-figure business
* 2 x 7-figure businesses
* A 6-figure business

**My latest business: [Unbound Merino](http://www.unboundmerino.com)** Unbound launched 5 months ago (July 2016) and we've done over half a million dollars in revenue so far. We are on track to making 7 figures by the end of our first year. Definitely off to a killer start!!!

**First Company: [BizMedia](https://bizmedia.com)** Digital Video Agency did 60k in revenue in the first year, 600k in the second year, and by the third year was a 7-figure business from there on out.

**Second Company: [dbrand.com](https://dbrand.com)** Vinyl skins for smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles etc. Grew this business to almost an 8-figure business within 3 years before being bought out by the founder (and one of my best friends)

**Third Company: [Hitsu Socks](https://hitsusocks.com)** Online and retail manufacturers of funky socks designed by street artists. An epic journey that had me cycle through 4 different partners until I found my current partner who is an entrepreneur far beyond me who has taken this from a struggling, money losing (but fulfilling) side project into a real business with real legs which is finally a business doing 6-figures. But it was a real grind to find the path with this one. Happy to say it's on the path to real growth.


The night after launching my most recent business I couldn't sleep much. I was very happy with the launch but my head was spinning and I couldn't stop thinking about all the different experiences I've had over the years and how it's shaped me. All the people I've met and worked with, all the mistakes I've made, all the lucky breaks I've gotten, and so on and so on. So I started writing some of these things down, not with the intent of sharing them - but more so just to get all the reflections out of my head and on to paper. Thought maybe it would help me sleep. It did. Anyway - these are some of the lessons of my 9 year journey. It's not in any particular order and a lot of this is just rambling. But hopefully some of you can take some value from this. And if you have any questions I am happy to answer!

**Go save money!** It costs a ton of money to start most businesses. You don't have to be rich to start a company. I was broke as all hell when I started. But I freelanced as a videographer and editor to get the funds to start my first business while waiting tables on the side. I would rather wait tables and save $20k and start from there than start a business for $500 like a lot of threads I see on here suggest is possible (which it is!). But while you technically CAN start a business with just $500 and be really successful, that is a crazy steep hill to climb. And getting traction with a $500 startup I am willing to bet would take longer than going and waiting tables, saving $20k and starting with that money. You can always tinker with a $500 startup on the side of making and saving funds working a job.

**Forget your social life** It's not important. It never was and it never will be. Unless of course your social circle is directly related to your line of work / your startup. I mean, people who could help you, work with you, you could sell to, etc. Just because you went to high school with someone and you like them, doesn't mean you need to go waste time with them at the bar on Friday nights. Friday night is a time when 95% of the world is taking a break, what a time to get ahead. If people get mad at you for not coming out any more, tell them you want to focus on your startup. If they can't understand and support that - you don't want those people around anyway. 

**SALES - the most important word in business** Sales is the most important skill you can ever obtain. Good sales people are the most under appreciated and rare breed of people you could ever find. Keep sales people around you. Go to sales seminars, find entrepreneurs who say the word ‘sales’ over and over again, who’s only concern is sales. They have all the answers you are looking for. I can't stress this enough. In business sales fixes every problem. You need to understand the mindset of the people who's lives are sales. The most successful entrepreneurs have sales blood. 

**Join and be involved in organizations that better you** I spent years in Toastmasters learning to be a better public speaker, then I joined the board of trade (tried for a year but wasn't a huge fan), then I joined EO (Entrepreneur's Organization). In every year of my journey as an entrepreneur I was a member of, and heavily involved (usually at the board level) in some kind of organization. This is a great way to meet people who are growth oriented and care to see you succeed. The people you meet in these organizations are the types of friends you want close to you. It may take you a while to find an organization that you take lots of value from, but look for it. And don't just pay your dues and expect results, put in and contribute. The more you give, the more you can take out. Being on the board and regional council of EO has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and it's helped me through all of the biggest challenges I've faced as an entrepreneur. I don't know where I would be without the support of the brilliant people in EO Toronto. 

**Start on something now** While I said go save money before diving in, I didn't mean you shouldn't be starting in some capacity. Even if you're just researching, planning, blogging, maybe doing a side project selling some soap you make at home or something, find something you can make or source, or a service you could provide today - and start selling. You could be an entrepreneur by tonight if you wanted. All that matters is you have something to sell and you find someone to buy it. Anything. If you get someone to buy something off you, you're gaining invaluable skills that will compound over time. Experience is everything. So get started on something, even if you have bigger plans for later. Oh, and if it fails miserably. That's a great outcome. Which brings me to my next point, and probably the most important...

**There is no failure really. Only feedback** That's a line stolen from Jeffrey Gitomer the sales author. But what the hell is failure really? You tried something and the outcome was different than your hallucination? Failure is FEEDBACK. And it's the feedback that is only given to those who have the balls to try. I would rather be a man with 100,000 failures in life than someone who hasn't tried to do shit. At least I'll be able to write a book about what not to do at the end of the day. Maybe I'll have a really sweet reddit post that will get me lots of karma. OR maybe my experience will take me to the place I was looking for all along. You can look at the list of companies I've founded and think I've been successful, but I left out all the failures I've endured in the process. The gut wrenching, nightmare inducing fuck ups. But they all help in the end. The key is to never ever let a failure slow you down. Failure will give you that feeling that you need to stop and reconsider your direction. Just learn from the failures and go harder. The path just becomes clearer and easier to navigate after each failure. As long as you have the will to not let them break you. Feedback. It's freaking feedback.

**Earn Cash, Don't Burn Cash** Build a business that doesn't burn cash, but earns cash. It's so 101, but I'm amazed at how easy it is for people to forget. Don't spend anything that won't make you more money in return. Be ruthless about this. I've blown more than $1MIL that I probably didn't need to over the past 5 years on stupid shit that I am now embarrassed of. And it's came close to devastating and ending my business. You don't need to grow your staff and the size of your office, unless you NEED TO. Stack your money, and guard it. Again, it seems 101 but I admit I have made some pretty dumb decisions spending myself, and so many people around me are guilty of the same thing. 

**GOALS** I think this will apply to those of you who already have a company, or the early seed of a company. Have a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal - a term from Jim Collins book Good to Great). A BHAG is a vision of where you can take your business if things go BEYOND WELL and you are incredibly lucky and everything goes amazing, 25 years out. So if you're in video you may say you want to create the next HBO or something. Something that is so big that it's almost unreasonable based off of your reality today. The only reason you need a BHAG is because it sets the direction, no other reason. From the BHAG, figure out where you could be in 3-5 years if things go well. The 3-5 year goals need to be leading you towards the BHAG. For example, you want to have $10-15MIL in revenue and one online show concept that has XX million subscribers on YouTube and 3-5 corporate sponsors. I'm just pulling these out of my ass but you get the point. From the 3-5 year goals, find your 1 year goal. Things get real now. What is realistic within 1 year that is in the direction of your 3-5 year goals? Maybe have 5 big corporate video clients (for revenue) but also to have 2 YouTube shows with original content already in production (the early attempts at making big time original content in the future). AND THIS IS WHERE THE BEST PART COMES IN. The quarterly goals. Nothing is more real than a quarterly goal. 3 months is the perfect amount of time to conquer one meaningful and sizeable project that moves you in the direction or your 1 year goal. Maybe it's to have your corporate website up, to have show concepts and pilot scripts written. Whatever. There's nothing pie in the sky about this. You have 3 months to do it. And it takes you towards your 1 year goal, which is a step towards your 3-5 year goals, which are aimed at your BHAG. It's ALL about direction. You can always tweak the long term goals as you go, but the quarterly goals MUST be set in stone and executed against. We break our quarterly goals into weekly and even daily action plans. Take the whole project and map it out over the 3 months and stay on time. Trust the plan. Get in the trenches. Get to work. 

**Expose yourself to feedback** And let it sting. This really hit home with me recently. My EO forum (group of 8 other entrepreneurs who meet monthly) all recently went on a forum retreat to New York City. We met with another member of EO from a chapter over there. I am not allowed to share who it was because there are very strict confidentiality rules in place for EO. But, he's a business titan. He recently sold his company for over $800MIL USD and he took us in and told us all about building his company and what he's up to now, and took us for lunch and really spent some good time with us. He's working on a new project and he was so eager to get our feedback on it. Now it's important to know that while the businesses in my forum are all multi-million dollar companies, none of us are quite at the level of being sold for $800MIL. Not even close. But he was so keenly interested in our take on his new business, that it really made me realize that he's just an obsessive tester. He gets as much info as he can from wherever he can. We may not be as big as him, but we're all entrepreneurs and that was enough for him to truly want to dig into our thoughts on his direction. I started being more aggressive in my hunt for feedback on what I do, and it's amazing to open yourself and your ideas up like that. Even my recent Indiegogo campaign was completely shit on by a few of my colleagues which stung so much. But ultimately led me to make very pivotal changes last minute that made the campaign way way better. Find mentors, and seek feedback. Be open to what you hear. This may be obvious to some but it took me a while to learn and be more open to it. 

**If doing business internationally, have a mentor** I do a lot of importing from China and I've wasted so much time and money learning lessons the hard way. I then started seeking help from a friends friend who does tons of business in China, and in one hour he taught me enough to completely change the way I get things done with overseas suppliers. If only I met him earlier, I would have saved SO MUCH FUCKING TIME AND MONEY. If you are dealing with people overseas, find someone to give your pointers and guide you. This actually applies to every aspect of business. But the importing thing is fresh in my mind. 

**Don't be an egotistical prick**  In your 20’s you are at your peak of energy and there is very little you can do wrong. Fucking up is a gift and the repercussions of doing so in your 20’s are next to nothing. But don’t ever think you’re smarter than those who have been in the game longer. You may have insights they don’t have because you’re younger – but experience is the best teacher there is. And your ego can easily piss off older people who probably have a ton to teach you and likely would really enjoy helping you. So keep your ego to yourself and surround yourselves with people who are older and wiser than you. And be grateful and have your ears wide open. 

**You're the average of the 6 people close to you** If 1 person in your immediate circle isn't ambitious, hard working, smart, helpful and generally and awesome person... Get them the hell out of your immediate circle. Your close circle is the most important asset you have. Don't mess it up by having a douche bag in there. Because then you're 1/6th douche bag yourself. 


**Passion / Purpose** People always have advice about following your passions, or ignoring you passions to find purpose and yadda yadda yadda. Just fucking learn skills and make each day count. Come up with an idea and a plan and get to work. There's nothing wrong with having passions, but I don't see why everyone tangles passions into your work. I love music, but I don't need to make my money writing songs about my achy breaky heart or some shit. I'm happy having music be in my life as I passionately learn and work hard and try to grow my businesses. Learning how to make a business work is just as fun as playing guitar or ice hockey or eating an amazing cheeseburger. It doesn't matter if your business is a new social app, or you manufacture industrial cleaning products. The mechanics of starting a company or simply improving yourself are enough to be super passionate about. I never thought growing up I would be selling socks. I just go through life trying to solve problems and get better every day. So there, my purpose is making each day count towards my longer term goals. 

**Have an accountant in your circle** Accountants speak the language of business better than anyone else. Have a good one in your corner, and have one as a friend to help you with a second opinion. Even better, hire one who no longer wants to be an accountant. Have them help you keep your books clean and to mentor you to understand how to really make sense of your P&L. Know your P&L like you know the back of your hand and stay on top of it. 

**It's going to get real hard**  And when things are the worst, give yourself 5 min to wallow in your own shit and then write down where you want to be, then write down what actions you can do today that would set you in that direction. You can’t do anything more than what those actions for that day are, so just do that. It’s all you can do. And it’s the right thing to do. Nothing to be bummed out about anymore, you’re doing your best and you’re going in the right direction. 

**Picking a business to get into** From what I've experienced - the best businesses to get into are those where you feel all the current offerings that exist suck. When dbrand was founded, it came from the realization that all the now competitors actually made garbage skins. For some reason, nobody was doing a good job at making skins. The soil was fertile for that business. My friend started a hair extension business called Luxy Hair. It came from his wifes terrible experience trying to find good quality extensions online for a good price. They couldn't find it, so they created it. It's a multi-million dollar business today. And my new business Unbound, we created it for us (my partners and I), after having no luck finding anything that was the right look, fit and quality. We made this company at a time when the soil is fertile for growth. My sock business on the other hand was founded in a very crowded market. It took 2 years just to find our niche, and only now are we seeing any traction. We got excited because socks were so popular. That isn't the smartest time to start a business. It's a lot tougher. 

And lastly...

**Entrepreneurship isn't for everybody** I fell into this and it's become me. At times being an entrepreneur sucks. Really. I have many days and weeks where I have no idea how I got myself into this. But I am built to handle the shit storm and not break down. Not everyone is like that. For some people having a good job that you can stop thinking about at 5pm is a much better life. There are amazing upsides to entrepreneurship, but if you aren't fit for handling the really hard and ugly side, be smart enough to avoid it. Entrepreneurs have great stories, but you often don't hear the ones about those who never made a 7 or 8 figure business. There are a lot of casualties in this line of work. And it sucks so bad so often. BUTTTT. When it doesn't suck, It's FUCKING AWESOME!!! Just be ready to not let the feeling of roasting in the fiery ditches of hell with no way out in sight get to you. And when things are great, don't let that get to you either.

I have no idea if anyone will read this. But it felt good to write. And sorry if there are any typos or grammatical errors. No way I'm reading all of this. I need a beer. 

All the best!

Hello everyone my name is Josh Shogren and I am currently a Freshman in college. I have some money saved from my niche sites that make me over a $1k a month and I am in the process of selling one of my niche sites for $14,000. I have decided that I am going to put some of this money towards starting a new private label business on Amazon through their FBA program.&nbsp;


I have also decided to not go the route of buying a $4,000 course and I am going to figure everything out on my own. That means that I am going to use only free information on the internet and learn by doing and making mistakes. I know a lot of people want to get into this business but don't have the extra money to spend a ton of money on a course and have to pay for all of their initial inventory.&nbsp;


I will act as a test dummy for all of you and try to make some money on Amazon with only free information. I will be updating everyone as I go along. I posted the [introduction post](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/follow-along-as-i-try-to-make-money-with-amazon-fba-introduction) last night on my website and you can read what I said below. I have cut out some of the fluff and only kept the most important parts of the article.&nbsp;


Thank you for reading and I hope this is something that will be of interest. The next update will be out soon!&nbsp;


**What Can You Expect from me and this Case Study?**&nbsp;

I am going to be documenting all of my progress as I try and get a product up onto Amazon. I have not taken any paid courses about private labeling products or any type of course related to what I am going to be doing. I have found everything online for free and that is where I have gotten all of my information at this point. My plan is to absorb all of the information I can for free and figure everything else out on my own all while posting everything I find here for all of you.&nbsp;


As I go through the process of getting my first product on Amazon and selling, I will be explaining every step for you guys to learn from and follow. I would rather save $3,500 and use that for my inventory and on learning by doing then on a course. By not following the course and doing things on my own I will act as a crash course dummy. I will be a test dummy for all of you that want to get started selling on Amazon but don’t have enough money to buy the course AND all of your inventory.&nbsp;


My plan is to update you all very regularly as I go through the process of finding a product, finding a supplier and getting it on Amazon. It is not going to be that simple and there are a lot more details that go into private labeling a product and selling it but I will cover it all as I go through it myself.&nbsp;


**How Will I Be Updating the Case Study?**&nbsp;

I will be posting new updates very frequently on the site and I will show you every step of the way from beginning to the end. I will make use of videos a lot in this case study because I will be able to show you exactly what I am talking about visually instead of trying to explain everything through writing. I am going to be making videos for the niche research process, product selection, supplier selection and many other parts of the process that I feel are important.&nbsp;


I might even do some webinars to help answer questions that people may have or start a Facebook group for people that are looking to start selling on Amazon but don’t want to spend a ton of money on learning from a course. Instead, we can all learn together as a group and help each other out when possible. I am also open to suggestions that any of you may have so let me know!&nbsp;


**I Have Already Started….but I Will Catch You All Up**&nbsp;

I have already settled on a product that I am going to be selling but that is as far as I have gotten. I still am in the process of finding a good supplier that will do everything that I need.&nbsp;


The good news is that I will still have videos and updates covering the part that I have already completed. I will go through the whole process and explain every step. There will be a couple of updates to this case study that will come out here in the next week or two that will catch you all up to the point where I am at currently, which is looking for a supplier.&nbsp;


Even though I am already a little ahead, I am still going to be updating the case study from the very beginning of the process and explaining each step of the way. The next couple of updates will be coming out at a quick rate so that I can catch you all up to where I am currently at as quick as possible.&nbsp;


**Will I be Sharing my Exact Product?**&nbsp;

I am not sure yet. I don’t want to risk sharing my product and niche and then have people either a) try to sabotage my project or b) bring in extra competition that there wouldn’t be otherwise.&nbsp;


But I do see the benefit of sharing my product so I can use that as my example in everything I do in this case study. I am pretty torn on this decision and I am still deciding, I would love to hear what you all think about this. So please let me know in the comments below.&nbsp;


**Will This be Free?**&nbsp;

YES.&nbsp;


This whole case study is 100% free and I am not going to sell you anything. I am doing this because I want to document my progress as well as help people succeed on Amazon who don’t have the extra money to spend on courses.&nbsp;


I think I have a pretty good grasp on what I need to do to be successful on Amazon but I will be constantly learning and everything that I learn will be shared here, with you.&nbsp;


**Conclusion** &nbsp;

I hope this post wasn't too long and that you are all interested in following my journey. All of the updates will be posted here - [my site](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com) but I will also be posting the updates here as much possible.&nbsp;

636,4rce93,False,,135,"This subreddit is full of stories of success. I have a few of them, but far more businesses I have tried to start failed. Here are some of the worst.",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit. There are so many stories of success on here I thought it would be interesting to hear about some failures.

I have started a popular coffee shop, created a successful sporting goods brand and built and sold a tech startup.

That all sounds great. A lovely fairy tale of success. But it's not the whole story. 

The true story is that along the way I tried to start a lot of other business that totally failed. Costing me thousands of hours and enough money that it still makes me feel ill. 

Including:

**A social network.**
Yes, I tried to become the next Mark Zuckerburg. And failed. 

**A dropshipping clothing business for a music niche.**
A 10% margin and small-time bedroom business suppliers was a disaster waiting to happen.

**A car importing business.**
Importing went fine. But it took almost a year to sell just three cars.

**A gambling affiliate site.**
Lost the equivalent of a deposit on a house trying to build something I have no interest in and think is slightly immoral.

**A web development firm.**
As a student, I assumed it was an easy way to make money. But I'd never built a website before and turned out to be rubbish at it.

**An educational site to teach students how to make money.**
Actually made some money, but nowhere near enough to cover the time and work that was put into it.

On top of those I tried countless get rich quick schemes, played and got played by the stock market, and bought into a few random rubbish and very small-time companies (a face painting business, an events firm, a carbon trader).

They say: fail fast, fail often. 

Well, I don't know about that, but I do know that without the lessons I learnt from these failures I would never have succeeded in the other businesses.

196,3e70uu,False,,264,"$50k a month with lead gen guy here again, If I had absolutely nothing and had to start from the beginning with $0, what would I do in detailed steps...",Entrepreneur,"Hello again.  

I have been trying my best to answer every reply I can, I have also tried answering almost every PM that I can.  I've got tons of pending skype msgs but I will get back to you later on, I promise.  Currently, I am traveling in Indiana for a day to finalize a few operators.

First, I would like to clear a few things.  I don't have anything to sell you.  I am not selling any ebooks or have a plan down the line to send you to a website to pay me money.  If I ever do that, please ban me.  Secondly, if we chat on skype, after the conversation, please remove me from your log, I don't need your personal information in anyway so you don't feel I am going to try to sell you something later on.  Lastly, I am only helping people out.  It's how my parents raised me, it's what my religion teaches me, it's who I am, if you personally knew me, you'd know I go out of my way to help you in anyway I can. No bull shit, all up front, the real deal.  

Let's get right to it.  

Everyone asked me a lot of questions, by far the highest ranked question would be,""What and how can I start a business with the operator model?""  Even though I was trying to share my secret I stumbled upon for lead generation, it seems many were interested in operator structure as well.

So, I have $0.  Let's say bad credit as well and at the same time no one out there to help me financially.  All my friends are as broke as I am.  What I do have, however, is knowledge, lots of it, from reading a lot.  I honestly and truly believe I've read more than some college graduates.  Keep this advice handy.  

1 - What do I love and I am passionate about?  I like computers, anything tech, internet stuff, good food. (I would write all this down and make a detailed list)  
2 - First, I need to make money, I want to do something with computers.  
3 - Work at a computer store, any where I can, best buy, local pc store, dell, hp, any where you can. The money I make isn't important, the experience I gain is much more important.  Make sure you're targeting a industry that has a good future.  
4 - I start working and saving up, 6 months, year, however long it takes.  Keep saving.  
5 - Now it's time to start making more money, I start utilizing business cards and craigslist posts.  I post ad's online in the closest metroplex around me to see what sort of leads I get.  The ad must be catchy and interesting.  It shouldn't say, I fix your computers, call me.  Something more like, *Computer GENIUS who can fix all your problems for a flat fee of only $25.*  Once you're in the customers door, you upsell.  Play with test ads, you'll see the $25 get a huge response, maybe 100x more responses.  It works.  I visit the customer, fix the problem if its software related for $25, upsell open source virus programs and what not for an additional $75, $100 or more.  You can't charge for free stuff but you charge for your time.  
6 - I dress professionally, buy a shirt with a brand/logo on it, file for company name under a few hundred dollars that I've made already.  
7 - Now time to open my first store?  I don't think so.  This is where many people screw up.  They rush it.  First, you need to make sure your service will have demand.  In retail, a block makes a difference.  Keep in mind, real estate is king.  If you're a doctors office, you can be in the middle of the forest, it doesn't matter, people will look for you and find you.  It's not like that for other businesses, that's why they pay prime for real estate.  Location is key.  
8 - I can start from my own garage, let's say I live in an apartment, so I start looking for busy electronic stores (mom/pop).  
9 - Approach one or many, cell phone stores, electronic stores, etc.. are perfect.  Offer them a cut from my profits for using a small space in the back of their store, all I need is a counter.  Test it out. Play with it.  I realize now, people are breaking their phones left and right, I need to watch youtube videos and learn this as well.  I take the time do to so, next thing you know, I am now a valuable asset to this electronic store.  Build clientell.   
10 - I've got a lot of money saved now, at least $10k.  I start looking for sublet opportunities.  I dont' have credit, it'll be extremely tough for me to get approved, therefore I start looking for someone who already has a lease and for whatever reason couldn't run their business and need someone else to run anything they want in the store as long as they sublease it from them.  I have no risk this way, sublease in many cases comes with zero liablities, it's a temporary gig approach.  
11 - I get a small sign made, not from signarama or one of those high end companies, go on dhgate.com or alibaba.com and find a sign company over seas for a flat sign or a light box.  Don't need channel letters right now.  
12 - Look for some quick used showcases, something like this - https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=store+showcases  
13 - Cheap and affordable, fill up your small store, work 9-9 daily.  You have to work hard.  
14 - How the forumla works :  
No hard work = No good results.
Some hard work = Some good results.
110% = 110% results.  

This is the magic answer, that's it.  Nothing else.  

15 - Grow customer base, 6 months - year.  
16 - Post ad on bizbuysell.com / other businesses for sale sites locally saying, ""BE YOUR OWN BOSS, Run Your own Computer store! Existing customers and extremely profitable!""  
17 - Find a hungry operator, similar to yourself, he might be in the same shoes you were in few months/year or two ago.  
18 - If he has money, great, use it as a fee for yourself.  Give the operator 85% of the business, even 90 works.  
19 - I now have funds do start my second store, this time I also have more leads and more money from others who are interested in investing.  
20 - Time to repeat and grow.  


I am not saying this is the only method that will work, it's just one way that has worked for me and can work for anyone.  It can be applied in any industry :

Nail Salon Business  
Hair Salon  
Food Cart  
Web Development  
App Development  
Lawn Care  
Lead Gen.  
Construction / Contractor  
So many options...  

I don't care what industry you're in, even if you're a doctor, I know a doctor that has 3 offices with a similar setup.  This operator model isn't something I invented, it's the same concept all the franchises in the world are already doing, which is finding the right investor/business man to grow and run their businesses with.

1 - Year 1 - 10% residual from one operator.  (Work hard on making them successful, this can help you with future operators)  
2 - Year 2 - 10% residual from 2 to 4 operators.  (Work even harder and hire help)  
3 - Year 3 - 10%  from a dozen ore more operators and start getting creative, become Mr. Wonderful from shark tank :)  

Before you know it, you're making 1000's a month in residual from great operators.  You can tap into a ton of other business ventures now.  

These are just realistic goals that any one can do.  I have done the same thing with 4 foot carts that sell chicken and rice, I plan on doing the same thing across the nation with them as they are extremely successful.  The list goes on and on...

Any questions, post it on here and I'll respond when I can.  I'm still going to get you guys the video when I fly back out of Indiana tonight and have it posted by Friday hopefully.  This wraps it up - I need to wash up now and pray, good luck to you all.

541,aqle0u,False,AMA,193,"3 years ago, I was 🤬 of being a ""business guy with an idea"" and learned to code. Last week, I launched my first SaaS app.",Entrepreneur,"\[Sorry resubmitting, previous post disappeared\]

&#x200B;

Business guys. You know, the Patagonia vest wearing tribe of people who have bold visions but can't tell you a thing until you have signed an NDA. The ones who are always one developer away from becoming a billionaire.

&#x200B;

**Yup. I was one of them**\--save the Patagonia🧥, I never liked that look.

&#x200B;

I graduated from a top undergrad business school and established a career in management consulting / corporate strategy on Wall Street. I'm not trying to humble brag. I'm just illustrating *how deep in this shit I was*.

&#x200B;

I had ideas, loads of them. I even tried to execute a few of them--that's a story for another post. But I was always missing something, someone. **A mythical developer** who was willing to risk the odds and put in the hard work in exchange for ""equity"". And it's not like I didn't try to find her. I networked, hard. Name a tech meetup in NYC or an online startup forum, there's a good chance you would have found me there.

&#x200B;

At some point, it occurred to me that developers are not averse to risk or good ideas. **Developers are averse to people.** **People who have no track record of bringing products to life, don't understand technology, and think ""that feature should only take a few days to build"".** I needed to demonstrate that I'm different. I wanted to speak their language and show that I am willing to put in the hard work, day in and day out, to turn an idea into reality.

&#x200B;

So I taught myself how to code. I knew a bit of Java from high school, but next to nothing about web development. **My ultimate goal** was to develop an idea, research the market & customers and launch an MVP. Little did I know that it would take me three years. **Three long years** of juggling 80+ hour work weeks with social life and spending all my remaining time on coding. Why am I telling you all this? Mainly to assuage my bruised ego for taking so long 😭.

&#x200B;

**But was it worth it? Absolutely**. Being able to combine corporate strategy with technology has been a game changer for my career. It has also helped me understand just how difficult it is to go from an idea > research & test > plan > product. Ideas are truly worthless.

&#x200B;

Now for the next challenge--grow the customer base and find that unicorn tech co-founder. Or just hire developers. I have options now. **Moral of the story:** don't wear Patagonia vests. And if you are a fellow business guy with no track record of launching startups, maybe try coding.

&#x200B;

If there is interest, I'd love to write a follow up detailing either my learning process or how I researched and built my app.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading. Thoughts and criticisms are welcomed.

730,c8b0g3,False,,98,How I Make Money Off 4th of July Festivities: Selling Glow Sticks!,Entrepreneur,"So in my area, there are a couple different fireworks shows between June 29 - July 6. To capitalize off the festivities, I sell glow bracelets, necklaces, and glasses at the shows! I can usually get the glow sticks in bulk at around $0.05/stick. I then sell them at:

*  $0.50/bracelet (One glow stick with a bracelet connector), 
* $2.00/necklace (four glow sticks connected together),
* and $1.50/pair of glasses (2 glow sticks with special glasses connector pieces)

&#x200B;

I carry them around on a display made out of PVC pipe, and usually recruit a cousin or sibling to help me sell. 

&#x200B;

Here's the results for the show we went to on the 29th:

I spent about $15 in product and had my younger brother help (I held the display, while he made the change and helped people get the bracelets off). I kid you not, as soon as we took the display out of our vehicle, people started running up to us demanding our products. We had a window of around an hour to sell before the show, and during that time, they sold like crazy. All we had to do was slowly walk around and people would either come running up to us or yell for us to come to where they were sitting. 

&#x200B;

We covered maybe half of the viewing area, and made around $120 during that time.

695,ej3bfl,False,,49,I quit 12 years of government work to start a mushroom farm! - UPDATE!,Entrepreneur,"Hey team, Tom here from Oak and Spore.

Here is the link if anyone missed it and wants to check it out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/e8mtcr/i\_quit\_12\_years\_of\_government\_work\_to\_start\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/e8mtcr/i_quit_12_years_of_government_work_to_start_a/)

Anyway after posting about it on this sub, user u/avemk messaged me and said she happened to be visiting New Zealand and staying in Governors bay, which is just around the road from the farmers market I sell my mushrooms at, and that she would stop in and say hello! Pretty cool having an internet stranger come by your little business. Avery stopped by and had a chat, and it turns out she runs a new podcast which interviews people from different walks of life. She asked if she could interview me for her podcast, which I thought was a fantastic opportunity!

We organised a date, and she came to my property to look at my mushroom farm and give me an interview about quitting my job and starting a mushrooms farm. The story covers my life quitting the armed services and Police, and diving head first into a mushroom farm.

266,atjai5,False,,79,I Reached Out to 30+ Navy Seal instructors and asked what are the top characteristics that get students through training. Thought their answers apply to us.,Entrepreneur,"I've always been interested in high performers pushing the bounds of human strength and endurance. Starting and running a business is tough. 70% of businesses [fail after the first 10 years](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail). 75% of Seal candidates wash out.

I reached out to Dozens of **Former** Navy Seal instructors and asked them ""What are the main physical, mental, or personal traits that they saw in students that succeed vs those that failed?""

Here are some of their responses.

&#x200B;

""There have been many studies, many stories and books written on who/what does it take to make it through BUD/S, bottom line it is mental fortitude to endure challenges and most of all being a Teammate.""

""Most of the guys that quit are the ones that wanted the title, uniform, recognition, etc. SEAL training is not good for you. That’s why you need to have a good reason to go.""

""There have been many studies done on guys that made it through training and they have not found a common denominator yet. Some are big, some small, some smart, some dumb, none quit. I believe that it has to be for the right reasons.""

""Most students are already Olympic caliber athletes and mentally and physically superior to most of their common peers. It comes down to one word when they hit that wall, desire.""

""Each person has to discover that \[motivation\] on their own. For some it’s worth it, for most, it’s not. That’s what makes us elite.""

""We could never tell who was going to make it. It all had to do with each persons mental toughness. There were many times I was at first surprised, but then you see the mental strength of that person come through. Rarely was it the biggest or most fit guys who made it. It was usually the guys who were used to fighting for everything their whole lives. Best way to put it is, BUD/s doesn’t make potential SEALs, it finds them.""

&#x200B;

It was interesting as I was reading their answers some common things came up. It wasn't the fact that they were the fittest. Many were surprised when weaker students would make it. Mental toughness was mentioned a lot. More than physical fitness

But even more interesting was the underlying trait that drove mental toughness.

Words like ""desire"", ""right reasons"", ""good reason"". These all boil down to their **why.** It's what drove them to push past the walls.

Starting a business is tough. You may not be the most talented, smartest or capable in your industry, but that doesn't matter. We hit walls and it takes a strong mental toughness to push through. But what pushes us it is our ""why"".

&#x200B;

"" I would say, i didn't know who was going to ring the bell.  Quiet determination is the main characteristic. I had classmates that surprised me, but students were all kind of like lumps of clay that could be formed. You make it if you leave yourself with no choices. ""

"" Mental toughness and having no plan B... knowing the goal was to be a SEAL and not simply to get to or even just to get through BUD/S... starting with the long game in mind - I wanted to be a SEAL... do what SEALs do... be a part of an elite brotherhood... I didn’t just want to go to BUD/S. Quitters go to BUD/S... ""

"" There is always special surprising moments and unpredictable candidates who pass and there is very little predictions on who may or may not quit.  It is challenge to truly understand what that mental focus is and what drives an individual across the finish line..., and it does not stop after BUD/S.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/atjai5/i_reached_out_to_30_navy_seal_instructors_and/,789,"> booya

21,ge9swn,False,Lessons Learned,288,I changed careers and went from $40k to $100k in one year.,Entrepreneur,"Eight months ago, I changed my life completely. I went from being severely depressed, unfulfilled, and frustrated, working 50 hour weeks, barely earning above minimum wage, to landing my dream job, and more than doubling my salary. 

I’m sharing my experience because when I first began this journey, I would have loved to have heard a story like mine. 

After 7 years as a hairdresser, it became clear I was on the wrong path. Having always loved writing, I became determined to pursue a career in copywriting. 

The problem was, I had no idea where to start. 

When I researched ways to transition into the industry, every resource said I’d have to go back to college and study. I didn’t want to waste another 3 years, accumulating enormous debt for a piece of paper that I knew wouldn’t make a difference. I needed to find a different way to reach my goal.

Here are the steps I took to change from hairdresser to copywriter, without a degree, and without an internship.  


**1. Shift your mindset.**

I had to unlearn everything I thought I knew about how to build a successful career, starting with challenging the belief that I wasn’t capable, or deserving of the career and life I truly wanted. These limiting beliefs mean most people just settle for a job they can tolerate, not the life they want. 

I read the work of many successful female entrepreneurs to learn about how they overcame their own self-sabotaging beliefs, as well as researching material online about how to handle “imposter syndrome.” I have an entire hype-board on Pinterest, purely to remind myself that I am deserving of a seat at the table.  


**2. Find a mentor**

I ""apprenticed"" myself to my friend who is a successful entrepreneur and runs several digital businesses. Find someone who has been successful in the niche you’re interested in and ask them for help. If you ask for help, the majority of the time, you’ll receive it. Successful people have been where you are now. When someone who genuinely wants to achieve what they have, asks for help, they are almost always more than willing to give it.  


**3. Research**

I researched on Goodreads to see which books were consistently mentioned as being the best across marketing and copywriting. 

These included:

* *Mastery,* Robert Greene
* *Daily Rituals*, Mason Currey
* *On Writing Well,* William Zinsser
* *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook,* Joseph Sugarman
* *Ca$hvertising,* Drew Eric Whitman
* *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,* Robert B. Cialdini
* *The Copywriter’s Handbook,* Robert W. Bly

A key part of my process with these books is to take notes as I go, and either create or find online, a book summary once I’ve finished reading. I keep a Google Drive folder just for book summaries and I refer to them at least once a month to refresh my mind.

I did one online copywriting course that I actually found here on Reddit, which turned out to be incredible. The thread is still up if you want to [check it out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/aiwymi/i_make_around_300000_a_year_as_a_freelance/)   


**4. Start TODAY.**

I practiced as much as possible, journaling daily, writing on Medium, and submitting work to sites. I gained experience by working for my friend to practice working to a brief, following a word count, and meeting deadlines.  


**5. Cold-email small businesses.**

I started cold-calling and cold-emailing small local businesses, offering my services for free to help gain experience and build my portfolio. I landed my first \*legit\* client this way. In “Influence”, Cialdini talks about the principle of reciprocity —  if you offer your services for free to a few people, it’s likely that at least one of them will return the favor by offering you ongoing work.   


**6. Apply for jobs**

I started applying for copywriting jobs. Initially, I never heard back from a single application, until I decided to leave my work history off my resume entirely. I think potential employers were seeing my history as a hairdresser and immediately concluding I wasn’t qualified for the role. This tactic worked; I got a callback and they asked me to provide a writing sample. I knew I was up against 3 other top candidates, so I decided to go above and beyond — I didn’t supply just one writing sample, I supplied 4 and explained how I would split test them to find the top performer. I figured no one else would go to that amount of effort, and my employer later told me that was true, no one else had. I had an interview and I got the job. 

Less than 6 months after that I became a freelancer, continuing to work with that company as my main client but with others on the side as well. Today, I work with a range of clients including social media influencers, brands, and small businesses. 

I don’t expect to gain anything from sharing this, and I’m not looking for new clients. I just thought some of you might feel inspired by this or find some of the steps I took useful.

918,b55a4f,False,,89,How I overcame my biggest hurdle? Me and my ego.,Entrepreneur,"I own and operate a $1.2mil marketing company, own a new $300k small clinic and I am building an SAAS product. I have a small family, decent home, car etc.

I started working for myself in my 20s. I would try do everything in my business and fit every role. I would feel burnt out ever two years. I had an unhealthy ego and inflated sense of self worth.

At 34 I nearly lost my marriage, however, luckily I killed my ego instead. You see, 1 year ago I started seeing a psychologist to help with my anxiety, stress, my ego, my arrogance and fear of failure. My business would regularly decline in conjunction with the decline of my mental health and this impacted my total quarterly net profits, my attitude and my family.

Over a few months, my psychologist helped me learn the importance of taking proper holidays, taking business less seriously and my health more seriously, splitting work and life, and importantly helped me understand that it’s ok to quit or be defeated. The greatest mindset I learned was to trust people and rely on others, even if I get burned by people. Funnily, a combination of these things let me see how unhealthy I was and how I was limiting the growth of my own businesses and the comprising the integrity of my marriage.

My advice: Seek advice from a medically certified psychologist and share your struggles with them openly. 

Mental health has a negative stigma that is generally perpetuated by ignorance, low income demographics and a lack of education. You are not crazy in seeking professional medical mental health advice. Furthermore it is perfectly normal for highly successful people to speak with professionals regarding concerns and feelings. 

If you are like me and rely on your brain and state of mind to make money and support your family, then getting a check up regularly will be a very helpful. Regular checkups will aid you in keeping your mind well serviced to ensure years of continued success, profitability and happiness.

610,1u0unt,False,,154,How I Made $1k Selling Egg Incubators I Found on Alibaba,Entrepreneur,"I've noticed the content on r/entrepreneur has been improving over the past month and I wanted to add my experience to help. First, I don’t have a blog, info product or plans to create one. This is just my story with real numbers, real product names (rarely seen on this subreddit) and how I made $1k by selling a product I found on Alibaba. The reason I’m sharing my story is because I don’t intend on continuing to sell this product. I still have a domain name and shopify store I set up to expand on this product but I have other side projects I would rather focus on and I don’t think it's enough of a business to sell it on flippa. If anyone is interested I'm still in contact with the supplier.

If you don't have a basic knowledge of how importing products works or have never used [Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/) I would suggest starting [here](http://www.startupbros.com/how-you-can-make-big-money-importing-from-china-the-rise-and-fall-of-my-empire/) (FYI I have no affiliation with startupbros).

Second, it's probably relevant to mention that I have sourced products from Alibaba for a [drop shipping site](http://www.gundogco.com/) I run and at the time I was already an Amazon vendor. These aren't huge advantages but it is important to mention that I did not start from zero. My best advice would be to jump straight in. You will learn a lot more by doing.

**The Idea** 

Several months ago there was a debate in my city on whether or not chicken coops should be allowed within city limits. This led me to research what people needed to house chickens. Apparently, there are a lot of people doing this around the country (USA). Next, I went to Alibaba to look for relevant products. I stumbled across egg incubators and saw that is had potential.

**The Product**

Here are the steps I used to validate products I thought had potential:
-Search Alibaba for price per item and MOQ. Egg Incubators were around $50-$80 based on quantity and manufacturer
-Search Google/Amazon/Ebay to get an idea what they were selling for.  Under Ebay advanced search you can see completed transactions. The Incubators on Ebay appeared to be cheaper, around $230, but Amazons lowest list price was $350. Shipping cost is still a concern but it’s worth moving forward at this point.
-Message suppliers on Alibaba to try and get a “sample” or small initial MOQ. Here is the exact message I sent: 
>Hi,
>My name is *blriber* and I am the owner of GundogCo.com.
 
>I am interested in your 48 Egg Incubator. Would you provide me with >price and MOQ for an initial order? The shipping address will be 
>[redacted]  USA
 
>I look forward to hearing from you.
 
>Thanks

I received several promising responses and ultimately was able to purchase two incubators as a test order for $60 a piece + 195 shipping (for both). The shipping is really expensive by air for a large product like this. It would have been much cheaper to ship by boat but I wanted to test this product quickly and not wait a month. Plus, with the shipping my total cost was $157.50 per unit. This still leaves enough room for profit if they sell for $350.

**Results**

-After receiving the two test incubators I placed a listing on Amazon. To my surprise the first incubator sold in about 5 days for $350. After taking out the 15% Amazon fee and my shipping cost I was left with $270.50 almost covering the initial investment of $315. 

-Once the second incubator sold I ordered four more from the same supplier at a total cost of $665 ($166.25/unit). I also ordered two from a different supplier and tested a few different prices. Both were the same exact incubators so I’m pretty sure I was working with wholesalers and not manufacturers.

**Here were my totals:**

Sales:            $2,800

COGS: 	       ($1,295)

GP: 	        $1,505

Amazon fees ($420)

Shipping        ($104.84)

Net	        $980.16

899,3j27th,False,,110,There is no easy way.,Entrepreneur,"Ah, the fabled easy way.

I’ve been there, looked for it, determined it does not exist and then went back to look for it just to make sure.

Google great small business ideas (I know we’ve all done it) and all you see is the same old crap rinsed and repeated with no tangible steps on how to be successful. Then we start a t-shirt company and wonder why we fail.

Here’s the secret, there is NO EASY WAY. Period.

I have recently been studying entrepreneurs and businesses who started from scratch (no investors in the bag, no free publicity, no real safety net etc.) and are now doing well to try and identify common themes. I looked across sectors, from apps to food to imports to subscription boxes to niche products to service so that any similarities would not be industry specific and thus would (hopefully) be universal.
 
Want to guess what I found?

The single, most-repeated, trait was *working like a maniac on their business*.

Not a couple of hours here and there or finding time on the weekend. We are talking 8-12 hours daily, usually in addition to a separate full-time job.

For those bad at math, that’s 40-60+ hours **weekly** on their business for at least 3 months from anywhere to a year or two and then they turn into a overnight success and people looking from the outside make excuses like “I thought of that idea first” or “they just got lucky” or, one of my favorites “they already had money”.

Here is a summary of how some of those entrepreneurs spent their time:

1. They looked around and see where people were making money and came up with a way to do it slightly better

2. They developed their thing and made it look awesome, professional, and trustworthy

3. They proceeded to market like a madman/woman. Like the kind of marketing where you tell everyone you know and ask them for referrals and then tell all of those people and ask them for referrals. The kind where you reach out to every influencer within your niche. Where you go around and cold-pitch businesses, or sell door-to-door. They told people about their thing and why they should use/buy it.

4. They reiterated steps 2 and 3 based on customer feedback and identifying what was working.

The truth is that success in the world of entrepreneurship isn’t about luck, circumstance or privilege (although those can help). It’s about putting the nose to the grinder and making something that people are willing to pay for (either with time or money).

I think u/localcasestudy says it the best:

“There are only really three things we look for when deciding what to go after:

1. Are people making money doing xyz?

2. With our available skill set can we be better than at least on of those people?

3. Are the monetary requirements relatively small?

If the answer is yes to all three, we go for it, otherwise we pass.""

Success, my friends, is both *achievable* and *repeatable*, but it doesn’t come without busting your tail to get there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3j27th/there_is_no_easy_way/,418,"> Here’s the secret, there is NO EASY WAY. Period.

I had a van, I bought a rake, a spade, a bucket, some gloves and some bags and blasted all of the local buy and sell pages on Facebook I could get my hands on. 

I've been unemployed and depressed for quite some time and finally decided I had to try something to make myself an income, I couldn't face working for someone else in my state.

Within 2 days I had a full week of bookings lined up (about 90% of which are weekly reoccuring customers) to come scoop up after their dogs. Apparently no one is offering anything like this within a 100 miles of me maybe even further and my customers are amazed no one has offered this before.

I plan to scale this up to £300 a day in the next few weeks as word spreads (I haven't actually cleaned a garden yet first day is tomorrow) and I'll hire someone from there to do it all for me and enjoy the semi passive income, I'll still be taking the bookings but hopefully I can afford to stop blasting these Facebook pages soon and do proper advertising.

Just a humble brag of a post really, my hope is to maybe inspire some people out there! It is possible to do things like this even still today. Not everything has to be ecommerce or private labeling on amazon.

Do the people who get that equal measure of success get there because of these 'Steves', or because of something they did themselves (dumb luck, good contacts, existing money, good looks, etc etc)?

Just food for thought. I've devoured so many podcasts, videos, books, and whilst I feel motivated and driven by their words, I often find nothing changes, and cannot figure out why.

I thought I'd share a bit about my business on its 10 year anniversary.    
I opened a hookah bar in a town of ~50,000 people at the age of 21 with about $5,000 and a $20,000 SBA loan. It was originally open 6pm-1am Wednesdays through Sundays. For probably the first 18 months I worked probably all but 4 or 5 shifts, without taking a penny. I also kept a day job the whole time to pay for my personal expenses. I've never ended a year in the red. Besides my initial start-up costs I believe I had to deposit one of my personal checks from my job in to help with bills maybe a year or so into business. IIRC the first full year I grossed roughly $27K. I obviously was very passionate about what I was doing and I was just happy to pay the bills. After 10 years I have 3-4 part time employees on average that generally 'run the shop' on their own each shift. I do very minimal work and, for the most part, it runs itself. The last few years I gross between 110k and 120k. I've purchased a building and net roughly 15% of sales.    
I wanted to share this because it isn't glamorous, but I am proud. I essentially have an investment at this point that takes very little management and makes me money and builds equity. I employee a few people who enjoy their job, I give people one more place in my hometown to enjoy and be social.    
I've been told many times it wouldn't last, or that I would fail. My parents cosigned my original SBA loan and were told point blank that ""when"" I failed they'd be on the hook. I faced a statewide smoking ban, bugged the shit out of lawmakers, and went to my capital to state my case for an exemption on the day the bill was signed into law. The exemption did not exist on the bill when I arrived that morning, only me and one other guy were asking for something that would keep us and at least a handful of other businesses from essentially being forced to close. They added it in as a grandfather clause that day. I made a lot of friends, I've learned, and continue learning, a ton about business and I even met my wife because I opened the place.    
My advice is this: Don't get into something to get rich (especially quickly), it rarely works, you might end up hating it and quitting before you get anywhere. If it were easy to get rich few of us would be in this sub, we'd be on our yachts. Do something you have a passion for that through research you feel people will be willing to pay you to do or sell. Don't let people that aren't your target market stop you from starting a business. Listen to the feedback you receive from customers and be willing to make changes even if they weren't part of your initial vision. Don't be afraid to ask for and receive advice or help from friends, family, customers, or people you look up to, or that may have insight on the issue at hand.

577,85baz1,False,Feedback Please,218,Purchase a $99 online course. Get a 100% refund if you finish it.,Entrepreneur,"Online courses platforms completion rates are pretty low. To motivate more people to buy courses and actually finish them, I'm thinking about a new business model.

#Updated idea (find the original one at the end)
Due to great feedback (thank you all!), I changed my mind on several aspects to build a coherent business model that makes money and is trustable.

You enroll in a 10 chapters course by purchasing it at a high price, let's say $100. Each time you complete a chapter, you get a cash reward of $7.5 which motivates you to keep going. You have 30 days to finish it (depending on the course size of course).

If you fully complete the course, you get $75 back (I arbitrarely capped the discount to 75%). Otherwise the money left goes to the charity of your choice. I earn 25% of the price for each course.

TAGLINE: *The more you learn, the less you pay*

##FAQ

**How could you ensure students really complete the course and all chapters?**

Students will have to complete chapter 1 to access chapter 2.

How can I manage that? By using clues blended into the chapter content so the student must read the whole chapter to get all clues. Then, put together, the clues form let's say a word, you enter this word on the website and it unlocks chapter 2.

The unlocking system must be simple enough so non-technical people can easily find the answer thanks to the content and access next chapter. I don't want students to be stuck in the course progress. I want them to read the whole course though.

**This is not very secure, someone can collect all the answers and post them online!**

Sure. This person can also take your paid PDF ebook or videos training and put them online for free. There is no way to avoid piracy. I consider piracy as free marketing. It's part of the business.

**But that's insane! You'll be incentivised to build crappy and unfinishable courses to maximize your profit!**

If I do this, I will burn my customers, I won't get any referrals, I won't build trust with my audience, my business will be screwed.
The purpose is not to maximize profit by making students frustrated or angry! It's to make them happy by motivating them through the money reward to finish the course they enrolled in. That's the main goal they have when they first enroll in the course.

Also, I can give the money not rewarded to a charity! So on a $100 course, if you do 6 chapters and give up, you get 6 x $7.5 = $45 rewards, then I take $25 and the $30 remaining goes to the charity of your choice! How awesome is that?

**How will you build trust with students?**

Simple. The first chapter will be short and easy. That way I can immediately reward the student with cash so they can be sure the system works and they'll get their money back if they continue to progress within the course. I will also provide a 7 days money back guarantee no question asked.

**How to make money out of this?**

As said in some comments, there were a flaw in my initial idea: I first wanted to fully refund if the course was completed. But if everyone completes the course, I did't make money. A good suggestion by ralphisahomo is that I can use a discount instead of the full price refund. I can even optimize the revenues by using tiers thanks to ListentoLewis great idea.

* Pay $99, get $50 back on completion. (They pay $49)
* Pay $149, get $110 back on completion. (They pay $39)
* Pay $199, get $170 back on completion. (They pay $29)

I can also think of non-linear rewards. For example, chapter 1 rewards $5, then chapter 2 rewards $6, then $7 etc. The more you progress the more you earn. That could provide a boost in motivation too.

#Original idea

You enroll in a course by purchasing it at a high price let's say $99 (the loss of money must be important enough to motivate you to finish the course). If you finish the course, you get a full refund. No fees or whatever, just a full refund. At the end, it's like having the course for free.

If you don't finish it, you say bye bye to your money.

What do you think about this? Would you be more willing to purchase this kind of course? Do you think it would help you finish the course too?

EDIT: Updated the format and content of the post to reflect awesome feedbacks and answer common questions (thanks you all!).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/85baz1/purchase_a_99_online_course_get_a_100_refund_if/,546,"I think this is a great idea. I think you should merge some of the feedback you've received:

1. In order to keep the revenue but still keep the idea of it being completely free, you should give them the money back, but make the last bit be credit toward more courses rather than actual cash back.
2. Your idea of progressive payments in each chapter is good, but it shouldn't be 1:1. I.e. if there's 10 lessons in a $100 course, let each lesson earn $5 back. The whole point is to incentivize them to finish the whole course, not just part of the course.

Combine these ideas like so: $5 for each lesson, they've got $50 back. Another $30 in cash at 100% completion plus $20 credit towards their next course.

Adjust those percentatges as you see fit. As someone else said, you'll have to pay transaction fees on each transaction, so to get more full-course buy in and to minimize fees, make it so that they can only claim the per lesson credits by giving up on the full course so that you only ever pay for a maximum of 1 refund transaction per course.

Getting URL clues is weird and complicated. Just make them take a quiz after each section.

If you're going to use the different tiers, then I like the idea of making it some sort of wager. Duolingo does this. However, since it's real money, you might run afoul of gambling laws doing that. But at minimum, you should give the option of an outright payment for the course with no refund. That sets their perceived value of the course. Using this scale you laid out:

>Pay $99, get $50 back on completion. (They pay $49)
Pay $149, get $110 back on completion. (They pay $39)
Pay $199, get $170 back on completion. (They pay $29)

I'd make the ""regular"" price without any money back on completion be a minimum of $79, maybe even $89.

And as someone else said, content is king. To build a course platform, you need quality courses first before whatever marketing scheme you choose to employ matters. ",2018-03-18 13:46:53
659,8ksb6g,False,,71,"How To Sell Anything Part 2: The Biggest Factor To Why Only A Few Are Successful, And The Only Reason People Spend Money",Entrepreneur,"As I posted [How To Sell Anything Part 1: Your Mental Blueprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8k98bt/how_to_sell_anything_part_1_your_mental_blueprint/); I've gotten both good (and negative) feedback for a couple of reasons.

First, I would love to address that these posts are not posts that will magically give you the ability to sell anything you want no matter the product. 

What I would love to derive from these posts is the ability to teach people what I've noticed that made myself successful in sales, and what made others successful too. 

It may seem redundant to you; sure. If you are already aware of the advice that I'm spending across, fantastic. This is for the people that I've seen with my own eyes (I currently work as a sales trainer that on-boards new hires for different companies) that may not know about how to tackle the realm of sales. 

What I've also learned is that you can **always be learning.** I believe anyone who takes the time to posts valuable advice (clearly relative if you know about it or not) can always add to your sales arsenal as both a salesperson and as an entrepreneur. 

Still, I would love advice/feedback/positivity on how I can improve these posts for both myself and my readers. 

To start, probably one of the biggest factors to what differentiates successful salespeople and unsuccessful salespeople. What are salespeople doing that you’re not doing?

**Top Salespeople Are Goal-Oriented**

for people who al goal-oriented, there is a direct relation to success. If you live a goal-oriented life, you will never lose sight of your goals and your dreams.

The problem is, people are the only goal oriented when they are motivated. Right when they lose that motivation, Then you know what happens next?

Eventually, they give up, “life happens”, or they [insert excuse here] and cave back into their own comfortable routines, finding any kind of rational through a series of mental gymnastics finding any hole they can.

Then, they won’t readdress their goal until something motivates them again.

“People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.” – Earl Nightingale 
You might say:

“This is obviously common sense.”

But I’ve seen the majority of the people give up pursuing their goals when it becomes to difficult for them and I personally believe this makes up for the majority of the population.

When you relentless purse a goal that a majority are not, your chances of ending up more successful is extremely high because your sharp shooting your target – rather than hustling 6 months there, a year there, 1 week there.

“How do I live a goal-oriented life then?”

Make goals, and attach deadlines with repercussions. I’m asking you to use fear to your advantage. Fear is primally deeply rooted and etched into our brains. Once you will move out of your comfort zone – you will scramble to find your way back.

Fuck all that bullshit of:

“Make conscious decisions to step closer to your goal throughout the day.”

“Write down your goals and you’ll remember them.”

Lot’s of individuals become entrepreneurs because of the fear of being controlled by a boss. The fear of wasting their life in corporate America. The fear that they will spend the rest of their lives doing something they absolutely loathe.

Lots of poor individuals become so obsessed with success (and become successful) because of the fear of being poor again. The fear that they won’t achieve greater things in life. The fear of that same pain of being so broke, they would skip multiple meals and suffer.

You develop a discipline for yourself that will make your hungry for your goals and to achieve them.

Lot’s of artists use the fear of not being able to make a living from what they love doing, so they relentlessly pursue it until it comes to life.

Former fat people become so fucking obsessed with becoming jacked because of that fear of being fat, unwanted, and ugly and the dark side it comes with it.

Now, I’m not saying that this is the only way to be motivated. But this is the only want in my experience plenty on how a lot of successful people stays on their toes.

This is considered “fear-setting”.

You aren’t making the money you want to be because you are a lazy fucker, it really is that simple.

You aren’t making the money you want as a salesperson because you don’t want it bad enough.

Lot’s of salespeople who first struggle to pay rent, in fear that their lives will continue being this constant struggle – so they develop strategies to get to a point of being comfortable (where your comfort zone is). 

Hint: **your comfort zone does not exist.**

Now I can make this completely philosophical, and advocate always practicing misfortune so you’ll both constantly be comfortable with being uncomfortable – but that is not the point of this post.

When making your goals, it is absolutely essential for you to know how much you will earn each year, or you’ll end up with nothing just like you did a year ago.

 

Now, ask yourself:

“How much do I intend to earn for the next 12 months?”

Write this number down. This is the target which you will orient all your activities throughout the year. 

[Statistics don’t lie:](https://sidsavara.com/why-3-of-harvard-mbas-make-ten-times-as-much-as-the-other-97-combined/) A Harvard study found that the 3% of graduates from their MBA who had their goals written down, ended up earning ten times as much as the other 97% put together, just ten years after graduation.

A goal that is realistic, but challenging. Remember, goals rediculous goals won’t motivate you – they will demotivate you. You will quit at the first sign of adversity.

For example, take the amount of money your making now: and increase it by at least 25%.

Top salespeople know exactly they are going to earn each year.

If you were to ask any successful salespeople how much they are going to earn that day, they will give you that exact number. Low performing salespeople have absolutely no idea what they are going to earn. Every day is a new adventure with no compass.

Now ask yourself:

“How much am I going to have to sell to achieve this annual goal?”

After you decide your annual sales goal, break it down over the months.

Then, ask yourself:

“How much am I going to have to sell each week/month to achieve this annual goal?”

Break it down to the point where you are making daily sales goals. This is the best way (personally) how I found myself making the annual sales goal I desired. If I wanted to make six figures (tax-free), I would make a goal for myself that would look like this:

$100,000/52 weeks = $1,923/week. $1,923/7 days = $275/daily. I would then wake up every morning, relentless pursuing this $275 daily goal – and eventually, give me a yearly goal of six figures.

Then, you will need to develop strategies to get to that $275/daily goal.

“How many calls will I have to make to make this daily goal?”

“How early do I have to wake up to start prospecting, to make this daily goal?”

“How much should I sell my product for, to make my daily goal?”

“Who do I need to talk too, where, and how long for each prospect to make this daily goal?”

“Who do I have to hire and what marketing techniques do I need to make this daily goal?”

When you can document everything and look at it objectively, you’ll soon be able to predict (with accuracy) exactly what you’ll have to do each day to achieve your annual goal.

Force yourself with this motivating factor to follow through doing everything you’ll exactly have to do each day.

Think about this about yourself: is this you, or are you that person who tries to sell “as much as possible?”

**The Law Of Averages** 

You will have dry periods, and you will make more than you’d thought. You will have your sales highs and your sales lows.

Some days you’ll make nothing – and some days you’ll make x3 the amount. If you continue to make those necessary actions to achieve your goal in sales, you will eventually make that annual goal on schedule.

As you make it a habit, you will train your subconscious mind – it will further alert you to new opportunities, and give you the “right” ideas to get to your goal quicker. Your subconscious mind will help you better read your prospects face, smell bullshit a mile away, and even further distinguish if a prospect is even worth your time.

Your mind will always help you perform at your best – in the pursuit of your goals. When you have a positive self-concept about yourself and are goal oriented – you will always have the right things to say, at the right time, in the direction of your goals.

When you set goals for yourself, you will be amazed what’s possible.

**How Setting Goals Outside Of Sales Will Further Lead You To Sucess**
 

“I have a daughter, and I want to show her what success looks like. So, I’ll [insert all your actions here]” 

“I want my family to finally be happy.”

“I eventually want to enjoy life alot more than I am now”. 

Using additional facets of goal setting outside of sales will give you the motivation to bounce back and continue pursuing your sales goals. This is sort of like a system of checks and balances.

When you’re aggressively trying to sell your product; will the person with only one obligation/goal succeed, or will the person with 50 different goals/obligations succeed? More reasons, more desire.

After you have your mental blueprint set up and have a goal that you will relentlessness pursue; you’re ready to further build on your sales foundation to become one of the top salespeople in your field.

I firmly believe the biggest, number 1 rookie mistakes amateur salespeople make (and still are making) is…the inability to figure out their customer’s needs by asking questions in order for them to take action.

**The Two Reasons People Buy**

*Desire for gain
*Fear of loss

The desire for gain is the improvement within their life, of some kind.

Your job is to help your prospect understand how much better his or her life would be with your product, to the life they are living now.

Prospects are afraid of wasting their money.

As prospects become familiar with the market which results in becoming more cautious of what they buy, they fear they will lose if they make a purchase if there is no real value behind it.

This is called [Loss Aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)

People generally prefer to avoid losses than to acquire its equivalent gains.

It is better to not lose $5 than to gain $5.

[The Prospect Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory), which is research done by both Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, found out the psychological value of losses and gains indicated that people may have a loss aversion ratio of between 1.5 and 2.5.

This means a loss that is identical in money terms to a gain may be valued up to 2.5 times more than the gain.

People hate losing more than winning.

What is the key that makes successful salespeople close more sales?

Salespeople are able to demonstrate both. 

Your job will be to both: find if that individual will gain from the product or service (desire for gain), and how much worse off he or she will be if they don’t act (fear of loss).

**The Psychology Behind Why We Take Action**

Every action we take is based on a motivating factor to take that action. simple as that.

People buy products and services because of two main reasons:

*They feel as if they’ll be better off in life after purchasing your product
*They have so much “fuck you money” so they can spend all day and every day because money is no factor to them.

Rarely you’ll get the second reason. It’s happened to me a couple times, but it probably made about under 5% of the sales throughout my sales career.

There are three actions a person can take in the realm of sales:

*They can buy from you
*They can buy from a competitor
*They can buy nothing

Understand, you are ultimately signaling to the prospect that they are better off with your product, than without. 

Your product must serve as a solution to their lives since they’re looking for one.

They then will be willing to give up a portion of their freedom (money) in order to find whatever solution they are looking for.

**The Human Desire For Freedom**

Also, it will help if you understand that money does not exist. Money is a medium of exchange to buy people freedom.

Money is a fiat. Money has no value behind it. Most people traded their time and labor for their hard earned “money” which they will use to exchange for a product or a service that will help them give them a degree of more freedom or an improvement in their lives.

If prospect buys a product that has no value to him or her, they’ve just traded a portion of their life away for a product that gives no value to their lives.

For the majority of people who understand that they’ve worked hard for their money – there will always be some kind of buying resistance. 

An individual always wants to get the most out of what they buy, so they look for a product that gives them the most benefit and satisfaction to their lives.

In economics, this is called marginal utility.

If you put a product out on the market, it is already assumed that your product is at it’s best price and quality.

A mistake I’ve seen is when salespeople reinforce the product by saying:

“Buy my product because of the price and quality!” 

Sure, you are a salesperson, but it it’s most literal definition.

You are an individual who sells goods or services to other entities, but you’d probably not be a very successful one.

**Finding Your Customers Needs**

In order to help your prospect both not lose – and for you at the same time win; you need to see if your product or service will bring value to them at the point in time.

How do you do this?

You need to ask a plethora of questions – the more specific the better, in order to dig out specifically why the customers want to buy your product or service at that current sale.

Let’s put this is an example in simpler terms, using a scenario in car sales.

Prospect A just graduated college, just signed a lease for a new apartment next to his work office and just want a car the is both sufficient and economical to get to work every day.

How did you know this? You asked about who he or she was, their background, and why they were shopping for a car at that time.

Do: ask questions. 

Here is are two scenario that I’ve seen destroy salespeople, so you can better understand this concept.

In the first scenario, prospect A walks into the dealership. You, as a salesperson, make commission off the cars you sell want to make as much money as you want possible: so what do you immediately do? Start asking the prospect questions immediately show him or her the newest car out, substantially wasting time forcing information about a car (that they gave no indication that they were interested in it) down their throats.

He or she looks at the price tag, sighs, and eagerly waits for an opportunity to tell you that they’re not interested. Then, after an hour of the salesperson talking, he or she stops and says:

“So, what do you think?”

Little did you know, he or she just graduated college and isn’t looking for a big-ticket commitment like that car. He or she was just looking for an economical car that they could afford, just to take them to and back from work each day.

You are out a sale and a precious hour of your time. What you could have done:

You could have shown him or her a used, cheap economical car which would have potentially got you a sale if you understood your prospects needs first.

As addressed in Part 4, you have a daily goal to hit and you only have 24 hours in one day. You just wasted an hour of it.

What makes you think someone would want to buy your product? Because you like it? Because it’s nice? Because you making a living off of it and you have no choice?

No. People buy your damn product because it has to align with their goals during that given time. If a wealthy individual walks in and you use the same tactic and made a sale without asking a question, you got lucky, friend. 

After that sale, you’ll subconsciously look for clues that signal wealth. When you make enough sales to wealthy people, you’ll start to be hyperfocus to prospects upon the way they dress.

They way they speak.

What that currently drive.

Then, through trial and error, you’ll (hopefully) realize to sell cars to people who can obviously afford it and to sell other cars to people looking for cheaper alternatives. You’ll also realize people who are a waste of your time.

In the second scenario, let says a salesperson is trying to sell car insurance.

That salesperson might spend the time to talk about its affordability, how it’s better than it’s competitors, the reputation of the company, or how cheap it is.

Sure, this is all important. But this is not the sole reason why a customer will buy car insurance. He or she will buy it, for peace of mind.

A simple strategy you can use when identifying new prospects:

“Do you feel the need to keep your car safe and secured – with a peace of mind and 24/7 support, spending as little as possible?”

If the prospect does not say “Yes!” immediately, you will not spend any more time trying to convince him or her. If he or she is feeling relucted to secure their car, they won’t care too much in case of an accident.

Learn to ask questions and discover your customer’s needs in order for them to take action, or to figure out if they’re worth their time.

**Reasons Why People Purchase**

Once you find the right motives to why they are purchasing your product, it is usually the individual:

*View a purchase of your product as an accomplishment or an item that represents their status
*The product your offering either makes or saves the individual money
*Security (to become safer)
*The appeal after the purchase to being liked, accepted and respected by others
*If your product can enhance health & fitness (high levels of energy and/or attraction)
*Gives the prospect power, influence, or popularity
*The desire to staying “up-to-date” (need the newest iPhone, ect)
*The ability to give the prospect of love, attraction, sex, and companionship
*Personal growth (learn new skills or a permanent transformation)

**People Are Ruled By The Sensual And The Visual; Logic Always Comes After**
All buying decisions are usually emotional, based on what they see and how it makes them feel. People justify their decisions logically and usually decide emotionally.

Humans have an array of emotions – but the strongest emotion operating at the particular moment will determine what that person will act upon at that time.

784,9u6obu,False,,86,"Don't be afraid to take on low-skill / low-pay ""menial"" jobs.",Entrepreneur,"I went from a highly technical (Engineering) job to being unemployed for quite some time, due to a bust in my industry. This led to months of being unemployed, and a metric TON of job searching. 

In the meanwhile, I also called temp agencies, and agreed to take ""anything"" that came my way, just to do *something*, really. 

This led to a string of ""shitty"" jobs, often one-time assignments. And even though I was highly educated, with good work experience, it was mostly manual labor, or quite menial jobs. 

Did I feel like a failure? Sure. I had imagined something else. But I always do my best, no mater how boring or uninteresting the job is. I was also sending out applications during the evening, so I figured something would come along, sooner or later. 

But there's one thing I had not foreseen: The sheer number of ""*There* **HAS** *to be a better way of doing this!*"" moments. 

A ton of these jobs are being done the same way they were done 20-30-40 years ago. Minimal digitalization. ""Process optimization"" is foreign. 

For example: I worked at one warehouse, which was part of a leading big box electronics store, where 90% of registration and data tracking was done manually, *by paper*. Employees registering data with their one phones, sending important information over snapchat or FB chat. 

One time we had to manually count a whole truckload twice, because the guy in charge had lost his checked inventory list (paper), but before he got to enter the data on the computer. 

Or the fact that expensive cargo (cellphones) would get shipped in one large box, then ""hid"" in the rest of the cargo. These boxes would sometimes contain hundreds of phones, and be worth hundreds of thousands. 

They contained no tracking systems. No anti-theft systems. No-nothing. And it's still like that. 

So, if you're really struggling to come up with ideas, I highly recommend to just dive into some jobs, and see what pops up. 

It's easy to get accustomed to always having cutting-edge tech at your fingertips, if you work in tech - but huge parts of large industries are still very primitive, and ripe for change. 

And you won't really discover those things, unless you actually work there (or happen to be a consultant, trying to identify all these things). 

EDIT: In case someone misunderstood my post - I'm not advocating people to pursue these jobs, but rather that if you find yourself in the position of taking jobs like that, you absolutely should look around for things that can be improved.

785,8k98bt,False,,87,How To Sell Anything Part 1: Your Mental Blueprint,Entrepreneur,"Some years ago, Harvard University did a study upon 16,000 salespeople - determining that there are basic qualities that determine the successes and the failures for a salesperson...and the determining factor?

It was all mental.

It is everything that goes on in the mind of that salesperson that makes all the difference.

If a person had certain psychological qualities with everything else constant - that salesperson would succeed.

If you personally develop these same psychological qualities, then you will form your own foundation to your own sales success.

If you want to see how tall a building is going to be built; look at the foundation. The deeper that foundation, the taller the building is going to hold. The same concept applies to sales.

The greater understanding and foundation you develop about sales, the more money you'll be able to build for yourself.

Once you have built your foundation and truly become phenomenal at selling, you can now go where ever the hell you want and write your own check.

Never stop trying to dig a deeper foundation for yourself.

**People Don't Use Their 90% Of Their Potential **

Most salespeople only use 10% of their sales potential. It is estimated that the average person doesn't use more than 10% of his or her potential.

What this means, is that the average person has 90% or more potential left untapped. When you learn how to unlock the 90% of your own potential, this is when you can move yourself to the top 20% of the highest earners.

**Follow The Lions, Not Other Sheep**

The first thing you do in your field is figuring out who is the top 10-20%.

Instead of following other followers - in this case, the other sheep, follow the lions.

Pretty obvious, right?

Learn to compare yourself to the lions. Remember, nobody is better than you or smarter than you. We were all cut from the same cloth.

If someone is doing better than you, all it really means is that he or she found a more efficient way of having a selling success that you've yet to discover.

The very proof that something can be done, is that someone already did it.

This means if someone is earning a seven-figure income, this is real, concrete evidence that you can also earn the exact same amount of money as that salesperson did.

The four-minute mile was supposed to be unbreakable. Roger Bannister thought otherwise and broke it.

And what do you know? Everyone now has the confidence to break 4 minutes mile (which was always achievable...someone just had to do it).

Remember, everyone starts at the bottom and works their way up. If someone specifically is doing better than you, find out the exact strategies that salesperson used to eject him or herself from the bottom to land where he or she is today.

Sometimes the very best way to figure this out is to just go and ask. He or she will probably tell you.

Top performers are usually willing to help other people who are willing to succeed. Since they've already beat everyone in the field they're in, they demonstrate more value for themselves by teaching others to get to where they are today.

So they write books, set up courses and seminars, or teach other people to achieve that exact same success.

**Your Self-concept**

One of the biggest breakthroughs in psychology in the 20th century was the discovery of a ""self-concept"".

Your self-concept is a bundle of beliefs you've created about yourself (both external and internal).

This is the way you see yourself in the mirror or think about yourself in any area of your life. This is exactly what goes on your subconsciousness - and has a direct relationship on how you interpret reality and the actions you take in it.

Everything in life starts to improve when you start to improve the source - the inner programming of your mind.

You always perform externally in direct relation to your subconscious and self-concept.

You also have a series of mini self-concepts.

These are little self-concepts that will determine the effectiveness and success in each area of your life from making perfect, fluffy pancakes - to the extreme of giving a speech amongst thousands of people.

**Your Self-concept In Sales**

If you are confident and have a high, positive self-concept about yourself - then prospecting and selling is absolutely no problem.

You get up in the morning, ecstatic to call, sell, or approach new people. You are so confident, your sales pipeline is always full because you know people want the product or service you are selling.

If you have a poor self-concept about the sales your making, you'll approach sales with fear and anxiety.

If your subconsciousness is filled with this negative traits, you will subconsciously take actions in the real world that will sabotage your sale.

You will avoid it, whenever possible.

The very idea of selling will make you tense and uneasy.

You will try to do a little as possible, and subconsciously try to find ways to avoid the act of selling. This is true in any other facet of life as well.

Every salesperson comes to work with a self-concept of how much they are going to earn. Psychologists have found that you cannot earn 10% more or less than your self-concept about your income.

If you earn 10% more than you think you are supposed to be earning, you'll subconsciously engage in behaviors that will derail you from ever achieve 10% more income.

You will start to go out to fancy restaurants, buy a nice car, or even take months off for vacation. This will eventually burn a hole in your pocket big enough to the point where it's like you've never made more.

If you earn 10% less than you think you are supposed to be earning, you will be engaging in scrambling behaviors.

You'll start thinking about working harder. Longer. Smarter. Better.

You do this in order to get your income back up to your comfort zone. When you get into your comfort zone, you will relax and take things easy again.

**Change Your Comfort Zone**

The only way to expand your income is by expanding your comfort zone.

Some people have a comfort zone of making $50,000 a year. When they get to that level, they relax and coast.

Others have a comfort zone of $100,000 a year. They strive to get to that level; and once they do, they relax when they hit that target.

There is a very little difference in talent between these two. The only real difference is that once has settled at $50,000 - while the other salesperson refuses to settle until he or she makes at least six figures.

**Reset Your Mind**

You can never earn more on the outside that you think you can earn on the inside.

If you see yourself as a $50,000 a year person, you will continually engage in behaviors that will keep your income at $50,000.

For example, a salesperson will set his/her goal for $50,000 a year. Once that salesperson hits that $50,000 mark, earlier than they were supposed to, the sales awkwardly dry up.

That salesperson, for some reason, can't get him or herself motivated to sell more until the end of the year. That salesperson spins his or her wheels until December 31. Then, on December 31st, they become phenomenal salespeople again.

In every case, it's your self-concept. This is actually quite common.

**Break Free Of The Past**

Some people think that it isn't possible to earn more than their parents. Time and time again, people plateau at a certain income level because that's the highest amount their parents have earned.

At an unconscious level, they have decided for themselves not to earn more than that amount. In turn, it becomes reality to them.
After You've Reset Your Mind: Change It
To increase your income, you must achieve these financial goals in your mind before you can ever achieve them in reality.

You aim should be to increase your level of you self-concept slowly, as a higher income earner.

Imagine yourself as already the person you want to be, already earning the kind of money you want to earn.

Look at other people making more money than you; then act exactly like them.

Imagine you are already financially independent, and the only reason you're making these sales is to meet new people.

This calm, collected, and confident self-concept will help you perform at your very best in the market.

**But, Be Realistic**

It is extremely important in developing this new self-concept realistically. When I first learned about the power of self-concept, I was earning $25,000 a year.

I immediately set a goal to make six figures the next year.

Instead of this goal motivating me, this was probably one of the biggest demotivators.

This was supposed for my mind to look the make that kind of money, my mind became extremely overwhelmed and down.

A goal that is vastly large - anything that you've never achieve for yourself, is ignored by your self-concept.

I finally realized my mistake, and set it for $50,000 a year. Guess what? I already hit my targeted goal in half a year.

A salesperson may start at the bottom, and work his way up over several years eventually making six figures.

But then, the economy goes south, the industry retracts, and he has to start out at a new company selling a different product.

How much do you think that salesperson made that following year?

Still well over six figures.

Why? Becuase this salesperson already has a self-concept of a six-figure salesperson. No matter what happens, this salesperson will find some kind of way to make six figures.

The fact is, once a salesperson is a millionaire, this is no reason to offer this salesperson anything less since they have proved to themselves that they can achieve a million dollars. It's all a matter of self-concept.

Another concept to learn, are the ""Key Result Areas"", or KRAs.

**Introduction To Key Result Areas (KRAs)**

KRA's are a strategic factor (either internal to the organization or external), where strong positive results must be realized for the long-term vision of success.

A good analogy used to represent these KRA's and how they work is like dialing a telephone. When you dial, each number you press (in this case, KRA's) is a specific KRA put in a sequence to ahold of another person.

In this case, you need to use specific KRA's in a specific sequence in order for the salesperson to make a sale.

**What Are The Seven KRA's?**

The seven KRA's include:

Prospecting
Building rapport
Identifying Needs
Presenting
Answering objections
Closing the sale
Getting both a resale and/or referral 


You self-concept in these seven areas, determine your success in sales as a salesperson.

Fortunately, everyone who is good at the areas was once poor at it. Every salesperson in the top 20%, started in the bottom 20%.

The good news is, if you can talk to people, you can perfect these seven skills. It simply a matter of learning and practice.

If you maintain a poor self-concept of any of these KRA's, you will avoid that specific key whenever you encounter it. The only reason you feel fear and anxiety when taking a specific action is that you are not good at it...yet.

You haven't mastered the skill.

If you are horrendous at a certain skill, you will be angry. It will be awkward. You will make mistakes. It will be normal and natural for you to avoid it.

**Master That Skill**

Your job is to master all seven skills as a salesperson. Fortunately, there are a lot more books, audio programs, courses, and advice available to you now to help you master each other these skills that will take you forever to learn 80 years ago.

There is absolutely no reason for you to be held back from achieving the top 10%, and the only reason you're held back is that you are weak in a particular area.

You can learn how to close the sale effectively. You also can learn how to present and build rapport effectively.

You can become skilled on how to ask questions - while listening carefully to the answers. Practice + repetition + consistency = success. 

You can become an expert and accurately be identifying the needs of your customers, by asking even more precise questions. You can answer the customer's objects so well; the objections disappear and never come up again.

These are all learnable skills.

**Get Better At What You Do**

The better you get you get at any of these given areas, the better your self-concept will be for yourself. The more confidence you have the ability to do it, the happier you will end up feeling when performing that specific activity.

You can, in fact, shape your sales personality. When has someone felt uneasy doing something that they weren't good at?

Every step you take to improve a specific area raises your self-concept - and your likelihood of success.

**Face Your Fears**

The first time you're trying to perform a sale as a salesperson, your heart is jumping out of your chest and into your throat.

Your heart is pounding so loudly you think your customers can hear it.

Psychologists say when you are afraid of performing something you've never done - this resembles the same feeling as if you were a child soon to get a spanking.

Your self-concept is not based on reality. your self-concept is based on the ideas about yourself, including the same limiting opinions/factors that hold most people back.

Fear and doubt have always been the greatest enemies of human potential. Many people doubt their ability to excel in a certain area. Even though it isn't true, it starts to become true.

Don't sell yourself so short.

Some people think they are absolutely terrible at closing sales. As long as you think that, you will then be forever terrible at closing sales. The fact is, closing is a normal and natural thing to end and close a sale.

**Challenge Your Self Limiting Beliefs**
 
The self-limiting beliefs you put upon yourself is based on idiotic information not based on any kind of facts or reality. These are very often illusions of your own mind.

Because they are unreal, you can easily get rid of them and replace them was new, positive beliefs of confidence and competence.

Self-limiting beliefs actually develop early and easily. When you try something new, like skating, you'll immediately conclude that you're not any good.

For then on, you will sabotage yourself - and soon you'll avoid that area altogether.

We feel as if people doing better than us...are actually better than us. If they are worth more than we are worthless. This is probably the biggest, a fundamental cause of unhappiness in our society.

A person who likes him or her self that has a high self-esteem probably has a positive self-concept about themselves.

When you really like yourself, you perform at your best. The more you like yourself, the more you like other people.

The more you like other people, the more they like you.

The more you like your customers, the more your customers like you. From this, the more willing they are to buy from you and recommend you to their friends.

High self-esteem people meet and marry other high self-esteem people. High self-esteem parents raise high self-esteem children.

High self- esteem bosses enforce high self-esteem employees. They then set higher standards for themselves, and practice higher levels of self-disciple. They are generally happier and more fulfilled than people who don't like themselves too much.

Low self-esteem salespeople who don't like themselves, don't really like other people either. As a result, they have a hard time building high-quality relationships with customers.

**You Are What You Think About**

Happy people think happy thoughts. Successful people think successful thoughts.

Wealthy people think wealthy thoughts. In addition, you become exactly what you say about yourself.

Successful people can control their inner dialogues. They can talk to themselves positively and confidently as they go through their day. 

Saying things like:

""I like myself."" 

""I am the shit.""

""I'm pretty amazing.""

""I'm a great salesperson.""

Will not only improve your self-esteem but actually cause you a chemical change in your brain. You release endorphins that will generally give you a feeling of confidence and well-being.

The more confident you feel, the more confident you perform.

I still repeat this at least 20 times a day until I drove the message deep into my subconscious mind and became locked in.

**The Best Time To Make A Sale**

The best time to make a sale is truly right after you've made a sale. After you've closed a deal - your self-esteem soars.

You feel terrific about yourself as a salesperson. You feel like a winner. You go ahead and talk to the next prospect feeling terrific about yourself, you will perform at a best.

This spike in sales performance is because your self-concept of yourself gone up.

As you sell more and more, you start to convince yourself that you are actually an excellent sales person. When your feeling terrific about yourself, you know you can do anything you can put your mind to.

You feel so good, you need less sleep. You have more enthusiasm. You have more energy. You feel more positive about yourself.

**There Are Only Two Obstacles To Sales Sucess**

There are two major obstacles when opening or closing any sales. This is also all mental. They are:

Fear of failure
Fear of rejection

The fear of failure is actually the biggest reason for failure in adult life. Not failure itself; but the fear of failure.

Fear of failure is actually created and rooted in our minds when we were young. The fear of failure usually stems from receiving destructive criticism from our parents.

If your parents were continually criticising you when you were growing up, then you are experiencing this deep, unconscious fear of failure as an adult - at least until you learn how to get rid of that fear.

The fear of rejection is that the potential buyer might say:

""No.""

The fear of rejection is triggered by the possibility of come across as rude or get criticism and/or disappointment by the potential buyer. The rule is; that 80% of sales approaches will end in a no - for a thousand different reason.

This does not mean there is anything inherently wrong with the product or the salesperson.

People sell ""No"", because they simply: do not need it; do not want it, cannot use it; cannot afford it, or some other reason.

If you're a salesperson and afraid of rejection; you've picked the wrong profession, my friend. Every experience of failure r rejection will affect your self-esteem.

It will hurt your self-image.

It will make you feel bad about yourself, and trigger your worst fear - that you're not good enough. Trust me, if humans were equipt without the fear of rejection, we would all be amazing salespeople. We would definitely all make so much more than we are making now.

Rejection is nothing personal. Great salespeople have built their self-esteem to a point where they no longer feel rejection.

If someone says no to them, it doesn't hurt them or put them off. It does not get them going back to hiding in their offices or cars.

Here is the key to dealing with rejection:

You must realize that rejection it is not personal. It has nothing to do with you. 
Just like it rains outside, or the sun comes up to shine. It just happens, day to day. Rejection is the sale concept.

When you can rise above yourself, and stop taking rejection so seriously, it will remove all fear you have for rejection.

When you get rejected, you'll shrug your shoulders, and immediately move on to the next prospect.

**Never Give Up**

it takes courage to get up every day and face your constant fear of rejection.

It takes courage to maintain the persistence, to come back day after day, in spite of all difficulties and disappointment.

The good news is, courage is a habit. Like a muscle, the more your practice courage, the stronger you become.

Eventually, you'll reach a point where you're virtually unafraid. After that, your sales career takes off.

**You Are Still A Good Person**

When a person says no to you, they are not saying it because of who you are. They are simply saying no to your product or presentation. Potentially your prices. The rejection itself is not personal.

Once you know and understand that saying no is nothing personal, you stop to worry about if someone were to react to your product negatively.

Heres the danger: If you take the no from a rejection of a sale personally, you start to think they are rejecting you as an individual.

When you begin thinking like this, you will soon become discouraged and lose your enthusiasm for selling.

When you organize yourself to make yourself a high self-esteem person with a positive self-concept about themselves, that alone will help contribute more to your income than any other factor.

Hopefully, this helps some of you guys.

167,79ok2p,False,Best Practices,93,"Over the years, I've hired over a hundred freelance contractors. Here are the 3 kinds of freelancers you want to AVOID.",Entrepreneur,"I run a business that depends very, very heavily on freelance contractors. They’re the lifeblood of my business. 

Finding and hiring talented (but affordable) professionals was instrumental in allowing me to scale my business up the way I did. I owe a lot to those guys -- I couldn’t have done it without them.

(If you’re wondering, I basically run a small digital publishing company that publishes on Kindle, iTunes, Nook, Kindle Paperback, ACX audiobooks etc. I outsource pretty much everything including writing, cover design, editing, marketing, and project management...everything)

**It took me a while to figure out what I was doing.** There are good workers out there, and there are bad workers.

And it’s not just a matter of skill.

There are people out there selling their services as “writers” or “designers,” who quite honestly have absolutely no business doing so.

When you post a gig on Upwork, you may find yourself absolutely inundated with shitty proposals from people who suck.

Sorry to be blunt about it, but it’s true.

**But believe it or not, the skill issue isn’t even the biggest problem you’ll run into.**

It’s not just a matter of being good at the job or not. You’ll also run into problems with things like honesty and reliability. And that’s really what can trip you up.

#There’s a Huge Freelance Marketplace Out There. I went through a lot of shitty freelancers before I learned to weed them out.

Upwork has its problems, for clients and for freelancers. But from experience, it’s still the most reliable and widely used bidding platform for this kind of thing. (quick history bit: it used to be oDesk but elance bought them and became upwork)

There’s other platforms too like freelancer.com, guru.com, microwokers, but I like upwork the most. 

I will point out that these platforms are *not* the only way to find freelance contractors. You can also use subreddits like /r/forhire, Fiverr, as well as other resources like 99Designs (for graphic design) and the Problogger job board (for copywriting and content writing).

You can also hire through LinkedIn but it’s a topic for different time because it requires a slightly different strategy. 

But honestly, if you’re on a budget and you’re new to all of this, I’d stick with Upwork at first. One of the biggest benefits, other than a sizable pool of potential candidates, is that **Upwork has an escrow system that protects both clients *and* freelancers.**

So if your writer flakes out, or your seemingly perfect graphic designer turns out to be a faker who swiped someone else’s portfolio to claim as their own, you’ll be able to avoid getting fleeced out of your money.

This also protects workers from not getting paid for their work. Well, at least in theory. For the most part, Upwork has better support for clients than for freelancers.

But if you’re hiring, that’s a good thing, at least for you.

This post is more about shitty freelancers to avoid, but I did want to give at least a quick rundown of how to write the kind of job post that attracts the good ones.

**Be as specific as you can, just in general.** Don’t be vague. Don’t worry. No one’s going to steal your idea. Seriously, they’re not. If they were the kind of people who’d even consider doing that -- much less be able to pull it off -- they wouldn’t be writing or designing for literal pennies on Upwork. Plus, being too vague comes across as unprofessional. This can be a deterrent for experienced freelancers.

**Be specific about your niche and topic.** This may matter more for some things than others. But if you’re having an ebook ghostwritten, you want someone who’s at least somewhat familiar with the subject matter. Tell applicants what it’s about, at least in a general sense. Is it about diet and weight loss? Self-help? The good old perennial “how to make money online” category? Someone who’s a world-class expert on ketogenic diets might not know shit about how to flip antiques on eBay.

**Figure out your budget, and state it up front.** Don’t leave it blank and wait for everyone to haggle their way to the bottom. Now, this approach might be worth considering if you’ve got a little budget to play around with. But look. If you’re willing to pay like $0.01/word for a 5k-10k word ebook, you need to realize that **prices literally don’t even go any lower than that.** If you’re already at the low end of the budget scale, you’re not going to get people to undercut each other even more. Not listing a budget is actually a deterrent for many experienced writers and designers. It comes across as unprofessional, and makes it obvious you don’t know what you’re doing. Just list the price you’re willing to pay. If you’re on a low budget, own it. Give some talented newcomer a shot at their first ever paying gig. 

**Ask for samples of their previous work.** Just about anyone should be able to show you something to prove they can do what you need them to do. Even someone who’s never been paid for writing or designing should be able to at least show you some spec work. 

I may do another post about this at some point that goes into more detail.

But basically, these guidelines can help you put together a good post that attracts good talent.

Well, for the most part. Again, you’ll get proposals that suck.

And sure, if you need a writer and the proposal’s in broken English, you can just toss that out and move on. 

But the contractors that can really, genuinely hurt your business usually make it past that point. They may even interview well. 

The problems don’t become apparent until later on.

#**The 3 Kinds of Bad Contractors That Can Seriously Ruin Your Business**

I’ve had my fair share of bad experiences, that’s for sure. And over time, I’ve run into enough of these situations that I’ve started noticing some patterns.

**Overall, there are 3 different “types” I’ve run into that cause trouble.**

The whole point of making this post is so if you’re new to hiring on Upwork, you’ll have a heads-up about what to keep an eye out for.

So, here they are.

**#1. The Disappearing Act**

Also known as “the flake.”

Their proposal caught your eye immediately. They were a league ahead of everyone else in the game.

The interview was perfect. 

You gave them a paid sample project first (always a good idea, by the way), and it was astounding. 

At what you’re paying, this guy is a steal. 

So you’ve got the money in escrow, he’s ready to start, everything’s good to go.

Then a few days later, with the due date coming up, you send them a quick email asking how it’s coming along.

You never hear from them again.

Eventually, you end up pulling your money out of escrow, scrapping the project, and posting again to find someone else.

Ideally, you won’t lose any money on this guy. But what you do lose is something even more precious: your time.

So what’s this guy’s deal? Why is he such a flake?

Honestly, there are a couple possibilities. **None of these are excuses.**

Depression, alcohol abuse, other mental illnesses. Major depressive disorder can fuck your shit up. None of these things excuse this disappearing act, but they are possible underlying issues. I’m not trying to make you sympathize with The Disappearing Act guy, just pointing out people don’t flake out like that randomly out of spite.
They’re a full time college student, or they have small kids, and they greatly overestimated how much free time they had available for your project. Again, this is not an excuse or anything. Just a potential factor.
They took on too much work at once and overloaded themselves, leading to smaller projects and lower-paying clients falling by the wayside. Again, not your fault, not an excuse, just a reason.
They’ve got performance anxiety. This usually ties into number 1, with some kind of substratum of depression or anxiety going on in there.

Those are just a few of the reasons this shit happens, but none of them are your problem. 

When it comes to The Disappearing Act, you want to have a zero tolerance policy for things like missed due dates or delayed communications. 

Regardless of what’s going on with them, your time and money are too valuable to put them at risk with someone who would waste them.

**How to Avoid The Disappearing Act**

So how do you make sure that great writer or designer you just hired isn’t a flake?

On Upwork, you can simply look at their previous history. 

Check their total hours logged.

As a rough guideline, when you're starting out, don't hire them unless they’ve logged over 100 hours total to reduce turnovers. 

Sure, you can get seasoned workers that are new to upwork that doesn't have many hours logged yet but it can be a homerun or a strikeout because they don't have their feedback at stake. 

When you get a bit more advanced, you can consider working with new workers because you'll know what to look for.  

Also, look a little more closely. What is their history like with long term clients they’ve had in the past?

I recommend going with workers who have worked with a past long term client for at least three months.

How are their ratings? Do they have good reviews?

If you’re not sure, move on to the next candidate.

**#2: The Time Waster**

This guy looks promising at first. Good portfolio, decent work history. So, you hire him.

Next thing you know, he’s blowing up your inbox 24/7 with questions, comments, clarifications, and apparently anything else that pops into his head.

Now, don’t get me wrong here. A few questions from your contractor is a good thing. Freelancers will sometimes need a clarification on something, and that’s fine. In fact, it can be a good thing. It’s a sign of professionalism. It means they take their work seriously.

But this guy takes it to the extreme. 

And yet, for all their many questions, they still end up delivering something that’s way off of what you wanted.

They usually mean well, but they end up costing more time and money than they’re worth.

**How to Avoid The Time Waster**

So how do you keep this from happening?

What I do, is I hold an initial voice call when I hire them. I record and document it. That way, I know what’s been covered, and what hasn’t.

But that’s really just an extra layer of precaution. **The best way to avoid The Time Waster is to only hire contractors who have handled similar jobs in the past.**

I’ve already mentioned looking for someone who understands your niche, but that’s just part of it.

You also want someone who’s done the same type of work before.

Let’s say you’re hiring a writer for an ebook about The Cabbage Soup Diet.

You definitely want someone who knows a thing or two about weight loss, nutrition, and things of that nature.

But you also want someone who has specifically written ebooks before. Someone could be a world class email sales copywriter, but not really quite have a handle on how to style and structure an ebook.

It’s its own format, with its own peculiarities. There’s more to writing a good ebook than just being a good writer in general.

So if you need an ebook, look for someone who does ebooks regularly. The same goes for blog posts, sales letters, logo design, or just about anything else.

**#3: The Fake**

They have impressive reviews. Their profile looks nice, very professional.

And their portfolio is perfect. It’s exactly what you’re looking for.

Sounds great, right? There’s just one problem.

**Everything about them is a lie.**

They scammed someone else into writing some content for them, for which they never paid. So voila, they have a portfolio filled with seemingly legitimate work.

That professional looking headshot? Also stolen. Run it through Google Reverse Image Search, and you’ll realize they stole it from some small town newspaper editor named Frances from Bumhole, Indiana.

You just hired The Fake. 

They may then metamorphose into The Disappearing Act.

But there’s an even more insidious possibility.

They might be, in turn, scamming someone else into doing the actual work for them.

Seriously, that happens. I’ve met writers with some horror stories about that. The Fake may be sourcing work on Upwork, or content mills, or wherever, then posting it as a client.

But either way, The Fake is probably the worst kind of shitty freelancer.

The others may just be kind of hapless, not ill intentioned. The Fake is a straight-up scam artist.

**How to Avoid The Fake**

How do you avoid scammers and fakers?

Hold a Skype call with them. Ask them to explain, in their own words, what your project entails.

You can pretty easily tell who’s a faker and who’s genuine, based on their answers.

#**There are some really crappy freelancers out there. But there are also plenty of gems. You just have to find them. And when you find them, keep them. They will make your life a WHOLE lot easier.**

Most freelancers are sincere, hardworking people with good time management skills and plenty of professionalism.

But by knowing the “warning signs,” you can save yourself a whole lot of headaches and frustrations by avoiding people who suck.

I hope this post was helpful, because hiring freelancers can be a total game changer for your business. It can be the key to scaling up and bringing in more money -- all while reducing the amount of work that you have to do yourself. Also, if you hire overseas, some of these guys will take care of work for you at pennies on the dollar of US workers. 

I hope they improve your business and quality of life as they did to mine. I wish you the best of luck!

132,4crxzx,False,,189,"I'm an SEO/Digital Marketing Consultant...I just helped take a client's eCommerce company from just 3 total sales, to nearly $100,00/mo revenue on a bootstrap budget - in less than 3 months. Here's a long-ass post with some takeaways & strategies I used to get there.",Entrepreneur,"**Warning: Long As Hell (but hopefully informative) Post Coming**


Howdy /r/entrepreneur…long time lurker here but I wanted to finally contribute something hopefully semi-useful. I recently helped one of my clients get his online mattress startup from 3 sales, to high 5 figures in revenue/mo, less than 3 full months into the project. Our growth is now on its way to million + $ year 1 revenue. I wanted to share some takeaways &amp; strategies that helped us succeed on a bootstrap budget in a highly competitive industry. Pre-apologies for the novel (I like to write) – but hopefully you can at least skim through.

For context -I'm a freelance ecommerce development consultant.  For 6 years prior to doing this, I was a full-time analyst/operations specialist for a Private Equity investment firm - where I learned a ton and got a lot of experience launching businesses from the investor/operator side.

A few months back, a college buddy approached me about a startup he recently launched with his fiance’s father. The company was called ""[The Dromma Bed](https://drommabed.com)"" - it was an online “Bed-in-a-Box” memory foam mattress company, similar to Casper. If you're not familiar with this industry...its been blowing up over the last year or so.  The idea is to sell a single high-quality bed design exclusively online, roll-pack it in a box, and ship it directly from the manufacturer to consumer. Cutting out the middle distributors and brick-&amp;-mortar markup allows them to sell much higher quality beds for a much lower price than regular mattress stores.  


When he initially approached me the company had only sold a few beds – all to friends &amp; family.  They had been paying another marketing company to run Google ads that didn’t produce any results after several months and several thousand dollars spent. So he asked me if I could help them overhaul their digital strategy. 


I was skeptical about accepting the project at first.  All they really had so far was the mattress design, contracted factories/sourcing channels, and a Wordpress eCommerce site. They were self-funded with a limited budget.  No big email list or social media following.

Aside from the limitations of the actual business – the competition within the mattress industry is fierce. Its typically thought of an unbreakable Oligopoly, dominated by just a few massive companies. Casper managed to break in with a disruptive business model and the advantage of being the first mover – but they had just secured $70 Million Dollars in VC funding. Several other early competitors with similar products had also secured big-money funding.  

 I honestly had no idea if we could find a large enough gap in the market for them to grow into -and I feared their product wasn’t unique enough to carve out their own niche. If there was no gap – there was no business. I didn’t want to waste my time on a project doomed from the start. 

However, after he explained to me more about the product and company, I could see there was actually something to it.

He told me about the extensive design process they went through with top industry experts.  Some of the big differentiators were that their bed had more advanced features, and used higher quality foams &amp; materials than their competitors. Their foams were eco friendly -> most of the competitors weren’t. . They offered multiple firmness levels, while their competitors only had one. And the most important thing of all to me was that he honestly believed their bed was far more comfortable than every similar bed out there they’d tested.

Aside from the product design, the company’s commitment to operating an ethical business model was a big brand differentiator in that industry.  A primary reason they started the company was to help support the manufacturing industry around their hometown in North Carolina – which had been decimated by Asian outsourcing. They made a pledge to source their product with 100% U.S.-made materials and use local production (Their hometown was fortunately home to some of the oldest foam-manufacturers in the country). They refused to budge on this even though it would have been cheaper to outsource. 

It wasn’t necessarily revolutionary … but they had a better product design than their competitors, a good story, and a strong set of company values. So I agreed to the project, and got to work.

My first order of business (after disabling the useless Adwords program from the other company), was tweaking the website – refining the copy and layout to reinforce the sales funnel. 

Once the website was updated, I planned out the first Facebook ad.  I set it up to run without any targeting initially. Within just a few hours, we had made our first online sale.  

That first month using only Facebook Ads as pretty much our only channel (with some small experiments in Adwords), we did ~$20,000. The second month, we added additional sales channels and reached high 5 figure revenue.  We’re currently well on track over $1 million year one revenue.

Here are some general advice/takeaways &amp; specific initiatives that lead to the success of this project (as well as others I've worked on) – which can be applied to other startups working on a bootstrap budget. 

-------------------------------**Marketing Strategy**-------------------------------------------------

**Our basic strategy was to focus on 2-3 paid channels, and do them well**:  We used 3 primary marketing channels to get to this point -  Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, &amp; Affiliate Marketing.  We decided to go with the channels we knew best, and put all of our effort into optimizing them rather than spread ourselves too thin. We spent very little effort on any organic social media (which I explain a bit farther down).  Now that we know what works, we’ve recently been expanding into new channels. 

**Facebook Ads:**  Facebook Ads have been our primary bread and butter. The first month we spent a couple thousand $ on testing various campaigns, then narrowed it down to just 2 of the top performing ads – and let them run continuously.  We found our most successful conversions actually came from keeping the targeting fairly broad – as our market is fairly spread-out and undefined. The key here was using a compelling image –and compelling ad copy. 

Other than running some promotion-specific variations on occasion and some minor tweaks, we really haven't changed our original performing ad creative much at all. If it aint broke, why fix it?

**Adwords - Bid on Competitor’s Search Terms!:** SERP space for the primary keywords around the mattress industry was insanely competitive – resulting in extremely high CPC for prime positioning (I'm talking $15+ per click!). That is why the original marketing company's campaigns weren't getting any results. 

We were most successful running our ads on the brand keywords of mid-level competitors - and creating customized landing pages directly comparing our beds to that competitor's beds.  This allowed us to get way more bang for our advertising buck. We let our better-funded competitors spend the money to get people to perform a search...then all we needed to do is convince those people that our bed is better. Using customized landing pages for each ad resulted in far more conversions than homepage URL ads.

**Affiliate Marketing**:**  Our first sales were the toughest to get because people obviously wanted to see reviews from other customers before they purchased an $800 bed. We found there are tons of blogs and mattress review sites out there who would post a review of our mattress for free, and also post an affiliate link on their site to drive customers to our store. The only up front cost was the cost of a bed…and it more than pays off in every case.  We’ve also been experimenting with the Share-A-Sale platform to manage a larger scale affiliate program…this channel takes a lot of effort to manage, but we’ve seen moderate success with it.

**Public Relations…Don’t Discount the Value of Local PR!**:  From the beginning I knew press write-ups from big publications would be very hard to get as a late-entry company.  So rather than wasting time pandering to mainstream content producers – we put some effort into reaching out to smaller newspapers &amp; magazines.  Articles we had run in tiny local newspapers regularly resulted in several thousand dollars in sales. Valuable lesson here…don’t neglect local PR!

**Refer-a-friend program**:  We implemented a friend referral program last month, and have seen decent results. There is no better marketing than word-of-mouth.  The good thing about these programs is they’re incredibly easy to set up with pre-built software solutions. And once you set it up, you can let it run and more or less forget it (aside from the occasional maintenance). Downside is that its a rather unpredictable as a sales channel.  Our program offers: “refer a frien dand they get a $75 discount, you get $50 cash”.  Obviously our margins/price point were high enough to support those numbers,  but I’ve implemented refer-a-friend campaigns with rewards as small as $5. 

**Takeaway**:  The number of options for attracting users to your site can be overwhelming. Don’t waste your time trying to implement every new marketing gimmick or technology that pops up…even if everybody says ‘it’s the next big thing”. In the early stages if you spread your brain power and marketing dollars too thin across too many channels, none of them will perform. 


---------------------------------------------------------**General Advice**--------------------------------------------------------

**Set a Realistic Marketing Budget**

Some people working on their first ecommerce businesses dramatically underestimate the budget they need for digital marketing.  Your budget should be directly correlated to your targeted revenue-especially in the early stages. You can’t go into it assuming your marketing campaign will net 300-400% ROI.  Adwords reports that their average campaign nets about $2 Revenue : $1 Spend – and that’s  highly variable.   That means if you need to make $10,000 in revenue on a campaign, the minimum you should plan to spend is $5,000…and you should budget even more for wiggle room.


**Never give up your core values  for the bottom line**
When I first heard the founders were only open to sourcing locally– I admired their integrity, but the Private Equity guy in me winced.  In the PE industry, dealing with other people’s money … everything is about the bottom line. 

But during the course of this project and others I’ve worked on, I’ve seen that the companies' commitment to values has been one of the biggest things that strengthen the brand, and actually ends up driving conversions. Customers really do appreciate things like local sourcing, and knowing we use safe, eco-friendly materials - and sometimes thats the difference between buying from us and a better-known competitor. Sticking to your guns on ethical business practices might sometimes cost you slightly more money in the short term, but you'll end up benefiting with a better performing brand in the long run.

**You don’t need to dump a ton money on your website pre-launch**

For an ecommerce company, your website needs to be decent. But if you’re on a budget – it doesn’t need to win a webby award for you to start driving revenue.  The most important thing about your site is good copy, an efficient checkout process, and making sure you have a strong sales funnel. Don’t waste too much time trying to implement every bell and whistle at first.

The Dromma site is extremely basic, and certainly not the prettiest, but it got us to where we needed so far. Now we’re planning to upgrade to a better site as we have more capital to do so.

**Real consumer behavior trumps a good sales pitch**

Most of our competitors were running on the business model &amp; sales pitch of selling “One bed suits all”. They offered one bed design, with no customization options.   However, the actual researched we did showed that one bed doesn’t suit all – real people have preferences in firmness. Selling “one perfect mattress” is a great sales pitch, but it didn’t match consumer buying habits. 
We found that many customers from our competitors were returning beds because they were too soft or too hard – they were bouncing around to multiple companies trying to find the exact right fit.   So one of the biggest competitive advantages we’ve capitalized on is offering multiple firmness levels. If the first bed a customer tries doesn’t work, we swap it out for the other free of charge.

Takeaway: make sure your sales pitch matches with actual consumer behavior. Don’t just go off “gut instinct” what you think people want to hear…go off what they actually want to buy &amp; use.

**If something isn’t working, cut your losses as soon as possible**

At one point we tried migrating from Wordpress to Shopify. We put a significant amount of time and effort into getting it going. But once we launched, we found an unforeseen problem with it that would take a lot of time &amp; money to fix. Rather than letting our pride get the best of us and stubbornly pushing forward, we cut our losses, and reverted back to the original system. It was disappointing, but we didn’t waste any more time or money than need be. 

Takeaway: If something isn’t working out, cut your losses sooner than later. Don’t try to force something to work just because you’ve put  a lot of effort into it.

**Don’t get lost in targeting (at first)**

When we first launched we had expectations about our primary demographic. Based on our research, we expected our primary market to be young millennials who are  more likely to buy something from a new industry. However, I still decided to run our ads with very broad targeting with no age limits so we could see how the older demos in their mid 30s to late 50s were buying beds. What we found was that those older demos were far more likely to convert than early Millennials. We wouldn’t have discovered this if we only targeted based on our initial expectations.

Takeaway: Do your initial demographic research, but unless you have a very niche product, don’t target your ads too narrowly until you 100% confirm that’s who will be most interested in your product.  

**Good Copy Is Essential**
I managed to start driving initial sales just by making some adjustments to the on-site copy.  We’ve also seen measureable improvements in conversion rates from just making minor text tweaks.
The most common issue I come across with ecommerce startups is that they launch their website with extremely shoddy copy. A lot of these guys are great entrepreneurs – but terrible sales copy writers.

Takeaway: Copy is king – you won’t see nearly the sales you could if its not up to snuff.  Don’t be afraid to get outside help to write for you.

**Traditional Organic Social Media is nearly dead – don’t waste too much time on it**

We spent very little time with organic social. And until we get enough of - its not a priority for us.  
Facebook essentially killed traditional social media marketing when they updated their algorithm to drastically limit organic reach potential to 1-2 percent of your audience.  However, many companies are still dumping countless man-hours trying to grow their pages and get that “free traffic”. Unfortunately, no matter how much time &amp; effort they put into it – most will not see the results they want. Twitter is hit or miss. And Instagram is great for awareness in certain niches – but its extremely hard to drive actual conversions from.

Takeaway: Don’t waste too much time on organic social unless it’s essential for your niche.
 
**SEO is a long term play that won't drive immediate sales – especially in a heavily competitive industry**

I’m saying this as an experienced SEO consultant. Organic search is a slow-growth channel – I don’t care how much link-building you do or structured data you enter - if you’re in a competitive industry with well established companies, you will have a difficult time ranking for many of the primary keywords that will drive sales right off the bat. You should focus more on the secondary keywords that are easiest to obtain. We'll shift our focus to SEO once we get some breathing room.

With limited resources, your immediate initial focus with SEO should be making sure your site is solid from a technical standpoint, ensuring that you rank for your own brand keywords names – and making sure your website displays properly on the SERP.  Be aware of the keywords you want to rank for over time, generate content when you can, and optimize as much as you can…but you don’t need put too much work into it in the very early stages until you have the resources to do so.

**Product First, Brand Second**

The success of many of our competitors came from riding on the initial wave of being a “cool new online company” in a trendy industry. But they were so focused on building a “sexy brand” as quickly as possible – they didn’t care enough about the actual product they were selling. That’s why now, many of the competitor’s sales trends are flattening out, while ours continue to grow.  

We have been successful because the founders put so much effort into creating a great product. That has lead to many happy customers and subsequently many word-of-mouth referral sales.  Great brands can be toppled by selling shitty products. Always make sure you’re putting the thing you’re selling ahead of the brand that’s selling it.

**Ignore the competition when setting your initial goals**
This is an important one. We get inundated by the media with these huge startup success stories, and feel our own smaller accomplishments are inadequate in comparison. . My advice is this - Ignore the competition’s achievements, focus on your own realistic goals.

 Casper had done $30 Million in sales their first year. Our next biggest competitor did $15 Million.  But we were in a different position than those companies - and I knew if we had gone in trying to emulate those numbers, we were setting ourselves up for failure. So one of the first things I did was talk to the founders about realistic expectations for revenue.  We agreed: Coming from 0 sales, If we could get to the point where we were selling 1-2 bed per day, we would consider it a big success. Planning around an achievable goal allowed us to better focus our marketing dollars, and scale the business in a controlled fashion. 

**You Don’t Have To Be A First Mover To Be Successful – Especially if you’re on a tight budget**

So many would-be entrepreneurs (myself included) have been dissuaded from pursuing a great idea when they realize it’s already been done before. But ask yourself this – how many pure monopolies still exist out there?  As a startup on a limited budget, you’re much more likely to be successful coming “fashionably late to the party”.

Our ability to break into the market quickly was the result of our ability to research our competitors, and improve on their strategies and product offerings. We could see how customers responded to their products, what worked, and what didn’t.  

Being the first mover certainly has its advantages. It’s also thought of as ""sexier"" and more exciting than coming late into a trending market.  But being first is generally much riskier and much more expensive.  They have to make all the mistakes themselves…and also spend the money &amp; effort to grow a market from scratch.

Be aware of your competition – but don’t let it scare you off entirely.

**Your Product Differentiation Doesn’t Have To Be Revolutionary To Succeed!**

 Following up with the previous point, your idea doesn't have to be some sort of revolutionary breakthrough for your business to do well. There are actually many advantages to launching a business with already proven and tested products &amp; technologies.

For Dromma, most of the features in the bed can be found on other beds out there – but none of the competitors offered all of those features in a single design.  The technologies have been around for a long time – we just figured out how to apply them in a new way. That approach is far less risky than trying to launch something new and untested.  

The founders also made sure Dromma was more comfortable, and used the highest quality materials possible.  Along with the strong values, that was enough.  They didn’t drain all of their resources trying to re-invent the wheel.


Anyway, I’m super excited about the success of this project, and where we're going to grow from here. Just hope everybody here realizes that success is possible in almost any industry, even on a limited budget.

I’ll leave it there for now. If you have any questions about anything specific, feel free to ama and I’ll try to help you out.

**Edit** Thanks for all of the kind words and great advice/question as! I'm going to try to get back to everyone asap, just give me a bit!   I'm well aware there is still plenty left to do on the site &amp; lots of great marketing opportunities to explore, so all of your suggestions are definitely appreciated.

237,a3zhw6,False,,86,The template I use to write FB ads that tend to get clicks/sales,Entrepreneur,"I audit a lot of Facebook ads accounts, which means I get to see what works and what doesn’t across loads of different industries, countries and ad types.  


By far, the most common area for ‘big potential improvements’ is the copy in their ads.  


***For example*** \- I took on a Gym as a client in the summer who had never managed to make Facebook ads work, despite having all the ‘assets’ in place (nice website, big social following, loads of photos & videos, a good facility, great reviews, admin team to handle leads efficiently…).  


We had a short timeline to get ads out, so all I did was re-use their existing visuals, package up one of their popular classes in a new way, and write new copy.  


That campaign brought in around 120 leads in 3 weeks for under £4 a lead, and then we had to shut it down because the classes were full.  


Here are the most common mistakes that I’ve seen in the accounts I’ve audited this last few months, and then the fairly simple way that I approach writing a new advert.  


*\*Note, I’m not a professional copywriter, I have hired a few great copy guys in my time, who’s ads generally do outperform mine, but what I’ve learnt to do is like the 80/20, 80% of the results for 20% of the time/ money invested.*  
*Most common mistakes:*  


1. **Talking about yourself, not the reader -**   
This is what the gym above were doing, and it’s something that most local businesses do too much“We’ve been operating for 30 years” “We care about our clients” “We are passionate and experience” - your reader just does not care about all that, what they want to know is what’s in it for THEM.  

2. **Not testing variations -**   
Often business owners will latch onto one phrase/headline that seems to work, and just use that for every ad.   
That’s understandable, because they don’t have the time to give FB ads the amount of attention required to do proper testing, but it is a waste.  
An commerce client was spending £300 a day on ads, and they were the primary driver of his sales, but he was relying on just one phrase, and as soon as we tested some other headlines, we found variations that outperformed his.  

3. **Dry copy -**   
This is VERY common in B2B - for example, a business I audited who helped graphic designers build website without having to deal with web developers, they wanted to look professional, or like a bigger business, and so they got all corporate, but the person reading your ad IS A PERSON, and their boring ads weren’t persuading them to do anything.  

4. **Not qualifying the reader -**   
When people are scrolling their news feed, 90% of the time, it’s the visual that gets attention, then the reader is going to scan the ad to see if it’s worth another single second of their day.   
What they’re looking for is relevance -so make it easy for them.A good friend of mine runs a course on investing in property, and this was something he was missing out on.Just starting his ads with a phrase like “For people who’ve wondered how to actually make money from property” helped people self-qualify, and increased clicks immediately.  

5. **No Call To Action -**   
If you want people to sign up with you, then you’ve got to take people by the hand and walk them through each step of the way.   
This was the case for a meditation coach I audited, her ads were interesting and engaging, but because she wasn’t telling people exactly what to do next i.e. “Click the button to download it now” or “Hit Learn More and fill in the quick form, one of our team will then call you to arrange an intro session” she was missing out on a lot of clicks.  

6. **Features over Benefits -**   
This is such a big one, and a current SEO agency client were guilty of it.   
They would talk about the technical aspects of SEO and what was included in the services, rather than what that would actually mean for the client (more traffic, more leads, more clients, more money)  

7. **Not telling stories -**   
Us human-folk like a story. It’s fundamental to our society as a race that was pass on information through stories.   
Yet many businesses are hesitant to use them.I audited a driving instructor instructor (he taught people how to become an instructor), and he had the potential for great stories “Bob was bored of office life and hated the rigid hours of his corporate job, but after he qualified with me, he’s now in charge of his working hours and doesn’t answer to anyone but his wife""  


**So HOW DO YOU WRITE ADS?**

  
Copywriting is a thing that people spend decades trying to master, so don’t worry about emulating the pros, and instead keep it simple and follow a few rules.   


It’s not about writing award winning ad copy, it’s about being able to come up with a functional group of words that connect with the reader and get them to take action  


**My favourite ‘template' for quickly writing ad copy (or any copy) is the 4 why’s:** 

*(This I learnt from the wonderful Colin Theriot, who runs a FB group called the Cult of Copy)*  


Answer these questions (in order) that the reader is asking in their heads.

1. Why me? (How do I know that this is for ME specifically?)
2. Why you? (Who the fuck are YOU? Why are you the person telling me this?)
3. Why this? (Why is THIS AD/OFFER relevant and interesting to me and my set of circumstances?)
4. Why now? (Why do I need to pay attention/ take action RIGHT NOW? Can I ignore this until later?) 

  
That is going to cover your bases.  
From there, here are some specific tips to help add a bit of shine.

* Make sure you have a VERY clear avatar defined. If you don’t know who you’re talking to, it will come through in your copy.
* One problem, one solution - focus on one thing per ad, don’t try to sell 8 different things.
* Use testimonials wherever you can, they make easy, meaningful stories to tell.
* Speak naturally - read the ad out loud and make sure it doesn’t sound clanky or awkward.
* Avoid big blocks of text and break up your ad into different sentence/paragraph lengths.
* If you run a local business, then start your ad with the name of the place - i.e. “BRISTOL pet owners…""
* Get someone else to read the ad and ask them if it makes sense, it’s easy to get lost in the finer details and end up with something that doesn’t actually communicate what you want it to, or explain the offer properly.
* And finally, read back every sentence of you ad, and ask yourself “So What?” This will help keep you on track and avoid waffling on.

248,9q5oxg,False,,133,Step by Step Guide on How to Manufacture Products in China,Entrepreneur,"I have written this tutorial on my [blog](http://garlicpressseller.com). But I figured loads of people on here source, or are planning to source from China as well. So hopefully this will be helpful for loads of people. These are the steps I take when I want to manufacture a new product from China. There are loads of different ways of course, but this is simply how I do it.

&#x200B;

If this is the first time you manufacture a product in China, this process might seems very scary. And you have all the right to be! You are pretty much handing a huge sum of money to someone in China to produce the product you want! A lot of things that can go wrong! However, once you have done it a couple of times, you will realise it is actually quite easy.

# 1). Contacting Suppliers

The main website to find Chinese suppliers is: [Alibaba.com](https://www.alibaba.com/)You simply search for the product you want to manufacture and you will find loads of suppliers that will manufacture this product for you!

I am a big fan of the “shotgun approach”. This means you send out the same standard email to as many suppliers as possible. With this email you want to ask some basic questions, and reach as many potential suppliers as possible. I simply copy & paste 1 email template and send them to as many suppliers on Alibaba as I can find. Below you can check out the template I use.

>*Hi, I am looking to manufacture product X. I have attached a picture as a reference.*  
>  
>*Specifications:*\- *Color: x– Size: x– Material: xCan you manufacture this product?Do you have similar products?Can you send your catalog if you have one.What is the lead time?What is the FOB price for x amount of units?Can I customise the product by adding my logo on it?How is the product currently packaged?Thank you and have a nice day,<Name>*

Based on these reactions you can already make your first selection. Some suppliers will reply very late, or some won’t even reply at all. Some will reply with very high price. To those suppliers I simply reply that I have received better prices, and if they want to be considered as my supplier they should lower their prices. Once I have received all replies, I usually compile all suppliers in a spread sheet to make things easy to compare.

## 2). Samples

Based on the reactions from the suppliers I have gathered above, I can select the top suppliers and request samples from them. Now I don’t request samples from just one supplier, I usually request samples from the top 5 suppliers. This gives me options to pick the best suppliers based on the sample quality and negotiate prices between them.

Normally the sample cost is free and you only have to pay for shipping. Now if you have to pay shipping to your home country for each sample your order ( x5 ) this can add up quickly. That is why I always have them ship all my samples to 1 address in China ( which is usually free, as shipping within China is very cheap ), then I combine all the shipments there, and ship it as 1 package. This way I can save massively on shipping. There are a couple of companies who provide this service, but I use Tip Trans

# 3). Negotiating price

Now before we even start talking about the price we have to know about Incoterms:

## Incoterms: FOB vs EXW

If you start dealing with Alibaba suppliers and discussing the price you will run into Incoterms. Incoterms define how you goods are transported and when the ownership of the goods are transferred. There are a lot more Incoterms, and the most common ones you will run into are: FOB & EXW.

**FOB: Free On Board**

This means the supplier will delivery the goods from their warehouse to the port and load them on your freight forwarders ship.

**EXW: Ex Works**

Ex works simply means the supplier will manufacture the goods and have them ready for pick at their factory.

So the very important difference between these Incoterms is that when you request your supplier a FOB quote: The supplier will pay shipping from their factory to the port. And when you request a EXW quote, your forwarder will have to pick up the goods at the factory ( resulting in a higher fee from the forwarder ).

So now that we know about Incoterms we can start negotiating about the price! Once we have received our samples, I pick the best ones. I make a top three of the best suppliers ( based on quality & price) , and negotiate between them. A very good negotiating tactic that I have learned is simply to tell them you have a better offer from another supplier. Even if this is not the case, I can always skim a little bit of the price with a simple email like:

>*Thank you for quote, I really like your product. However, my boss demands I get the lowest price as possible. And we have received a price $1,3 from supplier x. Since this is lower than your quote my boss wants to go with supplier X. Please let me know if we can negotiate the price, else I am afraid we have to go with supplier X*

You will find out that you can negotiate a lot with Chinese suppliers, and I personally think this is a very interesting game. Now after going back and forward with my top suppliers, I pick the best one based on price & product quality.

# 4). Payment & Production

In order for the supplier to start with the production it will usually require some sort of a deposit. From my experience it is normal to pay 30% upfront, and 70% once the production is finished. This will also be referred to as 30/70 tt.

&#x200B;

# 5). Quality control

I ALWAYS have my production process inspected by a 3rd party. It doesn’t matter if I have been ordering from them for a couple of years, I always check the quality of the product while it is still in the factory! If you do a bit of research you will find plenty of horror stories about people who received a great quality sample, have the supplier produce their product, and then get ripped of by their supplier who produces a sub-par product. I had this happen myself as well, and I can tell you right now: If you find out in the USA you have a bad quality product it is too late!

I personally use an inspection company in China. I let them schedule a date with the supplier when almost all the products are done. They go to the factory, take out a sample size of the production and inspect every detail of it.They send me the report on the same day with pictures and all the details. They also highlight any possible defects the shipment might have. Once I have received the quality control report and approved this, I can pay the remaining 70%.

# 6). Shipping

You will have a couple of options when shipping your products from China to the USA. Each option has it’s own advantages and I will cover each one:

**Ocean**

\- Slow: Average shipping time 30 days

\+ Cheap!

**Air**

\+ Fast, average 7 day shipping

\- More expensive than ocean shipping

**Air Express**

Air express is pretty much a faster and more expensive version of Air shipping. Air express will be the services such as DHL & UPS. They will charge you an extremely high rate, however you product will arrive very quickly. I also believe that import duties are already included in the price with Air Express. However, you should double check that as I have not shipped with air express for a while.

My choice I ship 90% of my products by ocean. This is simply the most cost effective way of shipping your products. There are a couple of occasions when I prefer to ship my goods via Air:

– **Quick restock**: If I am doing my stock forecast and notice I will run out of stock before I am able to restock with ocean shipping. In this case I will gladly ship by Air or even Air express as you never want to run out of stock .

– **Quick launch**: If I am really excited about a product, and want to launch it as quickly as possible. In this case I will ship a couple of carton by Air Express that I will use to get started with promo's & photography.

275,9altw3,False,,231,"No education, was almost homeless, battled depression; now Co-founder of 2 nearly 7 figure annual businesses with only 3 employees. If I can do it, so can you!",Entrepreneur,"Was thinking through my entrepreneurial journey last night and felt compelled to share this in case it may help some budding entrepreneur somewhere. I feel incredibly blessed in seeing how far I’ve come in my life and hope this would encourage others. 

To start things off, I have no degree (other than a High school diploma) and about 10 years ago I was nearly homeless making between $200-$400/month. If I had no family in the area with whom I could live, I would have been homeless, so I’m thankful every day for them. 

I have been a lifelong entrepreneur but never really realized it until about 10 years ago. When I was 5 I would take drawings I made to the grocery store with my mom and ‘sell’ them to grandmas for 5 or 10 cents. I had a great pitch, I’d ask if they wanted the drawing, they would of course say yes, to which I would reply, “that will be 5 cents,” or 10 cents or whatever I felt like charging at the time. Ran paper routes, shoveled snow from driveways, and mowed lawns for extra money throughout Jr. High and High School. All this to say, I always wanted to do my own thing, start my own business but never knew how. 

8 years ago I started a web design & development company with a friend, when I knew literally nothing about web dev. Like nothing. We sold websites for $100 per page but we didn’t ask what the pages needed to be or do or anything. We were so dumb. 

After about 6 months of that I got hired at a web development and marketing firm as a project manager. Turns out I’m a really (really really) shitty project manager but I’m great at sales. Was promoted to director of channel sales in 1 year. 1 year after that I was fired. Long story with that but in short my inner entrepreneur was dying and I needed out, the management saw that and fired me.

That put me in a period of depression for about 2 years because I felt like a massive failure. I had helped build that company from 12 employees to over 100 in 2 years, and being fired really, really hurt. I then bounced around jobs for awhile, wanting to start my own thing but again, was depressed & felt like a failure. As anyone who has (or does) deal with depression knows, finding motivation to do anything is insanely hard- when it feels like waking up and getting out of bed is an accomplishment, reaching to start a business seems like walking on water. 

4.5 years ago I started my own web dev & marketing agency with a friend mainly because at that web dev & marketing firm I was fired from a few years prior I had done an good job of networking in the local community and I was known as the guy to talk to when it came to web development and digital marketing. We actually did ok, made some money, and through this I started to realize I wasn’t as big of a failure I thought I was. More importantly I began to learn a bit about running my own company and how much work that took. We weren’t doing super well tho, I had to work nights waiting tables to barely pay the bills. 

3 years ago I started a baby brand with my wife and launched our products on Amazon. This was a HUGE leap for us. Started the whole business on credit while trying to start my web dev/marketing agency and working nights as a waiter. Day 1 we had 9 sales. 9. Whole. Sales. May not sound like a lot but those 9 sales were from perfect strangers and it was so much more validating than anything to date. 

Things slowly progressed and 2 years ago I stopped the web dev company and quit working as a waiter cos I was making about $25k/month online in the business I started with my wife (to date the best month we had in the web dev company was $9k).

Along the way I have learned a lot more about marketing and getting good press and have been invited to speak all over the US and internationally. Sometimes I even get paid to speak, which is crazy and cool. So far this year in that eComm business I started 3 years ago I’ve grossed almost $480k, up 40% over my sales last year over the same time period. 

In May this year I started another business online with two partners I met through eComm and speaking and so far we’ve made $170k in that new business (in 3 months!), plus as a result of that I’ve been offered to consult for a company starting at $10k/month. 

All this to say- if you bet on yourself, are a perpetual self-educator, and learn how to develop and sell solutions to problems that people have you’ll do far better than you ever will if you work for someone else. That and if you are in a shitty season of life and battle depression like I have, you can do it. 

I wouldn’t say I’ve arrived but I would say I’m at a more pleasant spot in my journey than I was 10 years ago. 

TL:DR- I went from literally nothing, battled through depression and now am a Co-Founder of two successful 6 (nearly 7) figure businesses. You can do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9altw3/no_education_was_almost_homeless_battled/,788,"This is great man. I have one question, what is meant by “a baby brand”?

I was the first to hit the market and I was the first to acquire the majority of available shelf space in the US. It was a hemp product. I sold the business a few years ago and have been living comfortably ever since, but it wasn’t enough to retire.

Recently, my loved one(s) are irking me to move. Their urgency and my financial situation meant I had to get a job, which means I might feel like killing myself.. so I took a step back, and I rolled 10 joints, and I sat on my back porch for 36 hours. I didn’t use the bathroom, eat, or even stand. I smoked weed, started into the tree line, and thought about how I could solve the problem of wanting to be near my family without selling my soul to an employer. 

After a well earned sleep, I woke up and began working. I worked for 75 hours straight 😂 I built a new website. A few hours a day I worked on the website and nothing to big happened with it until a few of my content pieces went viral. I built this website for about 45 days before I started to make money from it.

The website is a niche that reports news pertaining to products like I used to sell. 

I built the website user base to over 100,000 monthly users, and as long as my traffic remains the same, and the law doesn’t change too much, I have enough advertising contracts to comfortably last me the rest of my life.

I closed a sponsorship deal with a company that equates to over 6 figures of income annually by itself. After the meeting, I went back to the same spot on my back porch with a single celebratory joint, and I cried before I lit it.

520,2qpxz4,False,,142,The 5 books I read before starting a profitable business that replaced my day job.,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

A little over a year ago I started a new business and saw some pretty incredible growth, allowing me to quit my day job, travel, work from anywhere I pleased, and feel great about the work I do every single day.  I imagine many people are thinking about starting a business as a New Year’s resolution, and I thought it might be a good time to share some light reading that I felt was key to my early planning stages.  For veterans of this forum you likely won’t see anything new, but I hope this will help a few people along the way.  For reference, my business is called Executive Drafts, a career consulting and resume writing company based out of Austin, Texas.  (www.ExecutiveDrafts.com)

Here’s my recommended reading list, arranged in the order I think they’d be most useful to someone starting out.

**The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime**

Excellent book, cheesy title.  A perfect “first book”, this really helped me to understand my own definition of “rich”, what my actual goals were, and whether or not I knew the steps involved in getting there.  It offered excellent insight into evaluating the potential of a business, understanding what I wanted to avoid (shipping physical goods, and hiring dedicated employees were two things I wanted to avoid if possible).  This got the wheels turning.  Instead of saying “I like X, I think I’ll make a business out of it!”, I started actively evaluating and formulating business ideas.

**The 4-hour Workweek**

Very well-known, this book is an absolute must read if you want to learn how to have ""full time"" pay on a part time schedule. It has so many potential uses. The author used it to travel the world and streamline his businesses to require as little hands-on time as possible. I used it to create a six figure business working 8 hours a week DURING my 40-hour work week. I firmly believe my happiness depends on working between 10-20 hours a week while enjoying life, traveling, and spending time with family.  This book was monumental in showing both practical ways of accomplishing this, and theoretical ways of approaching career decisions.

**The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups**

Y combinator is a famous startup incubator that helped launch companies like Dropbox and Airbnb. It's heavily geared towards software (which is where I want to build my next business) and is a superb""documentary"" that follows several companies inside a single class of Ycom. Awesome for watching how the young hot tech startups are operating, what their failures were, and giving you insight into the way venture capitalists think. A must read if you find yourself dreaming of being the next big thing. Educational AND entertaining.

**The Lean Startup**

This is sort of the bible for new business ventures. Regardless of the business you build, this will teach you the mindset of creating quick ""minimum viable products"" and using the feedback loop to quickly change your product based on user input. The theory is practically accepted as truth nowadays, since so many new businesses operate under this methodology. It gets you out of the mindset of ""I want the product to be perfect before launching it to the world!"" and into ""lets make something that barely works then let users tell us how to build the rest"".

**Rework**

A really interesting read into corporate counterculture. This company hates meetings and other time-wasters, and offers tons of eclectic/strange but work-changing practices that keep people productive. It makes fun of the typical hour-long meeting, and dives into the practices of a company that operates with primarily remote employees. An excellent foray into efficiency in the startup workplace.

Hey all,

&nbsp;

Happy New Year! My [last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3n8w60/from_2k_to_3k_per_month_blogging_income_report/) was about growing a blog from $2k to $3k per month.

&nbsp;

In that post, I estimated 2015 revenue:

&nbsp;

> Projecting out, I estimate the site will generate around $33,500 this year.

&nbsp;

I'm happy to report that this estimate was surpassed. Total revenue for 2015 was $36,566.

&nbsp;

I've been writing [quarterly income reports](http://www.themodestman.com/category/resources/income-reports/) on my blog, and I just finished a full [2015 year in review](http://www.themodestman.com/2015-review/), but I'll give you the breakdown here in this post:

&nbsp;

Q1: $5,832

Q2: $7,905

Q3: $8,964

Q4: $13,866

&nbsp;

Why was Q4 so high? Well, especially in this industry (menswear/fashion/retail), advertisers spend way more money during the Q4 holiday season.

&nbsp;

This means everything from affiliate revenue to banner ads to sponsorships was up. Sponsored posts were a huge part of the business during this part of the year.

&nbsp;

I also formed a couple of key partnerships that have been really successful, most notably with a company called [AdThrive](http://www.adthrive.com/).

&nbsp;

The handle all of the automatically served media (banner/video) ads on my site, using a combination of different ad networks (AdSense, etc.).

&nbsp;

With their help, the site's advertising **RPM has more than tripled** (to just over $5).

&nbsp;

*If you have unsold ad inventory, or are willing to put additional ad placements on your site, I highly recommend checking out AdThrive.*

&nbsp;

I'm not an affiliate or employee, just a fan of their service.

&nbsp;

Traffic was also up from 2014 - it more than doubled (up 118%), and it's almost all organic.

&nbsp;

This is due to making sure basic on-page SEO is done correctly for every single post. It's really simple stuff, but so many bloggers ignore it - especially when it comes to writing titles for blog posts.

&nbsp;

If you follow [this guide](http://backlinko.com/on-page-seo), you'll be way ahead of most bloggers.

&nbsp;

*Side note: I've learned that I have no idea which content will do well, and which content won't. The top three posts of 2015 were completely unrelated. The only unifying theme was that they all did well in search. Even seasoned bloggers tell me that they're still just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.*

I'm hoping to double traffic again in 2016, and increase revenue to a consistent $10k/month.

I also want to grow [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbfoD1o7sV0VxErpxTCpyw), which only has about 1,200 subscribers right now. I just haven't made it a priority to focus on it, but that will change this year.

The past few 3-4 months have convinced me that this site *can* generate ""full-time"" income. That's why I post these reports on this sub - to show any other fledgling or struggling bloggers that it is, in fact possible.

301,31qvv0,False,,177,What I'd tell myself about startups if I could go back 5 years.,Entrepreneur,"(I'm not the author)

This is, in no particular order, what I'd tell myself about startups if I could go back in time to when I first got involved. Which is probably the same as what I've learned. This is most definitely not advice, the ""you"" here is directed at me. So is ""I"". Grammar is hard.

 1. You're definitely going to end up building too much and shipping too late. Be obsessive about avoiding this
 - Someone's always already working on the same idea and that's not a bad thing
 - Always refuse if someone asks you to sign an NDA before hearing their idea
 - Like it or not, most networking in London is focused around drinking. Find a way to deal with that without having a constant hangover
 - The people who are really getting somewhere aren't the people who are always out for drinks
 - Linear growth can be worse than no growth
 - Most people who talk about failing fast, aren't actually practicing this
 - It's really easy to kid yourself that you're ""doing customer development"" when actually you're finding ways to make what your customers are saying fit with what you want to build
 - Everyone has a hidden stash of domains they've never used
 - It's really easy to become hyper-critical and respond to every idea with ""yeah but that won't work because of x"". This is lazy, don't do it.
 - Be especially careful to avoid the above when talking to people who are new to the scene. Call out other people who do it
 - It's really hard to listen to someone pitching an idea you've seen fail several times already and focus on working out if there's something slightly different and interesting there
 - Someone being a technically competent developer does not mean they know how to ship things. I'd always rather work with someone who ships over someone who's technically brilliant
 - The programming language/ framework wars are great fun in the pub, but of limited value in real life
 - A good developer can pick up any language or platform in a few weeks
 - I still don't know any real investors
 - Constantly exaggerating how well you're doing can be very tiring. It makes it harder to publicly celebrate the real victories
 - It's really hard to build a product if you don't have a big personal investment in the problem it solves
 - Falling in love with a product (rather than the problem) is really dangerous
 - You can get away without knowing how a hash table works, but it's really satisfying when you eventually learn it
 - Same goes for Big O notation
 - Overnight success isn't a thing. The Social Network is still a great movie
 - I still don't understand PR
 - Most technical solutions are trivial compared to how you get the product into peoples hands
 - Make something people want is probably a less useful heuristic than make something you want
 - But you wanting it doesn't mean enough people want it for it to be a business
 - If you don't have first hand experience of an industry, you're probably wrong about how it works, what problems they have and so how they should be solved. Talk to people
 - ""Ads"" are where business models go to die
 - ""We'll monetize the data"" is the new ""Ads""
 - The people you end up wanting to work with (and help) are the ones who always try and work out how they can help you. Be more like them
 - But get really good at asking for things. Most people will give you a discount for no reason other than you asked. If you see someone important and influential, introduce yourself
 - Get good at saying no to things, from people asking you for discounts to interesting projects you really don't have enough time for
 - Think hard about a pivot which makes good business sense but leads to a product you no longer care about
 - Writing (blogging, books, journaling) is a really positive experience
 - Don't pay too much attention to internet comments about something you've written, there's always someone who didn't like one particular sentence (see point about trolls below)
 - One troll can wipe out a hundred positive interactions, be ruthless in keeping them out of your communities
 - If you end up pitching to someone over coffee, ask to hear their pitch afterwards
 - Only say you're going to introduce someone or send them something if you're actually going to do it. People quickly get a reputation for never following through
 - Show don't tell. ""I'm going to build this amazing thing"" is a LOT less interesting than ""I've built this slightly crappy thing that actually does something"". EVERYONE is GOING to build something, most people never do
 - Building things is awesome, don't get too caught up with the whole ""Lean Startup Landing Page"" mindset
 - Lean Startup is awesome, but it's a pamphlet not a book, read the first few chapters and you'll get the idea. Four steps to the epiphany is more technical and probably a better book
 - Most startup advice is terrible and the good advice is usually obvious. Everyone will give different advice, trust your gut
 - Except when it comes to what your customers want, then ignore your gut and trust them
 - No-one has ever used a Bitcoin ATM for practical reasons
 - Do back of napkin financial forecasts for every potential business model you come up with, just to see if it's in the right ballpark to a couple of orders of magnitude
 - It's really easy to automatically dismiss everyone who starts a conversation with ""I'm looking for a technical co-founder"". Doing this means you miss talking to some interesting people. But be upfront that you're not that co-founder so no-one feels like their time is wasted
 - Trying to raise money and apply to accelerators is a full time job. You're probably either building or fund raising. Not both. If in doubt, choose building
 - The solution to many, many problems, is not technical. That won't stop people trying solve them with apps
 - Facebook is the Facebook for X
 - The idea you laughed at when you saw them pitch at a hackathon may well be the one that's still alive and kicking long after whatever you pitched fails
 - If there are people who genuinely like failing, I've never met them
 - That was not ""your idea"" unless you shipped something, otherwise I invented Facebook, Nest and Oculus Rift
 - People don't steal ideas. Tell as many people as possible. Never ask someone to sign an NDA before hearing your idea, you'll instantly lose all credibility
 - Being friends with somebody is not the same as being able to work well with them
 - Small teams can move VERY fast, be really careful getting extra people involved in any project where agility is important
 - Multi-tasking isn't a thing, switching costs are huge, do one thing at a time and do it really well. Find a way to block out interruptions
 - [Read every essay Paul Graham has written](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
 - Tech news (and news is general) has a very low return on time invested. Prefer books and conversations
 - Read Founders Stories, Fooled By Randomness and The Four Steps to the Ephiphany
 - The logo doesn't matter at the start, find a simple text based logo you can re-use for different projects
 - If you possibly can, open source and write up any side project. Every now and then you'll meet somebody really interesting as a result
 - Regularly working 12 hour days is probably never a good idea. If this is happening a lot, find a way to optimise
 - Talk to everybody

875,4ydmpu,False,Case Study,53,"Selling $5,000 on Reddit and Instagram in 48 hours without being Spammy [Case Study]",Entrepreneur,"An interesting interview with an ecommerce entrepreneur (selling soy candles) who had success engaging people on Reddit and Instagram to drive sales without being pushy and spammy. They Sold $5,000 within 48 hours just from the engagement they got on very niche subreddits. 

It's a great podcast, so if you have time listen to the whole thing here :

https://www.shopify.ca/blog/122652997-wax-and-wick-reddit-for-marketing

and I have also timestamped the interesting parts below.

If you've ever tried or witnessed someone planting links in a subreddit, you'll know what happens next (the pitchforks come out).  

They sell soy candles (super niche product), and it was interesting to read how they actually engaged redditors to get feedback on their idea and product, and actually improved their products based on that feedback.

They had some pretty insightful things to say about reddit, because here you're more like to hurt your brand than drive traffic if you look at it as a marketing channel more than a community.

It's not crazy amount of sales, but the fact they engaged people to improve their product and build trust was an interesting part of the podcast.  It's kind of obvious that you need to be real.  But it's cool to see the *results* of being real on reddit on here.

Thought this would be of interest to the folks here.

Cheers!

190,50i591,False,,120,Marketing is Not Hard. Let's cut the BS and talk about a strategy that works every time,Entrepreneur,"# Introduction
Hi. Sit down. Let’s talk about Marketing. Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell you an Ah-ma-zing $1.000 marketing course. I wrote this because all the misinformation and 'advice' about marketing makes me sad.  It’s like nobody has a clear view of *what* tools to use for *which* effect.. I see a lot of sources on how to use  tools (which is awesome!) but no mention on *how* this fits into a marketing strategy for your business. **How can you use tools if you have no idea if they’ll fit your market or have the desired effect on your business?**

I’ve run my own company for the last 5 years. We create online software products to make our customers lives easier. I studied international marketing and am a software engineer. The past year I have focused on developing a process to create/execute marketing strategies. **The goal of this post is to explain that process and to show that it’s easy to do marketing**. You’ll be able to create a marketing strategy and have a clear idea where to grow your business.

If any of you can chime in on the ideas I’m presenting, please respond below. The process will always be a work in progress, any feedback is welcome! Most of my marketing experience is online but the ideas also apply to ‘the real world’.

Let’s begin, grab some coffee, this’ll take around 10 minutes to read.

# Customer Lifecycle Marketing


The process involves a CRM principle called Customer Lifecycle Management. It’s nothing new. It’s been around longer than the internet. And there have been many books written about it. The idea is that by using CLM you **become a customer-centric business**. In other words *the customer is king*. Your main focus becomes building  **long-term customer relationships**. I think we can all agree focusing on nurturing customer relationships is a good thing.

## Lifecycle stages

The main idea of CLM is that every (potential) customer fits into one of five stages;

* Reach
* Acquire
* Convert
* Retain
* Loyalty

A clear marketing strategy will have an answer for every stage of the customer lifecycle. Each stage has a measurable goal you’re trying to achieve. 

For example, Reach focuses on *reaching* your customer. Making them aware of your business. Every customer starts in the Reach stage. The goal is to push them through to the Acquire stage.

How are you going to achieve that? That’s completely up to you. If you want potential customers, you should focus on ad clicks/website visits. All your activities and selected tools should be about reaching that goal. Every potential customer who completed the goal progresses to the next stage. Which has it’s own goal and different tools.

**How you determine which stage a customer is in is important and specific to your business**. Make sure to write down which metrics you analyse for every stage. We’re going to go over each stage and look at the goals you can set for them. I will also mention tools you can use, so you have an idea where they fit into this framework. 

NOTE: Searching online for 'Customer Lifecycle' can be misleading. Images often show the lifecycle as a loop. This is confusing and doesn’t make a lot of sense. In my experience Loyal customer don't progress back to the Reach stage.

Try to think of the Customer Lifecycle as a timeline. Everybody starts out at Reach and your marketing strategy will push them to Loyalty. You can find visualizations of this by searching for 'Customer Funnel' or 'Customer Journey'. 

### Reach

The Reach stage is all about getting your potential customer’s attention. In case of an online product/service you’re going to be looking at website visits. With that in mind it becomes easy to visualize how to become better at reaching people. **Just increase the amount of website visits!**

There’s a whole host of ways you can grab people’s attention and direct it to your website. When selecting tools for this stage keep in mind that every tool needs to help you achieve the goal. This means you have to track how well each tool performs. Discard any that don’t create more website visits, or figure out how to make them more effective.

It can help to do research before starting. I  call this the Pre-Reach stage. You can develop a Persona or Customer Archetype based on your customer segment. If there’s interest I will post  how I create Personas. For now I encourage you to use one of the many online resources. I’ve included some links below.

Thinking of tools with a goal in mind makes it easier to select which ones work for your business. It also gives you a clear way of determining which tools you should continue using and which ones need to go. Think about which tools would reach more of your potential customers. Instagram could drive traffic for your sunglasses store but won’t work for airconditioning repair.

**Goal:** Get your potential customer to notice you and get them to your website.  
**Metric:** Website visits/Ad Clicks.   
**Tools:** SEO, Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, Instagram, Twitter, Blogs, Podcasts, Content Marketing, Youtube.

### Acquire

Now that you have the customer’s attention you need to start focussing on building trust. **On average it takes around seven interactions before a customer trusts you**. Only then do customers feel comfortable enough to buy anything from you. An interaction can be anything from receiving an e-mail to visiting your website.

The Acquire stage is all about getting your customer to make that first interaction. You can think of interactions like;

* Signing up for a newsletter
* Taking a survey
* Joining a discussion
* Requesting a demo

After their first interaction potential customers move on to the Convert stage. Establishing trust starts in the Acquire stage and concludes in the Convert stage with a sale.

Visiting your website is an interaction but doesn’t have to be an expression of interest. You should find a different interaction that you can track. As a rule, the end result should make the customer known to you. They should give you some form of personal information, an e-mail address for example.

Since the name of the game is building trust you should include trust elements on your website. These will also work well in the  Convert stage.

**Goal:** Get the customer to interact with you for the first time.   
**Metric:** Newsletter/Email signups, Twitter Retweets, Instagram Comments.
**Tools:** OptinMonster, HoldOnStranger, Intercom

### Convert
The next stage is a two-part’er. First you’re going to have to solidify trust then you have to make your sales process as easy as possible.

#### Trust
As discussed in the previous stage it takes seven interactions to establish trust. You need a plan on how every potential customer is going to have those interactions.

A beautiful example is a Nurture email campaign;

* Potential customer gives you their email address. 
* You send them an email every day.
* Talk about something interesting to them.

For example, you’re selling a book about traveling through Asia. You send them 7 emails about your favorite places to see. Which are also included in the book. Link to your website in each email and that’s seven interactions.

It is also possible to start a blog, create videos or have an active social media presence. Do everything to make yourself known as an authority in the field. When a potential customer looks at your business they should perceive you as ‘the real deal’.

**It’s all about making potential customers associate your company with the product.**

Another way of gaining trust is by having a great website. Design can have a noticeable effect on what potential customers think of your business. There’s 1.001 resources you can find about how to create websites that are awesome. 

#### Sales process

If everything goes well your potential customer is now ready to buy from you. It is vital(!) that you make the process to buy from you as easy as possible. Focus on creating the perfect buying experience. 

For an e-commerce website reduce the clicks/actions potential customers have to make. Look at information you don’t need to collect and remove it from your forms. 

Potential customers that don’t convert into paying customers will abandon your business. This means that somewhere in your process  the customers are not engaged. It is your responsibility to find these ‘trust leaks’. Fix them and come up with a ‘last resort’ to convert almost abandoned customers. 

On e-commerce websites you can do this with Cart Abandonment campaigns. When a potential customer forgets to checkout their cart. You can send them an automated email to remind them to come back later. Reminding potential customers will give you a better conversion rate.

**Goal:** Get the customer to trust you and make a sale.  
**Metric:** Revenue, Cart abandonment.  
**Tools:** Shopify, Woocommerce, Magento, InfusionSoft, Mailchimp, Klaviyo

### Retain
Congratulations! Your potential customer has converted and is now an actual customer. Your goal now is to stay at this level of trust and get the customer to come back. This stage is harder to track since we’re going to have to include a timeframe. When do you expect the customer to buy again? This depends on what kind of product/service you offer. Someone who buys a car isn’t likely to come back within a year. While someone who bought cleaning services from you is likely returning soon.

Since the customer is now familiar with your business he/she might make direct contact. This is the first time in the Customer Lifecycle where communication will go both ways. It is a good idea to have some form of Customer Service to keep that level of trust.

Next to that we can adapt our Nurture campaign from the Acquire stage, and use it to keep customers. This campaign will show customers that we *care* about them. And haven’t forgotten that they bought from us. 

In the case of the Asian travel book, you might write about your next adventure in a weekly email. Or send them beautiful new pictures of places described in the book. When your new book comes out, you are sure to keep some of those customers.

**The idea is that you keep your customers interested in interacting with you.**

When a customer doesn’t come back it means they went to the competition or they don’t need you anymore. It’s completely normal to lose a few customers this way but it is possible to minimise the effect.

**Goal:** Keep customer trust and get another sale within a given period.  
**Metric:** Amount of purchases per customer.  
**Tools:** InfusionSoft, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Zendesk

### Loyalty

The final stage of the Customer Lifecycle describes customers who keep coming back. This stage is only attained when all the other stages work well. 

These customers are passionate about your business and are willing to promote you. They’ll post on their social media and tell their friends. Make sure you interact with them! Think about organizing events. And creating merchandise so they can show appreciation for the company. Your branding can go a long way to help these customers express their loyalty.

How you measure who your most loyal customer are is up to you. Is it after five sales? or maybe after two? Or maybe you want to look at time spent on your website. Pick a metric and find those customer that are special.

With the Asian travel book you could interact when your social media accounts are tagged. Instagram and Twitter are great channels to do this on. It shows your customers that you care. And it exposes you to more potential customers.

If done well these customers will become customers for life and help you grow your business.

**Goal:** Make customers feel valued.  
**Metric:** Amount of purchases per customer, amount of time spent on site.  
**Tools:** Meetups, Events, Merchandise.

## Conclusion
With these pointers you can create your own marketing strategy. It is also a great framework by which you can determine the bottleneck in your business. Are you reaching enough potential customers? or are you just not converting them? Are you tying people to your business or losing them to your competitors?

I hope this gives you insight into how you can improve your own business. If anybody would like me to write up a post with best pracices for each stage and/or how to make personas. Please comment below, and I’ll see what I can do.

People don't click and browse through hashtags. Most hashtags you see while researching hashtags are brand hashtags for people trying to get featured on bigger pages. Random people are NOT discovering pages through them.

Bots and automated behavior are getting accounts shut down left and right.

You aren't going to get on the Explore page unless you're ""popular"" (There's a subtle way around this further on in this guide for small accounts) 

Fear not though weary Instagram user because in this guide I'll show you how to wake up in the morning to loads of fresh followers, multiple real comments, and tons of likes without even having to post frequently so here you go:

Instagram has changed greatly since that guy whose guide you read on the internet wrote it and will always change. 

There is only one practical mechanic to use for account growth without wanting to pull your hair out before your page gets big enough that people naturally mention you and you show up places so....

Research pages in your niche that have as few followers as possible but no fewer than 2,500 and no more than 50k and start manually following their followers. I've noticed for some reason adding the followers of bigger or massive pages doesn't result in as many followbacks.

If you get a followback whose page is in the same niche as you go to their followers and start following them manually on your phone. 

There's a cool little bonus when their followers check out your page they are going to see a little message appear below your @ handle that says ""Followed by (bigger account that they follow)"" it's a nice little social proof boost that results in more follow backs. 

Don't follow more than 275 to 375 accounts per day and no more than 100 in one sitting (per hour) or you risk a temporary penalty on your account where you can't follow anymore accounts for a day or two.

When you get a follower immediately or as quickly as possible go to their page and leave a quality comment. The bar is really low. Always tag them in the comment and write a couple lines about what you like about a picture on their page. Sometimes it helps to comment on their caption.

Whatever you do don't comment something about a woman's appearance unless it's ironic or written in a non-sexual way. 

I've also noticed that putting emojis in your comment actually hurts your chances of getting your comment noticed as well, I suspect because people think emojis look spammy. 

The vast majority of your engagement in the early days of your account (dozens of likes and lots of comments per photo) will come from following people and/or leaving a comment that shows that you're a real person. Some people will sprinkle likes all over your page sometimes on every photo.

*If someone likes many of the photos on your page you'll have a high chance of appearing on their explore page(s) every time you post.* 

You'll notice some followers liking every photo you post within 30 minutes to an hour and half of posting it and this is probably why.

Post 3 times a day until you get to 30-33ish posts to make your page looks full and active. Then post once a week until you hit 10k. 

No point in working hard to come up with high quality curated or original content and posting 3x a day when virtually no one is going to see it. Save yourself the trouble in the beginning then post the usual 3 times per day and profit. 

**On dealing with ghost followers:** Don't use hashtags they don't matter. That alone will eliminate 80+% of them. This goes against most advice but, most people haven't started their Instagram accounts recently I'm not knocking them. It's a different ball game nowadays.

If an account follows you out of the blue and their profile actually looks put together like they're trying to promote themselves as a public figure, model , actor, brand page etc. assume it's a ghost follower until your account is bigger.

They're going to unfollow you in t-minus 15 to 36 hours (although some have lasted a week). So don't bother interacting with them they don't look at their comments. 

Do not follow them back. Let them sit in your followers and add to your social proof. If they're in your niche follow their followers and enjoy the social proof boost I talked about above.

**On the Instagram strategy that circulates entrepreneur Reddit every so often (not calling him out just sharing my experience):** I've tried going to random commenting user's pages through top pics on hashtags and leaving high quality comments but this doesn't result in follows and most people's pages are so typical and near identical (or downright not pleasing to the eye to say the least)  that I found myself struggling to come up with anything authentic to comment about them anyway ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/a2vl2t/how_i_predictably_grow_instagram_brand_accounts/,579,"We have started to use http://skimic.com to manage some of our client's accounts.

892,f1tp7h,False,,101,How do you deal with feelings of inadequacy when working for yourself?,Entrepreneur,"One of the biggest challenges I encounter regularly is my mood. I'm pretty critical of myself and don't know how not to be. I'm sure also being diagnosed with major depression doesn't help. 

I often feel like I'm not doing enough in my day or that I'm not reaching enough of my goals. It's really bizarre and upsetting. 

When I'm employed my bosses always praise me for my work and my skill set. It feels good and it really helps hearing that. I don't know how to replicate this while being an entrepreneur. 

Is this a sign that maybe being self-employed isn't right for me? Is this a hump that all entrepreneurs eventually get over? How did you get over it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/f1tp7h/how_do_you_deal_with_feelings_of_inadequacy_when/,413,"I like to have a few other things going on that I can do. One is, I like to read, when my anxiety gets so high I can't function I can go read for a while and calm back down. After a while I don't HAVE to read so much for that anymore. 

Once, during an incredibly difficult time a friend invited me to go play tennis. Such an intense exercise where I basically burned through the horror of what had happened. This was a major turning point in working through that terrible mess. Still felt awful for several months but could tell it was getting better. 

Other times I go deeper into the inadequacy and use that pain to come up with better ways to do things. But mostly it seems that I just get bet at doing what I don't know what I am doing. 

Fake it, 'til you make it. I just pretend and start to feel like I think I am confident at something until I get it down. It feels like the chicken and the egg problem. I can't get better until I am confident I can but I won't feel confident at it until I feel better. Ha! Short circuit this over thinking by simply doing something and getting lost in the enjoyment of it. 

What I have been doing recently is embracing/accepting that my negative emotional base keeps me motivated. This one sucked a bit for me because it basically means that I won't move forward until I feel crappy first. In my case, it is pure unadulterated raw terror. Ha! That gets me to do something about it. Method actors do this a bit too with positive or negative emotions, of course. 

If you are positive motivated, then go do something you are good at first. Feel good about it. Now hold on to that feeling of confidence when you go to do what you feel inadequate about. This is the practice of learning to associate different feelings with different types of activities. 

Stay motivated to follow through by reminding yourself of why you are doing it. 

Your comfort zone grows and adapts over time. ",2020-02-10 17:35:18

The amount of trust & goodwill Trump lost in 3 years was staggering but with the US handling of Covid that loss has exponentially increased well past a point where even bringing in a rational government in November can fix it.

Some accounts feel like they are created by sweatystartup's marketing team just so u/sweatystartup can reply to their ""willing to put in the work, but don't know how to start"" post.

Seriously if you look at the history on some of those 'users' it looks like their account is brand new and their message is worded in such a perfect way for u/sweatystartup to swoop right in and market their website and podcast. I appreciate their message, but it's the same thing over and over again, and surprise, surprise, it's not the single best way to start out as an entrepreneur. But these days sweatystartup doesn't care whether a budding entrepreneur starts a successful service-based business, as long as they are listening to the sweaty startup podcast.

For everyone who is saying ""But his ideas are really helpful"" : annoying advertising is annoying advertising. If we're gonna have equal opportunity here we have to have equal treatment. Just because he advocates doing 'dirty work' doesn't excuse him from using scummy practices.

Also you guys don't think it's weird that for a brand that advocates working hard doing service work, they sure spend a lot of time and effort marketing on Reddit? Sweaty startups just saw a niche on here ripe for marketing and ran with it. You guys are all getting marketed to.

This is no different than a bunch of Gary Vee fanboys defending him. (except there's not as much money behind sweaty startups, let's just be honest)

Results in 6 months: 1000 email subscribers, 30K visits, $736 (affiliate), and most importantly… KNOWLEDGE + EXPERIENCE",Entrepreneur,"I'm tired of all the click-bait success stories in many marketing guides, stuff like this:

[\[IMGUR LINK: Unrealistic claims\]](http://imgur.com/z313Rft)

Or this...

[\[IMGUR LINK: Very unrealistic claims...\]](http://imgur.com/mJ80z3Z)

If it were as easy as those guides *claim*, we'd all be millionaires by now. 

These so-called ""success stories"" are normally created by people who are either already marketing experts, or have a pre-existing audience. That's because if you already have 100,000 monthly visitors, it's relatively easy to obtain an extra 1000 users.

That's why I want to share with you a case study on Niklas Goeke (click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngoeke) for his Linkedin). 

##Background

Niklas graduated university in 2014 and wanted to learn online marketing. He realized that the best way to learn something, is to actually do it.

It took him **6 months** to acquire his first 1000 users. But by applying his lessons learned, it only took Niklas 3 months to get the next 1000.

###Here's the proof
[\[IMGUR LINK: email subscribers\]](http://imgur.com/pb3MXdn)

[\[IMGUR LINK: traffic\]](http://imgur.com/hslBT6Q)

[\[IMGUR LINK: revenue\]](http://imgur.com/29dShNH)

He did this by creating an affiliate marketing website (selling books) and drove traffic to it by creating an efficient content creation framework. 

By doing so, he was able to create **content every single day** (~4 hours/day). Since he created so much content, he was able to rank for specific keywords and would also promote the content like crazy.

###Want to do the same thing? 

I'll be honest with you, even if you work hard and apply the lessons learned in this guide, success isn't guaranteed. That's why if you're a beginner, I recommend you approach this with a goal to **learn** and **to gain experience**.

For the full in-depth (7000+ words) guide with tons of supporting GIFs/images, check it out by [**clicking here**](https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation?src=reddit-https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation).

Otherwise, you can continue reading here for a summary:

##Step 1: Figure out your ""why"" --> crunch the numbers to meet the goal --> validate

Niklas' goal was **""$1000/month in passive income""** and to meet it, he decided to pursue affiliate marketing.

**He would sell books and make a commission for each one he sold.**

Validating which books to promote/sell is tricky. To choose the best books to sell, he used two methods:

**Method 1)** Using a tool called NerdyData, he could see a list of other affiliate marketers promoting his product. He would then look for the affiliate marketers who *pay* to promote (e.g. banner ads) the affiliate product. By searching for the banner's web archives, he could see how long the banner ads were up. If the banner ads are up for a few months, it must be selling enough to justify the banner ad costs.

For example, Mike Vardy had this banner ad for the same affiliate product up for several months:

[\[IMGUR LINK - competitor banner ad validation\]](http://imgur.com/dyeX4N7)

**Method 2)** Told his friends about the product, and for the friends who were interested, he'd send them the affiliate link. He made 3 sales by doing this, which was enough to validate.

Once it was validated, he now spent the time to build a website and drive traffic to it.

##Step 2: Build a content log and streamline SEO, email collection and your promotion process.

To sell his affiliate book products, Niklas created a site that would provide short book summaries and reviews. There were four parts to it:

###Part 1: Content Creation
Niklas wanted to publish content everyday to promote his affiliate books. To do so, he'd limit each article to <1000 words by following a framework:

[\[IMGUR LINK - content framework\]](http://imgur.com/zXiPBdu)

###Part 2: SEO

Since he was creating a piece of content each day (30/month), he started to rank for certain keywords by using Google's Keyword Planner. He would then add targeted keywords into his content headlines.

[\[IMGUR LINK - keyword research\]](http://imgur.com/shOzOiv)

He would then make sure the keyword were in the meta descriptions, url slug, and inside the body of the content.

[\[IMGUR LINK - keyword input strategy\]](http://imgur.com/yRtPzWa)

###Part 3: Email Collection
Niklas was now creating a bunch of content, and several of the content pieces started to rank in the first page of google on popular keywords. He was starting to see quite a bit of traffic going to the website.

He would make the most of the website visitors by collecting emails using SumoMe.

[\[IMGUR LINK - email collection\]](http://imgur.com/9Y4YBv8)

###Part 4: Promotion

Every day, Niklas would spend ~1.5 hours writing the content piece, and another 90 minutes promoting it.

He would distribute his content on:

* Stumbleupon
* HackerNews
* SlackGroups
* Email Outreach
* Twitter
* Answering Quora Questions 

##Step 3: Publish every day until you hit your goal.

Create content every single day. By doing so, eventually you'll have several articles that start to rank high in google. Create a content creation structure so you publish at the same time everyday.

[\[IMGUR LINK - content calendar\]](http://imgur.com/qY5DI5q)

And that's how Niklas eventually achieved his first 1000 email subscribers and $736.

If this summary didn't cut it: [**Here's a 7000+ word guide of Niklas' exact blueprint to grow an online business from scratch.**](https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation?src=reddit-https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation)

In it, it'll go into greater in each step along the way with tons of pictures, and tutorial GIFs so you'll know exactly how he did it. He also includes all the spreadsheets and tools so you can do the same thing.

###Any questions, comments, or feedback?

Niklas will be around here to answer :)

593,4zd8sh,False,,813,How to run facebook ads for any business: Comment your business and I'll tell you how,Entrepreneur,"Alright so I am a co-owner of a digital marketing company that specializes in facebook ads. Every single person or business I have worked with has explained to me that they have tried facebook ads and ""it just doesn't work"" for their type of business. They claim that facebook ads are real easy and they knew what they were doing, but it's just not right for their type of business. It takes everything I have in me to not laugh at them.

Without fail, all of these people that explained to me that facebook ads don't work for their ""type of business"", I am able to get them a positive ROI on the ads. Turns our they didn't know what they were doing, which I can understand. I'm a loser and sit at the computer pretty much all day every day creating facebook ads and I'm a member of a handful of private groups that contain some of the world's top spenders on facebook and get advice from them all the time, so I understand that a profitable facebook campaign doesn't come as easily to others as it does for me, but that's why I'm here to help!

**So what I would like to do is have anyone interested in trying facebook ads (or has tried in the past) to comment their type of business or what they are trying to sell, and I will explain how I would approach things.**


**Things to consider:**

* 1.) Type of ad: conversions, post engagement, video views, website clicks, leads...
The objective of your ad can make an insane impact on how well your ads perform. You can optimize for many different objectives and the different objectives will get you different results. Example: If you want your business to bring in new leads, then you don't want to be optimizing for post engagements. 

* 2.) Targeting: broad audiences, behaviors, job titles, education level, income and/or salary, interests, highly target multi-layer audiences, demographics, etc.
Specialty products or services require a much more dialed in audience. For things that aren't specialty, you are better off using a large audience and letting facebook optimize to show your ads to the people most similar to people who have already purchased.

* 3.) Placement: Destop or mobile? News feed or right column? Instagram?
People have different intentions when they are sitting at a computer and when they are on their phone. People are on their phones when they are sitting in cabs or at a restaurant or the gym. Is that the best place to get them to watch a 10 minute video? Probably not. 

**Here are some examples of types of businesses I have worked with:**

**Photography company -** They though facebook ads couldn't work for their business and I set them up with a campaign that was bringing them in wedding photo leads for $9 a peice (average wedding job for them was $3000)


**Realtors -** Buyer leads for $4, Highly motivated seller leads for $15, and less motivated seller leads for $2. Video walkthrough ads are killer and using facebook live to do virtual open houses is the future of real estate


**Musician -** Helped an artist get 100,000 views on her first single in a few days for $30. It also got her page a ton of likes.


**Bars -** Ran carousel ads promoting their craft beer selection and the prices during happy hour to get the bar consistently packed during that time of the day. Facebook ads also work fantastically with bars for events. You can also run ads to people's phones who are at other bars telling them to come to your bar. 


**E-commerce companies -** Helped many ecommerce companies (as well as run one myself) to run highly profitable ads while tracking everything to ensure all ads have a positive ROI when scaling the ones with the best ROI. Examples: jewelry, apparel brands, a store that sold ice molds for whiskey drinkers, pet products and more


**Online Personal Trainer/fitness coach -** Built an email list of 800 leads of people looking for a fitness coach for .60 a piece in just 1 week. 


**Other businesses we've had great success with:**

* Printing company
* Wine and painting company
* Watch company
* Beauty product company
* Bridal shop
* Specialty olive oil store
* Golf course
* Software company
* Antique store
* Gym
* Boat dealership
* Digital cookbooks

250,6fp751,False,,217,1 year ago we had the dream of creating the IMDb equivalent for podcasts. Now that dream is nearly a reality and we hope to raise money to quit our jobs. We need your help to do it right.,Entrepreneur,"Cole here with Podchaser! I'm responsible for sales and growth of our new website launching this weekend, and we need your help.

**What we are:**
Nine months ago, we posted on reddit asking if an IMDb equivalent for podcasts existed -- see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/64tjic/introducing_podchaser_the_imdb_of_podcasts_were_a/). A flurry of responses and grievances came about, and it was clear that such a concept was desired. So, a team of five of us from the US and Australia have all banded together to create [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com). Podcast discovery is an ongoing problem for podcast listeners. Some recommendation algorithms exist, but they’re generally based off podcast show preferences, rather than episode preference. Generally, the same 10 or so podcasts are recommended and remain on top charts. So, we are building a system around individual episode ratings and reviews. Our front page will feature the hottest episodes rather than podcasts, allowing users to discover a broader array of content. Users can also check out reviews on individual episodes before diving in. Some podcasts have shows with varying degrees of quality, and now you can just check out feedback in one place rather than googling around fan forums and subreddits.

Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/bqibL1M.png).

**Where we are:**
Our development team is employed full time and cannot dedicate the time necessary to make Podchaser grow as fast as we want with our other obligations. We've worked long nights and weekends across time zones to build this dream, and now our developers are ready to work full time to take the next step! When we send our [pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lhaY43yAmXYjJaQ2ZyS1BQOW8/view?usp=sharing) to investors, we will ask for convertible notes for this seed round of investment to last ~12-16 months. 

The closed beta launches June 10th, and you can register today at [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com)! Registration ends on June 10th until the site goes live to the public.

**How you can help:**
We’d love some feedback from this subreddit on our [pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lhaY43yAmXYjJaQ2ZyS1BQOW8/view?usp=sharing) before we approach investors. Also, we'd like to opinions on your suggested strategies to find the right investors and get funded.

If you happen to host your own podcast, we'd love to get you involved! Podcast hosts can get a [mega key](http://imgur.com/a/OE3wI) for their listeners to access the closed beta after June 10th. When your listeners rate and review your episodes in the beta, you'll be much more likely to appear in our trending section and find some new listeners. Shoot us a PM for details.

We also will need your precious data (ratings and reviews). Please head over to [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com) to sign up. Invites will be going out June 10th to all subscribers.

We will hang out here for a few hours.

TL;DR
We're making a cool podcast website and want to raise money. We've never done it on this scale and need your advice!

The end result is an extreme feeling of loneliness. I GENUINELY think I’ve found why this is.",Entrepreneur,"**About this post:** I’m just an average entrepreneur who finds certain marketing, advertising and business stuff fascinating. This post (along with all others) is nothing more than a fun little project for myself where I write about stuff I find cool. 

Today’s post is one I wrote following listening to a very cool Alan Watts lecture. I’ve found him, along with a few others have helped balance me with the constant striving for more of entrepreneurship.

There is NOTHING wrong when you strive for more for your own personal benefit. But I’ve come to realise that’s not always the primary reason we strive for more…

This post was originally written on my blog where it's accompanied by pics I can't include here due to reddit's limitation. To read the article in its original glory click [here]( http://ganonmakesmoney.com/why-most-entrepreneurs-dont-enjoy-entrepreneurship-ugly-truths/) (I personally recommend it).
Anyway without further ado here’s the post…

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

##**Why Most Entrepreneurs Don't Enjoy Being an Entrepreneur**

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship has become a burden as of late. I constantly worry about money and the future. My brain never shuts off and enjoys what I have. I can’t switch off. Not even in the company of friends, family or my own wife.

&nbsp;

It’s become a constant battle for some goal in the future. And when it’s hit, it’s time to upgrade it to another goal. This sort of thinking and striving whilst popular in the entrepreneur-sphere is the very thing I quit my job for four years ago to avoid.

&nbsp;

I have  a feeling many of you know what I’m talking about. And luckily for you, your boy Ganon has found the root of the problem. Buckle up and let me explain…

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship was supposed to be our rebellion. To earn our freedom and live life on our own terms.

&nbsp;

However instead what many of us dream about is to be millionaires…

&nbsp;

Think about that for a second. Why do you want to be a millionaire? What not a $857,303-eraire? Or a $1,493,344.84-eraire?

&nbsp;

Again think about that. Think deeply.

&nbsp;

Wanting to be a millionaire is the self-employed equivalent of the office worker who dreams to gain the beloved title vice-president of another man’s company and vision. That moron wants the fancy title even more than he wants the money. So he can hold his head up high as his mother gloats to the community, friends and neighbours how important he is.

&nbsp;

Striving to be a millionaire is the same. It’s meaningless status. And fellas my gut and heart tell me it’s something to be avoided.

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship has become a burden as of late. I constantly worry about money and the future. My brain never shuts off and enjoys what I have. I can’t switch off. Not even in the company of friends, family or my own wife.

&nbsp;

And why is that?

&nbsp;

I’m always trying to earn more. Do more. Be better.

&nbsp;

Not for myself, but to get the approval of my wife, my mum and my dad. So that my aunts, uncles and cousins secretly admire and envy me. So I can attend school reunions have everyone think I’m some bigshot.

&nbsp;

This my friend is the source of unhappiness. The poison which sucks the natural joy of being alive.

&nbsp;

I’d want to clear up that this is in NO WAY a post against the acquisition of money. Not at all.

&nbsp;

I’m a FIRM believer that money is a beautiful thing, and you should go after everything you need to live the most luxurious, action-packed adventure of a life ever lived.

&nbsp;

But for god sake don’t pursue money to appease others.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

706,befto5,False,,85,"A real small business story. 170k gross, profit 42k. 1 owner, 1 employee. Brick and mortar store. My profit loss statement and story.",Entrepreneur,"Hey guys, I created a new account for this but I wondered if you would at all be interested in hearing a real Entrepreneur story. Not these grossing 500 million whatever stories. I promise you I'm selling you nothing, there are no links in my post I'm just here to share a story and answer any questions you might have. 

Like most of my generation I was told you had to go to college, leave home, and then you'd have the good life. After doing that sometime in my mid 20s when with in a week of each other both of my parents got very ill I decided I needed to get back home. I'm an only child, they needed help. My Mom had cancer and with in a week finding out my Dad had a massive heart attack. Then the next year my Mom got a rare blockage in the artery of her stomach, and my Dad then got cancer. They are both doing well now, but the massive hospital bills have left them in pretty rough shape financially. 

So I came home and of course jobs are few and far between in rural America. However I was making a go of it working two jobs. At my main job the owner of the small business was aging and had no children that were interested in the business. I had a conversation with her about the future and she was willing to sell the business when she retired. That would be about 8 years later. I saved as much money as I could and when it was all said and done I bought the business for 60k. I had to get a loan to help with this. The business at the time had the owner, myself, and another employee. 

Things were going great and I took that business from grossing 88k the last year of the old owners ownership to a high of 179k two years ago. My take home has been pretty consistently around 40k give or take a thousand or two. 

Initial Growth: came from advertising, of which the owner did non before, only word of mouth. In my small town the local radio station had great reach so I hit that hard and I would occasionally (once a month) do an ad in the local newspaper. Without getting into specifics my customer demographic is older, usually above 55 so this hit those targets. 

Bumps in the road: For the first few years it was all coming up roses. It seemed like we could do no wrong. Then one day while working in our shop part of the roof collapsed during a rain storm. The owner of the building also owned the building and business next door so I went to talk to him. Basically he said he's not fixing it and I better look for another place to have my business. By luck (or curse) a pretty good place came available. It had room to grow, was nicer, and was in an ok location. I was able to secure some low interest loans through our local economic development agency. If you are looking for help definitely see if your community has something like that. 

The move was tricky, there was nearly 3 weeks that we were basically shut down doing production work, but we still were doing sales. However we only took about a 7% dip in business that year so it could have been worse. Year two at the new location was my best ever. 

Then there was a major bump in the road. My key employee who basically handled all of my shop production got into some major legal trouble and was gone. 

Stumbling all the way: The next year was a revolving door of employees. It's hard to get people to take pride in their work like you do. I dealt with the typical no shows, showing up late, and I heard every excuse in the book. To out right stealing and screwing my business over. Honestly after about a year of that I just wanted out but I didn't have a business, I owned a job. Finally I was able to find some stability in an employee who works hard and shows up, but is damn frustrating to work with. Still the last year or so has been ok and in fact I felt confident enough to open another sales location. Now it's commission based and the sales people own a small business of their own. We just set up a display there and they sell our product as well as their own related but not the same product. That location last year grossed about 15k of which about 6k of it was profit for me. Nothing to write home about but it's money in the bank. 

Then Goliath came: Just this winter some serious competition came to town. This town can definitely not support two of what I do, but they came anyway. This is their 5th location and it's pretty clear they think they can run me out of business, which may be the case. 

My problem is this is still a job and I feel like I can't afford to make it a business. Realistically I need to make two hires. A sales person, and my shop foreman. Then I could ""run the business' and float between the sales and the shop to make sure everything is working. So great, why don't I just do that. Well here is my profit loss statement for 2018.

New Sales: 163,000
odd jobs: 2075
repairs: 1090
Total Income: 166165
Cost of goods sold: 63391
Gross Profit: 102773

labor 20634
shop supplies 9851
office supplies 323
repair parts 764
fabrication 1426
laser 150

insurance 4799
shipping 1089
utilities 5601
misc 838
ads 5384
com mortgage interest 6345

Total Expenses: 61494
Net Income: 41279

My take home is quite a bit less than that net income as the actual mortgage payments for my building come out of that. 

So anyway, I hope some of you glean something out of that. Running a small business is hard and it's extremely stressful. I took about 10 days off all last year just trying to keep things going. It's a strain on my family and myself mentally and physically. I'm not sure in my case if it's worth it but where I live it's the best shot of not working some terrible service industry job with weird hours and shifts that I'd never see my family.  So here I am feeling perpetually stuck between this is going to work and I'll make it and I'm stuck here and this isn't worth it but I don't have an option.

101,gf52xm,False,Case Study,123,21 tips for great copywriting,Entrepreneur,"**1) Write with your eraser**

You get 100 bucks for every word you rub out from your title:

*Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done => Work collaboratively. Get more done*

**2) No one cares what you can do**

Everyone cares what you can do *for them*

*The worlds first portable digital media player => 1,000 songs in your pocket*

**3) Avoid the passive voice**

It's indirect and awkward:

B*igger fish will be fried by me => I've got bigger fish to fry*

**4) Speak with conviction**

* Don't say “We help” say “It's how”
* Don't say “alternative” say “replaces”

***We help*** *you make a podcast =>* ***It's how*** *you make a podcastAn email* ***alternative*** *inside your company => Slack* ***replaces*** *email inside your company*

**5) Avoid “landing page words”**

*Unlock*, *unleash*, *enhance*, *exceed*, *empower*, *supercharge*, etc.

Real people don't use them.

**6) Find the tension**

“Pleasant” gets forgotten. Conflict creates interest:

*Insurance for the digital revolution => Forget everything you know about insurance*

**7) Write how you talk**

Casual. Colloquial. Full of pronouns:

*Before Basecamp:* ***You’re*** *wondering how* ***you’ll*** *quickly transition* ***your*** *team to remote work.* ***People*** *are stressed, work feels* ***scattered***, projects are ***slipping***, and it’s tough to see + manage everything.

**8) Don't exaggerate**

An honest line always feels warmer:

*The new Volkswagen. More space. More comfort. => If you run out of gas, it's easy to push.*

**9) Avoid “contained” titles**

Write something that pulls your reader down your page:

*Social media intelligence for your startup => Do you know the value of your Facebook content?*

**10) Think “Call-to-value” not “Call-to-action”**

Buttons which amplify **“value”** over **“action”** usually perform better.

* *Sign up now => Create your website*
* *Get started => Hire top designers*

**11) Don't kill your personality**

The best brands feel “real”:

*As efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, we hope you’re supported in taking every measure to protect your health. => Melanie here, CEO of Andie. I'm writing to you from my living room as my dog Sara proofreads — we're both working from home today.*

**12) More periods, fewer commas.**

Periods mean short sentences. We like short sentences.

Commas mean long, painful sentences, like this one, which *New Yorker* writers think are clever, but real people find torturous, because they wind on and on without actually saying anything.

**13) Use value based messaging**

People don’t want a **better toothbrush**. They want a **brighter smile**:

*Introducing the new and improved Colgate => Smile like you've never smiled before*

**14) Kill adverbs.**

They're flowery. They're vague. They try too hard:

*Effortlessly create email lists from LinkedIn => Create email lists from LinkedIn*

**15) Think slippery slide**

Every line of copy should lead to the next. All the way down to your CTA. Watch [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXL2YukS6Sc&feature=emb_title). You won't be able to stop.

**16) Get specific**

You can’t bullshit specifics:

*Save more on your AWS bill => Save an average of 33.7% on your AWS bill*

**17) Fence sitters don't buy**

Go to the edge:

*Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. In event of success honour and recognition — Ernest Shackleton*

**18) Your first line is crucial**

The first line of your copy is crucial. If people don’t read it, they’re not going to read your second line either. Make it short.

*We focus on nearly every muscle in our body, yet neglect the one area we value most, our face. => Your face has 43 muscles.*

**19) Call out the customer you serve**

People pay attention when they know something is specifically **for them.**

*A creative hub for anyone and everyone => A creative hub for 150,000 authors*

**20) You're on a speed date**

The majority of people look at your site for 30 seconds and never return. If you can't make your **product** interesting in six words sell the **benefits** instead:

*All-in-one social automation => Turn followers into customers*

**21) Copywriting is selling**

Don’t romanticize it. The goal isn't to be clever or cute. The goal is to inspire action:

*Request a demo => See Drift on your site*

Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed it. Before anyone jumps in these are heuristics, not universals. *Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.*

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Set up a website on WordPress. Pay someone on a freelancing site to create a simple logo for you and some marketing material. Here is my [full guide](http://sweatystartup.com/essential-tools/) to setting up your business.

Make sure your flyer has great copy. This is an example of what you want to say:

>Predict your home utility bills with affordable thermal imaging  
>  
>Where is your home leaking heat?  
>  
>Understand your home utility bills BEFORE you buy  
>  
>Protect your investment with a thermal imaging analysis  
>  
>Affordable energy auditing

Buy $100 worth of door hanging flyers created on UPrinting or your local print shop. Make sure your phone number and web address is on the bottom of the flyer.

That weekend go on Zillow or Realtor.com and get in your car. Drive around and hang a flyer on the door of every home for sale within 10 miles of where you live.

Why would someone who is about to move utilize a service to analyze their utilities? They won't for this house. But they are moving somewhere. They'll want to spend a few dollars to learn about their next house. Thats the play.

Read and learn about thermal imaging by watching videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYERTgD3ldA). Take one of the many online classes. Consider getting certified. Watch an [updated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYERTgD3ldA) on equipment so you can decide what camera to buy. Study the industry and learn as much as possible. Buy a camera for under $350. You can upgrade later.

Create a report template that you will use to report back to customers. Use the [many many examples](https://www.carsondunlop.com/assets/inspection/Carson-Dunlop-Thermal-Imaging-Sample-Report.pdf) out on the internet and take what you love from each of them.

Your phone will start to ring. Get out and service some customers at heavy discounts. Learn a lot. Provide professional reports for them to use.

As you gain momentum start to grow your marketing channels. Partner with realtors to send you referrals and pay them a cut if necessary. Watch the MLS. Show up at open houses and hand out business cards. [Get creative with your marketing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pressurewasherporn/comments/97hig7/saw_this_otw_home_from_work_today/?st=JRCWGDFL&sh=dfddde91) Find local real estate investors and offer your services to them for free at first to gain trust. Word will get out about your work and business will start flowing.

Invest in a nicer camera. Get licensed. Learn to understand the house or structure as a system. 

You’ll start to bring in $150+ per service and it will take you about an hour. Begin to partner with contractors who want the leads you have for new windows, roofs, insulation, doors, etc. Tons of opportunity here.

As soon as your weekends and evenings are full and you are bringing in enough money to replace your 9-5 quit your job and get serious.

Invest in some equipment like a drone and get certified to fly it. Start doing [big commercial thermal imaging](http://blog.uasthermals.com/how-to-build-a-profitable-uas-infrared-thermal-imaging-business) projects. Maybe expand to be a full on building inspector.

55,gzr9p4,False,,131,Quit my corporate slave job to save the family business. Ended up increasing family business monthly revenue by 110% — in 60 days.,Entrepreneur,"I’m starting to see more and more purpose in sharing my story.


Long time lurker, first time posting. Never liked long paragraphs filled with tons of fluff - so I’m gonna keep it short and meaningful. 

**Background**:
 
Parents own your typical brick-and-mortar, service-based storefront. Was financially struggling for quite some time and was on the verge of collapsing altogether, due to not evolving along with the world and adopting digital ways of business.

Me, a former finance professional at a Corporate-America company, quit my passionless job — to save the family business. 

Knew the ways to revive the business was through:

- **Digital transformation** 
- **Deploying digital marketing and leverages**   

I picked up and learned everything I could about digital marketing and digital leverages in hopes of saving the business with them. 


The milestones along the journey: 


**Market research**:

Learned from competitors' strength and capitalized on their weaknesses.

**Marketing strategizing and planning**: 

1. Identified competitive edge — what's the our biggest selling point, something that we do better than everybody around
 
2. Embraced and completely owned this edge 

3. Sharpened and repackaged it

4. Delivered it with the right channels and copy to the right audience.



**Recreated website using UX/UI principles**:

Knew website was where all my digital efforts --- pivot off of. Spent endless hours polishing and fine-tuning this step with the developers I hired. 

User-friendly and aesthetically captivating. Purchases and bookings are made effortlessly --- unlike my competitors’ sites that had users running around in a maze, only to give up on searching for their desired product/service/information.  

**Incorporated automation**: 

Incorporated online point of sales, self-scheduling, self-checkout system, and unique egift-card system.

**Deployed digital marketing**: 

- Google Ads 
- Instagram
- Facebook 
- Waze

**After 60 days**:

- +110% monthly revenue

- Consistently booked out 2 months out

- Achieved the following metrics: 

1. 550% ROI
2. 800% ROAS
 


**Me aftermath**:

Discovered I loved doing marketing so much more than finance, so:

I'm in the process of leveraging myself into a marketing managerial position with the experience I gathered and the results produced from this endeavor.

Wish me luck, friends!

**Moral of the story**

Business completely revived from the brink of dying; from consistently letting staff go to hiring new ones to meet the explosion of demands and traffic.

Unexpectedly, I went from working an passionless job in corporate to producing monumental digital marketing results that set me up for an exciting career in marketing

It’s mind-blowing how fast and sharp your fate can change, when you take a leap and dig deep when the going gets tough. 

**The Message**:

I know times aren’t looking good and most of you are discouraged to take the leap —

the road ahead looks dark and you can’t help but feel drained and exhausted, I know the feeling, I’ve been there —

but there’s always a way out of the dark tunnel as long as you keep digging and strive for that one glimpse of light.

Good luck friends

678,fw15o2,False,,119,How I Made $8794.50 By Sending Out 1300 Postcards - Marketing Experiment,Entrepreneur,"In this experiment I'm sending out 1000 post cards to homes recently listed for sale in my area in attempt to gain more sales for my moving company. I will cover design, my tactics, the total expense, the results. 

&#x200B;

## Flyer Design

 I have done a slight redesign to my flyer. I did away with discounts and replaced the spot that used to be a coupons with a smiling face. In services I find smiling faces and a friendly look matter a whole lot more than technical details. You can't touch or hold a service like you can a product but you can ""feel"" its impression. 

&#x200B;

## Why I Like Postcard Flyers

1. They are cheaper to send than regular mail. Post card stamps are currently $0.35. This really adds up as you send hundreds of flyers out. 
2. It's an easy activity for admin staff to do during downtime.

&#x200B;

## Total Cost

After sending out the initial 1000 post cards I noticed that there were still a few hundred houses left in the area so I decided to hit them all, resulting in 1300 total flyers sent. This is the total expense. 

 Postage $455 (1300 at $0.35 a piece) 

 Labor $120  

 Flyers $39 ($0.03 a piece) 

 Total $614 

&#x200B;

## Results

We sent the flyers and waited about 6 weeks to tabulate the results. A certain number of flyers are always returned to sender. In this case 300 of the 1300 flyers were returned due to vacancies or address issues.  

 Of the 1000 that were actually sent we ended up booking 6 jobs. That doesn't sound like a whole lot but the caveat here is we only sent flyers to homes for sale for over $400,000 so each job is of significant size. 

This is proven with the first job we landed for a whopping $4600. This single job paid for every single flyer PLUS some. 

The total revenue from sending 1300 flyers was $8794.50! 

At a 20% year end profit margin that comes out to $1758.90 in net profit on $614 in expense. A 286% return on investment! 

&#x200B;

## What I Attribute the Results To

1. The flyer design. On the first in-home estimate we did the customer said ""we just loved your flyer"" and when I heard that I knew this would work well
2. We have great reviews online. I don't believe our results would be nearly as impressive if we didn't already have a great online presence.
3. My office staff is trained and relentless. I have 3 salespeople who book jobs for me and they are very good at closing sales and following up with customers. They don't leave anything on the table. 

&#x200B;

The best marketing plan is only as good as the company behind it. The best form of advertisement for your service is simply being a wonderfully ran service.

94,7zvsnv,False,,119,Harvard Research Gives Clues On How to Be Successful And Have Fun Doing It,Entrepreneur,"Chances are you want to be more successful.    
Chances are you realise success takes a lot of work.    
Chances are you wish there was a scientifically proven method that made success a little bit more... fun. 

Well, Shawn Achor, bestselling author of The Happiness Advantage, studied for years at Harvard to try and find just that, and his solution was incredibly interesting.

What's even more interesting than his findings is that his cutting-edge research is incredibly similar to many ideas in the Philosophy of Stoicism.


#Prefer to watch? [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPCFviNl_Rc)

Shawn Achor gave a TED talk that accumulated over 20 million views.    
He was even interviewed by Oprah.    

What makes Shawn so interesting is that during his research he would ignore the trend and only study the outliers. 

>""Instead of deleting those people that are weirdos in the data what we do is we intentionally study them. We try and find out why it is that while an entire sales force has low numbers, we’re finding three or four people whose sales are skyrocketing. Or we’re looking at a low socioeconomic school in Chicago, where the academic scores are below average, there are a couple students whose grades are skyrocketing. By studying those outliers, what we’re doing is we’re gleaning information not on how to move subpar performers up toward that average point, but how to move people from average to superior."" - Shawn Achor

After years of Harvard research, Shawn came to the conclusion that **success doesn't bring happiness - happiness brings success.**

Shawn's research proved that there are four things that will make you happier whilst being more successful as a by product.

#Realise that Success Doesn't Bring Happiness.

My parents tell me the story about how I sat in front of the TV mesmerised by the advert for the new Xbox games console. It was better, faster and newer than the old one - it even had a wireless controller! I begged and begged my parents to buy me it and when they refused I made it my goal to buy it with my own money.

I spent the next few months doing extra chores and saving my pocket money so I could buy it. It was all I could think about. All I needed was the new Xbox and then I would be happy.

Two months later I had enough money. 

I rushed to the nearest GAME store.

I proudly handed over my money and bought the brand new games console.

As I ran home I treasured what I thought was the cure to all of my problems.

When I unboxed it and started playing I realised I was right! All my problems were gone and I was completely happy...

For a week or so. After that I started dreaming about the next biggest thing.

You may laugh at my naivety but we've all fallen prey to similar thoughts:

* I'll be happy when I earn X amount
* I'll be happy when I lose 10 pounds
* I'll be happy when I buy a new car

You see, due to something called the Hedonic Treadmill we return to our default level of happiness soon after something external increases or decreases out level of happiness.

This is not even a new theory - 2,000 years ago philosophers came to the same conclusion:

>“True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.” — Seneca

Shawn's research supported this further:

>""If we can get somebody to raise their levels of optimism or deepen their social connection or raise happiness, turns out every single business and educational outcome we know how to test for improves dramatically. You can increase your success rates for the rest of your life and your happiness levels will flatline, but if you raise your level of happiness and deepen optimism it turns out every single one of your success rates rises dramatically compared to what it would have been at negative, neutral, or stressed."" - Shawn Achor

Some companies, such as MET Life believed in this so strongly they started hiring salespeople based on optimism. 

The results were incredible: 

>""It turns out that the optimistic group outsold their more pessimistic counterparts by 19% in year one and 57% in year two.""

When I read this I thought: ""wait a minute.. so you're telling me that being happy is the only decider on the performance of sales people? Surely not"".

I was right: happiness is not the **only** decider on performance - but it is a damn big decider.

>""If we know the intelligence and technical skills of an employee, we can actually only predict about 25% of their job success. 75% of long term job success is predicted not by intelligence and technical skills, which is normally how we hire, educate and train, but it’s predicted by three other umbrella categories. It’s optimism (which is the belief that your behavior matters in the midst of challenge), your social connection (whether or not you have depth and breadth in your social relationships), and the way that you perceive stress."" - Shawn Achor

The moral of the story is we should worry just a little bit less about grades and a little bit more about optimism.

Breaking this down further, what was the most powerful thing Shawn learned from looking at these happy, superhero-like outliers?

#No Problem is a Threat, Just a Challenge 

As I'm sure you are all aware, there was a huge financial crash in 2008. Soon after, Shawn did a study of many bankers. As you can imagine, many of them were incredibly stressed. But a few were as happy as ever.

Following Shawn's normal strategy he ignored the trend and focused on the outliers.

What did they have in common? What separated these men from the crowd? What secret did these men hold that the others clearly didn't?

**They never saw problems as threats; they saw them as challenges to overcome.**

>What these positive outliers do is that when there are changes that occur in the economic landscape or the political landscape or at an educational institution, they see those changes not as threats, but as challenges. - Shawn Achor

Damn. Those luckily people. I wish I could be wired like that.

It's your lucky day - you can.

Shawn discovered through further experiments that this attitude can be learned.

Shawn showed the normal bankers a video explaining exactly how to see stress as a challenge.

>And we watched those groups of people over the next three to six weeks, and what we found was if we could move people to view stress as enhancing, a challenge instead of as a threat, we saw a 23% drop in their stress-related symptoms. It produced a significant increase not only in levels of happiness, but a dramatic improvement in their levels of engagement at work as well. - Shawn Achor

And once again, ancient philosophers agreed. Epictetus was a huge influencer in the [Philosophy of Stoicism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhQDnpf-ad0&t=3s).

>Difficulties are the things that show what men are. Henceforth, when some difficulty befalls you, remember that god, like a wrestling-master, has matched you with a rough young man. - Epictetus

Some of you might be hoping I give you a more definitive answer on how you can get happier, taking success gladly as a side effect.

Well the answer is simpler than you think.

#3. Send a Thank-You Email

Contrary to public opinion, research shows that the little things in life are more important to our happiness than the big wins.

Shawn's research proved that it is smarter to build small, repetitive habits instead of doing things like going on vacation. 

But what small, repetitive habits will increase your happiness?

>""The simplest thing you can do is a two-minute email praising or thanking one person that you know. We’ve done this at Facebook, at US Foods, we’ve done this at Microsoft. We had them write a two-minute email praising or thanking one person they know, and a different person each day for 21 days in a row. That’s it. What we find is this dramatically increases their social connection which is the greatest predictor of happiness we have in organizations. It also improves teamwork. We’ve measured the collective IQ of teams and the collective years of experience of teams but both of those metrics are trumped by social cohesion."" - Shawn Achor

On top of this there are a few other daily habits I recommend you to start doing to increase your default level of happiness:

* Meditate
* Exercise Voluntary Discomfort
* Other-Size

The numbers say that around 70% of you will read this article, consume the information, feel like you're becoming better, then not do anything with it.

Stoicism has something to say to you: 

>“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One.” – Marcus Aurelius

Shawn has made this easier for you.

#4. Make Habits Easier With the 20-Second Rule

Shawn says that the thing stopping you from making the changes that you know you should is ""activation energy"". 

When doing something that doesn't give you an instant sense of gratification the hardest part is always the most difficult. 

When going to the gym the hardest part is getting out of bed and into your clothes.

The 20 second rule states that if you make it 20 seconds easier to start a task you significantly reduce the amount of activation energy required to follow out the task.

Tough things become easy.

Shawn would sleep in his gym clothes and put his shoes right next to his bed. At that point it is easier to follow out the habit as it takes a mental decision to get undressed and not go.

>""If you can make the positive habit three to 20 seconds easier to start, your likelihood of doing it rises dramatically. And you can do the same thing by flipping it for negative habits. Watching too much television? Merely take out the batteries of the remote control creating a 20 second delay and it dramatically decreases the amount of television people will watch."" - Shawn Achor

Shawn and his research definitely has some incredible research. What is more incredible is that philosophy came up with very similar ideas 2,000 years ago. I made a whole YouTube channel about the practical, tangible, scientifically proven, benefits of philosophy.

So many people think that out happiness is set in stone and can only be decided by external events and genetics. If there was one misconception I could change in people it would be this.

>Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."" - Epictetus

Also, remember

* Success doesn't bring happiness. Happiness brings success.
* All problems are challenges, not threats.
* Send a ""thank you"" email.
* Use the 20-second rule to build habits.

>""When you look at outliers on the graph, you find people who actually break the tyranny of genes and environment by creating these conscious positive habits that actually cause them to interact with life in a more positive way with higher levels of success, lower levels of stress, and higher levels of resilience. They do it by changing their mindset and changing their habits, and by doing so they actually trump their genes.

>Most people accept that they’re just born some way and that’s how they’re going to be the rest of their life, and whatever they were last year is what they’re going to be this year. I think positive psychology shows us that that doesn’t actually have to be the case."" - Shawn Achor

#Action Step

Go write an email/text/comment to someone thanking them for something. I promise your mood will increase after. Turn this into a habit to gradually increase your default level of happiness.

427,2z8riy,False,,228,Let's Talk Consulting: How I Built A $250K Consulting Business In Two Years,Entrepreneur,"G’Day folks - I’ve taken a lot from this community. 


Whether it was /r/entrepreneur or /r/marketing – I’ve been taking notes and keeping track of insights shared here for quite some time now. Specifically, I’ve taken posts from users like /u/bandholz, /u/localcasestudy and /u/brian604 and used their expertise and insights to grow professionally. Now, I know I’m from an entirely different industry but I like to find inspiration from anyone and any thing... I think we all can learn from one another and the folks here at /r/entrepreneur are some of the best for aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from. 


Beyond that, I think some people here would do great work in the service industry. As such, I feel like its time for me to give back to this community by sharing some lessons… 

First, let’s rewind back to where it all began. I was employed at a small advertising agency for two years and while I thoroughly enjoyed my work, I always wanted to (1) work for myself and (2) have flexibility to travel when I want. And while it’s not something entrepreneurs say very often, I really just wanted to (3) make more money. While at this agency, I started my first blog all about marketing – Here’s what it looked [like](http://i.imgur.com/c0HCQ1h.png). 


2013 was my first year out on my own doing consulting and I earned a little over $160,000 in revenue. For me, this was awesome. I tripled what I was making as an employee and couldn’t be happier with the results. At the time, I was terrified that I would be struggling for the entire year. After expenses (my salary excluded), I sat with about $120,000 profit… At the end of last year, I was able to generate more than $250k in my second year of business.


Here are a couple of the key insights I gathered from my first two years as a consultant:

    
**Work With The Right Clients & The Right Partners**

At the moment, I’m working on two significant technology projects, writing my second book and preparing for a handful of presentations. I would likely go insane if I didn’t have such a great group of people surrounding me and in my corner. I don’t know how to give much advice on this because I really feel as if I’m just starting to figure it out but this [Venn Diagram sums it up well](http://i.imgur.com/pk9Y1Mh.png). 

I’ve made mistakes in the past of working with poor clients but I feel I’ve figured it out. I’m now picky with who I work with and solely work with clients who believe in accountability and are not interested in me telling them what they already know. 

I’ve stopped responding to RFPs and have a focus on working with B2B, startups and enterprise brands. I make some exceptions when the client has a culture fit but if it’s not something I believe in or an amazing opportunity – I pass it along to others.

Finding the right clients can be challenging. The first thing that most freelancers think they should do is set up a Facebook page and possibly a website to promote their business. If you build it, they will not come. It’s not enough to put up a website and Facebook page and call it a day for your marketing efforts. 

As a freelancer, the majority of your work will come from referrals and through word of mouth on the back of clients, friends, colleagues and acquaintances It’s more going to be important to make an effort to develop and nurture relationships with people in industries and organizations that would be interested in your services.

Here are a few of my most profitable tactics for generating new business:

**Say Yes To Great Opportunities Early On**
In the service industry, you’re only as good as your last project. If you’re not a freelancer or haven’t worked in service before – your challenge is going to be achieving credibility. If I was to rewind back to my early days of consulting, I said yes to every and any project that came across my desk. I was young, hungry and had no portfolio. Saying yes to these projects allowed me to build a quality portfolio along with a handful of case studies and references that I could leverage for future business development.

Look for potential clients who are struggling in an area you can help out in. If it’s something that you can sweep in and provide a quick win – do it! Helping potential clients achieve success early can lead to longer and bigger contracts down the road. And if you’re not already crazy busy servicing your clients; building a reputation and generating case studies at this stage will be very valuable down the road. 

**Speaking at Events**
The majority of the events that I’ve spoken at has been local or within a 10hr drive. Public speaking is one of those skills that I truly believe allowed me to separate myself from the competition. I always aim to leave an event as being the speaker that dropped jaws and left people wanting more. 

Few tips & reasons why I encourage you to get into the speaking game:

**Personal Branding On Steroids**
If you’re speaking at an event, you immediately are considered an expert in a field. As you deliver your presentation, you can either gain more credibility or lose it bit by bit. If you give a captivating presentation that turns heads and delivers value; people will take notice. People will follow you on Twitter, subscribe to your newsletter, ask for your card and associate you with your expertise or industry.

**New People = New Opportunities**
This one is pretty straightforward. The more people you meet, the better chances you will find new opportunities. If you hang out with the same people at conferences, you’re doing it wrong. Do research by looking at conference hashtags before the event and try to follow some people who will be attending. If you see someone using the hashtag that you HAVE to meet – Send them a tweet before the event and lock in some time for lunch or coffee in between sessions.

How can you find these events and conferences? Here are two of my favourite places: www.lanyrd.com/2015 and www.eventbrite.com

**Write About What You Do – Position Yourself As An Expert**

Between 2013 and 2014 I wrote more than 500k words on marketing, startups and technology. Writing has been one of my biggest generators of new business, has helped me develop my skills and has accelerated my ability to build a quality network. 

Creating content and sharing my ideas on marketing has allowed me to connect with people all over the world and help organizations across the globe achieve meaningful results for their business. Whether it’s through the writings of my recent book or through content published on various industry blogs or seeded in various networks – writing has been a driving force behind the growth of my business and existing network. 

**Strategic Coffee Meetings**

Lots of people will ask you for your time; it’s important to take the meetings that matter. When you’re starting out, the coffee meetings you take will make a huge difference down the road. It might be just an hour today but it could be the beginning of a relationship that fuels a portion of your business. 

How can you find the right people to meet with? One of the best approaches I’ve found is surrounding yourself with likeminded people. Attend events and always follow up with them after you meet. Follow up is key. From there, don’t hesitate to reach out when you’re looking for advice or have the ability to deliver them with something of value. When you meet with someone, find out how you can help him or her and then follow up trying to do exactly that. 

For example, one of my early contacts said that they were looking for someone who could help with their website redesign. So I sent them a detailed email highlighting how easy it was to use a site like 99designs.com for the design elements along with the emails of 4 contacts I found locally by using dribble and Behance. Fast forward two months later and they hired me to develop an entire content strategy.

**Join Associations or Create A Group**

A great way to generate leads and find new business opportunities is to become a member of a professional association or group. Whether you’re a member of a local chamber of commerce, industry association or volunteer on the board for a charity – all of these actions can act as a direct lane to new customers. 

If you’re not able to find an association or group that seems relevant to you; create one. I’m a member of 3 or 4 groups on Facebook where the members discuss business and share leads with one another. I’ve seen people collaborate on projects and even go from contracting each other on the side to joining forces full time.  

**Get The Right Processes & Technologies Behind You**

One of the first steps to starting a consulting business is ensuring you have the right processes and technologies behind you. Processes and technologies both play different roles but are the backbone of being able to run a consulting business effectively. 

For me, the processes and technologies I leverage daily have played a key role in allowing for sanity, growth and productivity. Here are some of them:

**KEY PROCESSES:**

* **New Business Onboarding:** Develop a standard process for the approach you take when onboarding new customers. It could be as simple as sending them a timeline that requires approval followed by the estimate. Either way, having this structure locked down ensures trust in the early days of your business.

* **Standard Project Steps:** The best thing you can do for your business is productize it by breaking out each step into chunks. For me, every project starts with “Discovery” which is when I get to know the client followed by “Planning” which is when I develop a plan (obviously) and then “Execution” which is when the creation, delivery or distribution of deliverables takes place.
* **Standard Pricing For Services:** No one likes it when you stumble over your prices. Know what you're worth and communicate it with confidence. 

Great resource is Brennan Dunn’s blog: [Double Your Freelancing Rate](http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/)

**KEY TECHNOLOGIES**

* **Freshbooks for Invoicing**: This is a service I’ve been using since I started. It’s a great service that makes it easy for sending invoices to your client and generating reports for bookkeepers and accountants. 

* **Slack For Communications**: Once you start working with other freelancers, it’s important to communicate. Slack is one of my favourite tools for communication although I’ve also used Basecamp in the past. A combination of these two tools are great for managing your projects and knowing what’s going on. 
* **Wordpress For Blogging**: This is how you build your reputation as an expert or a homebase that you can drive people to for conversion. No matter whether you’re selling dog walking services or plumbing services; Wordpress has the plugins and themes that will help you create a compelling and engaging site. 
*  **Gmail (And Plugins) For Email**: Sounds simple but Gmail and the various plugins are the key to my sanity. First and foremost, the set up is easy and managing it is a walk in the park. The plugins are the gold mine in my books. While Rapporative isn’t as good as it once was, tools like Boomerang, Canned Responses, Sidekick and my recent favourite: MixMax are amazing. 



I don’t know if you folks will find this valuable or not but I hope someone does. If just one person can take a few of these lessons and apply them to their life to get closer to financial freedom – I’ve done my job. While I’m still consulting, my focus is now shifting towards product development - one project called Hustle & Grind another called Crate.  Both are going to be very challenging for me and will push me to learn some new tricks. 

I’m excited and terrified all at the same time.  

There are a lot of more details that I can talk about, but I’ve already written a mini-novel. It's probably best that you ask questions and I'll answer them as soon as I can!

***


**FACT: You can put your ad in front of 10,000 people that need whatever you're selling for about $100-200.**


Facebook allows you to laser target people, to the extent that you can target cat-loving single moms who listen to Coldplay and play volleyball in their free time.


Whatever (almost) your market is, you can laser target them on Facebook and put your message in front of them. 

The problem is, advertising on Facebook is a bit different than on other platforms.

Unlike on Google AdWords where you can directly sell your stuff, people on Facebook are not that ready and eager to buy right away, and you need to nurture them a bit more.

But while you're going to pay $5-100/click on AdWords , if you're paying more than $3/click on Facebook, you're doing something wrong. This allows for much higher returns on ad spend. 

There are some ridiculous examples - my buddy once got something like $55,000 in sales with $150-200 spent on a campaign. Now that was 95% luck, as his client was a roofing company, there was a huge storm in the area and leads closed fast. Don't expect this kind of results to be the norm. 

But - in my (strongly biased) opinion Facebook is the best way to get new business, when done right.


**I hear a lot of ""But Facebook ads don't work for my business"" statements.** In 99% of the times, there's somebody who's doing the exact same thing that you are doing, and is absolutely killing it with Facebook ads. 

Why most of the people fail with FB usually falls in one of these 3 categories (or all 3 at once):  
1. They don't understand what goes into a successful Facebook campaign  
2. They quit to early  
3. They hire the wrong person/company  


All these problems can be avoided by educating yourself first. Even if you don't fall into the service business category, read this post as it will help you understand how advertising on Facebook works in general.


What I'm going to show you is a specific process for getting new business for service type businesses, that's working right now.




  

These types of campaigns, when optimized, generally bring in 3x-20x ROI - I know this is a huge range, but the rule of thumb is, the bigger your ticket is, the ROI will be bigger. So if you're selling a $5000 service, your ROI will be bigger than somebody who's selling a $500 service. It will also depend on **how good you are in sales (or your salespeople)**, because the sale usually happens on the phone, or in person.

This is by no means a magic-pill - it takes hard work, but I'm about  to make it a lot easier for you, and if you apply it, your business is going to be very thankful. 

**I'd not advise you to get into paid traffic if you don't have at least $2k-3k/month to put aside to invest** - paid traffic is awesome and brings fast results (unlike SEO) but you need to spend money first for testing and finding what works. If you're on a tight budget and can't afford to lose some money, you could get yourself in trouble.

Let's get into it.

#Intro to Facebook Ads

First thing to understand is that with Facebook ads (and with any online/offline marketing channel) the **actual ad mechanics are just 10-20% of what goes into a successful campaign**. By mechanics I mean the actual ad setup, bidding, all the little clicks you need to do in Facebook ads manager.  

(I'm not going to describe the little clicks and steps you need to take in Ads Manager/Power Editor here - you can easily find that on Youtube and some of it in the links I provide on the bottom of the post.)  

What really makes the most impact is the **actual psychology behind it,** and what happens after someone clicks on your ad.
That's the difference between a losing campaign, and a 20x ROI campaign. 


Second thing to understand is CONTEXT of Facebook:


1. Facebook is a content platform. Which means that people are there to consume, create and share content.  

2. Facebook is a social platform. Which means that people are there to interact, communicate with and enjoy their friends and family.


Meaning that if you crack the code, your ads will be successful, AND you'll get free traffic and endorsement.  
Here's a good example: http://imgur.com/a/Ki4Pj   


This was a really successful ad that gone somewhat viral (credit repair niche) - most of the comments are people inquiring and tagging other people. That means, FREE traffic. Free traffic=free money.

 If you treat Facebook for what it is (content+social), Facebook will treat you well right back.



#**Here's how the method works in short (simplified):**



So how this works in practice is (oversimplified): 

1. Targeted people (potential customers) are going to see your ads in their news feed
2. They are going to click and read an educational/promotional article that you created 
3. Some of those people will be interested in your service and will give you your info in exchange for a ""hook"" right away
4. You're going to use Retargeting to send people who read your article to your Lead Capture page where they will turn into leads.
5. You will followup with the leads and a good percentage of them will become your clients/customers.

The moving parts of this method are:  

* Offer/hook
* Lead Capture page  
* An educational article related to your service
* Facebook ads


***

##**Step 1. Do the research and dial in on your ideal customer**  

If you don't have a deep understanding of your audiences problems, desires and needs, you can't make this work. I consistently see people failing with Facebook and saying that it doesn't work - It works, but you have to understand your audience/ideal customer first.  

This is where a lot of people fail or skip this step altogether. **Before creating a successful marketing campaign on any channel, you have to know how your customer thinks, breathes, and acts.** Use websites like Google, quantcast and Facebook's audience insights. Here the things you should know before even starting to execute a marketing campaign:

* Age  
* Gender  
* Relationship status  
* Kids/no kids  
* Net worth  
* Home Value  
* Renters/Owners  
* Interests  
* Income  
* Why do they need your service  
* When do they need your service  
* Their fears and desires  
* When do they use internet
* Do they access internet via desktop or mobile
* What kind of words they use when describing the problem your service solves
* What do they hate about your and similar services and how could you get them rid of that?
  
  
This is crucial. The research will help you with targeting your customers, crafting the actual messaging and coming up with a converting offer. 
***


##**Step 2. Come up with 3 different hooks/magnets for attracting leads**    
  
Now that you have the actual knowledge on who is going to buy, you need to come up with an angle of approach, an actual ""hook"" that's going to make them leave their data/inquire about your services.  
  
This is the most important part of your strategy. You can make amazing ads, have the best targeting and service in the world, but if your hook does not make them bite, you will fail. 

##Job of the hook is to get people to **leave their information and express their interest** in exchange for something.
Job of the hook is not to sell the service (Just yet). 


Hook can be either **direct** or **indirect**. If you're using a direct hook, you're usually going to spend more per lead, but the transition to sale will be more direct as well. 


Since we have such a variety of businesses here, there's no hard rule but here are some examples that I found work as a hook: 

Direct:  

* Free estimate  
* $XXX Discount 
* Straight up pushing the sale ( eg. Looking for a new roof? Get it done by professionals, submit your info and we'll call you back)

Indirect:

* Free part of the service
* Free consultation
* Lower end service for free (if you have a range of services)

Industry-specific examples to get your creativity flowing:

* Free teeth checkup
* 15 minutes consultation on improving your credit score
* $50 Hairstylist discount

Be creative here - if you have a hair salon you can offer a lower end service for FREE, to get them trough the door and then upsell.  

For niches like **Home Remodeling, Loans, HVAC, Roofing a more direct approach will usually do - get an estimate or a discount** You'll also have a more direct path to a sale. 
 But TEST everything, it will make a difference between paying $20 or $200 for a lead.


***
##**Step 3. Create 3 Lead Capture pages, one for each hook**   
***
Lead Capture page is a page that you're going to send your traffic (Facebook clicks) to. A lot of business owners make the mistake of sending people to their homepage.  You should NEVER do that, as the homepage usually has too many distractions, and is not designed (usually) to convert visitors to leads. 

Here's an example of a great looking lead capture page: http://imgur.com/a/vD7Ty  
It's clean, it has a clear purpose and the next step, it's benefit driven.


Here's a perfect example of what a lead capture page shouldn't look like: http://imgur.com/a/CoDqd   
It looks like it's from 1995, it's ugly, there's no social proof, there's no clear direction, everything.

##** Only goal** of the lead capture page is to **turn visitors into leads** aka make them leave their information in exchange for your ""hook""(free estimate, discount, etc.).  

Since you have 3 different hooks - you will need 3 separate lead capture pages. The design can be practically the same, but you will use different copy (text) and/or images to match different hooks. Luckily, you don't have to pay $100s or $1000s for each - you can easily create one yourself using https://www.clickfunnels.com/ or https://www.leadpages.net/.



Here's what your Lead Capture page **has** to have for maximum conversion: 

##1. Powerful benefits based headline  

The headline should clearly and **specifically** tell visitors what's in it for them, nothing more. Don't talk about yourself, talk about what's in it for them.  

Bad headline: Top #1 Dentist in Canada  (You can use this as social proof/subheadline though)

Good Headline: Get a Professional $250 Teeth Checkup for Free
##2. Form for data submission (phone,email,name, etc)  

These are the blank fields where visitors enter their contact and other info. Don't ask for more than you need! Every extra step will lower the conversion rate. Caveat: I had a few situations where my clients told me that the leads were not qualified enough - in that case ADD a few extra qualifying questions to the form. 

##3. Clear and visible call to action button  

Call to action button and headline need to be the **2 most visible things on your lead capture page.** First things the visitors need to notice are 1. What will they get and 2. What to do next.  

Call to action button should specifically state what to do next - people need to be instructed (you'd be amazed by the extent of this).

P.S. I just started testing a first person button with one of my clients - it seems to work great. Instead of ""Click here to get XXX"" test ""Yes, I want XXX"".


##4. Contact number  

Some people just prefer to use the phone - don't let them drop off and give them that option. Put it in the upper right corner or beneath the call to action button. 

If you don't, you're going to lose sales - a few months ago I forgot to put a number on a client lead capture page, and after fixing the mistake, we got an increase of $1000-2000 in  **extra sales from the calls** each month, while the adspend stayed the same. 

##5. Urgency/Scarcity

The less there is of something, the more valuable it is. Much more people will take you up on your hook/offer if it's limited. You can limit it by a) time and b) quantity. 




##6. Social Proof (Testimonials and the likes)  

This is yet another of 6 principles of influence - and it will drastically improve your conversions. 

**People trust products and services other people use and find helpful**, that's hardwired into our brain (Social Feedback). 

Add a couple of testimonials under your form and CTA button. You can also add a sub-headline that says something like ""Trusted by 4483 happy customers"" - works like a charm.  


##Make it mobile optimized - a lot of the traffic will come from mobile. 
Clickfunnels does this for you automatically.

##Put a Facebook Pixel on your Lead Capture page and on your Thank you page ( a simple page that says Thank You, after visitors submit their info). You'll need this for tracking conversions. You can find instructions on youtube. 











***

##**Step 4. Create an educational article directly related to your offer/service** 


Since we know that people on Facebook love content, that's exactly what we're going to give them (at first).


For this, you're going to need a promotional/educational article that is ***directly related to your service.***

The goal of the article is to educate people, position your company as the authority on the subject and to bring people closer to the desired outcome - sale. It serves as the first ""bridge"" between the sale. We're also going to use an article as a tool for improving your targeting (more on that in the ads section).


Here are a few formats that work well for the article:  

1. How to get xxx (positive result your customers want)  

2. How to avoid/solve xxx (problem your potential customers have)  

3. How Jane Doe (your customer) got xxx (positive result)  
4. How Jane Doe (your customer) solved xxx (problem)  
5. Top 5 Benefits of solving xxx (problem your customers have)  
6. How solving problem xxx improves your life  
7. How achieving xxx result improves your life  
8. Number #1 thing to avoid to avoid when hiring xxx (service provider)  


Think about what your potential customers **would be interested in reading.** Actual examples (""case studies"" (3 and 4)) are usually best because they are actual testimonials in disguise, and you demonstrate how you already helped someone. 

Get creative with the headlines - think mild clickbait.


##The more specific you are about the problems being solved and for whom - you'll get better results.

If you can make it fun - even better.
If you're not good with this, just hire a writer to do it for you. Even better - hire a direct response copywriter, he'll know exactly what to do.

#When you write the article, add a soft call to action linking to your lead capture page at the bottom of your article.

We need to get people from reading content, **to taking some kind of action**. A small percentage of people will be ready to take you up on your hook right away. Most of them won't - but we will use retargeting to show ads to them and convert them later.


**Add a Facebook pixel from your account to this page.** 





***

















#Step 5. Create kick-ass ads and show them to the right people 

And only NOW you can proceed to the actual ad creation. 

##Goal of your ad is to get people's attention and make qualified people CLICK.

Job of the ad is not to sell your service, the goal of the ad is to sell the click.

There are 3 elements that make an ad successful: 

##1. Targeting 


There are 4 general ""categories"" you can target: Interests, demographics, behaviors, and location. I know a lot of people struggle with targeting - but if you understand your customers it's really not that hard. Here's a look inside Facebook's Audience Insights,  tool that you can use to help you with your targeting: http://imgur.com/a/ebBfl 
 
Now I'm going to make targeting MUCH easier for you and make it better at the same time. 

Facebook spent and spends millions of dollars on developing their algorithm - and you're going to leverage it using **Lookalike Audiences**. Lookalike audiences are audiences of people that are similar (based on MASSIVE amount of data Facebook has about you and everybody else) to your customers/leads. Here's what to do:

1. If you have a customer list(Phone Numbers or Emails) , upload it to Facebook, and create a Lookalike Audience off of that.
2. If you don't have a customer list use Facebook's basic targeting (based on your customer profile) to send 250-500 clicks to your pixeled educational article, and create a Lookalike audience from those people (who clicked on your ad and read the article). If your article is directly related to your offer, that will be people who are laser targeted.

(This takes a couple of clicks in ads manager, you can find it on Google/Youtube)

Based on this, you will get a big targeted list of people that are potential customers for your business. You can not do this better than Facebook's own algorithm (unless you're an expert). If you're a location-based business, you'll need to narrow it down by your location. Pretty common sense. 

Now, if you want to get all NINJA (not necessary), you can target even more - by narrowing down your Lookalike Audience by an interest/behavior/demographics. For example, you can use your Lookalike Audience as a base for targeting, but say only show ads to people that are in your Lookalike Audience AND are homeowners.

##2. Copy (Ad and headline text)

This will vary based on the type of ads and your business, but here are some directions: 

* Check your grammar - make sure it's perfect
* Make it BENEFIT based, instead of FEATURE based
* Try starting your ads with questions
* Specifically address your potential customer
* Try to use language your customers use when describing your service/their problems
* Explicitly instruct customer to click
* Check out Facebook Ad Guidelines to know what words you can use (so you don't get your acc banned)
* Make sure the copy (wording etc.) is CONSISTENT with pages where you send traffic to

Before creating ads - go to [Adespresso's ad library](https://adespresso.com/academy/ads-examples/). You can find great examples there from almost all industries that will help you craft your ads.

##3. Images

Images are super important - if the image sucks, people will just scroll over your ad without noticing it. Now, the thing about images is that you can't know what works before you test it. So with any campaign you start - start with testing 5 images. 

Make sure your images are **related to your service** and **consistent with your landing page**. Images that are in contrast with Facebook's colours usually work better. Using smiling people (especially women) helps (if it's related to your service). 

Stay away from obvious stock photos.

You'll need to set of ads - one to send people to your article, and one to send people who saw the article to your lead capture page. 

Write at least 2 different copy variations, and pick 5 images for each set.

You will place your ads in the NEWS FEED, where all the attention is. Both mobile newsfeed and desktop newsfeed: http://imgur.com/a/z5mUc

#Ads 1 - Sending people to your article

First batch of ads should be optimized for Website Clicks. (http://imgur.com/a/OHp0A). You'll choose that in Ads Manager when creating the campaign (http://imgur.com/a/tVKul) - instead of ""Conversion"", pick ""Website Clicks"". That means that Facebook will show your ads to people that are most likely to click.

#Ads 2 - Sending people to your lead capture page

This batch of ads should be optimized for Website Conversions using the FB pixel. Conversion will mean that somebody has seen your Thank You page, meaning that they submitted their info.  For this campaign - **you will only target people who have read your article.**

##After the campaign spends $50-200, check what ads are performing the best and turn off the other ones. When increasing budgets, DON'T increase for more than 15-20%/day, it will mess up your click and lead costs. 

From time to time you will need to switch up your ad copy and images, because people get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. In your ad stats you can see the **frequency** - that's a number that shows how many times on average your ad was shown to the same person. Track that and don't let it go over 5-10. 

Some metrics you can keep an eye on:  

1. Click trough rate (CTR)  
2. Cost per 1000 views (CPM)  
3. Cost per click  
4. Cost per conversion  
5. Frequency (how many times your ad has been shown to the same person on avg)  

While these will be a good indicator on which ads are performing -**the only important metric, in the end, is are you making more money than you're spending.**
 

***

#Step 6. Follow-up and close ($$$)


Now that people are reading your article and converting into qualified leads - it's time for you to follow up and close!

Depending on whether you used a direct or indirect hook, and what you used as a hook, this process will be different for everyone, but you need to follow-up and make the sale/upsell happen. 

One really important thing here: **The longer you wait to contact the lead, the colder it becomes. Money loves speed.**

Here's a **SUPER COOL** trick to massively help you with this.

Using https://www.eztexting.com/ (or similar services)  you can set up Automatic SMS messages. 

What you want to do is make the software, every time a lead is submitted, sends a message saying (depending on your hook/context) eg: ""Hey - thanks for showing your interest in XXX. When is the best time to call you/do whatever the hook was? YourNameYourCompany""

**Make it personal**, people want to communicate with people, not computers.

791,7inu7t,False,AMA,315,"Will Earn $120k This Year from Blog and YT Channel - What To Do With Extra Cash? Also, AMA You Want!",Entrepreneur,"Some of you might know me from my [income report posts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/59baw8/finally_hit_10kmonth_revenue_with_my_blog_income/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit) on /r/Entrepreneur ... Here's the quick tl;dr ↓

I run a style blog and YT channel called The Modest Man. It took a few years for it to become a ""full time"" operation, and the growth has been really cool to see since 2013:

- 2013: $2k
- 2014: $8k
- 2015: $36k
- 2016: $89k
- 2017: $120k
- 2018: $170k (projected)

September of this year was a record month for revenue at a little over $12k. Looking at [Q3 2017](https://www.themodestman.com/income-report-q3-2017/), after expenses and taxes, the business put about $6,250 in my pocket each month.

So, I'm by no means rich, but I'm almost at the point where I could hire someone (I have a part-time assistant now), and I have extra cash to put back into the business, which is really interesting. Up until this year, I was just trying to make a living and survive. Now the question, ""What's the best way to use this extra cash?""

Some options are:

- Ramp up the existing model (hire writers, social media people, video editors, etc.)
- Create physical products (clothing line, merch, accessories, etc.)
- Invest in real estate (rental properties, developers)
- Sock it away in retirement accounts (I have an IRA that I max out, but I could - open a SEP or a non-retirement investment account)
- Buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
- Start another, completely different business
- Upgrade my lifestyle (probably wouldn't do this, but it *is* an option that's worth mentioning)

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, especially if you've been in this situation with your business and have some experience/advice.

Also, I'd love to answer any questions you have about blogging, getting traffic, SEO, monetization, sponsorships and creating content.

\- No refunds on tickets that are cancelled even though I am pretty sure that the artists and event organizers (in some cases) have not been paid.

\- No way to get real time feedback on how the event is until you buy the tickets and walk in to find it empty or just a bad experience.

A few months ago I ended up at the [very top of the frontage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3pj9d5/i_started_a_mens_underwear_company_selling_over/) for r/entrepreneur when I launched my second Kickstarter campaign for my comfortable boxer briefs.

Many enjoyed reading the story and how-to’s… so, in the spirit of sharing, I thought i’d tell you how things have moved along since then.

I’ve since relaunched with 9 different product lines, refined the products extensively, improved the manufacturing process, replaced my platforms, completely changed the branding, and reached $500k in total sales. I'm stocked up on inventory for the rest of the year and I have a growth plan in place.

This post explains exactly how I got here, what tools i’m using, and what i’m planning on doing next. I urge you to keep the conversation productive, asking any questions you may have, big or small, and please keep the criticism polite. Suggestions and critiques are always welcome! 

First, a quick background:

**Milestones in the Past 8 months**

* [First Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/premium-boxer-briefs-ridiculous-comfort-at-a-fair) - $142k - July 2015
* [Second Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/ultra-comfortable-mens-underwear-at-a-fair-price) - $219k - October 2015
* [New Branding, Website, and Product Launch](https://comfortableclub.com/) - January 2016

**The Refined Concept Behind Comfortable Club**

We started off naming the company The Comfortable Boxers Co.  It works well for SEO and gave it a nice unbranded feel to it, which resonated with those not willing to pay premiums. After striking the underwear market on a fairly significant level and with intentions of expanding our product line, a lot of thought went into a re-branding. In planning for monthly subscriptions services for our apparel, we’ve opted for a lifestyle brand with a primary focus on quality, comfort, and pricing. We arrived at [Comfortable Club.](https://comfortableclub.com) 

The whole theme revolves around the idea that we shouldn’t have to overpay for premium apparel, so, quite realistically, the product line can expand into many areas. For now, though, we’re mainly focused on underwear, undershirts, and lounge products. 

Our name says it all. We make a premium line of obsessively engineered, ridiculously cozy underwear and lounge apparel – and deliver them at half the price of retail. Harry’s did it for razors. Casper did it for mattresses. Now, at Comfortable Club, we’re doing it for underwear and loungewear: building a great, premium brand that reflects the things that customers care about today: quality, cost, convenience and, of course, comfort. 

**Premium at a Fair Price**

An immediate reaction from some of you will be: ""Why would I pay $16 for a pair of underwear? I can buy X and Y for Z."" My job since the very beginning was to convince customers why modal fabric is worth it, because your day absolutely changes when you're wearing these bad boys. Except this time, you won't be paying Calvin Klein or other brands over $35 for a pair. But I won't go into too much marketing lingo here, because the point of this post is to show you just how I managed to cut the price and built a sustainable business around the concept. Let's begin:

**Bridging the Sourcing Gap**

Quality underwear requires quality craft, so we partnered with the the best factory and fabric engineering experts we could find. The process was extremely long and patience was essential. First off, shy away from resellers and agents (aka Alibaba), do your research, find a sourcing partner, and go straight to the factory, the same ones used by high-end brands.

Our relationships with the manufacturing plants are very close. So close, in fact, that during the peak manufacturing timeline we actually LIVE in the factory. This is part of our quality control program, which we’ll describe later. You see, the tricky part about sourcing is making sure you get a consistently high-quality product. Apart from a lack of organization, this is precisely the problem that plagues small businesses. Because small businesses usually don’t follow-up with recurring orders to the factory, the supplier is usually hands off once the product is on the boat. If you can establish a clear, long-term relationship, set your requirements up front, and have a presence in the process, you're set. 

We learned this when sourcing metal sheet rolls for a multinational roofing company, so we opted for a closer relationship with the supplier. We established a permanent presence in Shanghai in partnership with a small sourcing office. This means we have feet on the ground in the factory, can supervise every step, and we establish our own quality control programs (at our expense of course).

**Building Something Beautiful Through Manufacturing**

Early in our research (of which I also mean shopping around and trying everything out there), I learned there are three key factors that impact comfort: the stitching, fit, and fabrics. So in creating our underwear, we put a meticulous -- some might say, obsessive -- amount of attention into each of those areas.

The devil, as they say, is in the details, and when it comes to underwear, stitching is one that tends to get overlooked. We use a more robust, sturdier stitching in our products that make them last, while maintaining their comfort. But we shied away from traditional threads and opted for fluffy threads reserved only for the most luxurious winter apparel for a completely itch-free experience. Look closely at any pair of Comfortable Club undergarments, you can see the uniquely intricate, tight knit puffy stitch. 

We opted for 92% modal fabric, an eco-friendly microfiber that enfolds the body in a light embrace. Modal is smooth, soft, and breathable, and its luscious texture feels similar to silk. It’s cool to the touch, super absorbent, and resistant to shrinkage and fading. In short, it’s the perfect microfiber fabric for body-hugging underwear.

Stitching, fit, fabrics. It’s a relatively simple formula, but the result is something pretty spectacular: underwear that looks great -- and feels even better.  

**The Actual Manufacturing Process**

Here’s a generalized model of the prototype and final manufacturing process for a new product:

* Initial size, die-cut, stitching, waistband & fabric specifications created
* Textile production for prototypes
* Dyeing process for prototypes
* Prototype testing with real-world use
* Revisions for prototypes
* Revised prototypes created using same textile
* Prototype testing under more scenarios
* Sizing trials
* Final exact manufacturing specifications created
* Demand planning
* Manufacturing order created
* Quality control program created and programmed. Hiring process for quality control specialists begins.
* Textile production - depending on the factory, this is done in-house or outsourced
* Dyeing process
* Waistband production
* Quality control runs
* Lab testing for fabric weight, color fastness, and shrinkage
* Fabric cutting
* Quality control runs
* Revisions, if needed
* Packaging specs created
* Packaging order created
* Stitching and crafting
* Final quality control runs
* Revisions, if needed
* Ironing and folding
* Packaging and labeling
* Final check and count
* Loading onto container
* Freight shipping - FOB to door
* Receiving at the warehouse

Prototype as many times as you have to. Each round takes over a month of work, but the version you take to market has to be as perfect as possible. It's important to specify exact sizing guidelines and templates for every aspect of the product. Design specific packaging guidelines, including product tagging, warning messages on bags, SKU and UPC labels, and specify items per case. Color codes must be clearly stated. Fabric weight, fade, and shrinkage minimums and maximums be specified and tested. As an example, we raised our fabric weight to 190g/m2, and lowered our fade and shrinkage ceiling to 1%.

**Quality Control**

When you’re manufacturing thousands and thousands of items that involve a manual process, you can’t rely on a ‘set-and-forget’ attitude. Our quality control process involves actual third-party lab testing with SGS. We also send our own personnel to the factory.

After finalizing the prototype phase and finalizing specs, we establish a strict defect-rate ceiling at 1% and randomly test up to 10% of the products to control for this. The sample size is large enough to be a good representation of the entire product. Of course, some defective items sneak through the cracks, but as long as you can keep it below 1%, you’re golden.

To reach this rate, however, we tripled our quality control staff and rejected every anomaly. We ended up rejecting a whole blue textile batch that led to a few delays.

**Demand Planning**

Quantities to produce depend highly on your demand model. With our initial Kickstarter campaign, we produced the amount pre-ordered on the campaign and at least an additional 50% for recurring orders. Problem is, we ran out of inventory within the first month! Lesson learned.

For our second Kickstarter campaign, we produced an additional 800% of total items spread out through 9 different product lines. For this reason, the transition into e-commerce was smoothly executed. Being out of stock is probably the most dangerous thing for your business.

As for quantities per size and color, black and gray are always the most popular ones by about 50% more than other colors. Sizing usually goes as follows:

* S - 15%
* M - 45%
* L - 25%
* XL - 10%
* 2XL - 5%

This, of course, depends on your target market. But this model has done rather well for us so far. We also extended our offerings to include Lounge Pants, Undershirts, and a Women's Underwear line. The same model applies for all.

**Presenting Your Product**

In presenting our product to the world, we could’ve opted for any local model and called it a day. we also could’ve sent our products over to a photographer that specializes in this type of photography. We truly believe we wouldn’t be here, telling you our story, if we had done this. 

We instead researched the LA market for the best models we could find. They did cost us quite a bit, but the results speak for themselves. We personally flew to California, brought our own trustworthy photographer with us, rented a beautiful house on Airbnb, got some studio space, and ran the whole photoshoot ourselves. 

For any product you sell online, you’ll need to create lifestyle images, e-commerce images, and product images. The theme around the lifestyle images depend on how you want your brand to be perceived.

As for [retail packaging,](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Comfortable_Club_Packaging-10.jpg?6884464036085610274) these were created as a showcase and ‘show off’ concept. More on that later.

**Optimize Your Storefront**

The [Comfortable Club](https://comfortableclub.com) shopping experience starts the minute customers hit our website. The landing page says exactly what we do and transitions into our whole product catalogue. For this and many other reasons, we’ve built and designed the site for unlimited growth potential and scalability using Shopify’s excellent platform. 

Optimized for conversion? You bet it is. We’ve removed tiny roadblocks that shave off seconds from the shopping experience, like custom developed color and size swatches instead of drop down menus, as well as plus and minus selectors instead of a number input form. [Every little improvement counts.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Buybox.jpg?4437860519955730119)

We’ve also made the navigation menu sticky and always visible for easy browsing. On top of that, the mega nav menu (the pop-up that shows up after hovering over SHOP) helps customers understand how our products are categorized and allows for easy browsing at any time, regardless of which page you’re on.

The website is always a work in progress. We’re constantly fixing tiny bit that improve the experience ever so lightly. After-all, it's all a numbers and psychology game.

**Automated E-mail Flows**

E-mail is a beautiful art. It’s also the highest converting platform out there. I’ve set-up my platform using [Klaviyo](http://klaviyo.com/) and pop-ups using [Privy.](http://www.privy.om) They integrate very nicely with Shopify and pull in a great deal of data that allows you to segment e-mails and create flows rather easily. As for e-mail design, [here's an example of an abandoned cart e-mail.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/email.jpg?1514475351117951741)

Cart abandonment e-mails are what some people call ‘low hanging fruit’ and are huge drivers for conversion rates. It’s important to reassure your customer that you have his back.

**The Enterprise Resource Planning System**

Our ERP and information systems are designed to maintain exact inventory counts in every warehouse, with real-time visibility that allows us to plan our manufacturing requirements ahead of time, so we can grow with demand, instead of behind it. 

A lot of testing went into choosing the right platform. The first and most important criteria is integration abilities with my other platforms. Second, automation functionality. We opted for the beautifully operated [Stitch Labs](http://stitchlabs.com/) inventory management platform as my centralized hub. It handles all my sales channels, including Shopify and upcoming Amazon and eBay openings. We then assign a fulfillment warehouse to each one, and using the new 3PL integration functionality, orders flow back and forth. We designed workflows and established flow parameters like shipment mappings based on weight and destination. Stitch Labs handles the rest, including a complete accounting integration with Quickbooks. 

A new feature i'm probably going to end-up using is product bundling, which means I can finally build a virtual SKU composed of multiple existing SKU's. Stitch reports an inventory level of the SKU with the lowest availability. This will serve well for ‘packs’. 

Reporting is robust enough to handle manufacturing requirements planning (MRP) and deep level sales insights, including customer loyalty and variant splits. I’m completely in love with it.

**Automated Freight Logistics**

Our logistics partner, Flexport, combines the power of the cloud and uses a proprietary bidding technology that guarantees the best rates and shipping times from our factory, all while streamlining the online-only process that eliminates paperwork and errors. 

I go with [FOB to Door.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/IMG_1033.jpg?10601425246704194831) Customs, paperwork, and communications are handled entirely by the Flexport team.

**Automated Fulfillment and the Science of Shipping**

If you run a small operation in the hundreds of items of total inventory and can find the time to spend a couple of hours a day picking, packing, sealing, labeling, and dropping off orders at the post office, by all means, do so and use Shipstation for this. If you have a small amount of SKU’s but a couple thousand items, you can upgrade to a 3PL like Fulfillrite. On the other hand, when inventory counts start getting into the tens of thousands with hundreds of SKU’s, when you expect significant growth, and when you start requiring advanced order routing, you move into a larger, more established, 3PL with advanced connectivity features.

We opted for the latter with DCL Logistics.

We have the capacity to store, pick, pack, and ship any volume with same-day fulfillment and an optimized arrangement that places the popular items closer to the picking line. We also use special bar-coding in every single item to guarantee order accuracy -- making order confusion or missing items a thing of the past. In short, we moved in with the big boys!

We have 180 SKU’s over 9 product lines. Keeping track of each one is hard, but our 3PL handles it beautifully. Bear in mind, an organized inventory is crucial and begins from the factory, especially in regards to proper tagging an labeling. [Registration with GS1](http://www.gs1us.org/) for a proper UPC code was crucial for the process, especially if we want to expand to retailers or Amazon. 

The implementation process with a logistics provider of their caliber does require quite a bit of customization and know-how. The way we have it set-up is:

* Order received on sales channel
* Order pushed to Stitch Labs
* Invoice pushed to Quickbooks for immediate realization of income
* Order pushed to respective warehouse with mapped shipping
* 30 minute grace period for order changes
* Items picked, packed, and shipped
* Shipping notice sent back to Stitch Labs with packing list
* Stitch Labs triggers the shipment notification e-mail according to packing list
* Stitch Labs sends Costs of Goods sold info to Quickbooks to immediately realization of expense

The 3PL receive orders from Stitch Labs through the custom-developed API, granting a 30 minute window before the order is locked from any changes (for customers that make mistakes in their orders). They've since published this 3PL connectivity feature to all customers. They pick and pack, ship, and spit back tracking information to Stitch which triggers the shipment confirmation e-mail on Shopify. If yout can't develop an API between Stitch and your 3PL, you can bridge this connection via Shipstation.

The result? [Same-day shipping](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/100_0213.JPG?8245723273761910188) on orders placed before 12:30PM EST. That’s unheard of for a small business!

The implementation process took about 2 months, which I consider to be a good thing. One-click 3PL's are very limited in functionality, whereas custom designed connectors have given me the ability to process returns, handle special rules like box sizing, and perfectly expandable features like EDI’s with large retailers. As an example, the new Amazon competitor Jet.com handles most of their sales through EDI connections with other merchants.

As for shipping providers, USPS is always the best way to go with average shipping times of 1 to 4 days. Our competitors use Fedex Smartpost or UPS Mail Innovations, services that save a few cents over USPS. The twist? They sort the packages and hand over the pre-sorted bulk to USPS anyways, except this time USPS has no incentive to deliver quickly.

**Accounting**

Last, but of course not least: accounting. Yes, you guessed it: also automated. Stitch Labs spits out all invoices in one single format, regardless of the sales channel it received it from, and then sends out costs of goods sold to Quickbooks once the item is shipped. All we're left to do is match bank transactions and deposits with the appropriate group of invoices.

Accounting takes us about 1 hour a week. Bear in mind, the implementation and work-flow design process took months. But remember, [preparation is key!](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280)

Take the time to learn accounting. Take a quick course or read an accounting book. It's worth the effort, as this is the base by which your business runs. It's not as simple as how much cash you have in the bank. When long-term inventory planning is involved, knowing your numbers on a deep level is crucial. 

**[THE WHOLE PICTURE](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Macro_Operations_Diagram.001.jpeg?4487767735057772902)**

So, can we agree that automation is your best friend. What it comes down to is this: at Comfortable Club, we have the logistics of a Fortune 500 company -- without the Fortune 500 overhead. You might ask, what does all this streamlining, automating and general process-hacking get us?

It gets us the ability to run our entire operation -- thousands of dollars of orders across multiple SKUs every month --  as a one-man show. That’s right: the “we” we’ve been talking about this whole time? Well, it’s mostly just me. More on that in a minute.

**Platforms I Use**

All of my platforms have been carefully selected to be compatible with each other. It took months of work to get them talking in such a way that requires minimal maintenance:

* Inventory, Planning, and Sales: [Stitch Labs](http://www.stitchlabs.com/)
* Ecommerce: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)
* Custom development: [Codementor](http://codementor.io/) and [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/)
* E-mail flows: [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) - Much much better than any other platform I’ve tried
* E-mail Pop-ups: [Privy](http://www.privy.com) - Connects beautifully with Klaviyo
* Sales Taxes: [Taxjar](http://www.taxjar.com/) - Counts taxes from every sales channel and creates a beautiful liability report
* Accounting: [Quickbooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/move-to-quickbooks-online/)
* Kickstarter Order Organization: [Backerkit](http://backerkit.com/)
* Kickstarter Shipments Pushed to 3PL: [Shipstation](http://www.shipstation.com/)
* Packaging: [Pakible](https://pakible.com/) (not connected but awesome supplier nonetheless)
* Freight: [Flexport](http://flexport.com/)

Getting them to communicate is a matter of understanding accounting on a basic level, maintaining organized information, and mapping things correctly. In making them work, I've developed wonderful relationships with the support teams from all of these platforms.

**The Almighty Profit Margin**

I’ve noticed that the topic always goes into a heated discussion, and I have a few things to say about this: some markets require a deep commitment to an aggressive pricing strategy before you can start poking around looking for customers. And no, not anyone can price something low and sell thousands.

We required heavy investments in advertising to get noticed. It's only when you have validated your product, carrying a loyal fanbase of users, when you notice a strong rate of repeat customers, and when you can convince new ones easily that you can demonstrate long-term value and can start realizing healthy streaming profits.

This is the point at which i’m in. I’ve invested every single profitable dollar, funneling it into better photography, product prototyping, new product development, improved quality control programs, new advertising methods, and the development of my automated platforms. 

Here’s the breakdown of factors you have to consider in your profit margins:

* Item cost - this cost is realized once it leaves the warehouse to the customer. In the meantime, it’s considered an asset in your balance sheet.
* Packaging 
* Quality Control 
* Freight
* Import duties 
* Commissions & Credit Card Processing Fees
* Kickstarter Fee
* Receiving and unloading
* Storage and warehouse space
* Insurance
* Picking and packing per item charges
* Per order fulfillment charges
* Actual shipping charges
* Advertising with Google PPC, Facebook, and Retargeting (starting mid-May)
* Photography and Models
* Influencer Marketing
* Video Production, although I handled all the video production myself, including the editing
* Cloud platforms and monthly charges
* Payroll for any employees
* Travel expenses

**Social Proof and Reviews are Key**

Like we said, we had a hunch that we weren’t alone in our quest for better, more comfortable underwear. So rather than waste time and money on expensive validation studies and market tests, we took it straight to the market -- and the results were beyond what even we expected. 

In Summer ‘15, we launched our first crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Less than a month later, we’d raised more than $142,000 and sold over 15,000 pairs of boxer briefs. So, being common-sense people, we launched a second, follow-on campaign, which went on to sell an additional $219,000.

All told, we have attained over 7,000 customers in less than 6 months and shipped over 30,000 items -- providing powerful proof that Comfortable Club has [struck a chord with customers.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/reviews001-udmlmgwsvx.jpeg?12664222863729221570)

Next steps are opening up the Amazon sales channel and getting in on PR outreach. As I mentioned on my previous posts, I’m shying away from expensive PR agencies and handling the outreach myself. It’s all about convincing influencers, bloggers, and publications to try on your product. And who better to do that than yourself?

**About Me**

The inspiration for Comfortable Club came after I tried my first pair of premium underwear. I believed in the premium aspect, but couldn’t quite reconcile myself to the idea of shelling out $300 to replenish my underwear supply. Having worked as a supply chain and planning director for a multinational company, I knew only too well that problems with product pricing start upstream, so I put my supply chain and sourcing experience to work to develop a better, more budget-friendly solution. I also worked as director for an SAP implementation initiative on a 500-large multinational company - being the main driver for my knowledge in accounting, systems, and integrations.

The pizza parlor dude likely couldn't afford a business manager, an accountant, an attorney, a bookeeper, a marketing team, and still run the pizza parlor effectively..... let alone experience as a chef.

Or do you just think it's as simple as following a recipe and producing cookie cutter pizzas to perfection every time?

I understand your point and all the dreamers in here will likely downvote me but anyone who has started a successful business can tell you that you need to be the one running the company and have the experience and knowledge to do so.

I'm working in a growth marketing agency. Marketing tools are 30% of what we do, so we use them a lot and experiment with the new ones as much as possible.

There are thousands of tools and it's easy to get lost, so I wanted to share the tools we use most on a daily basis. And divide the list into 14 categories.

I thought this could be handy for Entrepreneurs subreddit.

Why adopt tools? I see marketing tools as tireless colleagues. If you can't hire an employee, choosing the right tool can solve your problems, because they

* Are super cheap.
* Work 7/24 for you.
* Don’t make mistakes.
* Don’t need management. (or needless management)
* Help you to automate the majority of your lead gen process.

Onwards to the list.

845,935gqx,False,,88,"9 months ago I posted that I wanted to start my own craft gin brand on a pretty small budget. Well, we did it! Our first gin launched last month and is going well.",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit, 

[Here is the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/77dk7f/i_am_two_weeks_into_starting_a_gin_brand_yes_the/). 

Our first gin is Earl Grey & Cucumber flavoured and we launched last month. So far we've entered one spirit awards and were [finalist for best-flavoured gin](http://www.theginguide.com/2018-gin-awards-winners.html). Which for our first attempt is pretty awesome!

Here is our website: [PipehouseGin.com](https://pipehousegin.com/). You can [get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pipehouse-Earl-Grey-Cucumber-Gin/dp/B07BY4GVWX) (UK only I'm afraid).

The plan was to try and launch for under £10k (about $14k). Well we went over budget, but not by too much. It cost £12k to get our first 250 bottles made. And then we put in another £4k to help pay for another 250. 

In our first month, we got through 500 bottles. Of which 256 were at markets, 110 to trade, 48 online and the rest given away in samples or drunk at our launch party.

**How we started the business**

There is a lot to talk about but I will try and highlight the interesting stuff.

* We came up with some recipe ideas and emailed every distillery in the country (over 100) to try and find one who would work with us. Only about 3 were willing. It then took quite a few months to perfect our recipe. 
* Because we had no money we did all the branding/website etc ourselves.
* Alcohol duty is a killer. It's about £10 a bottle with VAT which we need to pay upfront. 
* The legal stuff of selling alcohol is a minefield, but once you get your head around it isn't that difficult. We did it all with just two licenses. A personal license which let us sell at markets and an AWRS license which let us sell wholesale. Both were easy to get.
* We store our stock in my garage, a third-party warehouse with an alcohol license so they can deliver and at Amazon FBA warehouse.
* Local businesses have been really helpful and we have got a lot of help. Lots of introductions and orders.
* Markets have worked really well for us. 
* We have been focusing on local PR and got into a bunch of small-town newspapers. This has worked quite well because most people in our small town of Tunbridge Wells have now heard of us. And is much easier than getting into national news.
* We made a lot of pretty amateur mistakes. One of which was to forget to add VAT to our costings, which upped all our costs by 20%.
* The plan originally was to focus on online sales. But the costs of getting the gin to the final customer is pretty prohibitive. It's still work it but wholesale to distributors seems like a better long term plan at the moment.


I posted about the process [live on my personal blog](https://sampriestley.com/project/gin-brand). 

If you have any questions please ask away. I am by no means an expert but will do my best.


**What are our plans?**
There is still a lot we can do and have loads of plans. The thing that is holding us up is time. 

* We have a lot of markets lined up. 
* We are canvassing local bars to try and get them to stock us.
* We need to get in with some distributors, currently we are doing it ourselves.
* I want to look at international expansion. Earl Grey & Cucumber is a very English flavour and I think it could be popular with expats.
* I have some more flavour ideas. Next up an autumnal one for winter. And possibly some gift sets for Christmas.
* We are planning to raise some money to build our own distillery. Maybe through crowdfunding. 

**Questions for you drinks business experts**

* Do you think there is anything else I should be spending my time on?
* Do you have any advice for international expansion?
* Any bars out there want to buy our gin?

**Summary**

I don't think we're far enough through to label it as a success just yet. But I am incredibly proud and still haven't got over the novelty of being able to go into a bar and order my own gin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/935gqx/9_months_ago_i_posted_that_i_wanted_to_start_my/,429,"Goddamn I hate gin!

It's Excel. Or Google Sheets or AirTable or any other similar product. I'd like to tell you a story of how one of my clients saved money with Google Sheets and just a little bit of spreadsheet magic

A while back I made my first post on automation ( [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)) and got a fantastic response (And, full disclosure, a few leads too). Today I'd like to talk about my favorite automation story.

Disclosure: Together with my father I run three small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

This is a recent story. I got approached by a client whose business was struggling under the recent COVID-19 pandemic and were looking to cut costs. They told me that one of their biggest cost points was a part-time virtual assistant that they were paying $20 an hour for about 10 hours of work a week, which works out to about $800 a month (Well, slightly more).

The assistant's job? The client received orders through a variety of platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc) and many of the orders (But not all) were subscriptions. The assistant's role was to pull orders from all these websites and create a 'Daily Deliveries' entry in a spreadsheet listing out when a product needs to go out. They'd then create an associated entry in ShipStation (A very popular shipping tool).

So for example if somebody ordered a 9 month subscription through Shopify, they would first create 9 different entries in a spreadsheet then create corresponding entries in ShipStation.

They'd also spend time inputting other info into the 'Master Spreadsheet'
___
So that's what they were spending $800 a month on. Now, how do you automate this? There's a bunch of components here:

1. Pulling data from Amazon, Shopify etc
2. Splitting subscriptions into individual shipments
3. Creating a daily list of shipments that need to go out
4. Sending that info to ShipStation

Okay! Four steps. Can we automate it? Yes! Luckily ShipStation provides us an easy to use API ( [What is an API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)) but Amazon obviously doesn't (For our purposes that is). But we can still create software that automatically pulls data from Amazon's orders page

Using a combination of Node.JS, The Google Sheets API and the Protractor Framework and at a cost of about $600, i was able to automate it
___
But that's just the automation, you've heard it a billion times, yada yada yadda, automation beats manual labor. The future is automation, bla bla bla. What's the point of this post? Well, here's the thing. For $800 a week, you got the basics done. But I'm yet to describe the real power of spreadsheets.

I was also able to design a spreadsheet for the client that purely using existing formulas, was able to give them an exact overview of each day, week, month and year.

For $800 a month with an assistant, you didn't get that data. You'd have to pay extra to get that data since it'd take them hours of effort. But with a spreadsheet that takes nanoseconds to compute that data, you get it for free.

And in the future, data is king. The more data you have on your business, the better you can forecast the future.

422,bkt1g1,False,Young Entrepreneur,197,Harsh Truth About Young Entrepreneurship,Entrepreneur,"Something you'll notice is that the vast majority of self made young entrepreneurs who struck it big before 30 were doing some sort of online/low barrier of entry business. This is why everyone talks about eccommerce, copywriting, digital marketing, dropshipping..... And then bragging about $40k monthly revenue selling colorful socks online. It's much easier to scale.

Most real life businesses require significant financial capital plus industry knowledge and experience that a young man could not easily obtain unless he were born into it. Take manufacturing for example. A 21 year old out of college does not stand a chance compared to a 40 year old with years of experience/credibility and an established network. Ask yourself which one you trust more? Which of these two would you invest in?

**It's a catch 22. We aspire to get rich as young as possible so that we can enjoy that wealth for the rest of our lives. But without industry expertise and significant startup capital, we're stuck with dropshipping or selling t-shirts. Yet if you spend a decade working in an industry, you will see massive loopholes that the average 20 year old guy cannot.**

It's a complete myth that the average startup owner is a 20 year old dude. That is a tech stereotype. You only hear about these 20 year old's because of how rare they are. Which is why they get so much publicity. The average 30/40 something year old is much more confident, mature, experienced and financially grounded than the average 20 year old.

Your social background is also important. Your average Joe from Akron, Ohio has access to significantly less opportunity than Tony from Long Island who attends a top school and his parents are wealthy and have a strong network. Therefore he is going to have to pull himself entirely from his bootstraps. Whereas Tony is given the option between working at the investment bank that his uncle manages or being 100% financially supported by his family while he builds his startup.

Everyone sees the Kardashians and Dan Bilzerian living these crazy lives. Nobody bothers to mention that their fathers worked themselves into death and prison so that their children could have amazing lives that seem impossible for the average man to even fathom. Gurus like Grant Cardone won't tell the young men that watch his content every detail. He didn't start seeing the fruits of his labor until his 30's. And it took him a lot longer than 30 to become a private jet rich.

**I'm not saying any of this to persuade you into quitting.** I myself am a struggling entrepreneur who has been knocked in the head a couple of times so take my words for what they are. Back when I was 18 I was always so hyped about getting rich and dating models and having a fancy car. Then when I started to get more life experience I realized that if I was going to make it I was going to have to be a lot more humble. It could take a lot longer than I anticipated.

If you're struggling, don't focus too much on the 0.0000001% of 23 year olds with 8 figure eCommerce stores. Not only is it bad for your self esteem. But those guys are also exceptionally rare, and either very talented or very well connected. You will probably never even meet those guys outside of the internet.

For guys out there like me, we just got to do the best with what we have. Maybe you didn't hit one million dollars by 30. SO WHAT. You could still have 50+ years of life left. Most male hollywood actors' careers don't take off until 30's. If it takes me until my 40's, 50's, or EVEN 60's to make it, that doesn't mean I can't have an amazing life with what time I have left. And if I never make it big at least I can die knowing I gave it a shot.

This is the end of my rant about entrepreneurship. I feel like aspiring entrepreneurs do a good job of talking about the positive sides of entrepreneurship. But there needs to be more discussion about the sacrifices and harsh truths that come along with entrepreneurship. It's a lonely road out there. I remember all those times my friends were out partying and I blew them off to work. They thought I was crazy and they were probably right.

628,6nsx69,False,,122,Two months ago I posted about hitting my first of three business goals after quitting my job to go full-time on a business. I completed the second goal a month early: 100 paying customers.,Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit (and my fellow entrepreneurs),

Two months ago I submitted a [Reddit post detailing my journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6c3t83/two_months_ago_i_lost_my_job_instead_of_getting/) from leaving a cushy corporate job and starting a business.

Directly after leaving, I worked out three business goals with my wife that I had to hit, or I would have to go back and find a job. The goals are:

1. One sale within the first two months (which I hit on the very last day)
2. 100 paying customers by August 13th
3. Grow at 10% per month for six months

Today I am proud to say that **I accomplished the second goal a month early**. 

**What has changed since then?**

Quite a bit!

Most of the great feedback from the prior post pointed out how broad my original business idea was. Visitors would come to the site and not have a clue where to start. 

The prior website slogan was ""Automation and Spreadsheet Vault for Entrepreneurs."" Automation for what? My morning routine? What kind of spreadsheets? What does vault mean?

*And they were absolutely right.*

Around the same time, the digital currency market and blockchain were absolutely exploding. I saw it as an opportunity to not only get much more targeted, but to enter a space that was hot (and I believe to be on an unstoppable path.)

**The Pivot**

After doing some rigorous keyword research, I saw that a large portion of blockchain related terms were getting huge amounts of traffic, but the competition was less than stellar. I took this as an opportunity to take a great portion of my current skillset (finance, trading, analysis) and create something very valuable for people interested in digital currency and blockchain. At the same time, I became crystal clear on my message and vision, and it goes like this:

""For investors and developers in digital currency and blockchain, who are dissatisfied with unreliable, messy data, [Spreadstreet](https://spreadstreet.io) is a data-delivery service that provides dependable, documented data sets with multiple avenues of delivery (such as Excel, and web download). Unlike existing options, we plan to focus on expanding our delivery options, and providing an affordable foundation for developers looking to build blockchain apps, or investors looking to build analysis models.""

**How has initial traction been?**

So far, the website has had the following:

- ~17k pageviews, ~5k unique sessions
- 612 registered users
- 102 paid users (yay!)

While not a huge amount, it feels good that it is finally gaining some traction.

**What has the initial feedback been?**

The most important thing in business is to listen to your customers. I have implemented Intercom again, as I believe the chat function is extremely well done. It has provided an avenue to talk to customers, and I have been happy with the results so far.

I also created a user onboarding survey that has a 69% completion rate, with the first question garnering 100%. That feedback is very valuable as far as modifying the website to fit exactly what our users are asking for. The following has been some great feedback from users:

- Current datasets are lacking (had to start somewhere!)
- Users are extremely hesitant to install an Excel plugin, as the Cryptocurrency space seems to be ripe with scammers. My goal is to ease that concern as much as possible, and one of those avenues is through our (currently in development) API and a Google Sheets plugin
- Current datasets could use more customization (such as date ranges)

After hearing all of this great feedback, answering customers, working on product development, marketing, finance, accounting, I realized something very important...

**What's next?**

A one-and-a-half man operation (one part-time developer) is not enough. I will be seeking the following help:

- Technical Co-Founder/CTO
- Web Designer/UX Expert

And since I need this help, I recently finished a pitch deck to present to investors. So far I have received a few initial offers (that were honestly terrible), and am extremely excited for what the future holds.

These individuals will be instrumental in getting Spreadstreet to my ultimate vision.

**Products I currently use (not affiliated with any of the listed products)**

Last time I gave a run-down of products I currently use, and here is an update:

- **Wordpress**: Site is still on Wordpress, and I expect it to be there at least in the short-term. However our API is currently being developed on a Node.js server. In the future I fully expect a custom built solution, but for now it serves it's purpose
- **Divi Theme**: Still awesome, I would recommend to ANYONE using a Wordpress site. It could not be easier to use for non-technical people
- **Vultr and Microsoft Azure**: Vultr houses the Wordpress site, Azure has been selected as our option for the API to handle scaling needs. We will be using a Node.js/Blob Storage/PostgreSQL stack. 
- **Canva**: Awesome for coming up with graphics for anything you can think of. $13 per month
- **Namecheap**: Where I purchased the domain name. Negligible cost, not worth noting. If you go with a less used TLD (such as .club instead of .com) it comes out to $0.88 a YEAR
- **Cloudflare**: Great for speeding up websites, however the current website is pretty light load so this may be overkill…but it’s free
- **Blockspring**: Awesome Excel/Google Sheets add-in that makes calling APIs extremely easy.
- **Zapier**: Automation tool. $20 per month. Currently used to fill up my…
- **Buffer**. Scheduling tool for social media profiles. $10 per month
- **Upwork**: I have one developer on staff who I sourced from Upwork. She is amazing, and has been extremely helpful in initial development I was unable to do. Ranges from $200 to $400 per month. I do not have the link at the moment, but someone on this subreddit had a great write-up on sourcing talent from Upwork
- **Data feed**: I anticipate this to be one of the most expensive pieces of the business going forward, depending upon the landscape. Certain companies will want to offer their current data for sale, so licensing and agreements will be a part of the model going forward. 
- **Intercom**: Last post I noted how I stopped using it due to cost. I came back to it. The product is just too damn good, even though I still do not agree with the pricing. But alas, here I am. Talking with customers is so damn important, and they have the best product on the market.

**New Skills Gained**

I continue to accumulate new skills every day, so this acts as a great buffer in case I am forced to go back to work at some time in the future. 

- I now have an intermediate understanding of how the funding world works. Extremely interesting and exciting
- Beginner PHP, although I stopped this as it seems to be quite hated within the developer community (not entirely sure why...) and because my time must be spent elsewhere
- Basic UX - my website was honestly a mess two months ago. It is still not great, but much much better than what it used to be (doing such things as making sure the content is above the fold on multiple devices, creating a user onboarding experience, etc.)
- Blockspring
- Zapier marketing automation
- My technology lingo is a bit better
- Differences between types of databases, such as document storage, key-value, relational, etc.
- Best practices for API development. While I am not creating it myself, I need to know what I am talking about so my developer knows what to build

**Don't be shy, say hi!**

I will end this here as it is getting to be a bit long, but I love meeting new or current entrepreneurs. Please send me a message, I would love to get to know you. I am located in the DC/Baltimore area, and in-person meetings are even better.

(Read time: ~15 minutes).  
  
Grab a cup of coffee and get comfy!  I’ll get right to it. 
 
 
**THE INNER WORKINGS OF A SUBSCRIPTION BOX COMPANY.**
 
So about 6 months ago, I came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zn089/i_am_looking_for_some_advice_on_selling_a_website/) from a guy looking to sell a website he owned: 
 
I contacted him and found out that it was [wetshaveclub.com](http://www.wetshaveclub.com/), a wet shaving subscription box. I felt like I could make it work given the fact that dollar shave club had proven out the model. “Ok, Let’s do it!”  This was the extent of my analysis on this. The site owner sent me a screenshot of his revenue, I offered about 15X his monthly profits, and we wrapped everything up that same weekend.  We skipped the usual back and forth dance people go through when they’re buying websites.  I sent over the money, he sent over the passwords, and that was that.
 
I reached out to redditor u/kaster who I had been talking to on skype for some time. He had read [my original series of posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/), followed it to launch and grow a local business to 40k/month, sold it, and spent a few months in Costa Rica on vacation. We had never met, but I felt like he would be the perfect person to work on this with me.  This is a guy that does not play around when an opportunity presents itself.  Case in point: A few weeks later he was in his car for a 5-day drive from California to the east coast so we could work on this. ([Kevin’s Facebook post as he was hitting the road](http://imgur.com/rMYvzJU)).
 
Ok, so here’s what we did to get moving:
   
**Step 1: Website Rebranding**  
The original website needed some work and we set out to change the look and feel of it.  Design is critical, and even more so with a consumer product where emotion is a large component of the buying decision.  [Click to see of our branding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/HZJqP)
 
**Step 2: Expanding the Product line and raising prices**  
So the original service only delivered soaps and at a price of $12 per month.  We felt that we had to double that price to make this worthwhile.  In order to do this we had to expand the product line and provide more value.  [Click to see how we expanded our product line.](http://imgur.com/a/CBzSZ)
 
**Step 3: Box Rebranding**  
Since we were now shipping more products (and we had rebranded the site), the next effort was to find a box that worked.  We called around to different box suppliers and had them send us samples.  We settled on Salazar packaging.  We sent them our box design and they got on it.  [Click to see our box rebranding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/sR1mN)
 
**Step 4: Increasing prices and adding annual option**    
Everything so far took us about 2 months of balls-to-the-wall work, but things were starting to shape up.  We were then able to increase prices to $29 for the monthly box instead of $12.  We also added an annual version at a reduced monthly rate to see if people would prepay for an entire year.  And they did.  [Click to see our new pricing options](http://imgur.com/Q7Lwyit).
 
**Step 5: Marketing**  
So with our conversion rates up, and our box at a higher price point we were able to unleash the hounds.  You’ll see that most of what we do is completely free marketing mixed in with a few paid sources.  [Click to see how we drive traffic.](http://imgur.com/a/CUDIH)
 
**Step 6: Ordering, Warehouse and Shipping**  
So with the results of our efforts, we needed space.  We were shipping from our living room and while I had a small office, there was no way we could do it from there any longer.  So we found an office/warehouse, moved in 10 days later and got everything set up.  [Click to peep the warehouse](http://imgur.com/a/Gf3LP).
 
**Bonus**: [Our new office](http://imgur.com/a/ojqCT).
 

So the result of all this work:
We’re going to hit $100K in revenue in the next 30 days, and just passed $78K ([Obligatory screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/PBmXMxs.png)).  We did $22K last month ([Cratejoy screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FDhitpp.png))-They have pretty awesome analytics btw, and we’re on pace to do $35K in September.  We think we can hit our first $100K month in 6-12 months and join the ranks of /u/bandholz from beardbrand.com. Dude knows his stuff and I respect how much he shares with the community.  In some ways I think we’re cut from the same cloth, he’s just smarter and better looking!  
 
What Comes Next:  We’re launching an accompanying ecommerce store.  This way, when folks find products that they like in the box, they can order more of them.  In addition, we can expand the product line a bit to include additional grooming products and other men’s accessories. [Click for a sneak peak of the upcoming store](http://imgur.com/a/J4kpq).
 
**TAKEAWAYS FROM ALL OF THIS!**
 
This is hard work and we made a lot of mistakes and will continue to make more.  We’re working every day on providing a better customer experience and trying to improve the product line.  We went into this not knowing a thing about selling and shipping products, logistics, inventory, warehousing, or even wet shaving for that matter.  But we live in the information age.  Anything under the sun can be figured out if you’re resourceful enough and willing to bust your ass until you make yourself an expert in that thing.  We’re not well connected, nor do we access to a gazillion dollars in VC funding.  We just work.  Hard. And we’re just getting started.
 
**The companies that made this happen:** 
 
Cratejoy.com for our subscription box web platform.  (Awesome service and Amir rocks!)  
Salazarpackaging.com for our box (Great to work with)  
Sonicprint.com for our inserts (Karen is the bomb)  
99designs.com for our design work (I wish I owned this company)  
Uline.com for our warehouse shelving and box fill (Their delivery speed is insane)  
Shipstation.com: (Integrates with cratejoy to handle our shipping. This gives us life!!)  
Endicia.com: (Integrates with Shipstation so we just print labels from our computer. The truth!)  
Stripe.com: Payment processor (You already know)  
Perfectaudience.com: Re-targeting (Works. Well! ROI positive and helps with branding too)  
Kabbage.com: $15,000 Line of credit (Surprisingly smooth experience)  
Gleam.io: Contests (Super awesome set up and easy to add virality to your contests through sharing)  
TeamBeachBody.com: (haha, we do insanity every morning before work! Thanks Sean T)

If you’ve made it this far, props.  

**This is where the case study ends!**
******
 
  
But if you’re interested in taking a look at the mindset that has gotten us to this point, read on.
 
Launching something:  
I read almost every front-page thread on r/entrepreneur and have done so for the past 2 years, so I know a lot of folks are stuck right now with coming up with something to launch.  Here’s what I would do if I wanted to start a new business today and had no idea what to do next:
 
1) Check your bank account for something you’ve spent money on in the last 12 months. Bonus points if it’s a recurring service of some sort (Your customer lifetime value is instantly boosted, and you can thrive even with a high customer acquisition cost).   Either way, you know it’s something that people already spend money on.  This simple rule eliminates fantasy ideas: “If I get enough members I’ll figure out how to monetize it later.”  Later never comes, so ideas like these don’t get a minute of my time.  **The only things I work on are things where I can make money starting on DAY ONE!**  
  
2)Narrow down the list to things where a lot of people are making money in that industry.  Competition is good.  I know, this goes against everything you’ve learned somewhere.  But the more **thriving** competition you find, the more money is being made, and the larger the market.  Join the party, throw your hat in the ring, and be at least as smart as somebody there.  **Most people search for a great idea with no competition without realizing that this makes it almost impossible to start something.**  
  
3) Narrow things further to something that can be delivered with a simple but well designed website that cost no more than a month’s salary.  If it’s a product, you’ll then have to find someone that will let you re-sell his or her product.  If it’s a service, you simply have to find someone that already provides that service.  In both cases (product or service) you’re just re-selling something, and with a well-designed website, you’ll double your chances that your supplier will feel comfortable enough to let you resell their thing.  Yes, good design is important for both your customers and your suppliers!  **Don't launch with bad design!!! MVP or not!**   
   
4) When you get that “Yes” from a supplier, make sure you set things up so that you’re not in the customer’s way.   Make things as easy as possible for them to do business with you.  Seriously, remove all hoops.  **They should be able to do business with you as easily as they do business with Amazon.**  If you don’t need that extra field on the form, get rid of that shit.  As easy as humanly possible! 
   
5) Market your thing until you pass out.  If your thing is something that really speaks to a person’s identity like grooming, fashion, makeup, fitness, etc. [you can kill on social media](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/steal-your-competitions-followers/) (twitter, instagram, Facebook, YouTube).  If your thing is more detached from a person’s identity like say a car wash or home cleaning, your best conversions will come through search (adwords, seo, yelp).  
******  
**A few additional thoughts:**  
I think that a lot of “startup best practices” work well for people that have access to funding.  For the rest of us, some of the generally accepted ideas end up pushing folks further away from launching something.  Consider:
 
**Validation:** Validation in my opinion is for fantasy ideas.  If you stay away from having to come up with an awesome idea, you won’t need validation in the first place. There are plenty of things you can do that other companies have already validated for you.  And when you find that thing, stop worrying about competition.  **Competition IS the validation.**  
 
**Competition:** Stop measuring this by quantity.  One of the first things you’ll hear is “the market is oversaturated”!  This is meaningless, yet this single phrase has stopped more potential entrepreneurs in their tracks than…well I honestly can’t think of anything that beats this.  Start looking at the quality of the competition instead, and you’ll often find that the market is saturated with a LOT of bad players, and they’re making a LOT of money despite being so bad.** This is the perfect situation.   
 
**Business plans:** This often ends up being a way to push action further down the road.  If It’s longer than one page you’re wasting your time.  [Download something like this](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf), fill that bad boy out, and get to work.
 
**LLC/incorporation:** Unless the company can pay for it, it’s not happening.  So this only happens AFTER the company is making money.  One more excuse...GONE!
 
**Business Analysis:** Demographic data, market analysis, the economic outlook... blah blah blah. More ways to kick the can down the road and to feel that you’re doing something when you’re really not.  I just get to work. If a lot of people are making money doing this thing, the startup cost is low, and there is no sorcery involved, it can be done!
 
**Fear of your idea being stolen:** Ideas hold little intrinsic value without execution. However, you can start to extract value when you get feedback on it, massaging it, push and poke it, and really run it through the wringer.  And the only way to do this is to tell people about it.  This goes against our most basic instincts because we’re fearful that our ideas might be stolen.  Well the reality is, most people are sitting on the bench with a gazillion ideas of their own that they are not executing on.  You just added one more to that list.  Either way, if an idea cannot survive competition it’s probably not that good in the first place.  In addition, what happens when you launch?  You can’t run a business without telling anybody about it.   You’ll often get this response, “ But I’ll lose my first-mover’s advantage?”. Well good.  I would never want to be the first mover anyhow.  First movers bare a tremendous cost in educating customers.  Most of us don’t have the money to bare that cost.  The folks that are second and onwards, can just slide in and benefit from all of that work.  For example, I don’t have to explain the concept of a subscription box service sending you shaving equipment every month.  Most people already know what this is, thanks to Dollar Shave Club.  Bottom line: Try to get over this stuff.
 
**Find something you’re passionate about:**  Nah son.  Find something that is viable.  I’m passionate about table tennis, but I’m not looking to turn that passion into a business.  When it comes to business, I’m far more passionate about providing a good product/service that has good margins, than about being able to marry that business to any hobby or other exciting pursuit I may have in my regular life.   This way, I’m free to work on the best opportunity that arises without limitation.  And honestly, quite often the least sexy industries are where the big money is being made.  So while most of the brainpower is busy chasing sexy mobile apps and such, you can make bank by selling ugly widgets or providing basic services.  It’s tough to pay bills with app downloads.
 
**A note to Engineers and consultants:** Resist the urge to complicate things.  For technical folks, it seems like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming.  So a problem like “find people that need lawn service and connect them with people that provide lawn service” becomes, “well how about we use Zillow’s APi to pull a picture of the lawn, and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the area to be serviced and we tie that into Google maps and feed everything into a pricing algorithm”.... and on and on.  Unfortunately, many of these guys do not make it.  More often than not simplicity wins.  Get out of the customer’s way.
 
**Start something small to get practice:**  You don’t get good at running marathons by reading about running marathons.  And you don’t get good at business by reading about business.  You get good by doing. And doing it over and over again.  But just like you wouldn’t expect to win the first marathon you entered, why put so much pressure on yourself to win at the first company you start?   Or worse yet, paralyze yourself with fear into never running at all because you’re afraid you won’t win? It doesn’t make sense with marathons and it doesn’t make sense with business.  So while a lot of folks over-analyze every minutia about the thing, people like Kevin and me would have already downloaded a training regiment, bought a pair of shoes, and hit the bricks.
 
**What if I fail?** Nothing happens!  It’s literally the most mundane non-event imaginable.  I spend a day or two wrapping up any loose ends, head to the movies or do something fun, and by the next day I’m already figuring out what the next thing is.  My personal experience hasn’t been “Try->Win”, it has been more like “try, fail, try, fail, try, fail, try, fail win, win, win, win.”   With each failure you get better, and then things just start to come easy.  Don’t be afraid of failing, it’s like the best and cheapest MBA you’ll ever get.  
 
**Naysayers:** If you’re doing something...I mean anything, you’ll meet them.  Whether it’s in real life, on the Internet, or wherever else.  Sometimes it’s even your friends and family.  I keep an imgur album of the best ones I come across.   Sometimes for a little motivation, and sometimes just to look back and smile.    For example, recently I mentioned in passing that my next big project will be a restaurant, and I already have a list of comment screenshots explaining why I won’t succeed.  :-)
 
Here’s [one of my favorite ones](http://i.imgur.com/UNNyS0F.png) from a few years back when I was making $4k per month, from what was a new company at the time.  This was the top comment on Hacker News.
 
That little company now pays me a 6 figure salary.  What intrigued me about this comment was the fact that it was so thoughtfully written.  This wasn’t a troll.  This was someone that provided a seemingly well-reasoned analysis of where he thought I would be in 12 months, complete with business school type analysis: barriers to entry, competitive landscape, etc.   
 
So why is this important?  Because **this is exactly what many of us do to ourselves.**
 
We have a naysayer living permanently inside our heads that is constantly appraising and analyzing every business idea we entertain.  And the analysis sounds just as reasoned, and well thought-out and measured as the one I posted above.  Not a bad thing on its face, but **the guy in our head typically skews negative.** Shut that dude up! Or you’ll analyze and over think and what-if every single idea until you convince yourself it won’t work.  Over time this messes with your confidence, and you end up paralyzed.  Say what you want about the guy, but Kanye was right about this: [Most people are held back by their perception of themselves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3X4r-eCYQ&t=6m59s)  It’s a brutal feedback loop.
 
At some point we have to just say “Fuck It” and get to work!

387,cty4xu,False,,78,Just taking a few minutes to write down your goals for the day can be a huge boost to productivity,Entrepreneur,"I'm not a big planner. I don't meticulously block out on my time on apps and daily planners, and I only use my calendar app for a few important events and appointments. Planning your day is a useful habit, but for those of us who don't have the discipline or desire to plan out our lives in detail, just taking a minute or two to jot down a few tasks you want to accomplish for the day can make all the difference in the world. For those of us who set our own schedules and have to be our own boss, some of us all too often let a day slip by without getting much work done. We know what needs to get done, but we just put it off for tomorrow. 

Something about simply writing down your goals for the day has a huge psychological effect on whether or not you actually do them. At any given time we might have 20 things we need to do, and we can't get to all of them in one day. At the beginning of the day pick just a handful of those 20 tasks that you think could reasonably be accomplished that day. The order and the exact time allotted to each task doesn't matter so much as the fact that you actually write them down. All of this might take no longer than a minute or two, but at the end of the day you most likely will have accomplished much more than you would have if you had no written plan at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cty4xu/just_taking_a_few_minutes_to_write_down_your/,674,I started planning the most important tasks for the next day morning the night before.

Two years ago, I posted about our move into much larger location - https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2yz1b6/i_got_60_days_to_turn_my_local_business_around/ 

When we signed the lease, we knew we were taking a huge risk. It was like betting your life's saving on black in roulette. The space was in reality way too big for us at the time, and wasn't something we should have took. 

**Today, we are generating roughly $65,000/mo** in revenue, we our eyes on sight of the magical $83.3k ($1m/yr). We have grown the spa more than 10x since the day we bought it. It hasn't been the easiest journey, to say the least.  

That image where they show you what a real entrepreneur's life is like? Yeah, it's true. We have grown, stumbled, fell flat on our face, stood back up. 

The worst of this was in May of 2016, we walked into our spa under 6"" of water. A 1"" line broke in the middle of the night, and left our entire spa flooded. The damages were so bad that we literally had to close our business for 3 weeks to ""remodel"". 

On top of all of that, we were just exiting the season. Typically you want to have a great May to sustain your June/July. Yeah, that wasn't happening.

Yet, we fought back, and continued to grow. 

##My 3 Biggest Keys to Success

###Inspect Everything.
Don't ever assume anything. If you aren't growing your business the way you want to, inspect the full process. Turn over every detail. Secret shop yourself. Sometimes, there are things that you are missing. 

In September, I was looking at our numbers and was kind of bummed out we haven't grown much year over year. I knew that we should have, but something wasn't right. I looked at our schedules, we seemed to be filling up nicely. We seemed to have plenty of appointments on the books. Our room utilization was a bit low though. 

I had our front desk start tracking how many appointments we were rejecting, and why. 

It turns out that I was understaffed. I had assumed we were running perfectly. I had assume that we were only rejecting maybe 1-2 appointments per day. Turns out that we were rejecting 4-6 appointments on a weekday and 8-10 on a weekend day. 

This is a huge KPI for us to monitor now.

###The Emyth is Right -- Create Processes so you can work ON your business, not IN your business.

In October of 2015, my grandfather passed away in Poland. I had to go over there to take care of his things. I had a small irrational temporary fear of flying at the time because of the last flight I took, I had a huge anxiety attack. My wife asked me if she should go with. 

At this time in my business life, our day spa's doors were never open unless we were there. We were approaching our season, and no way we were going to close for a week. So in 5 business days, we trained two of our staff members to handle the front desk + operations for a week. 

Since that day, we have started creating processes for everything. Everytime an issue arises, we write up a protocol on how we would handle it. Occasionally, we will throw out random ""homework"" to the staff to see how they would handle the situation.

Just last week, we had a major sewage backup into the spa. We had to close the spa for the day to clean up the waste from the floors (thank god it was all on tile). The very next thing we did once the issue was rectified, we typed up a ""memo"" on how to handle such a situation. Each time we type one of these documents up, we share it will all the staff and put it into a Binder.

The other huge side benefit of this is that when you have processes, inspecting your progress is much easier. It's also much easier to train & hire, as well as explaining the expectations.


###Lean Startup's Philosophy - Pivot Fast & Often.
Every single month, I try to change some part of our spa in an effort to increase revenue. We make assumptions on what should improve and how, and we test it. 

For example, we built a relatively well known promotion for two hours at the spa for just $99. It was and still is the staple of our business. Saturdays & Sundays are our busiest days. They tend to fill up rapidly. 

Somewhere in November, we realized that we were filling up way too quickly on those days, and we were leaving much to be desired in the middle of the week. So we came up with a pivot -- $119  for Sat/Sun, $99 Mon-Fri. 

Turns out, that the higher price was still more than acceptable. From November, we have tested different pricing each month and slowly have increased our average service hour from $52 to $57. 

You should be able to test any part of your business to see if there is an improvement.

# 5 Lessons from 2 Failed Startups

7years ago, on my last year in university, I unwittingly embarked on a startup journey. Here are the five most important lessons that I picked up the hard way.

*(comic 1)*

The main reason I wrote this piece is so that I don’t repeat the mistakes I list below, but I’m publishing it in hopes that my experience will have a positive externality — that someone out there will internalize these lessons without paying the cost of money, time, and tears.

    FIRST STARTUP
    What it was: the first premium educational platform for a popular competitive video game (Dota 2);
    My role: main content guy — I wrote most of the content and worked directly with our influencer partners, but with time got more and more involved;
    Timeline: created platform and developed content; launched successfully and found decent traction; slowly faded into obscurity due to lack of sufficient funding;

# LESSON 1: Be prepared for different levels of success

Naturally, when we started the project we had great expectations for its future financial performance. We also kept in mind that it could crash and burn, as we knew most innovative products fail.

The two options in our heads were either:

1. great success — the business supports itself just fine and grows
2. or total failure — we close down and search for “real” jobs.

What we failed to anticipate is the vast land in between those two extremes. That’s where we ended up. When we launched we started making enough money to indicate we are onto something, but not enough to fully support and grow the business.

*(comic 2)*

When you hear something along the line of “90% of startups fail”, you imagine that 10% of startups hit the jackpot while the other 90% lose their money and close their doors instantly. However, **this statement lacks a time dimension and a grayscale between the whiteness of success and the blackness of failure. It could be useful to investors, but it** **is misleading if you are a founder.**

I’m sure some startups lose their money very fast and are left with no choice but to close operations. Yet, I’d wager a big chunk of the unsuccessful 90% spend a long time trying to navigate mixed signals from the market. The problem is that in such conditions decision-making is not straightforward. Are you wasting your time, or are you on the brink of something worthwhile? Not an easy call to make.

When faced with such decisions, pessimists quit too early, while optimists tend to believe success is just behind the corner perpetually. Both mindsets are wrong.

If you quit too early, you are cutting short the chances that you’ll hit a lucky breakthrough.

But if you fight for too long, it could get you stuck in a terrible limbo people in the startup community call *“the land of the living dead”*. You make ends meet, barely, but in reality, you are just wasting your time, potential, and **testing the patience of all the people with a stake in your success or failure** (people in both your personal and professional life). A business is, generally speaking, not a worthy cause for martyrdom.

In our case, we ended up in the second option. We had over-promised so our investors and business partners were unhappy with the performance, yet we were not ready to give up yet because we still saw a lot of potential.

At the same time, without the full support of the inventors and partners, we had no chances to succeed. We spend over a year in this state. You need to be realistic about these things, and in startups, the business of selling dreams, this is harder than it sounds.

**Plan for success, plan for failure, plan for everything in between.**

Retrospectively, what we had was a successful proof of concept which required further funding to grow and become a real business. Our failure to anticipate this outcome meant that neither we nor our partners or investors were prepared, which spelled the slow and agonizing death of the project.

**If you’re a founder,** **you need to be granular in defining success and failure**. You need to have a timeline everyone agrees upon (not only the founders but all stakeholders) and a definition of different levels of success so that nobody quits too early or leads a lost war for too long.

    For example:
    
    Great outcome: X months after launch, we’re making enough money to support the business. We agree to reinvest and grow it slowly to avoid dilution (lifestyle business route) or to fundraise to grow fast and search for an exit (startup route).
    
    Good outcome: X months after launch, we’re making money, but not enough to support the business. This is expected — proof of concept. We’re in the process of fundraising. If we succeed to fundraise until month Y (money runs out) — great. If not — we close the business.
    
    Bad outcome: X months after launch we’re making very little (if any) money. We pivot if we still have resources, if not — we close the business.

# LESSON 2: Find a mentor

The three main components people talk about when evaluating startups are usually the **team**, the **product**, and the **market**.

It’s hard to argue if any of the three is more important than the others. Usually, you need all three to be good enough to reach success.

In our case, we were lucky enough to have a favorable market — demand for what we were offering and lack of any real competition.

The product was so-so: it could have been much, much better considering our lack of experience & resources, but it was good enough to attract the early adopters and with time it could have evolved.

**The team, however, had 0 experience.**

We did this straight out of university (I worked on the project part-time until I finished my masters). The founder was the technical guy and he was a junior developer at best. I was the content marketing guy and even though I had some marketing courses in uni (which mostly focus on traditional, big businesses), I had 0 real-world experience.

**Our lack of technical/marketing experience** **proved not to be fatal** — we were learning on the go and managed to push out a working product and to reach our customers. We had vision, passion, some domain knowledge, and the willingness to work hard.

What was fatal, however, was that we had 0 experience running a business. Honestly, we had close to no knowledge about startups and what to expect of these kinds of projects. **Doing the actual work takes thousands of hours, and** **the minutes spent making a bad decision can easily invalidate all your efforts.**

If present-day-me could advise and mentor this startup, I’m certain it would have become a successful business.

*(comic 3)*

**If you are a young entrepreneur, you need a mentor.** An official one, with a small share in the business in order to have skin in the game. Ideally — an entrepreneur who has some startup experience behind his back or at least someone who has been deeply involved in such businesses. Turn to your local startup community and it won’t be that hard finding someone interested: after all, most people like giving advice as well as getting free shares in companies.

*\[If you don’t have an official mentor, at least make sure you’re getting mentorship from other places intimately familiar with your business (investors, startup groups or communities, etc.).\]*

Embarking on your first startup journey without a mentor is like trying to become an MBA star without ever having a basketball coach. Unless you are incredibly lucky, you will simply fail. You’ll make fatal mistakes like the one above (and many more I can list, but it would take forever). Frankly, even nowadays, being much more experienced, I doubt I’ll ever work on anything innovative without a mentor.

    SECOND STARTUP
    What it is was: a monetization platform for video game influencers and content creators in the same niche
    My role in it: founder
    Timeline: fundraised (a bit more ambitiously this time, $90k); created platform and developed content; launched and found 0 traction; turned the website into a profitable gaming blog for a year; tried to pivot in the meantime, unsuccessfully;

# LESSON 3: Market expertise doesn’t trump startup common sense

As you’ve probably noticed, startup one and startup two are connected. What happened is that the founder of startup one finally had enough and bailed. I still had a chip on my shoulder, however, and managed to convince one of the old investors (and a few new ones) that there is merit in having another go at the market with a new (more ambitious) concept. Naturally, things didn’t turn out as planned.

>**“Fail fast, fail cheap, and leave yourself time to pivot.”**

That’s probably the most frequently repeated startup advice. And probably the most valuable one you can get. The one that you need tattooed on your forehead if you’re a founder.

So, even though I was aware that the biggest startup mistake is to spend all your resources developing something no one needs, I made exactly that mistake. **Like many a startup, I burned through 90% of our bank to acquire the validated learning that there’s no demand for the product we’re making.**

What led me astray was the belief that I was an expert on this particular market niche and knew intimately its needs.

*(comic 4)*

The confidence I had, obviously, was false.

What’s true is that the previous startup validated that the market actually exists, which is a good start.

What’s not true is that the previous startup validated in any meaningful way the new product we’re developing. We had a new concept, a new marketing approach, etc. Equally importantly, the market had changed since the first project — competition was starting to pop up, etc. I was probably one of a handful of people on the planet intimately familiar with this small market niche, and yet my ideas weren’t bulletproof anyway.

After we launched and saw 0 traction, I tried to pivot with a new idea based on the market feedback. The problem was that I had to validate it on my own with no budget and no team. I couldn’t do it properly, and I still don’t know to this day if this idea would have worked out if I had more resources to test it.

Looking back, if I had focused on being an expert on running a startup as much as I did on being an expert on the market, things could have turned out quite differently. I could have tested the waters for plan A with 20% of the budget. That would have left me with enough resources to try out at least three more different approaches. We were working from Eastern Europe (Sofia, Bulgaria) and mainly with freelancers, which meant that our burn rate was quite low.

Failing fast and cheap would have made the company four or five times more likely to succeed. I suspect that this number is even higher because the accumulated expertise by smashing your head into the wall (market) repeatedly means that plan B is usually better than plan A, plan C would probably be better than plan B, and so on.

**Every startup needs to be lean** (test your assumptions with minimal resource investment) **and agile** (be ready to continually change your concept/priorities base on market feedback)**. This is simply not negotiable if you want to succeed no matter how much of an expert you believe yourself to be.**

>*“Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don’t assume when this happens that you’ve failed. That’s normal for startups. But don’t sit around doing nothing. Iterate.” — Paul Graham*

# LESSON 4: Don’t regret correct decisions that didn’t turn out your way

After launching and finding 0 traction with almost no money left in the bank the realization where things are headed hit me hard. I wasn’t ready for a second failure just yet, however, so I poured all my efforts into finding a source of income for the business to give us some breathing room.

Content marketing was my biggest strength, so I made a [content strategy](https://medium.com/@KyrilKotashev/how-i-grew-my-gaming-blog-from-0-to-500k-monthly-pageviews-in-6-months-72f97f32514) and started churning out articles. I managed to grow the traffic of the website significantly (reached 240k unique monthly visitors at its peak), and at the same time, I was doing cold outreach to any viable business that might want to advertise with us long-term.

*(Google Analytics Screenshot)*

I deliberately made some of the content well suited to advertise a certain type of business in our niche. Eventually, I managed to close a deal with such a business, which gave us just enough income to keep our head above water.

During this time, an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A new game closely related to the one I was writing about pupped up and started gaining popularity (Auto Chess, which later turned into Dota Underlords). I was in a great situation to start writing about it and to turn our website into the main authority site on the subject, and slowly but surely I managed to rank our website in the first place in Google SERPs for most relevant keywords.

*(SERP screenshot)*

The hope was that the game was going to continue to grow (and our traffic along with it). This, in turn, would allow me to land bigger advertising contracts, giving me the needed funds to bootstrap a team and continue the validation experiments related to this new market and our newly acquired audience (I was trying to get the business into a positive feedback loop).

Then this happened:

*(steam charts screenshot, player base falls)*

Dota Underlords (the game we attached ourselves to, our market) fell from over 200k to about 10k concurrent players. Naturally, as I had invested most of my time into Dota Underlords content, our traffic started falling as well, which invalidated the authority site plans and made new advertising sales much, much harder.

You could argue I should have diversified our content to avoid this situation, but the reality is that you have limited resources and you need to plan how to use them. The business was created as a startup, it had investors, which by definition demands at least some level of ambition. Surviving as a niche gaming blog wasn’t going to cut it for the people involved, so I decided to go all-in on the opportunity I saw.

It didn’t work out, but that’s OK. As mentioned, most startups fail. Sometimes they fail because of avoidable mistakes (as demonstrated above), but sometimes they fail because the educated bets they make don’t work out.

Making educated but risky bets is what startups do, so don’t regret the second kind of failure when the risk is anticipated.

# LESSON 5: Accept full responsibility

*(comic 5, this one's not that funny :( )*

It’s quite easy to blame the circumstances when you’re looking back at past failures. It’s a great way to protect your ego. Going back to my own journey as an example:

* **Startup environment**: access to mentorship, funding, and know-how would have been much better if I was located in Silicon Valley. Yet, I tried to play the game of startups in Eastern Europe. Paul Graham sometimes mentions the concept of the [Milanese Leonardo](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html). In two words — there is no such thing, all great 15th century painters come from Florence, not Milan. So where are the Milanese painters? The theory is that the environment in which you develop trumps any kind of talent and probably even hard work. *Maybe I’m a hardworking genius, but simply failed because of the unfavorable environment half-a-planet away from the Valley.*
* **Influencer partners:** our two key influencer partners for the 2nd startup project bailed just before we launched. *Surely they are to blame for the failure at launch, not me?*
* **Crisis in Ukraine:** speaking of partners, our main business partners for the first startup were a Ukrainian esports organization. Shortly after launch, the political crisis in Ukraine happened and naturally, they were unable to fulfill all of their promises related to our project (they had bigger problems of their own). *Surely we couldn’t have predicted geopolitical events while managing an esports startup?*

I could go on, we’re all masters at making excuses. However, **this is a fool’s game.** Analyzing your past circumstances is important, but only in the light of taking valuable lessons into the future. An excuse means you learned nothing from an important event.

All of the above seems like it’s something I don’t have control over, but I’d argue that’s not true.

* **Environment:** I didn’t want to move to SV, but there are other ways to solve this problem at least partially. E.g. I could have reached out to people to ask for remote mentorship. “We have funding, we’re building this product, we want mentorship (weekly/monthly Skype calls) and we’re ready to give you a small share in the company to commit.” That’s not a bad offer and a viable way to make a connection to the real startup world.
* **Partners:** I could have done a thousand things to keep them more interested or involved in the project to minimize the chance they’ll quit. Even that aside, I could have made sure we’re not as reliant just on those two and involved more partners in advance.
* **Crisis:** sure, I couldn’t have predicted the geopolitical events, but I could have prepared for potential problems with our partners (same point as above). If someone is so important for your business that you fail if they underperform, you better have some plan to mitigate this risk. As a startup founder, you constantly operate in a high-risk environment. It’s your job to protect the project against the most critical and most likely of those risks.

Past failures are a blessing — put them on your shoulders and they will make you stronger.

Future failures are the ones you want to avoid, and your past failures are the best tool for the job.

630,c7jfdc,False,Young Entrepreneur,236,Started my own company,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys - Matthew Walters here - founder of a new footwear startup called CODDI™ ([www.coddi.co](https://www.coddi.co)).

&#x200B;

Thought I'd share my 2-year story / some of my #'s with you guys. Happy to answer any questions as well - always here to help when I can!

&#x200B;

**Story:**

* I was a professional footwear designer for Under Armour for just under 5 years (2013-2017)
* I left in the summer of 2017 to start my own footwear company. The number 1 question I get is 'Why did you leave your dream job?'...and I always answer it the same way: I became comfortable. A lot of people strive for comfort. Comfort to me is my worst nightmare. I want something new each day. Something challenging. I know it sounds silly and/or cliche, but in a weird way I like when I fail. I always learn 10x more when I fail then when I succeed. I also love control. Under Armour was amazing, but it's a multi-billion dollar company...in any company of that size, you quickly learn how small of a fish you really are.
* While creating this company, money was (and still is!) very tight. In the course of 2 years I've held 3 jobs in addition to starting my own thing (freelance design jobs, creative agency work, tennis coach. I chose each of these jobs because A: I have skills in them and B: they allowed me to have super flexible hours.)
* In order to be efficient with my time, I altered my sleep schedule to 3am-10am sleep. This allowed me to work directly with my overseas factory for almost 100% of their workday. 
* After 1.5 years of developing the boot, I launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coddifootwear/codditm-boots-for-your-next-adventure) in January 2019 for 2 reasons: 1. footwear has really high mold costs...there's no way I could afford this myself and 2. the community that comes with launching on Kickstarter.
* After 30 days on Kickstarter, I was successfully funded with over 61K
* This summer (2019), the entire shipment made it to my parents house [(aka the warehouse haha)](https://imgur.com/a/lIpKcyQ)
* One by one my parents, wife and I fulfilled each and every order. Every box came with a handwritten note, a sticker, and of course the boots
* For the rest of the summer, I will be focused on customer service, continuing to work and grow our small Instagram affiliate program, and plan out our first official marketing campaign which will launch this fall.

&#x200B;

**Some fun stats:**

* Launched: June 2019
* Location: Chicago
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1 (+ my parents who help with fulfillment since the warehouse is their house!)

&#x200B;

* Kickstarter Goal: $30,000
* Raised with Kickstarter: $61,316 (Kickstarter keeps 5%...credit card transaction fee keeps another 3-5%)
* Pairs sold via Kickstarter: 365
* MOQ with factory: 1000 pairs
* Price per mold: \~$1.5K
* Maximum colors set by factory: 3
* Maximum sizes set by factory: 10

&#x200B;

* First month selling on our website (June 2019): 3.6K in sales

&#x200B;

**Timeline:**

* Summer 2017: Initial sketch
* Fall 2017: Reached out to factory to get sample made
* Fall 2017-Fall 2018: 10+ rounds of samples and wear testing
* January 2019: Launched a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coddifootwear/codditm-boots-for-your-next-adventure) campaign
* February 2019: Campaign successfully funded
* Feb-May 2019: Ordered materials, built boots, shipped boots overseas
* June 2019: Fulfilled all Kickstarter and post-kickstarter orders
* July-Aug 2019: Plan for fall campaign
* Fall 2019: Fall campaign launches
* January 2020: Sell out of our initial 1000 order

&#x200B;

**Biggest hurdles:**

* finding a reputable factory
* coming up with a name
* dealing with a trademark issue (which set me back 3 months)
* building my brand months before Kickstarter so the initial Kickstarter launch would be as big as possible
* doing quality control on 1000 pairs
* living 1 hour away from my warehouse
* writing 400+ personalized hand-written notes haha

&#x200B;

**Best things to come from this experience thus far:**

* the feedback and reviews from everyone wearing my boots
* the insane amount of amazing people I would have never met
* learning something outside of footwear design. Every. Single. Day.
* I'm now immune to failure. Not saying I don't fail...I fail all the time. But I'm now immune to letting failure affect me. We all need to change how we view failure. Let failures be your greatest weapon. Use them to learn and grow.

&#x200B;

Last thing as well: Thank you to everyone in the community - I'm here lurking all the time learning something new every single day. Keep posting! Keep sharing! Such a great place to learn.

408,5qgobq,False,,311,"Lifestyle entrepreneur with multiple sources of income that are four or five figures a month. 6 mil views on YouTube, 4 mil on Quora. AMA",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit. My name is Sam Priestley, and I’m a bit of cliche really. Location independent (currently in Malta) with multiple online businesses. Yeah, so feel free to hate on me.

Where I’m a bit less of a cliche, is that I don’t ‘hustle’ or work 100 hour weeks. I’d probably have more money if I did, but I find it difficult to motivate myself to do the unpleasant jobs and I’m guilty of normally taking the most interesting path. Which has led me to having tried out most online business fads and abandoning projects I probably shouldn’t have. Some worked out, most didn’t.

I’m also an introvert and don’t really like talking about myself - overcoming that is one of the reasons I’m doing this AMA and why I started a blog a few years back. If you met me you’d probably assume I was an accountant or some other equally mainstream middle-class job.

I’ve been working for myself for the last 9 years or so, ever since my second year of university. Here are my current businesses and how they’re doing:

**Amazon FBA** - Five figures a month profit. [Here’s a screenshot of November's income report for UK and USA](http://imgur.com/a/HZeut). (I’ve chosen November because December and Christmas isn’t an accurate reflection on how much it makes).

Amazon FBA has a bad name because a lot of people use it to resell crap from China and then sell a training course on how to do the same thing. But really Amazon FBA is just the name of the logistics and fulfilment service that Amazon provide, meaning they handle all your warehousing and postage. Companies have been doing that for hundreds of years, Amazon have just put it online and greatly lowered the barrier of entry.

I focus on building my table tennis brand and making it the best there is. I don’t mind telling you I sell table tennis equipment because I’m trying to build the brand... so go out and buy some Eastfield or PalioxETT table tennis equipment please. I guarantee they’ll be better than anything else in the price range. I’ve been working on it for years and spent a fortune on research and development.

We sell on our own websites, on Amazon, eBay and a bit wholesale. But Amazon is by far the biggest market. Personally I never buy stuff online from anywhere but Amazon, and that is becoming more and more common. So Amazon is where I want to be.

**Blog** - Averaged a bit over £3k a month over the last six months. That’s revenue, but profit is pretty similar as my only cost is hosting and my time. [This post breaks down how it makes money](https://sampriestley.com/two-year-blog-earning-report/).

I’ve been working on the blog for about two years now. The only way I really marketed it is through writing long form answers on Quora and referencing back to my blog. I have a little over 4 million views on Quora now.

The blog makes its money through affiliate links. Affiliate links get a bad rap because the writer has a bit of a conflict of interest. Can you write a truly unbiased review if you get commission for every sale? I have my own moral standard that I adhere to: I only look for affiliate links after I’ve written the post. If the companies I talk about don’t have one that’s fine - I leave it and don’t go checking the competition.

An example of that is Upwork. I haven’t been able to find an affiliate program for them, but still refer people to them because I think they’re better than Freelancer - who do have an aff network. 

I leave a lot of money on the table as a result. But I think it makes the site better in the long term.

I’m not a very good writer (another reason I started the blog), so I try and make my posts as useful as possible. It seems that people don’t mind wading through bad grammar and bad spelling if they get some value out of the post.

**YouTube** - I have a YouTube video with 6.4 million views that gets a few hundred thousand extra every month. It is a time-lapse of me learning table tennis. It makes hardly anything. Like $100 a month. [Here is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y21uwFUgkE).

**Self-publishing** - I have one book on a very niche subject (me learning table tennis). And another novella I wrote as an experiment. The table tennis book does alright and sells a couple of hundred copies a month making about £500.

**Coffee shop** - I started a coffee shop in London. It doesn’t really earn any money. Just about pays the staff and is slowly paying off the money borrowed to start it. Highly recommend staying away from opening a coffee shop unless you really know what you’re doing. Plus it’s a not-for-profit so even if it did earn loads I wouldn’t benefit. It's called [The Wren](https://www.facebook.com/TheWrenCoffee/?fref=ts).  If you're in London go and check it out!

**Property** - I jointly own four properties. They don’t make much money. Currently looking to get out of three.

P2P lending and investment - I put any extra money I make into p2p lending or an index tracker. Been doing it a while now so make £1k-£2k a month in interest/dividends/equity increase.

Previous projects:

**Tech Startup** - I spent most of 2012 pumping money into and working all day every day on a tech startup. It was a comparison website for a financial product. Eventually sold to a big market maker in London for a small profit. I hated it. I’m a rubbish manager, didn’t really have any interest in the product and found it really stressful. It’s what convinced me to go into more lifestyle entrepreneur stuff and stay away from startups.

I’m afraid I can’t answer questions about the sale price or the company that bought it or the name of the product. That’s all covered by an NDA.

**Gambling** - The first thing I ever did that actually made money. Quite a roller coaster really. First few years involved a lot of programming and huddling over a computer. Final phase ended up with with our team running round bookmakers in London with wads of cash, wearing wigs and placing arbitrage bets on horse racing. 

Outside of business and money making:
I currently spend a lot of time learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I spent a year training every day with a coach at table tennis. And I am trying to learn Spanish. In March this year, I got all my businesses to the point where I don’t need to be on site and have been travelling the world with my fiance ever since.

To help get out of my comfort zone, become less introverted and deal with conflict better, I volunteered as a part-time police officer in London from 2013 until I left the UK to travel this year.

**Why am I doing an AMA?** Well, for one I like the community here. I read it most days and among the crap there are some really interesting discussions. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2w4kkj/guy_plays_table_tennis_every_day_for_a_year/) (not posted by me) is what made my YouTube video go viral. So yeah, thanks!

Secondly, I want you to read my blog. It’s called [The Arbing Blog](https://sampriestley.com/). It makes money through affiliate links. Yeah, it’s for-profit, so shoot me. But there are no courses or annoying popups or anything like that. I talk about all the above stuff and whatever else I happen to be up to. 

So.. ask me anything!

740,en7wp6,False,Case Study,99,Automation #7: How one business went from 10 hours of work a day to complete autopilot,Entrepreneur,"A while back i made my first post on automation ( [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)) and got a fantastic response (And, full disclosure, a few leads too). Today I'd like to talk more about three short examples that are some of my favorite projects.

Disclosure: I own three small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

If you'd like to read some of my previous posts, please check them out here:

* [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)
* [Automation: Three short examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aqilju/automation_three_short_examples/)
* [Automation #5: How one client made themselves unemployed](https://new.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/anrhbl/automation_5_how_one_client_made_themselves/)
* [Why Automation Matters #3: How i achieved a temporary monopoly overnight](https://new.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9azsbx/why_automation_matters_3_how_i_achieved_a/)

Today, I'd like to talk about a client who worked hard for their business. 10 hours a day! Their job? They would scour over 14 different mediums for trade alerts (Alerts for potentially good trades). These 14 were through different services. Some were over E-Mail, some over SMS, some on Slack chatrooms and others posted on websites.

Their day job was to filter through these alerts, find the most worthwhile ones and forward them on to their own users. On top of this they'd end up spending 1-2 hours a day just managing overhead. Subscriptions, adding them to their own E-Mail, SMS lists, verifying that the people already on the lists have paid for their subscription etc. Quite a tiresome process!

# The automation

One problem with the automation here was that the client needed to hand-pick the alerts that finally went out. They couldn't provide a simple algorithm to do it, their customers were paying for 20 years of experience!

The job was simple. Build a bot that automatically: Reads E-Mails, SMS, Slack channels & constantly updating websites. Okay, maybe not so simple. An algorithm would then filter out the worst of these leads based on a few objective criteria. This'd eliminate about 70-80% of the alerts.

For the rest? They would get a notification on their mobile phone. The notification would have an 'accept' and 'reject' button right there in the notification bar. Accept it and the alert is forwarded to all their subscribers.

Their entire subscription management was also automated. A script would automatically add & remove subscribers and verify payments received.

# Lessons learned

Many of the times i work with clients, i end up automating 10-30% of their workload. Maybe some tool that allows them to pursue a new line of work that was previously too time consuming. Rarely do i have the opportunity to automate 80-90% of the work!

With one tool, this man got his life back. An entire workday spent monitoring different websites, E-Mail, slack and SMS changed to just going about your day and responding to mobile notifications every 5-10 minutes (Remember, most of the alerts are automatically filtered out, only a few actually go to him for review).

That's the real power of automation. It gives you your life back. One day you're working hard on your business. The next day you're thinking hard about your next side hustle. Automation doesn't just give you wings, it gives you an entire jet engine. Think hard about how much work you do for your business. Unless it requires that 'insight' garnered over years of experience, i could probably automate it. And even if it does, automation can take away most of the work as in this example.

601,43kszm,False,,139,How to Wake up at 5AM and Build Your Startup,Entrepreneur,"Hi, last week I reached the [2nd most popular post on Medium](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-wake-up-at-5am-and-build-your-startup-7e1cff3a7f3f#.wnabeoxy6)!  
I'm posting the entire post here on Reddit. Proof [imgur](http://imgur.com/47RtxCk)  
Tried to format it the best I can. Links are missing.  
  
**TLDR:**
Build your startup before your day job, use a smarter alarm, drink coffee as early as possible, and break your startup into micro-startups.  
  
**How to Wake up at 5AM and Build Your Startup**  
What does your morning routine look like? Mine used to be waking up at 7AM, sleep walking to the shower, frantically getting dressed into socially acceptable clothes, pouring myself a cup of caffeine, and walking amongst drones of zombies to a crowded bus station.  
  
Of course, getting out of this hellish cycle is quite the “Catch-22.” The last thing you want to do after working eight-hours is to work on your startup. Yet,if you don’t spend time building your own business, you’ll be trapped in an endless loop of corporations. Racing to the office before 9AM. Managers breathing down your neck. An eternity of smiling at your coworker’s snide comments. Which is a horror movie in and of itself.  
  
**Rise of the Morning Superheroes**  
So I decided to wake up at 5AM and build my startup before the soul sucking day of a gleeful employee started. And he lived happily ever after… would have been great! If I managed to wake up early the moment I decided to become a morning person. I quickly found that my half-awake zombified determination could power-through any obstacle blocking my sleep. On the lucky days I did manage to wake up, I would just sit there and stare into the abyss.  
  
Productivity blogs make it look easy. You’re constantly bombarded with amazing feats that only these mythical morning people can achieve: 8 Things Every Person Should Do Before 8 AM, and 7 Things Morning People Do Differently, and Why Productive People Get Up Insanely Early. Watching these superheros catch falling airplanes before 8AM somehow makes you feel guilty for oversleeping. I mean are they even human?  
  
>Square/Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey  
>Wakes up at 5:30 to meditate and go for a six-mile jog. He kept up that routine during a period where he shuttled back and forth between Square and Twitter, spending around 8 hours a day at both companies.  
  
The truth is waking up at 5AM is hell. Your “morning self” is not the friendliest of people. Mr. Morning Jekyll will subconsciously turn your alarm off before early morning meetings and snooze your alarm when you have to catch the morning train. You can’t trust yourself in the morning. So let’sappease your morning demon by changing how you wake up.  
  
**Find an Alarm Smarter than You**  
I’m not sure when the trend of being violently shocked awake took hold, but we seem quite content with our morning shock therapy. Instead of willingly accepting a blitzkrieg of violent noises, find an alarm that gradually wakes you up. Waking up slowly allows your body to accept the fact you’re waking up. So when your mind actually does wake up, you’ll be less in the mood of killing your innocent alarm.  
  
You can use a coffee alarm that masterfully brews coffee to match the time you wake up. A light-up alarm that gently emits artificial light on your face while you reflect on how man has conquered the Sun. A vibrating wrist alarmto wake up early without having your spouse wanting to murder you every morning. Having a dog/cat/small-human walk over your face at 5AM is also a good option.  
  
Personally, I use the “Warmly” alarm app alongside the default smartphone alarm. Slowly waking up to 5 minutes of birds chirping in your ear, before opening my eyes to Yo-Yo Ma’s Cello vibrating through the air is quite the morning experience. Outsmart your morning demon starting with your alarm clock.  
  
**Have a Long-Distance Relationship with Your Alarm**  
Building a habit isn’t rocket science. A simple model of building positive habits (reading, exercising, socializing) and discarding negative habits (drinking, smoking, junk food) is through “Perverse Accordances.”  
  
>In design, you create affordances when you want your user to do something, and disturbances when you want them to not do something. Thus you encourage desired behaviors by making them easier, and discourage undesired behaviors by making them harder.  
  
If you want to build a habit of “not” turning off your alarm, make turning off your alarm as difficult as possible. Set multiple alarms, download a puzzle alarm app, or place your smartphone in a jar. While I would love to cuddle my smartphone before I fall asleep and glance into its lovely glass screen the moment I wake. If you want to wake up early, move your smartphone far away and have a long-distance relationship.  
  
**Force Yourself to Drink Coffee**  
For those who survived the Hunger Games and actually woke up, staying awake is another problem. I mean you did just wake up at 5AM, why not go back to sleep? You have all the time in the world! You can always wake up early “tomorrow.” All the while regretting having listened to my morning temptations after falling back asleep. I’m simply a terrible person before my first cup of coffee. So let’s get caffeinated.  
  
You can’t treat your 5AM coffee like a normal cup of coffee. It doesn’t matter if you painstakingly prepared a cup of hand-dripped Guatemala Starbucks coffee. If coffee is not part of your waking process Mr. Morning Jekyll will just ignore it. Don’t rely on your morning self to go out of his way to wake up. He’ll try everything to go back to bed.  
  
Find a way to directly integrate your coffee into your morning routine. The goal is to make your alarm a”trigger” for your coffee drinking habit. “If” the alarm rings, “then” you drink coffee. Experiment on different ways to automate the coffee drinking process.  
  
Initially, I planned on brewing a cup of coffee the first thing in the morning. I didn’t even make it to the kitchen. Then, I tried preparing a cup of ice-coffee the night before and placing it on my desk. I didn’t make it to my desk. Eventually, I placed the cup of coffee on my alarm (smartphone). So in order to turn my alarm off, I had to literally pick up a cup of coffee. Once the coffee is in your hand, you might as well drink it. Not drinking coffee at this point is just cheating. Treat 5AM as the start of your work-day, drink some coffee and build your startup.  
  
**Procrastinate Yourself Awake**  
Still not awake? A little procrastination never hurt anyone. Then again, self-professed Internet addicts don’t provide the best productivity tips.  
  
I spend a ridiculous amount of time looking at funny cat pictures on Reddit, Imgur, and 9gag. Hopelessly dependent on my next viral fix. I just can’t help myself. Visiting the same website over and over again in hopes of new content. Consciously knowing there isn’t anything there.  
  
So let’s justify our procrastination under a more productive light. While looking at funny cat pictures before you sleep, gives you temporary insomnia.Looking at your smartphone/computer first thing in the morning can actually help you wake up.  
  
>Why Screens Ruin Your Sleep  
>“Exposure to blue light of LED screens affects melanopsin, which leads to a suppression of melatonin, and ultimately keeps our bodies from feeling sleepy.”*  
  
If you can’t bear the thought of working on your startup first thing in the morning. Spend a few minutes procrastinating until your morning demons settle down. Remember, you’re fighting a two-front battle. Waking up at a freakishly early time “and” working on your startup.  
  
**Break Your Startup into Micro-Startups**  
When I can barely turn my alarm off, I’m not going to start my day debugging a server destroying bug. Your morning self is an asshole. Starting the day with a daunting task just provides extra incentive to go back to sleep.  
  
By now I’m going to assume your New Years Resolutions has failed, like thenormal 88% of us. One reason you probably failed is you chose too BIG of a goal. “I want to end world hunger” “I want to have six-pack” despite never having exercised in my life. This isn’t a Miss Universe pageant.  
  
“The Art of Manliness” shows how using micro-habits can help build towards a macro-habit. The goal is not to build your entire startup first thing in the morning, but to simply “start.” Once you get the engine rolling it’s easier to switch to a higher gear.  
  
>If you want to floss your teeth, just floss one tooth. Commit to flossing just ONE tooth — and make that your goal for the day. If you are able to do that, you’ve accomplished your goal. You can check it off your list. But here’s the trick: Once you perform the micro-habit enough times, it becomes muchharder NOT to complete the entire habit than to simply do the whole thing.  
  
Break your startup into micro-startups that you can work on in the half-awake hours of the morning. Build your app by writing one line of code a day. Start your blog by writing one paragraph a day. Build your portfolio by sketching one design a day. Build your startup in 100 small increments rather than spending 100 full-time days. Every work doesn’t have to be a Picasso. By decreasing the barrier to entry, you’re more likely to follow through and stay awake.  
  
**Build a Lean Startup**  
It’s hard to admit, but no one really knows what they’re doing at first. Even the largest startup unicorns in the world, took a long time to find their footing.AirBnb survived by selling political themed cereal Obama O’s and Cap’n McCain’s. #Slack came out of a failed game “Glitch.” Even YouTube began as a video dating service “Tune in Hook Up.”  
  
Micro-startups work well with the Lean Startup methodology (The Lean Startup by Eric Ries). Not only are micro-startups easier to implement, but provide a shorter feedback loop that keeps you more in touch with your audience. With 75% of all startups failing, would you rather spend 100 days in a basement building a product your customers “might” like or connect with your audience everyday “while” you adapt your startup to address your customer’s pain-points? Don’t build another Blockbuster.  
  
Start with the assumption that you’re wrong. Constantly validate your theories through micro-experiments. When I first started “Krown.io”. I explained the service as an “Annotation Blogging Platform.” That was, until I found out the majority of people have no idea what “Annotations” are. We tried a variation of “Smart Blogging,” “Highlight Blogging,” “Feedback Blogs,” and “Contextual Blogging Platform.” Which surprise, surprise. People still had no idea what we were talking about. So we added a bare-to-the-bones explanation, “Highlight a text and add comments directly on the highlighted text.” Validate your hypothesis.  
  
**Make Your Work Public**  
We all have that irrational fear the moment you publish your work, trolls all over the world will unite and make it their life’s mission to downvote you tooblivion. The truth is they don’t really care. In a world with 2 million blog posts published daily. Getting discovered is the bigger challenge. You really need stand out.  
  
If you can’t even get yourself to wake up early and build your startup. Why worry about your content’s likability? That’s the same as worrying if you study too much you might become a Harvard Professor. If you’ve been struggling with your masterpiece for a while. The simple act of public accountability can help you wake up early and build your startup. Don’t just take my word. It’s supported by scientific evidence!  
  
>Our findings are of relevance to those interested in changing their behavior and achieving their goals, as well as to those who want to help them, like weight loss programs, money advice agencies or sport coaches. Prompting people to monitor their progress can help them to achieve their goals, but some methods of monitoring are better than others. Specifically, we would recommend that people be encouraged to record, report or make public what they find out as they assess their progress.  
  
You don’t have to build a interstellar satellite to broadcast your progress, simple tools like Twitter can help you wake up. Thomas Frank from the “College Info Geek” uses Twitter and Buffer in an ingenious way to force himself awake. Basically he sets an automated Tweet about donating $25 and has to wake up early to prevent himself losing $25. Trust yourself. Your work is interesting.  
  
**Be Obsessed with Productivity**  
Try to hit two birds with one stone and kill the third bird from shock. Making your micro-startup more productive provides extra incentive to wake up early. I start my day by writing a public journal. If I were just writing public journal for the sake of writing a journal, I probably wouldn’t be as diligent. A single journal helps build my startup in three ways.  
  
First, writing a morning journal helps me reflect on my progress. How do I increase engagement with my audience? Should I switch over from Wordpress comments to Disqus Comments? Are Adsense ads still viable against the rising climate of Adblock? What is the best time to publish a blog post? What tasks can I automate? Am I crazy for starting a business?  
  
Secondly, writing a daily journal builds content for my blog “TechMob.”Building a niche blog takes time. You need at least 1,000 short articles to begin gaining substantial organic traffic from Google. Writing a daily journal helps build the necessary content foundation.  
  
Lastly, writing a public journal promotes my Contextual Blogging Platform “Krown.” TechMob is built on Krown and uses sentence-level comments to add contextual information. Every post on TechMob promotes Krown through the sub-domain “techmob.krown.io” and the CTA at the bottom of each post.  
  
**Prepare to Run a Marathon**  
Starting from 7AM completely switch gears to accommodate your 9–5 day job.While I would love to work on my startup full-time. Sadly humans are trapped in biological prisons where you to have to constantly eat, drink, and feel the urge to sleep with other people. Damn you Darwin. Working in micro-startups sprints in the morning, opens the possibility to continue working at your day job.  
  
Be smart. Don’t bet your entire life on a single game of Poker. Allocate a portion of your assets to a life-changing Poker game, while working at the casino itself. Startups take time and you need to eat.  
  
Based on Nassim Taleb’s Barbell Strategy (Anti-Fragile) you should allocate 20% of your resources to high-risk/high-return anti-fragile activities (ie. startups, bungee-jumping), and invest the remaining 80% in low-risk/low-return assets (ie. school, day job, family dinners). Experience the best of both worlds. Build your startup as a side-project first, gain validation, then jump into the unknown when you’re ready.  
  
**Wake up Early and Build Your Startup**  
Every morning startup routine will be different. Try to find a routine that fits your goals. If you’re going to spend 8 hours doing something you hate, at least invest 1 hour on something you love. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is madness. Don’t let your current “reality” drag you in the wrong direction. Face the odds, try to live the life you were meant to live. Wake up early and build your startup.

923,57405j,False,,196,"Wantrepreneur Wednesday: How to live rent-free (or make an extra $19,000/yr) by sitting on your ass.",Entrepreneur,"Hi r/Entrepreneur! I'm new here but discovered you guys just in time to offer up some advice and experience for Wantrepreneur Wednesday on how to spend $0 on rent OR make over $19,000+/yr doing basically nothing. For background I'm a serial micro-entrepreneur. I've never had a traditional job, and have been starting up small businesses to support my lifestyle since I was 17. A year ago money started getting tight and I could no longer afford (with good conscience) to keep paying over $1900 for an oversized living space for myself, so I found a solution that would allow me to live in a pretty nice place for $0/m with some elbow grease. 

One of the best tools, by far, used to make money without lifting a finger is airbnb, or other space-sharing websites. Before I used these services, and had any experience with them I thought they were a horrible way to earn or save money. When I first began to ponder about the idea I immediately jumped the gun and tried to sell access to my 2400sq. creative loft space. I lived in a hip neighborhood, and never once thought that the lack of walls (therefore, privacy) would be an issue. That is, until I found myself with no bookings, and decided that airbnb and sites like it were a scam. Then I moved to Vegas.    

## Going from paying $1200/m in rent to $0  

When I moved to Vegas I did so because the rent was cheaper, the weather weas nicer, and it's a city that's filled with opportunity to grow my main business. I found a nice 2bedroom apartment in a low-key part of town for a reasonable price. It's 1200sqf and I pay $1200/m for it. Upon signing the lease I immediately started planning to rent the smaller room out. I bought ~$400 (platform bed, comfortable mattress) worth of furniture, $200 on housewares (everything from towels to silverware), and another $100 on refreshments for my guests. By the first week I had gotten my first reservation, and by the week six I had made back my initial investment, and then some. Gross profit for the first 30 days was $1765 and has been steadily climbing as I raise my nightly rate and fees.     

## My motivation  

I simply didn't want to work hard, anymore. I have a small business that brings in money irregularly, and I didn't want to rely on it to survive or live paycheck by paycheck because I didn't feel like getting up in the morning. Some unwarranted advice for depressed people in this sub: You can be successful. You just have to work around your shortcomings, instead of letting them run YOU. Also be realistic. If you know you get down often, plan for that shit. The fact that 12-15 days out of a month I feel like shit was a MAJOR motivator for me. Not just the money, and small profit, but also the social aspects of it. I now have to keep my home clean, and I have to interact with strangers on a daily basis. It did wonders for my social skills. Also, moving to a more affordable city meant I was saving an average of $600/m on rent. That was motivation enough if I'm being honest.

## Your motivation  
I say this with the utmost respect: If you're thinking of this, don't get into it to profit. Get into it to save money, and to save time spent getting a job. Think to yourself: *If I had all of my basic expenses paid for, what could I do? What could I create? What business could I build?*  There are people that create side gigs, and full-fledged businesses while working a day job. If you decide to go rent free using an airbnb-like service, you will have alot of time on your hands. Use that time to make more money, and save the money you have now in case of an emergency. Or, in case your landlord finds out, but let's hope that's not gonna happen for awhile. (That was a joke. Please find out if your landlord is cool with this before renting. Or at least consult with an attorney. It'll be the best $250 you spend that month.)

## My start-up costs:  

* Security deposit + first months - $2500   
* Various utilities - $350  
* Furniture - $375  
* Housewares - $200  
* Snacks - $100   
 
 

## 5 must-haves of doing airbnb:  

### 1) You have to live in a large city. Period.  
It's possible to make money in smaller cities, but if you're trying to live rent-free so you can save, or start a business, or become a full-time painter, you're going to have to live in a large city, and if you don't already you have to move.    

### 2) You need enough space. Period.  
You'll need a 2b/2bth apartment, with enough room for at least 3 people to live comfortably (you, your guest, and their wife or husband). Cramped spaces often lead to people feeling uncomfortable, and it makes it impossible for your guests to enjoy themselves. 

### 3) You need the basic living necessities.   
The basics include things you'd normally have access to in hotel rooms: A bed. A dresser or closet. A night stand. Wireless *and* wired internet. A tv. A phone. Towels. Shampoo. Soap. (Not needed but good-to-have extras: Eating utensils, cups, plates, skillets, ect)  

### 4) You must have snacks. Lots of snacks.  
One thing that a ton of hosts get wrong is snacks. I spent less than $1.5/person for snacks. This includes canned soda, breakfast bars, and chips. A big part of these savings is the use of Sams club, and other discount stores. I provide snacks for my guest for two reasons: 1) because I've been a guest with airbnb hosts that didn't give me snacks, and I had to resort to late night trips to White Castle to feed my late-night hunger. 2) It's *very* rare that someone will eat your snacks, drink your expensive coffee and leave you a bad or lackluster review. Sometimes you make a mistake and give them the wrong key. Sometimes you forget to put extra towels in the bathroom and the guest ends up looking for them in your laundry room. Shit happens, and nothing will ever be perfect. But if you have snacks, and correct your mistakes with a smile, people will typically view you favorably and give you a positive review.  

### 5) You must shut the hell up.  
If you're an extrovert I sincerely feel bad for you. You can skip this part if the subheading made you cringe. Now, for introverts or those that are quiet, you have to keep up the silence. Don't stomp around at 9AM in the morning. Don't  sit in your kitchen at 2AM, eating cheetos and bonbons. Don't let your cat or dog roam around, meowing or barking all night. Shut the hell up, because people are trying to sleep and *they're paying you for that privilege.*    

## One last word of advice (and an invitation for questions!)  
One of the most disgusting things I've learned about as an airbnb host is how most rooms are rarely cleaned properly. Most hosts will vacumm, and clean towels, but a lot of them fail to clean bed linens, comforters, and bathrooms that are only slightly dingy. This is the *wrong* way to go about cleaning a space for anyone, and it is repulsive. When someone books your place, I recommend minimum $50 cleaning fee. For this fee, you should provide them with a clean room, clean bed linens, cleans towels, and a completely spotless bathroom regardless of how the last guest left your space. If you want, you can give that $50+ to pay someone to come in after each guest and clean the entire place. Or, if you'd rather keep the extra cash (like I do...) you can do it yourself. Cleaning an entire room, plus the bathroom takes less than 20 minutes if you work quickly. (this time doesnt include the minutes spent eating bonbons, waiting for the washer to finish a load.) Cleaning is fairly simple, and easy to outsource. Do not skimp on this. If not for the good reviews, do it for the sake of caring for another human being.   

Now that Im done with that warning, If anyone has any questions about using airbnb or not working for a living, feel free to ask them here.  

## Obligatory ""plz dont do something illegal and blame me"" edit:  
My situation is different than most random people that use airbnb. My landlord knows what Im doing. He also signed an agreement that basically states I can sublet the room or apartment for short periods of time. With that said, legally, airbnb falls in a grey area most of the time, and you should consult with a lawyer. Pay the couple hundred bucks to ask questions and have them do a little research to find out if what you're planning to do is legal, in a grey area of the law, or illegal and if so what kinds of fines you could have to pay.   

More info on my situation:    

> I told my landlord up front what I'd be doing, and he was very clear that as long as there was no excessive noise he didn't care if I sublet the room or the whole apartment. I had an additional leasing agreement drafted by my attorney for this very purpose. I got a great deal on my place (it is very cheap for the area.), and I was lucky enough to be introduced to a laid back landlord through prior business connections.

133,3avuhg,False,,304,"I created DicksByMail.com, went viral, and sold the company before even shipping out my second round of orders. AMA",Entrepreneur,"I wanted to wait to post this because 

A) I didn't want to seem like I was simply promoting my own company

B) I wanted to be done with it all

C) Im kinda lazy

Here's the brief rundown of what was definitely the most exciting/stressful month of my life.

At the end of February I had a bit of an... issue... with a girl I was seeing. This prompted me to to joke with some of my regular customers (I'm a bartender) about wanting to send her a dildo with the message 'Go Fuck Yourself'... we laughed and I was aware of the spark it created in my head because the idea stuck with me. 

A few days later while looking for cheap dildos online, I started seeing dick shaped candies and thats when the idea hit me; I could literally tell her to eat a bag of dicks. I joked with the same people about the idea and they thought it was brilliant, and everyone laughed it off - except me. a few days later (on what would ultimately be one of my few days off for months to come), I sat down with a few glasses of whisky and browsed through the shopify templates and confirmed pricing, then took the plunge to posting the site itself.

It was terribly bad, but it was funny. and I knew that I could actually provide the products, at the price and make a few dollars. 

Initial costs were **$8** for www.dicksbymail.com as my domain name, that would later become a big trend (I'll share a funny story about that later if you remind me).

A bag of gummy dicks was about **$6** at the time including shipping when i bought 2 dozen orders... I didn't buy anything until I had my first few sales. I'd worked shipping out to be about $**8** too hit the states through canada, and $**7** for most of Canada. 

I set the price at $19.99 feeling that $20 was an easy amount for people to part with, and I was right.

Price to Customer - $19.99

My Shipping - $8

Cost of Product - $6

Shopify rate - $1/product credit card processing fees

This left me with about $5 profit from every bag of dicks I sent out, not too bad.

I started to show the website to friends, the customers I chatted with and some of my family that has a good sense of humor.I even did some paid reddit ads that resulted in traffic but no sales.  I ended up getting a few orders, and I knew everyones name that I got (both the buyer and the victim). After about 6 orders in 5 days, I decided to order the product and ship some out. After about a week, my product arrived in the mail and i started to assemble the packages, but the first person to receive a package  was going to be someone special, no not the girl from the top of the post, someone that was actually more important - My best friend. I put together the package, even adding postage, but personally went over and put it in his mailbox.

I got a text from him later saying it was one of the funniest things ever, and that he was going to post it on imgur - which he did [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/6Ldtx).

Within 24 hours this was on the front page of imgur with about a half million views, that ended up translating into about a thousand dollars in sales, this day was coincidentally St Paddys day. 

$1000 was roughly 50 orders most of which came from the US, of all the things I scrambled to do, changing from CAD to USD was one of the best decisions I'd made that day. 

Blogs started to use the pictures and link to the site and hundreds of orders started to pour in. I went from thinking that I had to order a few hundred bags and get stuffing, to looking to order a few thousand and get a fulfillment company. At the end of the day, over $30,000 was spent on my site. and I still needed to make a phonecall.

Ordering the dicks in bulk wasn't much of an issue, I called the distributor directly from the box that I received in my first order. I asked for 6000 units of well, units based on the orders that were still rolling in. The price quote went from $6/bag to under $2. 

Cha Ching.

The next thing I did was [post this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2zl4y9/i_created_dicksbymailcom_yesterday_we_sold_2000/) on reddit because I was in a bind, I know I needed someone to fulfill the orders, but had no idea who, or how. A few people PM'd me with the services they used and I decided to go with www.monthlyboxer.com . The person running the show over there is Alex and he is a down to earth guy that was a genuine help in the first few weeks.

Fulfillment costs were $2 flat per unit that shipped out. Now I was already saving money on the whole deal with buying the dicks at a huge volume, so the extra cost wasn't bad. It was great, I didn't have to look at another bag of dicks for a long time if I chose not to. And the extra bonus was that now since I was shipping from the states, I could use a much cheaper option than shipping from Canada.

Now my costs looked like this:

Price to Customer -$19.99

My Shipping - $3

Fulfillment Costs - $2

Cost of Product - $1.75

Shopify Rates - $1 /order (apparently I could have dropped this down by upgrading my account - oops)

This put about $12 in profits into my pocket on each order, more than double what I was doing before... This also was the day the internet lost its mind and collectively spent $78,000 within 24 hours on sending bags of dicks to each other.

These first few days I did very little media, but did talk to both a local person (friend of a friend) and a BuzzFeed 'journalist' because I knew how big that exposure was going to be. The reason I stayed off media was simply because I wanted to focus on selling the products, I had dicks on order and on back order to meet the needs of the people, setting up the system was the #1 priority in my mind and I friggen did it.

The next few days saw more sales, (averaging $15k in sales per day for the following week) but I had a dilemma on my hands, I 'd been so focused on making this work that I was now a $100k+ business that was not registered/incorporated/insured or anything that a real business should be. So the natural question came up - should I go the glitter bomb route and sell out while the selling is good.

I contacted Flippa, and worked with the good people there to let someone else take over the dick empire that I created. Flippa works by taking 10% of the sale and then has a few extras built it to make more money. I was working with someone there to get the information that they needed and was basically told that they would run the auction and had several 'registered bidders' that were already verified. Within a few days the auction had shot up to the reserve price of $100k, remember this wasnt just for a domain, this was including the orders that were days away from shipping and they would have gotten all that revenue as well.

I was happy. Someone was going to buy the site, and then they could take on the orders, the headaches, the media and we would both make quite a bit. 

Less than 24 hours before the auction ended, the 'verified bidder' pulled out. People were pointing fingers and blaming each other, lots of people were calling me fake implying I had done that myself (I didn't). The bids slowly creeped up from $10-$20k but the auction ended without getting back up to that reserve price again.

In the days leading up to the auction debacle, I had been contacted from someone outside the auction that wished to buy the site. They asked a bunch of questions, and were pretty interested and fairly engaging, they understood the reality - I was a guy that did something big and wanted to see it succeed, make myself some money, and let someone else make money too. 

They drafted an offer that not only paid me out 6 figures right away, but also royalties over time as well. 

I took the offer, they took control of the site, and we all made money. In the days leading up to the sale I had lawyered up and got everything legally transferred to a company I started, and made the sale from there. 

As the dust settles, do I regret anything I did? No, I feel I handled everything pretty well and though I could have made more money if I kept the company, I wanted to make sure that the house of cards I was building didn't just topple down on me and have me end up with nothing. In asking the people that bought the site, they seem pretty happy with the whole thing as well. And really, Thats what I wanted - I want people to be happy with the whole damn thing. The customers, the 'victims', the new owners and myself. 

I think I've learned enough that if I do it again, I'll keep everything for myself next time. But I want to focus on a few other projects for now, things nearer to my heart than my dick.

Hi Guys,

I started a small web development company this year in January and I wanted to document my journey from making nothing for the first few months up to a steady income of over $10,000 a month. This isn’t all profit as I will explain but it’s been good so far and my best month was $17,000+.  Apologies for my rant-ish writing and hopefully some of you get some value out of this.

*** This isn't some magic get rich formula but it is a great way to learn some useful skills and get paid decent money to help people’s businesses. Also the profit and skills can be quickly used to start your own business. It takes a lot of work though and plenty of hours sitting at your computer – just want to be realistic from the start! ***


Backstory:
I used to work as a drilling engineer in Alberta, Canada (I am Irish) but when oil crashed I was let go pretty fast. I decided to travel in South America for a month, which I loved, but I had to go back to Canada and try find some more work. Even though I had made some good money in oil I spent it as fast as I made it and I was back to very little savings. I worked some odds jobs including moving furniture for an events company and other things. I got pretty sick of it and decided to risk it all and sell everything I owned non-essential and move back to South America. I moved just before Christmas last year and rented a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood. I slept on the ground on a mattress and basically had nothing but a desk, laptop and Wi-Fi connection. I had never successfully made money online before and I had no idea where to start. I tried Instagram marketing for a month and failure miserably. I did get some comments from Gary Vaynerchuk though which was cool. 

I ended up doing a Udemy course to build a website for a product I was working on. I actually really liked the website and I found coding kind of fun. I decided to give this a go and went to work. 

Months 2-5:
First stop was UpWork, which was brutal. I did about 3-4 months on here in total and it was pretty rough. I got some good clients but most were dicks and after some kid changed his mind for the 20th time on a $100 website I quit. I never made more than $200 and most websites took me two weeks to build (multiple changes, clients were slow, kept changing their mind). 

Months 5-6:
After that I decided to just start approaching people I knew and I did some websites for $200-500. They were mostly for small businesses that didn’t have much cash flow and could not afford to pay me much. The websites were okay but they weren’t getting great results for their owners so I didn’t feel like I could charge much. 

Months 6+:

At the time I was doing some legal work for Canada and the person I was working with had a terrible website. One day I asked her if she would want me to fix it (broken pages, terrible design) and she immediately said yes. She said she had been meaning to do it for years and badly needed it done. She said name my price. I picked the highest figure I could think of since I knew she had a very profitable business -$2,000!

It took me about 4 weeks to finish but I felt super happy about it. I spent a LOT of time on having it look great and making sure the images and copy (text) was perfect. When I gave it to her she loved it. Afterwards I asked her if she had gone with a real web design company what price would she have been happy to pay for the exact same website. Her answer… $5,000-6,000. Whoops. 

After this job I figured out a lot of what I had been doing wrong. I had been trying to get smaller companies to pay for websites that they would see very little ROI on. They would never be able to pay much because they just don’t make much. Or they do make a bit but having a good website doesn’t help them make more (good example is a gym - you just go to the nearest gym or the one someone recommends, a cool website won't help *too* much). 

I completely changed my strategy and started approaching larger companies that made a lot of money and were losing A LOT by having a terrible website. These are actually not too hard to find (if people want I can cover this is another post) and after a lot of cold calls and emails I started to get traction. I moved from $2,000 to $4,000 to $6,500 and after a few more up to $15,000. I read a lot on sales, marketing, design but I still only knew basic HTML and CSS. I would start off with a basic theme (around $30) and make a lot of changes to come up with a great design. 

Now I know people might be saying that isn’t the best coding practice  (and it is not) but I added a lot of value in other areas and everyone was super happy with their websites. They are simple static designs (these owners don’t want to edit anything again for a long time) but the results were really powerful. 

-	One business got a over 10 times increase in bookings (value 40-90k a month in future clients)
-	Directly helped an oil company close a contract for over 1 million with a great new website (portfolio, downloadable brochure)
-	Helped a pro athlete increase his sponsors and also get more recognition

These are just a few examples but I am really happy with every one so far and my clients love to rave about the websites and the success. 

Quick recap:
- I started with zero coding knowledge in January of this year. I didn't know how to host a website, I didn't know what HTML or CSS was, I made a tonne of really basic mistakes and figured it all out by myself. I didn't take any expensive courses, had no mentors and probably only spent a few hundred dollars getting set up. 

It took me a while to refine my niche but what I now focus on now is building simple yet powerful websites that get huge results. 
I usually charge between 4-15k and usually have a waiting list of 2-3 websites. 

While I made good money on these websites its nice to know that the value I added is many times more and all my clients have been very satisfied. 

I am still in the early stages of figuring this all out though so I will continue to add to this post with more lessons if people want. 


So my humble advice on how to begin:

*** I only build ""custom"" HTML websites, I don't know/use wordpress except in some rare cases for add on blog/news sections to my sites. Why? Most of my clients are very busy, non-tech people. They don't want or have time to update their websites. They want it built well and they want it to run itself. HTML is a lot better for this and when done right looks way more professional and requires less maintenance (IMO). I don't have anything against WordPress just that I prefer to use HTML and both work fine for what I am doing. ***


How to quickly begin with HTML:

Take the HTML and CSS lessons on https://www.codecademy.com/. 
You can also do the JS section but I didn't and have been just fine. 


Next take the following UDEMY course (non affiliate):
https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/


After this you will now know how to edit and work with HTML themes. What does that mean?

Well there is no point creating a website from scratch. That takes years of coding experience and a lot of time for each new clients. Luckily enough people have gone and created HTML themes - its an already coded website where you just rearrange, switch out the pictures and text and add in a few extra bits. I am making this sound simpler than it is but its still quiet simple. 

An example of a theme is here... (again non affiliate)

https://themeforest.net/item/foundry-multipurpose-html-variant-page-builder/11562108?s_rank=9

It just a blank slate with a certain style that you work with. While this may seem like strange or cheating (I thought this was how to learn to build websites!??) its not. Anyone with an Internet connection can create a website these days so that is not where I try to add value. I add value by building a website with a purpose. I aim to build websites that get results and make money, or whatever they are trying to achieve, for the owner. Its not about code, its about how it helps the owner. 

*** I hope this doesn’t piss off the obviously good coders on here, I do my best to code well but I am still learning ***


So how do you build a website that gets great results?

Good question. 

So first important thing is your clients want sales not a website. 
They don’t want a website that looks amazing, has cool videos and sections, talks about the companies recent golf tournament or how they really wanted to do X since they were 5 UNLESS it helps gets sales. Everything must be about getting a result. 

Every page, link, click and action on the website is to help facilitate the growth of the company and sales. 

Lets take for example an immigration lawyer website...

Is the goal of the site to teach you about immigration law?
Is it to show you stats of work, trade and education within the country?
Is it to teach you about what to do when you first arrive, what to pack, what to expect?

No.

The whole purpose of that website is for the user to either book a consultation or contact them regarding their services. Which both lead to that person hiring them as their immigration lawyer. 

Now it might use some of the above points to help with that goal but it only has one main purpose. Everything we do for that client must help with that goal or if it doesn't help... be removed. 



Once you sell results there is no limit to what you can charge and achieve. 


So where do a lot of people go wrong?

The types of clients you help. 

Imagine for a second the website you build will only ever generate one sale per year. Maybe only one sale ever. 



Now lets go over some businesses you could build a website for...

Client one: Jimmy & Friends Coffee Shop.
One sale is a cup of coffee or maybe if they are lucky a lunch special. One sale profit: $3-10 profit maybe.

Client Two: Jimmy & Co Travel Agency.
Maybe that one sale is a trip to Paris, or maybe even a round the world one year break. Profits on travel are slim though and the internet is really driving down those juice margins. One sale profit: $150- $1,000 profit maybe.

Client Three: Jimmy Inc. Industrial Clean Up Services.
Now this website is not on the sexy side of things. It won't exact be winning website of the year award or going viral on FB but...
One sale of a large scale clean up at that oil refinery this winter... Maybe $500,000 to $4 million. Maybe more.

Now when it comes time to sell websites you always want to aim to get your clients ten times the results that they invest in you.

So lets do the maths...

Client One: You can justify 30c - $1
Client Two: You can justify $15 - $100
Client Three: You can justify $50k to $400,000.


It’s the same amount of time dealing with the client, same amount of time coding, same amount of time hiring a pro photographer. Very different result. 

Now what you charge is your own choice. But the above example should clearly show who to build for:

- Construction
- Industrial Services
- Engineering
- Oil
- Legal
- Medical
- Other Blue Collar niches

The first four are my favorite. Unsexy, boring, aggressive clients (people are scared to call them which I like!), potnetial large contracts.


""Hey but what about tech start ups and that new app, they are making a zillion dollars. Lets go build for them!!!""

No way and here is why...

- They are in the design and internet business, they know guys already or have minimum wage slaves to work round the clock on design and websites
- There is no shortage of guys trying to approach the ""cool"" companies for web design
- You will always be replaceable and undercut by others
- They won't see your value

Your aim is to become a problem solver for large, boring, industrial companies that know nothing about the internet and want to deal with a ""regular guy"" to fix that website.



*** Disclaimer ***

While $15k+ a month (sales) might sound like a lot it’s not really. It’s enough. Enough to invest in my real businesses and cover my basic living costs. Not every month is clean profit. I reinvest a lot of money into education, design and growing. Things go wrong and learning from scratch is hard work. Some jobs run overtime, some things I have to do twice, or three times or more. 

I am not sipping cocktails on some beach while I go code once or twice a week on a hammock. 
I have since got a bed but I still live quite humble. I code 8 - 10 hours a day and also spend half the morning at Uni trying to learn Spanish. 

This is a crash course on entrepreneurship while you earn money. You have to learn to sell, cold call, manage, outsource, and so on. Everyday. 
Coding websites is time intensive by nature. 

If you are looking for easy money this probably isn't it. If you are looking to learn about business really fast though while funding and learning how to grow your own business this is excellent. Just want to add that in before someone thinks this is some overnight hack plan.

Next year I am going to focus on scaling more and bringing on some part time staff. At the moment I have some copywriters and use some people off UpWork and Fiverr. There is a lot more I could talk about but this post is huge. I have posted some of this info on another forum before but I wanted to added it here since I have got a lot of value from a few posts on this sub reddit before.

I will answer whatever questions you might have. I also have a little FB group where we help each other out... https://www.facebook.com/groups/makemoneywithwebdesign/  (no business or spamming please - its just to help each other)

Thanks for reading, hopefully not too many typos. 


1st Edit:

Thanks for all the positive comments and feedback. I will try get to everyone soon.

I got through maybe half those comments and I will hit up more later after work. Sales seems to be a common theme so Ill expand on that too.

Hope this advice helps. I won't be ""proving"" anything but hopefully my advice shows I know what I am talking about. I definitely am not a great coder but the work I do has added a lot of value and revenue to my clients so I feel great about what I have done. This and other forums (fastlane forum) have helped me a lot over the years so its great to give back. I actually had some doubts about posting here since its a big wilder than other threads but I like the pressure and it helps me step up my game. 
Ill be back later tonight to post more. Thanks.


2nd and final part: Sales

Side intro note: This was a simple AMA, I am not out to prove or convince anyone. If you think 10K a month is some huge figure you will approach it as such. It is not, its 2 big sales, or 1 small sale. There are a billion terrible websites. Learn to sell (from real resources not a quick reddit thread) and you can get in on this action. I know guys doing 40-50K a month with this stuff as a small team, and I know people doing 100-200k a month in ecommerce. 10k is small. When I started it seemed huge but its better to try focus on how little sales really make up that figure. I won't be responding to any more 20 point lists. I don't care and particular posters failures or bitterness doesn't change my reality. Anyway its only like 5 people but they keep posting - use that energy and pick up a phone!

How to find jobs when you are first starting: Google

As for finding companies that could need a new website its very easy. In fact its probably one of the easiest services to find potential customers for.

Job formula: Google... ""niche industry"" + ""local town"" and go through the first few pages of results. Anything that looks below par is suitable. I try go for companies that are clearly doing well but haven't updated the website in 3-6 years. You can usually tell by the date in the footer.

For example I google ""Carpet search Calgary"", Within the first few searches this site came up...

http://envirosurfaceremovers.com/

Probably a 4k job. Nice thing is he is ranked high on Google but has a poorly converting site. I don't have to focus on SEO or convincing him people will visit since its already on the first page. All he needs now is good copy, images and a clear path of desired action for customers to take. I would probably start the phone call off with that.

You could do that all day and not run out of companies that need a better website.

I go for certain niches - guys that probably don't like to deal with web companies. A lot of the companies outside of bug cities are run by red blooded, blue collar guys. The last thing they want is some ""nerd"" ( I am a secret nerd) they have to deal with. I run a no-bullshit web design company and know the way these people like to do deals and communicate. I don't talk about ""migrating hosting"" I just simply say the website has to be moved etc. I have 3 years experience on the oil rigs and grew up in a construction family so I know how to get on well with these guys. I think thats one main area that sets me apart. 

I hear a lot of ""our current web guy is impossible to deal with, he is really weird / annoying /lazy / arrogant "". Its not a tough game to be better than the rest and Im only getting started. You can see by some posters on any coding/business forum that their attitude is not helping - be ""cool"", friends, helpful and useful. If you are stuck on this read How to Win Friends and Influence People. It works. 

Now let me show you how this works in realtime (don't all call this person at once ha)...
Today (like right now) this guy is using Adwords for ""Immigration Lawyer Canada"" ...
http://www.somjen.com/
Thats an expensive search. Go check out that site. Easy sale. Already spending money, you just need to redirect it.

Web design is the easiest business in the world to find new sales - you have a full list of them anytime you search anything. 

I have already covered what to say when they pick up in the comments below. If you can't sell to people with sites this bad then please go work on that, its key to making bigger money.  

Once you do a few websites, and get great results, it is even easier to sell. Slowly move up to larger and larger businesses. As you move up you will need to improve on some things like invoices, email communication, information request forms etc but you can learn it all as it goes. 

Ways to even boost more sales...
- Sales guys on commission (covered below)
- 10% referral or free work for businesses that promote you
- Working the network - Lets say you do a website for X Service in New York, then when its done call every other X Service in nearby cities. Show them your results OR call every other different business that is geographically close to X service. Work the connections
- Believe in what you do. I love helping people and I love my websites. If you treat this as some money scheme or scam people will be able to tell and you get sales. If you look at this thread its like 90% upvoted because I gave a lot of value upfront and people responded, its the same with companies. Not everyone will respond (just like this thread ha) but you only need 2/3 a month. 

***********************
AIM BIG
***********************

I did just as much work for $150 a month as I did for $15,000. Well maybe a little more work now but not much. Sales for a HUGE site and a small one takes the same amount of time, so does emails, so do calls, so does hosting, so does invoicing, so does 100 other things. The only bid difference is design and code but that is only 30% of a job. 

My point is it is easier to aim big. Aiming big pushes you harder and gives you the reward to keep going. Aiming small sucks and everyday is a drag. I have been there. So instead of dialing the small cafe dial Jimmys Tow Truck company, believe in what you can do and what you can achieve. 

Well that is it. This wasn't a ""here are the super secrets to $$$"", it was an AMA. These are my best answers and I hope you enjoyed them. I am still learning and still growing. I mess up all the time still but I keep the show on the road. If you think I am definitely wrong about X - maybe I am, but enough of this works to hold it all together. I got a lot of great responses and I am very grateful. If I was starting again I would have loved to see something like this and it probably would have saved months of time. Scarysaturday if you ever come to South America Ill buy you a beer to cheer you up. 

Thanks everyone.

Today's interview is with Cory Stout of [Woodies](https://www.woodies.com), a brand that sells wood sunglasses.

*Cory is a very active redditor - /u/sigmaschmooz - and he'll be in the comments to answer your questions*

**Some stats:**

* Product: Wood sunglasses.
* Revenue/mo: $250,000
* Started: August 2012
* Location: Venice, CA
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

I’m Cory Stout, Captain of [Woodies](https://www.woodies.com/).  I started a wood sunglasses brand when I was 28 years old.

Our main product is walnut wood sunglasses that I sell for $25 on Amazon and Woodies.com  I hired one employee (my dear mother) and she’s won Employee of the Year for 3 years in a row ;)

In 2018, I topped 3.5 million in revenue and somehow ended the year with less money than when I started!  I bought a Bentley to celebrate…



### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I studied Economics at the University of Florida but the real education was scalping football tickets outside of the stadium. I really learned my lessons on those streets...

I mean sure he needs to make money but perhaps hire local designers or part assemble locally or something.

In fact I'm willing to bet we will see a HUGE surge in made in the USA or hand made locally type requests within ten years.  ,2019-02-18 17:15:05
924,4ukvcf,False,,135,7 common mistakes seen when reviewing 20+ redditors websites (x-post smallbusiness),Entrepreneur,"Cross-posted from /r/smallbusiness 

One of the top questions I get from small business owners is: ""Why isn't my website making sales?""

Recently I [offered to review a whole bunch of /r/smallbusiness websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/4oepz6/free_professional_website_reviews_here_in_thread/) for free in order to get some business intelligence, and to generate some reciprocation so I could get some surveys completed (if you haven't done it, it's a real pain to try to get survey completes).

In total, twenty-two websites were put forward for review during the 2 days the offer was open. Twenty included an answer to the simple question I asked (and I reviewed one that hadn't by accident). So this is not a massive study, and it certainly won't meet academic statistical rigour, but you should find the results interesting and helpful if you're a website owner.

I found 7 critical website mistakes:

**No. 1: Does The Site Have a Compelling Email Opt-in?**

While all of the sites reviewed had an email opt-in somewhere, not one of them had a compelling incentive to have visitors opt-in. 

In general, email newsletters are not a good opt-in incentive, that's just not compelling enough:
> ""Sign up for our newsletter"" is code for ""We know you get loads of email, but if you subscribe here we'll fill your inbox with even more email you don't want to read"".

You could test using a discount coupon – but save your profit margin, you can do better than that!

Recommendations

* Offer the visitor something that solves a problem they have, ideally directly related to your business. ""Free Guide to XYZ"": guides, checklists and cheat-sheets are great.
* They must actually provide genuine value, but they don't have to be very long – in fact it's better if they're quick to consume.
* Then start offering them valuable advice and building your credibility with them through their inbox via your autoresponder sequence

**No. 2: Does The Site Have a Clear, Obvious Purpose and Visitor Benefits?**

The first thing visitors look for is something to let them know they're in the right place. Usually this a clear statement of purpose, or visitor benefits.

    ""What's In It For Me?""

Of the review group, 30% made the website purpose very obvious and clear via a tagline or headline what the site was about. 25% less so, and a whole 45% of the sites didn't make it clear at all.

Recommendations

* Have a tagline or headline front and center so that visitors know what they're looking at.
* Read ""Don't Make Me Think"" by Steve Krug to get a better understanding of what website visitors are looking for.

**No. 3: Does The Site Have a Strong, Clear Call-to-Action?**

After a clear purpose, the next thing to look for is the Call-to-Action. What action should I take? What does the site owner want people to do? Around 1/3rd of the sites did this well, with a strong, clear call to action (CTA), e.g. Book Now, Add to Cart, Contact Us, that stood out from the page content and told me what to do next. 25% had a weak call to action and 40% had none at all.

Recommendation

* ensure every page on your site has at least one clear, strong call to action that stands out visually from the rest of the page content.

**No. 4: Does The Site Have a Quality ""About"" Page?**

The About Page is the 2nd most visited page on a website – after the homepage – and crucial in building trust with a potential customer.

Only 10% of the sites reviewed had a good About page that included photos of the business owners/staff, names and a bit of background. The rest had far less, usually just a block of generic text that could be copied and pasted onto a competitor's site.

You're asking people to trust you with their hard earned cash, so you have to include more information than that.

Recommendations

* Include details of why you want to serve your particular customers and what you do for them
* Include the business owner and staff photos
* Include your street address and photos of the business location if possible

**No. 5: Does The Site Load Quickly?**

The slowest sites were WordPress based, probably due to lack of caching, the fastest were Shopify and one of the custom builds.

Recommendations

* If you use WordPress, enable caching.
* Reduce your image sizes
* Move to a better hosting company.

**No. 6: Does The Site Have Good Design Aesthetic?**

It's somewhat subjective, but most visitors recognise a professional design when they see it, even if they can't articulate the details. And it's a big factor in generating online sales. Visitors will spend money on a site they trust, and design aesthetic is crucial in building that trust.

There was a mixed-bag in the review group when it came to design aesthetic: almost a 3-way tie between good, average and poor designs.

Recommendation

* If you can, get a professional designer to tweak your site design.
* Reduce the number of fonts, colours and textures.

**No. 7: Does The Site Have a Responsive Design?**

In this study, thankfully the vast majority of sites were responsive. If you're one of the few who doesn't have a responsive website, you need to get to work on updating your website, or say goodbye to 50%+ of your traffic.

Recommendation

* If your site is not responsive, it's past time for an upgrade. Start looking for a responsive theme or talk to a web design company.

--

**The sites**

Here's some background information on the type of sites by type:

* Product or service: There was an almost even split of product to service business
* Customer type: also equally split between business-to-consumer (B2B) and business-to-business (B2C).
* The website platform or content management system (CMS) breakdown was 67% on self-hosted WordPress (.org), 14% Shopify, 14% custom CMS, and 5% Wix.
* Domain TLD: 75% were on .com domains, the rest were .com.au, .co.uk and .io.

613,82qupr,False,,111,"This Exact Process Got 1.4 M Views and 1,200 Email Leads in 48 Hours! (And Got Us Contacted By SharkTank!)",Entrepreneur,"Hey All! 


I’ve been asked about this several times - so I decided to create a short guide to share how my team and I got one of our clients 1.4 M views and generated over 1,200 email leads in 48 hours ---> And picked up by SharkTank!


This will probably be super useful to many of you - but realistically I cannot cover every technique in total detail (way tooooo long for a post!), so please ASK QUESTIONS FOR DETAIL ON ANY PROCESS. 


First off - I lied.


We did generate a ton of traffic and leads in 48 hours, but all of that was the result of a 3-4 month PR campaign. This means a lot of testing and modifying of our strategy to get the killer results and high ROI for our outreach.

---

Some background ---> 

We have a client that sells a simple, yet unique and useful product - an electric jacket warmer that can be installed on any coat to keep you toasty on those cold winter nights. 

Like most people with a product-based business, they want to sell more product. Part of his challenge was that his company was fairly new and his product was fairly unique (so not a lot of search activity). He wanted to build awareness around his brand and product, get some SEO backlinks to his site, and ultimately - sell more product.

---

The Challenge --->

Part of the problem with product-based PR is that a pitch like “Hey, I have a really cool product, will you please write about it?” straight-up sucks. 

Unless you have a pocket-rocket that will fly you to Mars and back - most of the time journalists will ignore your pitch. 

A pitch needs to have more than a product-summary to be successful and this can be really hard to figure out at times. However, using creativity and data - it is possible!

---

The Strategy ---> 

With his goals in mind - Exposure, Backlinks, Sell More - we began to lay out a strategy that would help him get there. We settled on two approaches:

1) Hard Pitches to the Press

2) Guest Posting

This is nothing new to PR - but I think the results of the campaign speak to the power of these strategies.

I’ll give some detail on both of these strategies, but first some numbers from our outreach to put this all in context.

In 4 Months:

-198 Pitches Sent

-110 Opened 

-38 Replies

-9 Successful Media Placements

This can give you some idea about how much work goes into pitching - you can send a lot of pitches and you will only get so much. Yes - it’s a numbers game, but you also need to have a solid strategy behind it to get anything.

Let’s look at the strategies in more detail…

---

Hard Pitches To Press --->

Pitching writers isn’t easy. Most good writers at decent publications get 30-50 pitches a day and don’t even read them all.

This means two things in order to get a response:

1) You have to have a great subject line.

2) You have to have a solid pitch that follows it.
 
This is an article I wrote on B2C that some may find useful: https://www.business2community.com/public-relations/create-pr-story-grabs-attention-01870169

In general - I think the best pitches are short (100-150 words Max!), straight to the point, personal (ie. human talking to human, not a PR machine blasting the whole world), and contain something that is relatable, interesting, or useful (data, research, etc.) to the writer.

The worst pitches are a copy and pasted press release that sounds like a fax machine wrote it.

There are two basic elements to pitching press:

1) Creating pitch angles

2) Creating target lists

Let your pitch angle guide your target list. You want to qualify the people you are pitching by sending them something relevant to their interests. 

Don’t be married to just one pitch angle - if you are not getting replies - then you need to change that angle!

---

Guest Posting ---> 

This is another solid strategy that gives you a little more opportunity to guide the content since you are creating it.

However, to be successful with this - you should always lead with value. People want great content, so don’t be a spammy backlink, re-hashed content kind-of-person. Editors and readers will love you if you create content that is actually useful.

I could talk for days about guest posting - but for the sake of brevity...

I wrote a super extensive guide on how to guest post here: https://powerfuloutreach.com/guest-post-anywhere-every-time/

Everything you need to know on how to do it successfully is there.

---

The Process ---> 

To be honest, the first month of our outreach sucked :(
Our pitch was very product-centric and we got very little response.

However, there is always learning in failure!

We started to tweak our pitch to focus more on the unique offering of his product and how it fit in to different winter lifestyle niches (skiing, hiking/camping, watching hockey, etc.)

We ran through 5 pitches before we got one that really started to work. That’s when we started to hammer down features in gift guides, reviews, guest posts, etc. 

The elements that helped our pitch become successful was:

1) Willingness to adapt based on results

2) Willingness to send out sample product (great for follow ups!)

3) Willingness to take all press opportunities

4) Pitch angles that had more than “hey, here’s my product!”


---

The 48 Hour Madness --->

We didn’t really hit a huge success until we got featured on a YouTube review.

If you have doubts about what I am saying - check the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCK-h-xXk3k&feature=youtu.be

This one video got almost 1.4 million views and the client received over 1,200 emails in 48 hours. He didn’t even have the stock to support the rush!

The bottom line here is - If a company can pull off a hit like this once every 4 months, it can make a huge difference on the annual revenue.

---

SharkTank Reaches Out ---> 

Our second huge win - came as a surprise. 

One of our early articles that didn’t have a big impact at first was seen by someone from SharkTank, who then reached out to our client to set up a call.

I admit - hard to replicate this, but goes to show that when you have press mentions out there - you can never be sure who will see it.

---

The Lessons To Take Away --->

Press is an insanely powerful way to get exposure and drive traffic, but it’s not easy to get the type of media mention that blows things up. 

It takes, testing, modifying, and persistence to get there.

The bottom line is - if you can get your company out there, it will start to bring insane traffic, but it takes time to get there.

Not every media mention will be a huge hit, but when one clicks the right way - it is a game changer for any company.

The ROI on a campaign like this is clear. The client spent around $1000 for 4 months of outreach. With 1,200 email leads for a $99 product - that’s $120,000 in potential revenue. Even if you cut the conversion rate to 20% ---> That’s 24x in ROI.

---

I hope this was useful to some of you! If you want detail on any process (target list building, pitch writing, guest posting, etc.) please let me know!

If there is enough demand for it - I can create a guide on some of these techniques and share some useful tools!

536,h7va0w,False,,130,I'm gonna do it- I'm going to go all in with my Knife-making company.,Entrepreneur,"I started making knives when I was in high-school and kept it up for fun through college as I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering.  Been working in manufacturing for some time and had a lot of success and learned a ton about business, but it just hit me earlier this week that the time to do it is now.  I'm a young homeowner with minimal debt, no kids,and a job I'm getting tired of.

What I do:  
Like I said, I'm a blacksmith and knife maker and I've been steadily growing for the last several years, until about 10 months ago when things just started exploding and now I'm struggling to keep up.  I specialize in rustic looking hunting/survival/camp knives but I've also done plenty of swords and historical reproductions and domestic products like wall brackets and hooks.

Finances:  
I usually make about $1500/day at special events and festivals and do another $2000/mo in custom work and online sales while spending only about 10 hrs/week in the workshop.  Doing this full time would let me go to more shows and build my brand so that I think it's feasible to make $50-60k PBIT in the first year.  My expenses have been high over the last couple years as I've invested in better equipment, but now I'm coasting at less than 10% materials cost.  

Growth:  
I recognize the potential risks of being self-employed doing work that depends on good health, so I'd like to eventually diversifying into less physically demanding services like teaching classes, renting out maker spaces, etc and hiring staff in the form of other smiths and support staff.

Timeline:  
I'm setting the tentative launch date to be February 1st 2022.  This is kind of a long way off, but I need to get my house in order and build the infrastructure needed to make an effective transition.  I also need to make absolutely sure that COVID isn't going to make a surprise return and shut down all my big shows and events.  I need to develop mailing lists, build a youtube channel, and secure more brick-and-mortar stores that want to carry my work.

&#x200B;

What else should I consider?  Has anyone else done something similar?  Hoping to get some good insight from this community.  Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/h7va0w/im_gonna_do_it_im_going_to_go_all_in_with_my/,571,"I fear you don't know your customer.  You will most likely only be successful if you have a very high profit margin where people are paying a premium for your skill. But, you are selling to spontaneous buyers at events. Also, you will likely only be successful if you can sell multiple knives to the same person and grow through referrals, again, not events. You need an online presence. It doesn't need to be fancy. Focus on social media and build a Shopify store or something similar is my advice. ",2020-06-12 23:04:00
311,65eybi,False,,287,"How I’m making $3,500+ per month selling dirt",Entrepreneur,"Yes, you read that correctly. I’m *literally* selling dirt and making a solid chunk of change. My name is Nick and I founded www.DirtByMail.com March 1st with my best friend Ryan. We anonymously send a bag of dirt to the dirtbag of your choice. The recipient receives the bag of dirt accompanied by a “You’re a dirtbag” card.


Ryan pitched the idea to me in the middle of February and I loved the idea. Ryan and I each agreed to put in a few hundred bucks to get us started. I created our website, ordered the “You’re a dirtbag” cards, set up a manufacturer in China for our bags, and talked with Ryan about how we would get the dirt, boxes, and other miscellaneous stuff. We figured out a plan, ordered the first couple hundred units, and decided to do a soft launch through my University. I sent some out to random people and watched as they opened up the packages, put it on social media, and laughed at the hilarious experience.

With that small success, we agreed the best way to officially launch the website would be through an Instagram Influencer, or someone who has a few hundred thousand/million followers. For a few hundred dollars, we got our ad in front of hundreds of thousands of people. We made sure to work with an Instagram account that posts funny memes since our audience is people who have a sense of humor. The ad was a success and we got a great return on that investment.

We continued to put up other ads with other accounts and have some great successes and great failures. The problems occur when you work with Instagram accounts that have bought millions of followers. You quickly learn that if an account with 10 million followers is offering you an ad for $40, it’s too good to be true.

In 45 days, we have taken in just over $7,500. After covering our costs for shipping and cogs, a good amount was profit but we're reinvesting everything right back into Instagram ads. An example of an Instagram post: An account with 2 million followers cost about $400 which caused about 4,000 unique visits to the site which turned into about $800 worth of sales. We usually get a 2x return on our investment with these ads.

Ryan and I are continuing to advertise with legit Instagram accounts and are having continued success. We are growing at a steady pace and have had over 1,000 happy customers in just under 45 days. We are really enjoying the whole process of working with our customers, fulfilling all the orders, and running a dirt company.

We would love to hear what you think of DirtByMail! We especially would love any fun/different ideas how we can market it. Thanks :)

604,bag663,False,,82,37yo- 17 years in business- Some more of what I've learned,Entrepreneur,"I made a couple of posts a while back and they got me thinking.

Ive become quite introspective recently, probably because Im going through a lot in life including a major home renovation while trying to bring up 2 young kids, a couple of changes in my business/career and running another business which sells online in another country.

As I mentioned briefly in those other posts, I’ve learned mostly from direct experience and practise but also from observing those others I have worked with and for. I learned a little from books but I advise mostly against it now if Im being honest.

Don’t get me wrong, books are invaluable and learning from the past experiences of others is the only way to truly learn about and navigate our way through life and business without taking too long about it. But that said- not one of the people I know reads business books- I know these guys very well and know it for certain (helped by the fact that a couple of them CANT read!)

Todays little post then is just to provide some advice that relate to a common theme I’ve seen on here and others more so than usual recently.

**Instead of asking ‘Which Business(es) Should I start’….. ask yourself ‘What Strengths and Skills do I want to build and use for the rest of my life?’**

Well let me start by saying that while wanting to start a business is both a noble and worthy aim- I think you’re better off trying to figure what skill set you would like to develop AND THEN go and start the business.

There is no one particular industry that you will fare better in over an other when you boil it down. My own successes and that of the people in my social and proffesional circles are quite varied and have changed over the course of our lives so you can probably really just choose any other than something that is obviously in its sunset years.

I try to avoid using specific examples of high achievers but when you look at successful people across all the spectrums from 100k a year mortgage free guy through to billionaire, many of them have had their fingers in several pies over the years and have often had success in a couple or more different industries.

What they mostly have done is developed a particular skill set- they figured out at some stage (not always early on either) what they could make money from. They didn’t always enjoy it and they weren’t always that good at it (trust me- several of the most successful people I know are not the best at what they do by a long way but they nearly always have a good work ethic and they don’t mind asking for the higher price- Im going to cover these and a few other mental models in another post)

\- One of them is a marketer and has made millions from selling waste removal services- he’s never driven a truck or emptied a dumpster by hand but he knows how to find people that need it doing and get someone there to do it for them. He learned his trade as an employee for a bank. He wasnt a marketer at the time but he became one and got good at it. He often says all successful banks do is market themselves better than the rest at their ideal customer.

\- One of them is a salesman- he can’t market for toffee but he will gladly turn up at peoples stores and restaurants without an invite and get them to buy the ice cream he sells. He then turns up a month later and gets them to buy some more.

He drives the freezer van himself and loads the customers freezer by hand. He’s now in his fifties and became a millionaire from it in his early forties. He used the difference between his credit line from his suppliers and his cash on delivery terms with this customers to buy properties in the mid to late 2000’s. He sold some of them at the peak and used the funds to pay some of the others off. He still rents the rest out to this day. He learned his trade from a national wholesale company and left to buy his own first van in his twenties.

\- One of them is an accountant, a bean counter. He’s bought and sold several businesses- his recent venture was a haulage firm, he’s in his seventies and this is likely his last one. He bought a large share of it with no money of his own down for around a couple of million. He sold off the trucks and leased them back.

He used the cash to buy a rival in the lower half of the country and did the same with that one. He then stopped supplying services to the bad payers/ too much hassle accounts and used the spare capacity to do more work for the better ones- He sold his share to a bigger rival a not quite 3 years later and made 2 million profit for himself. He doubled the wealth of the remaining partner in 3 years!

His first 20 years of work was schlepping up the ranks of a mid sized accountancy firm.

\- One of them is a programmer- He used to write/ edit automation software for manufacturing/ oil and gas companies and charged as much as he could on each job. He saved hard and put the money into shares and houses. He became a millionaire in his forties and then sold the company. He now works a few hours here and there and charges 1k a day when he does. He now plays a lot of golf but again spent his first 10 to 15 years working for an employer- skilling up & refining his programming skills.

\- One of them is a logistics guy that specialises in chemical storing and transport. He started out at the floor level of a chemical company and left about 5 years later to work for one of their customers. Just before he was about to leave he had the idea to suggest to the owner of the company he was going to that he would remortgage his house and put up half the capital to start a small offshoot company providing the service to his new employer but as half owner.

The owner agreed and they started the company- basically storing chemicals for theirs and other companies. He also became a millionaire in his late thirties/ early forties. The previous owner and he have started several other ‘offshoots’.

He’s uneducated and relies heavily on accountants etc- he’s a logistics guy though and knows it inside out.

One of them is an engineer- He’s dyslexic and doesn’t use email/ smart phone etc. He’s just retired after doing his last job on site. Its my pleasure that I was on that job with him and it is to him who I owe a good chunk of gratitude for my own success. Its his business that created the opportunity for me to create mine.

He worked hard and charged for it for 4 decades- he’s now hanging up his tools and is living from his stocks, pensions and property income- he is a low singles millionaire. He lives in a small but nice house in a nice area and spends most of the year on holiday with his wife. He’s a very happy guy.

His first 15 years were working for others in the mines and steel mills. He started out on his own when one of the big recessions hit (80’s I think) and he was let go. He approached his own mill to work here and there as contractor and did the same with others in the region. He built a steady customer base and served them and others around the country for the next 40 years.

I could go on to write about 30 or more people I know either personally or proffessionally (a lot more through business etc) but it would more or less be the same for all of them- they have a strength and use it.

The only difference between them and the rest of the people I know is:

1. They know and use their strengths wisely- all of them do this consciously I think.
2. They own the business they work for and hence get to keep the profit margin.
3. They are ‘good workers’. ie They do long days and put work first. They dont hide or shy away from the dog work, they just get it done and out of the way every time.

When I see people say things like ‘should I start an amazon/ drop ship/ other ecommerce store’, or should I do pressure washing, should I open a store/ coffee van etc etc etc- My first thought is ‘What about that do you want to do?’

If you are thinking of starting something online, I seriously think you could do well with just about any product you cared hard enough about to learn about- but the main point is what skills will you apply to you online business.

What you should be thinking about is: What are you personally going to apply to the problem as your own particular advantage. Are you going to be an excellent marketer/ logistics guy/ accountant/ purchaser/ salesman/ engineer etc.

You can only do so much yourself so what are you going to do and what are you going to farm out?

**Proof:**  
Ad Account 1: imgur.com/a/jQLCcer  
Ad Account 2: imgur.com/a/KMG14xT

Side Note: That may seem like a huge dollar figure to some, but others that's a daily/monthly budget. That said, I'm not bragging or presenting that figure as being HUGE. In fact, last year, I sat next to a guy in Dallas TX who spends $50,000 - $100,000 PER DAY! The rest of those sitting at that same dinner table was spending similar amounts. Okay, onto the lessons!

👨‍🏫 LESSON 1: A Compelling Offer - This may sound obvious, but you'll be surprised at how many people (including myself) push an offer that the market doesn't want or need. I don't care how seasoned you are at marketing, at the end of the day you can't polish a turd. In other words, if the offer sucks, it's not going to sell! I've even had zero response to offers I gave away for free!

Before you give up on your offer though, make sure that you've done a thorough job at testing (I cover more on testing in Lesson 3 below.) The main thing is to look at how you package your product/service. People must view your offer as having more value than the money their trading for it.

To boost the perceived value you may need to test different price points, and/or add extra bonuses offers that complement the offer. In some cases, it may even mean raising the price because people may decide ""it's too good to be true"" and conclude it's a scam. Believe me, when I say, people hand that word out like it's candy. Either way, make sure your offer is a no-brainer decision for the audience your targeting.

Another big mistake is creating an offer that is too broad for any specific audience to target. It's a lot more difficult (and expensive) to sell a generic product or service to a broad audience. Instead, get more strategic by creating your offer around a specific niche.

For example: If you sell a workout program it's smart to frame it around mothers who want to lose weight by doing yoga. In Facebook™, you can target moms who also like yoga.

Another niche could be future brides who want to lose 10lbs before their wedding. You could target engaged women who like 'Weight Watchers' or other weight-loss programs that they most likely failed at.

If you offer a sales guide, you can get more niche by framing it around Realtors.

Before creating an offer and kicking off a Facebook™ ad campaign, I'd recommend testing to see if sells or not to your existing email list. If it doesn't sell to people who know, like and trust you then you can bet it won't with ice-cold traffic!

The Bottom Line: If your offer is proven to sell and targets a specific niche audience, the bigger your chances for Facebook™ advertising success.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 2: Stick To Copy Principles - It's easy to overload your brain with ""new and improved"" strategies that sell. Truth is, not much has changed since the mid-1900's on Madison Avenue when advertisers were sipping on an Old Fashioned and writing copy. The only difference is the platforms we have to sell on.

For example, Photography has the same core lighting/posing principles whether you shoot with film or digital. Again, the difference is the tools we have available.

The most effective copy strategies that get people to take action the most is fear. Not saying you should scare the hell out of your audience, but instead teach them.

I just paid a guy $150 to do a radon test for a house inspection. I asked him to sell me on why I should do it...his answer? ""Because of high levels of radon cause lung cancer."" SOLD!

Another way is through urgency and scarcity. That's why I ALWAYS include a deadline to register for a webinar or to take advantage of a deal. Humans procrastinate, and until you give them a reason to pull out their credit card right now they'll have already moved onto something different.

Whenever I feel like I'm trembling away from copy principles, I'll flip on QVC or HSN and watch how they sell. These shows have been selling products the same way for many decades and haven't changed since. It just works!

Another bonus tip is that controversy sells and works well with social media. Dan Kennedy said it best, ""If you haven't offended somebody by noon every day, then you're not marketing hard enough."" I apply this in most of my Facebook™ ad campaigns and frame it as ""us against them"".

For example, if you sell design work you could talk about how they should fire their designers. Believe me, the designers will show up in your ads ready to throw rocks. ""Okay Brandon, I don't want rocks thrown at me!"" - It's a good thing because no publicity is bad publicity. And also, because now it becomes a movement for your buyers to prove to their now-enemies that they stand for what they believe. I mean...how do you think Trump won?

The Bottom Line: Stop falling for the shiny new techniques for selling, and focus solely on the principles of selling that have worked for many decades and more to come! I could write for days on various copy tricks (like how emojis grab attention). More importantly, before flipping on an ad I recommend learning how the consumer thinks with these two books that are packed-full of copywriting principles: 'Cashvertising' by Drew Eric Whitman and 'Expert Secrets' by Russell Brunson.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 3: Always Be Testing - Failing is an important part of success no matter what you do in life, and it's no different when it comes to Facebook™ advertising.

I CONSTANTLY fail a ton and often times it leaves me scratching my head and wondering if I'm even cut out to be a marketer in the first place 😂 But...I never give up, and no matter how months pass by I keep pushing forward. To put that in perspective, I've spent almost a year on one campaign that's just now starting to convert. That's worse case scenario but enough tweaking and you can truly turn ideas into long-term businesses. That's why I'm willing to spend that much time; because I know it can result in yearly salaries once it's dialed in.

I'm going to break down what's necessary to test, based on my personal experience...

Ad Creatives: The image of the ad is what grabs the attention most, and that's why I recommend a thick red border with a baby crying hysterically...just kidding! It's not necessary to be obnoxiously loud. What's more important is to is an ad that resonates with your audience.

My personal experience has been keeping the ad creatives real and relevant. Ad creatives that work well are collages, amateur-looking (NOT stock photos), testimonials, hyper-speed videos. Turn images b&w and they may perform better too.

Ad creatives constantly burn out, and do so weekly! NEVER be afraid to add new ones. I've made the mistake of getting emotionally attached to an ad image because it WAS performing but fizzled out. I kept trying different audiences and copy and wasted so much money. Now I'm constantly testing new images/videos and always finding new winners. Pretty exciting stuff and a big hurdle I had to overcome.

The Landing Page: This goes hand to hand with the ad itself. When someone clicks on your ad, they want to feel confident that the landing page matches what the ad states. Otherwise, it's called 'bait and switch' when they land on your page. If you invited them to a webinar in your ad, it must take them to a webinar registration page. If you offer a product in your ad, it must take them to a sales page for that specific offer. If there's any disconnection (words, imagery...etc.) then this is going to put a huge dent in your conversion rate.

I've read many split-testing books and here's what I've personally found to be the most effective on sales pages:

a.) The Headline: The headline sets the tone for the entire page. When someone reads the headline they should know exactly know what pain points they have, what your offering, and how your offer will benefit them. You'd be surprised at how many sales pages I've seen that I've reached the bottom of the page and still have no idea what they're offering. So be clear about that!

b.) The Price Point: Once I have the headline dialed in, I focus on the price. When I'm sending traffic to an offer I like to keep it under $50 so I try to make sure the value exceeds that cost.  
I'll split test prices at: $47, $37, $27, and $17. If it doesn't sell at those price points I'll even go down as low as $7.

A recent campaign I did just this, and as soon as I did that it started to sell. I'm averaging $9.38 CPA's (cost per action) which means I'm only losing $2.38 per sale which can easily be made up on the backend. I call that a success!

Side note: I put a lot of hours into thinking, creating, and marketing this product, but I don't allow emotion to get involved when it comes to reducing the price of my product. I'd rather have a product that sells 10x as much at $7 than not sell at all at $17. All I care is about being profitable so I can scale to the moon.

Also when it comes to pricing, don't give them too many options to choose from. Too many choices result in no choice at all.

If you're driving an immense amount of traffic then I recommend testing other things, like moving different sections around, button text, button color but personally I haven't seen much of an effect by testing this.

The Bottom Line: Test ad creatives, headlines, and price points.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 4: Avoid Overlapping - This is more on the tech side of ads, but when advertising you should have an ad that shows to a cold audience ONCE. Then set up a separate ad that retargets those who clicked but didn't' buy.

If you neglect this, you run the risk of what's called: Overlapping. This will depend on your audience size, and your daily budget. However, when overlapping occurs you're essentially showing the same ads to the same audience which may cause ad spend to hike because you're competing with yourself. It could also prevent your ads from spending at all.

The Bottom line: Avoid overlapping by excluding people who've visited your landing page and people who purchased from your cold traffic.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 5: Follow Up (Advertising Is Just The Beginning) - Some advertisers collect leads by giving away freebies like eBooks, cheat sheets...etc. Instead, I choose to send traffic directly to an offer (under $50) or send them to a webinar registration page. The reason is it sets the tone that indeed I have an offer and that I am NOT a charity for freebie-seekers.

Once you have a buyer, they're more inclined to buy more. Whether you're profitable, break-even, or in the red with your Facebook™ ad campaign you can scale even more by up-selling, or cross-selling through email marketing.

I try to email my buyers every day and it's proven to be profitable. I've also created businesses within my business by partnering with people and selling their product, as well as adding a phone salesman to sell higher priced offers.

The Bottom line: View Facebook™ advertising as only the beginning, because the money is in the back-end of your business.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 6: Have An End Date - Most advertisers (including me) want to flip an ad on and just let it keep going. That used to work in the earlier days but now it's about scheduling an end date on your ad set because of 2 reasons...

1.) It forces Facebook's™ algo to optimize faster and find similar people that resonate with your ad.

2.) It adds urgency which gets people to take action!

I'll notice with my campaigns 33% of sales will come in the last day during a week long campaign.

The Bottom Line: Facebook™ algo optimizes more effectively when you schedule an end date at the ad set level. Also people take action when there's an end date.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 7: Mix In Other Ad Platforms - A lot of my Facebook™ advertising success comes from integrating other ad platforms. My 2 favorites are YouTube, and Perfect Audience and use both for retargeting purposes.

When someone lands on my sales page and leaves without taking action I'll stock them as they surf the web.

Creepy? Absolutely. Profitable? Yes, here's a Y.T.D. screenshot of a YouTube campaign I'm currently running: imgur.com/a/lzQbehd

When someone visits YouTube after they leave my sales page without buying, a video ad of me teaching/pitching will play before their video (they can skip it of course!)

Perfect Audience allows me to put banner ads on websites they visit after they leave without buying.

Bottom Line: Retarget your Facebook traffic using other ad platforms.

👨‍🏫 BONUS LESSON 8: Get Your Rewards! - If you find yourself spending big on Facebook™, get a business credit card of some sort that will offer cashback or travel rewards.

That was a mistake I made all throughout 2017. Now I have the U.S. Bank Edge Select card attached to my ads account which earns me 3 points per $1 spent on Facebook™ advertising. I set it and forget it, and then by the time I remember I have around $2k - $3k in cash rewards that pay for one hell of a vacation :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/91hq5m/7_lessons_ive_learned_from_spending_15201053_of/,544,">I just paid a guy $150 to do a radon test for a house inspection. I asked him to sell me on why I should do it...his answer? ""Because of high levels of radon cause lung cancer."" SOLD!

222,4x3fwx,False,,108,Pro tip... online sites like Legal Zoom are a ripoff for things like simple LLC formation/EIN applications in the US. You can generally do it yourself on your state's business portal in a few minutes and save several hundred dollars.,Entrepreneur,"I hear lots of entrepreneurs/independent workers suggest sites like Legal Zoom or NOLO for things like LLC formation. I can't speak for all of them...but in my experience these are complete ripoffs for basic business formation in most cases, unless you're doing something particularly complicated.  You'll end up paying $300-$700+ dollars for something you could have done fairly easily for free + your state filing fee. 

Rather than paying LegalZoom $150 to register your business...nearly every state has a free online registration portal that walks you through the exact same step by step process, and usually takes less than 15 minutes. 

Then you avoid all of the other BS upcharges legalzoom/NOLO try to tack on.

 For example...on top of the base service rate, LZ tries to charge you $80 for ""EIN number obtainment""...which is something that takes ~2 minutes to obtain for free through the IRS site. 

They try to charge you $150 per year to serve as a registered agent.  However, you can put anybody in your filing state as a registered agent...including yourself. If you're registering something like an out of state Delaware LLC, there are usually lawyers that will do your whole registration for $50, and serve as your in-state registered agent for $25-$50/year. 
**edit: note on this....the registered agent's address gets published publicly. They're also technically expected to be at the listed address during business hours to receive official correspondence if you get sued or something. So it may be best to choose an actual office location (have any lawyer friends?) rather than your own address. But even if you pay a 3rd party agent it should be a lot cheaper than $150.**

They'll try to charge you $100 for a ""business license compliance report"". Which basically just tells you what business licenses you'll need. However, this can also be discovered for free with a very quick Googling ""*my state* business license requirements""...or a usually painless call to your state revenue department. 

$60-$120/year for ""Compliance Reminder Service"". i.e...emailing you once or twice a year when your filing forms are due. Just set a calendar notice and you're set. 

Then all of the other crap like $200 for ""expedited service"" or it will take 30 days. BS...it takes 20 mins start to finish.

If you need actual legal consulting advice, I suggest looking into something like AVVO. Many of their lawyers are listed with fixed fees for basic services like business registration consulting. Often cheaper than what the generic legal sites offer...and you're dealing with a real person.

2. Uninstall and remove all unnecessary plugins and apps - Often times, once a plugin is installed, it's never removed even if it no longer serves a useful function. Take your time and make sure to use only what you really need.
3. Use a content delivery network (CDN) - A content delivery network caches your images on its globally distributed network of servers. If a customer from the middle east visits your website that is hosted in the US, your website will load fast.

826,997kpi,False,,72,"""Window Cleaning Guy"" with an August update on my ""Race to $400,000""",Entrepreneur,"Hi guys.  It's been a while since I've given an update (lazy).  

&#x200B;

Quick back story for those that dont know.  The last week of Jan 2017 I found out that my corporate job of 10 yers was being eliminated.   On a whim I decided to start a window cleaning business to pay the bills until I figured out what I wanted to do.  My son (17 at the time) wanted to start the business with me so we went in as partners.  Around August of 2017 we added pressure washing to our business.  We closed out right at 140k in revenue in 2017.

&#x200B;

This years goal is $400,000 in revenue.  We are currently setting at $222,812 of completed or scheduled work which puts us 16k behind pace to achieve our 2018 goal.  October, November and December are the big months in my area so we have a reasonable chance at still achieving this.  

&#x200B;

For the last 4ish months I have been almost completely out of the field as my son is the crew leader of our truck with a tech working with him.  This has allowed me to focus on sales and also building systems to help us grow/scale.

&#x200B;

Aside from the day to day marketing/sales efforts my time over the last 45 days has been focused on creating technician training systems.  I'm documenting everything that I can think of:  how to turn our equipment on, how to do preventative maintenance, how to perform the services that we offer....  I've also been creating training videos and uploading them to a learning management system (Talent LMS for those curious).  I think that technician training systems is my current most important system to be working on as it will be my biggest issue for the next two years of growth as most of my staff will consist of technicians.  This area will be an ongoing effort.

&#x200B;

I just extended an offer to a new tech that will be our tech staffing to a total of three.  This will have our second truck on the road sometime next month.  I am currently recruiting for my 4th technician with the goal of finding the right fit by the second week of September.  

&#x200B;

After MUCH time spent dragging my feet I have finally found a commercial real estate agent to get me a commercial space.  We have submitted a LOI for a location and expect to be able to be in it in the next 30-45 days (fingers crossed).

&#x200B;

I've mentioned many times in my previous posts that accounting and bookkeeping are my biggest weakness.  I'm ashamed to admit that I have done such a poor job in this department.   Early this month I hired a full service accountant/bookkeeper.  He has already 'slapped me on the wrist' but said that all is well and that all lose ends will be tied up shortly.  This is a HUGE relief to finally have under control.

&#x200B;

Biggest challenges currently:  

Cash Flow.  I've spent a lot of money on equipment (truck for cash, skids, machines...).   I only pay myself a salary of $50,000 but its still a big drag especially considering that we are just now finishing up our slow months of summer (the summer was tough);  

Obviously finding good employees is difficult.  I'm having success with this but it takes a lot of time to weed out the bad ones;  

Just growing in general.  I could put a lot more money in my pocket if I wasn't putting it towards future growth.   

&#x200B;

Best things that I've done to date:  

implement an automated followup system with email, voicemail and post card automation.  I didnt get this in place until a year ago this week.  It has paid off already but is starting to get me even more repeat customers now that some time has passed;  

Creating and implementing a google review system.  We have almost 5  times the amount of reviews (almost 150 google reviews) as the second place company in my area and then there is a drastic drop off after those guys.  This generates a lot of calls for us and gives us credibility.  On a regular basis I am told ""We usually get multiple quotes but since your reviews are so great we are just getting one from you"".  The reviews make a bigger impact for our target customers (high end, expensive homes) as they are more concerned with the overall experience than just price;

Being purposeful and consistent with my inbound calls script and my sales appointment script.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The past 19 months have been an adventure.  My life has changed in so many ways for the best.  I've had some dark moments but I would not change anything because I love who I'm becoming and I am very excited about what the future holds for my family and me.   We have plotted out our revenue goals through 2020:  2019 goal is $800,000 and 2020 goal is $1,100,000.  I'm not positive that I am going to achieve my $400,000 goal this year but that is not changing our goals for 2019 and 2020.

3) Turning the documentations / learnings / systems into a paid community site could give you great margins and scalability. Back of napkin math:

1000 Interested community members, paying you $500/year is 500k/year with probably around 85%+ margins. You could be doing what you are doing here in the subreddit: Continuously teach, maybe with photos/videos/scripts/strategies/best practices/showing exactly which tools you used/where you bought them etc.

### Founding Stories Are Myths

Company founding stories are almost always non-malicious lies. Take Netflix:

Reed Hastings has [said](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/07-reed-hastings) [many](http://archive.fortune.com/2009/01/27/news/newsmakers/hastings_netflix.fortune/index.html) [times](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/2746816142?lang=en) [that](https://www.wired.com/2002/12/netflix-6/) [he got the](http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/reed-hastings/Reed-Hastings-Quotes.html) [idea](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reed-hastings-innovator-year-81514) for Netflix because he once was charged a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.

That didn't actually happen. 

It's unfortunate because it will inevitably mislead anyone learning how to start a company. 

### Sam Walton's Overnight Success
Sam was already 44(!) when he opened the first Walmart and had been running his own retail stores for over 15 years.

He wondered why people focused on the beginning of Walmart: 
> **Somehow over the years folks have gotten the impression that Walmart was something I dreamed up out of the blue as a middle-aged man, and that it was just this great idea that turned into an overnight success... 

> Like most overnight successes, it was about 20 years in the making**

If you're trying to build your own thing & you want to learn from ""the founder of Walmart"", looking at the start of the company itself is stupid because at that point he already had 15 years of experience

So let's start with Sam's very first store.

### The Biggest Mistake Of Sam's Professional Life
Sam started his retail career at 27 buying his 1st store, a ""Ben Franklin"" variety store franchise. 

As a beginner he relied on the franchise's playbook but also incorporated his own experiments. 

Things like:

* **putting popcorn & ice cream machines in front of the store to drive traffic**
* **doing huge discounts but actually making it up in volume (i.e. not ironically)**
* **buying directly from manufactures instead of going through the franchise (which allowed for cheaper prices)**

He worked hard on that single store for 5 years, grew sales 3.5x to $250k/year and became the #1 Ben Franklin franchisee in his six-state region.

But then he found out he'd made a gigantic mistake.

***When he signed the store lease he didn't include an option to renew it.***
 
The owner (a local department store competitor) saw his success & refused to renew the lease at any price, thereby forcing Sam to shut down the store.

Imagine working on something for 5 years straight, becoming the best at it, and then having a single person end it all.

Sam was devastated:
> **It was the lowpoint of my business life. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe it was happening to me... I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community - done everything right - and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn't seem fair. I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord.**

He was mad, but he accepted responsibility:

> **I've always thought of problems as challenges, and this one wasn't any different... I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time.**

If Facebook or Google change their algorithms you at least get to keep your old customer base and your business assets.

But with a retail store you have none of that. 

And because of the structure of the town they couldn't just open another store somewhere nearby.

The Waltons literally had to pack up their family of 6 and go find a new town.

If he'd wanted to Sam had plenty of reasons to sulk: they were starting all over in a *smaller* town (Bentonville) that also had its fair share of competition (3 other variety stores). 

**But Sam said ""it didn't matter much because I had big plans.""**
 
### Unsexy Determination
Sam spent the next 12 years in what I call *narrative lingo*.

It's the crucial part of any ""overnight success"" that doesn't get covered in the Successful Entrepreneur genre.

No one writes about all the random tangents and mistakes you make here.

Like, say, that time Sam tried to start a shopping mall 10 years too early and lost $25,000? 

Or what about the time a tornado destroyed his best performing store? All he had to say was ""we just rebuilt it and got back at it.""

This is important to know if you're trying to learn from Sam, but it doesn't fit into any narrative.

The lesson here is that there will be mistakes and problems on any path to success. As a recent book title says, [those obstacles are the way itself.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

A coworker said Sam excelled here because he woke up every day ""determined to improve something"", and that he was

> **less afraid of being wrong than anyone I've ever known...Once he sees he's wrong, he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.**

You don't get any of this from Reed Hastings when he talks about $40 late fees. You think ""oh I need a great idea"" when the reality is the idea is nothing and your psychology & persistence is everything.

Eventually Sam got to 15 stores & by 1960 was the largest independent variety store operator in the US, doing a a total of ~$12M (in 2018 dollars) in annual revenue.

### It Would Seem Obvious
It was here that Sam finally saw the opportunity for much bigger discount stores and got to work on the 1st Walmart.

He was the most successful independent operator in the US & had 15 years of experience in retail, surely it should have been easy for him to raise money from investors...?

Wrong.

Sam asked other store owners, entrepreneurs, competitors... basically everyone said no.

He got a measily 5% from his own brother & a store manager and had to borrow the other 95% (signing their house and all their other stores as collatoral).

***Even the great Sam Walton couldn't find investors to start the 1st Walmart, on the back of a near-perfect record in retail.***

### The 1st Wal-Mart
Finally, the point where most people look at to learn, is the end of our story.

The 1st Walmart was an ugly retail store (8-foot ceilings, concrete floor, wooden fixtures) but it worked because Walmart's prices always beat competitors. 

(Even the name ""Walmart"" was selected with customer prices in mind: it was cheaper to buy neon signs for 7 letters than the longer names Sam considered.)

And you think Sam cared 2 cents about what anyone else thought about his stores? 

The New York Times doesn't mention Sam or Walmart until 1969, 7 years after the 1st store opening, and he's just one random quote in the back of the paper.

And the Walmart 1970 IPO got a *single* mention on page 44 of the Times

165,9xw88i,False,,128,"Don't rely on Social media and Google ads, there are lots of other low cost ways to market your company.",Entrepreneur,"Full disclaimer, I'm not trying to sell anyone anything, I see too much of that now and I don't want to add to it. This is a short list of ways I've marketed my company outside the normal social media and google ads that everyone seems to be so caught up in. I've run several business now, mostly services, including a pressure washing company and a commercial refrigeration company. I've since sold the pressure washing company and am trying to get a energy management company off the ground. For most of you, this stuff is common knowledge, however I see a lot of new entrepreneurs here that only want to deal with online marketing.

&#x200B;

**1: Don't forget the basics.**

This one isn't too special, but I find people forget that not everyone is glued to the internet 24/7, and a lot of people straight up ignore Facebook ads. So this summer I payed my brothers kid to go door to door in several neighborhoods (1 per weekend) and drop an informative flyer along with a ""save the tax"" coupon in people's mail boxes. On average, for every 100 flyers (one weekends worth usually) I'd get roughly 10 new leads, half of which lead to paying jobs, each job averaged $250 and it cost me around $150 for 100 flyers and paying the kid $50 cash to deliver them. $1250 for $150 is a around a 833% return. The reason this worked so well for me is for two reasons, one is people don't think about ""extra"" services like, in my case, pressure washing. They see the flyer, look at their walk way and decide that they should have it cleaned. Secondly, timing is everything, I sent the flyers out in late spring before people had a chance to clean their own walkways, driveways etc. Honestly I never looked into mail delivery, I looked at it as a way to help a kid out with some summer spending money and keep my costs low. Another key point here is location, are the people in this area your usual clients? If not, then you might be wasting your time. Again, I don't think this is news to anyone but I was surprised by how many other business owners I've spoken to that have completely given up on physical marketing and switched to 100% digital.

Overall: $150 in material and labour, average of $1250 return after finding the correct market and time.

&#x200B;

**2: Your car is a billboard.**

I'm sure 90% of you have some sort of decal on your car or truck promoting your business, but when you stop into the market where do you park? I made a habit of anyways parking somewhere that stood out. If I go to the mall in my company truck I'll park at the very back near the exit away from everyone else. If I'm between two other cars in the center of the parking lot my logo isn't visible. Parking away from everyone else allows people to see, read and remember my decals as they drive out. On top of this I made sure to drive my company truck as much as I could, you're paying to own your car and you paid to have your name plastered on it, get it out there. Another key tip here is keep it clean, people are more likely to call a company with a clean, professional appearance than some rusty old pick up that hasn't been washed in two years.

Overall: $700 for custom decals on my truck, unknown ROI but I can account for at least $3000 in jobs from people seeing my truck. I wish I had a better way to track this other than asking people ""how did you hear about me"".

&#x200B;

**3: Sponsoring events, sports teams etc.**

When ever I mention this I always get the ""But I can't afford that"" response. Truth is, you probably can't afford to have your company name tossed around at a NFL game, but you can almost always afford to sponsor a youth league or other small local event. Be smart, if you run a clothing store geared towards young females, look for a dance studio or gymnastics club that would be willing to plug your store all season for $1000 and a member discount. You'd be amazed how many small organization will go for this and it gives you a whole year of advertising. Obviously, do some research, if that dance studio only had 15 kids, and the same 50 people coming to each event it probably isn't worth it. The other side is sponsoring specific events. In my case, I found out about a 1/8th mile mud drag racing event about an hour from my city, I called the organizers and offered to give away a few $250 gift certificates as well as wash one of the trucks on site to show off my mobile services. All in it cost me around $700, but I landed two commercial jobs cleaning heavy equipment. Again, this comes back to knowing your market, I also lost money twice sponsoring events, one was car show and one was a small county fair.

&#x200B;

Overall: If you can find your clients this is a great way to gain some business, however research is key. I figured that a county fair was the best way to pitch my business to farmers, turns out they're too busy doing their own thing. However if you catch them knee deep in mud when their in a great mood, you get to go wash some tractors.

&#x200B;

**4: Always leave a business card.**

This one is super simple but so many people forget about this. Business cards are dirt cheap and very professional looking. Every time I see a cork board in the entrance of a restaurant or a shop I ALWAYS take the time to put one of my cards on it. Every time I do a job I make sure to leave a card. The more cards you have floating around the more chances you have of being seen. This past summer I went through over a 1000 business cards for my pressure washing company. I hand those things out like candy, even if I'm just giving someone my number for an unrelated reason I'll always give them a card. I've heard so many people say ""I ordered 1000 business cards and they lasted me years!"", thats wrong, they shouldn't last you years they should be distributed as fast as possible.

Overall: This one is a no brainer, but people only seem to hand out cards to people they've already sold to. Everyone could be a customer or a client, everyone gets a business card.

&#x200B;

**5: If no ones talking about you, start the conversation.**

Alright, I've been called shady, manipulative and a whole list of other things for this one. But it works, and it's currently my number on marketing tacit with my energy management company. I've had no problem landing commercial clients, however I've struggled a lot with residential clients. So what I did was start a second Facebook account under a different name, join a big local Facebook group and make a post about how high my heating bill was and what I can do to fix it, once the conversation got started I got my wife to plug my company and explain a bit about what we offer without making it sound like a sales pitch. It was something like ""You know you can get company X to come over a audit your house for fairly cheap, it's a lot better than throwing money at things you don't need"". It. Blew. Up. I had over 20 inboxs from people who were commenting on that post and got several jobs from it. It was by far the best method I've ever used to kick start a business. Those jobs landed me other jobs via word of mouth and most of those people who comment on the original posts are heavy Facebook users and they're constantly tagging me in similar posts. It's been the holy grail of marketing for me in term of residential work. For some, it's a little too deceitful, but oh well, it works. I think it's because people don't like being sold to, we're flooded with advertisements all the time and more and more people want real recommendation from other people rather than a Facebook ad. I've retired my fake social media accounts, but it was a excellent way to kick start my company after I sold my pressure washing business.

Overall: This, in my opinion, is gold. It's been my best campaign so far and it keeps on giving. Social media is good for much more than traditional paid ads.

&#x200B;

In the end, most of you seasoned business owners will know a lot of this little tips and tricks and probably more that I don't know about. But I spend a lot of time creeping this sub reddit and everyone is so caught up in SEO this and Facebook pixel that. Those are excellent ways to attract business, I use them, but it never hurts to get back to basics.

916,2seo0w,False,My Success Story,227,"Here's what SEO, Wordpress and lead generation can do for you",Entrepreneur,"I have been working a side hustle for the last 2 years using some local SEO techniques to gather leads for a major corporate office developer. After 2 years of selling them 2-30 leads/month on the ""boston office space"" type traffic they brought me in 2 weeks ago and asked if I would be interested in developing a similar site for them or revamping their website. 

I thought about it for 5 minutes as I excused myself to goto the bathroom.

Really it was a stall tactic to think about how much I should charge them. But then I said why does a $Billion valued developer in the Boston MA area ask a guy to ""make us a website too""? I was looking for the angle.

Then I thought ""how many leads have I given them in the last 24 months?"" and ""how many total leads have they received on there own with me?""

The first I could answer myself. I looked in my gmail account and brought up the last monthly report invoice I've sent them and figured it was about 400 leads in the 24 months we've worked together. If an office space went for $15 per square foot/year and the average space was 2200 sqft. Then that's $33,000 per year they're making 1 of my $30-$75 lead. If I sent them about 400 leads and if they closed even 10% of them then that's $1.3 million in revenue I bought in to them in 24 months.

So I walked back into the meeting (checking my pants zipper to be sure it was closed) and thought of a number to develop the same thing I had made. I was about to tell them $50,000 to make the same site and I would basically do the same thing I did with my own site.

Right before I got to that part I mentioned to them in small talk about what I did and the SEO stuff and one of the executive type guys asks me about the means I've been using to generate leads. I told them I had some websites that I sold leads to to a few clients in the ""boston office space"" industry. 

The guys face dropped and he said ""You're selling to other companies too?"" 

I told him yes because the contract we had in place said each lead can not be resold and they were not exclusive. Long story short they wanted exclusivity to all the leads and for me to cut out the other clients. I told them I would have to work some numbers and get back to them.

Trying to read their faces in the room to see if they were pissed or greedy for all my leads, I know how lazy I am at times and another long term contract with this client seemed boring to me. I threw out the idea of just selling them the site I had and do minimal maintenance on it for them.

They asked me to step outside and I was sweating myself thinking I just fucked up. After about 10 minutes they brought me back in and talked and BS'ed for about 20 minutes and all I can think about is what they were thinking. I checked my phone 3 or 4 times as I got texts and it seemed to make some of them nervous. One guy sat up and said ""Would you be willing to sell your site to us for $50k and help us maintain it?""

A got a lump in my throat and thought ""SHIT what do I do""

Trying to seem cool I said I would have to think about it. I knew that I billed them a little under $30k for those 24 month and both years around november - january it was all but dried up.

Some more talk and they said they're weren't going to let me leave without making a deal so what would it take. I said ""If you want to part with $100k I can deliver the site this week"" They seemed to jump at that and we all shook hands and I kicked myself quietly in the ass for not saying at least double that. The way I look at it now a few days later is that I don't have to put in a few hours/day to maintain, report, invoice and make sure the assistant I email leads to gets everything. AND I got about 3 years revenue coming in now without having to do any more of that work.

[check please](http://imgur.com/bOVNxyz)

Oh and I also wanted to say that I DID NOT post that photo to show off. I just wanted to share what I could and let you guys know what's possible with the right website in the right industry.

I've got websites in industries that you would laugh at. Stupid ideas of mine that went no where. Most I get lucky on but I'd like to think I have a better business sense within the last few years where I can figure out if an idea of mine would be profitable.

Just a little motivation for you guys.

683,4aaeer,False,,43,Study reveals the pitch deck that will land you millions,Entrepreneur,"Full text with slides can be found [here](http://startupfundraising.com/study-reveals-the-pitch-deck-that-will-land-you-millions/).


This study from DocSend gathers data from over 200 pitch decks. Most of these slides are from early stage startups executing at a Seed and Series A stage.


It takes on average 58 investors that a startup needs to contact in order to secure at least 40 meetings. This is obviously 59 investors where there is a warm introduction. VCs never pay much attention to cold calls or call emails. For them warm introductions act as a way to perform social proof or validation on the individual that is looking to connect with them.


In addition, the average length of the pitch decks averages 19 slides with an estimated time of 3.44 minutes that investors allocate to them on average. VCs and other investors that are sophisticated will probably meet with an average of 1,000 entrepreneurs on a yearly basis in person. This does not event count the pitch decks reviewed. In my modest opinion, 3.44 minutes seams high and for that reason you want to be able to capture the investor‘s attention on the first couple of slides of your pitch deck.


In terms of design and slides that entrepreneurs should include on their pitch deck, the study shows that successfully funded pitch decks included the following slides:


-Product

-Team

-Business Model

-Market Size

-Company Purpose


Other slides that are also included with less frequency are solution, why now, competition, and financials.


In terms of the order of the slides it is very similar to the order that Sequoia has on its recommendation that can be viewed here. In summary, the order of the slides is as follows:


-Company Purpose

-Problem

-Solution

-Why Now

-Market Size

-Product

-Team

-Business Model

-Competition

-Financials


The most important slide in this regard is the financials. Here you are showing the investor what kind of traction you have been able to generate and also the type of projections that you expect a few years down the line. In this slide there is no need to go into detail but a clear summary with a few lines showing revenue streams would be ideal.


The other slides that make the top 3 of the pitch deck are the Team and the Competition. The team is critical as you want to demonstrate the investor that you have the right people on your team. 


In terms of timeline, the study shows it takes for a Seed round on average around 12 and a half weeks to close from start to finish. This is obviously different from what I have seen in Series A rounds that take on average 3 to 6 months to close.


There are certain factors that influence the amount of time it takes for the closing of a round of financing. These factors are for the most part related to the way the financing is structured. If you are raising on a convertible debt it will take less time as there are just two documents that need to be signed and only 3 things where the investor and the company need to be aligned. These are the interest, the discount and the cap. However, if you are raising capital via the sale of equity then it will take 3 times the amount of time.


In addition, if you are doing a seed round you will be dealing for the most part with individuals where the due diligence process is much faster. In Series A rounds of financing you will have institutions like Venture Capital firms involved where they have a specific procedure to follow and where you will need the approval from more than just one person. In this regard, Venture Capital firms are investing the money of their investors as opposed to angel investors that are investing their own money.


As always in life it is more important the quality than the quantity. The quality of the connection will increase your chances of getting funded after your investor meeting. Contacting more investors will get you more meetings. However, more meetings does not necessarily mean more money in the bank. The key to fundraising success is to get the money in the bank ASAP and for that reason you need to be as effective as possible with your time and strategy.


In terms of verticals the study determines the easiest ones are consumer, business, marketplace, and hardware. The average amount of funding raised across the board is $1.7M. Interesting factor is that marketplaces tempt to be the ones with the most amount of success. However, marketplaces are more difficult to find due to the famous egg and the chicken issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4aaeer/study_reveals_the_pitch_deck_that_will_land_you/,492,"This is the same thing as saying ""Study reveals using a digital SLR camera makes you a professional photographer.""

Business 1: I had a great idea. I listened to this podcast on Shopify where someone who produced mouse mats for the gaming community was interviewed. The founder told his story, explained how he got started and with no marketing, through Reddit found his [first adopters](https://rykovmedia.com/2019/11/12/finding-the-first-adopters-clients-for-your-startup/).

I thought: “What a sucker. I can do better.” So, what did I do? Well, I decided to follow in his footsteps. I found suppliers on AliBaba, narrowed it down to two manufacturers, and made a modified mouse pad. It was huge and awesome, with a cool logo. I created a Shopify website, and set everything up.

I then proceeded to post an image of the pad on Reddit asking for feedback, thoughts, etc, thinking orders will pour in soon - two random comments would also be chosen, and I would offer a free mousepad to those people. I got the post to go to the top under the subreddit and I felt like things were really going my way. And then I read feedback.

“Adjust this”, “change colour”, and even worse “i hope I win”. Very useful that last one…

Sigh.

I contacted the manufacturer again, asked to make adjustments and then proceeded to order a full batch, as another sample on its own would have cost too much per piece. **MISTAKES WERE MADE.**

After I ordered the batch, and it arrived, I posted a new image on reddit. Got more engagement, and selected two winners.

At the same time I began to spend money on Facebook Ads. FACEPALM. (I didn’t have a lot of money, so I literally could only give this 2–3 tries, and then I was broke).

Feedback from the two winners - great material, awesome design… not very convenient. Turns out you need more space for your mouse…

After running ads for 2 weeks and getting **0 orders,** I had to rethink my idea completely and pivot business into a completely different field.

—

What can you learn from my failure?

**Don’t stop with the feedback**. I decided after the first feedback to go ahead and order a full BATCH, without asking for customers’ opinion again. **ASK FIRST**. Don’t commit until you know you got something all of your potential clients want.

**Marketing comes second**. Look for free ways to advertise. I failed, but Reddit was a great source of essentially [free marketing ](https://rykovmedia.com/2019/11/27/how-to-advertise-for-free/)(excluding the price of samples and delivery costs). Add marketing afterwards - good advertising and marketing goes a long way, but you don’t have to spend £100s initially. Hussle.

**Small improvements do not matter**. If you think you can make small improvements to your competitor’s product and immediately convert their clients to yours… think again. There is a reason their clients are loyal to them. It’s not always about the product. And people DO NOT CARE about small improvements. Do your own thing, make sure it’s 10x, 100x better or the market will destroy you.

Going back to feedback - before starting anything, ask yourself **would I use this, and would other people use this.**

Good luck, and avoid some of the mistakes I have made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/g5hyry/dont_do_this_if_you_are_starting_a_business/,385,"So here's my issues with the whole internet drop shipping business. The market is soooo saturated.. It doesn't matter if you succeed or if you fail. Shopify/Alibaba/Facebook (ads) make money regardless. It sort of allows people to attempt to create businesses lazily.

My key takeaway is if you've seen it done already you're already too late. Good example is the minimalist watch brands (people try to become like Daniel Wellington because they cost $2 to make and sell for $200). I've seen so many shopify stores for silly watch brands now it drives me crazy.

**I wish** people made businesses the old fashioned way - find a problem and solve it. Good old innovation will get you far. Good lesson learned and I hope you didn't spend a fortune

Side note - On my blog I talk about how I'm starting a business from absolutely nothing and I'd love your feedback! In fact I rant about shopify in my first post hahaha. If you want take a look I'd love the feedback!

I just want to make enough to live comfortably and be able to pay my expenses while having enough money to use for entertainment and leisure. I'm not a materialistic person so the super expensive things in life don't really appeal to me.

I would be content with just making $50,000 every year from whatever business venture I decide to embark on. I don't plan on getting married and having kids because it's just not fit for me.

Is it possible to reach this goal of mines, and how long do you think it would take to make $50,000 every year as an entrepreneur?

288,a2d99l,False,Feedback Please,279,Did you ever get frustrated when you decided to travel to a new country? I made a website to help you with that by finding visa requirements for 200+ countries,Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit!

I spent the last 6 months trying to build [Visalist](https://visalist.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=entrepreneur). Now your quest for tension free visa requirements research is over.

Here's why I made this web app:  A year back I became a digital nomad and started traveling. I wanted to visit all the countries that I fancied. Soon I realized that you need a visa to most of these countries, few have VOA(Visa on Arrival) and for others, you have to get it through their embassy in your home country(in my case India). So now I wanted to see the countries I could go without waiting for 3 weeks to get a visa, did some research. After few blogs and websites finally got the list. Traveled to a new country. After few months I wanted to go to another country. I had to do the same search, couldn't find the old one, found a new site which had more countries offering VOA. One of my friends told me that when he researching for Vietnam visa, he found almost 10 websites with .gov and it was really confusing. Many blogs don't have links to official websites of embassies.

To summarize the problems:

* No aggregated info of visa related info shown in a useful way.
* Most of the existing blogs and website has very less info and are usually outdated.
* Lot of research is needed even to go to a single country and this needs to be done every single time.
* Difficult to find the official website and data on many websites is outdated.
* Pay more than required money to visa agent's

So I took the matter into my own hands and decided to aggregate this info, organize and present it in a useful way to the user and so [Visalist](https://visalist.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=entrepreneur) was born. While I was talking to my friends about this, I realized many people wanted something similar from a long time. So what this has is

* A simple way to find the basic requirements for all the countries you want to travel
* Simplified visa requirements like visa-free, visa on arrival, visa not required, evisa, visa required and visa refused (Yes! For North Korea)
* A simple map color-coded with visa requirements across the world so you can easily see which countries around you can easily travel to
* Visa Requirement details like duration, documents checklist and other requirements for the stay
* Which is the official website for that information

I coded, designed and built Visa List using VueJS with NuxtJS for the frontend, MySQL for backend using Golang. I was originally an android developer and learned these just to build Visa List.

I believe every person who wants to explore the world around them and would have faced the problem I faced, so could find value in what I have built. So I would love to know what you think of this and would be more than happy to hear your suggestions and feature requests. Let me know what you want to be added or removed or do I need to build something entirely!

702,71qixe,False,,201,"TIFU By going to a ""Free"" 3 day seminar on Millionaire Mindset.",Entrepreneur,"So a few months ago I signed up to a 3 day seminar by T Harv Eker called 'Millionaire Mind Intensive'

I didn't know what to expect, haven't read any of his books but I figured it was free and I had nothing to lose. Turns out ""Nothing is this world is free"" rings true.

Like many people in this sub, I read many books, watch tutorials and do courses to increase my knowledge,  but this was my first seminar of this kind, and it was BULLSHIT.

Now don't get me wrong, there was information to be gained and the Guy doing the seminar was very funny and charming, but the whole thing was just a slimey sales pitched aimed at making money of vulnerable and unsuspecting people.

It was filled with "" GIVE THE GUY NEXT TO YOU A HIGH FIVE AND SAY YOU'VE GOT THE MILLIONAIRE MINDSET!"" and ""SCREAM LOUD IF YOU'RE READY TO BECOME WEALTHY!""

I  decided to go with my gut and leave at the first break due to a number of red flags and the fact that I couldn't take anymore

**Red Flag 1.** We were all messaged before the event to bring 100 pounds in cash for ""activities""
**Red Flag 2** The Speaker went from sleeping on his brothers floor and £100,000 in debt to financially free in a few years and didn't explain any details how.
**Red Flag 3** The speaker would barely touch on a subject and then say "" we do this really good course which goes into this a lot more""
**Red Flag 4** One of his courses will teach you how to consistently earn 25-30% returns from investing in the stock market. I've done enough reading and investing to know that is complete bullshit.
**Red Flag 5**  Sctrict no videos or photos of the event because "" this is a safe environment and people won't feel comfortable participating if cameras are around.
**Red Flag 6** All three people I had met in the time I was there had read T Harv Eker's book and it had said to attend the event when it's in your town.
**Final Red Flag** In  2.5 hours of sitting there, the only thing that was taught is Passive Income streams which I already knew.

I felt like a sucker for even going, but decided to cut my losses and leave as I couldn't handle another 9 hours of it ( The event is 12 hours a day and over three days!)

This begs the question, are there any genuine events these days not aimed at taking your money for very little valuable information?

TLDR : I fucked up traveling an hour to  go to a Millioionare Mindset event which turned out to be one big sales pitch.

Edit: I'm treating this now as a good thing as some of you have mentioned that it might save other people from signing up to these style of events!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/71qixe/tifu_by_going_to_a_free_3_day_seminar_on/,487,Sounds like Trump University  ,2017-09-22 12:02:21
749,85k3gp,False,Startup Help,111,How To Build Awesome Landing Pages / Websites - A Noob Guide by Me,Entrepreneur,"I've been heavily involved with 3 startup businesses each with six figure revenues in the past 2 years. I wanted to make a video series that gives practical, no bullshit advice. It's partly a way to challenge myself to make content in my spare time (rather than play video games), but I also think I can offer some lessons that others can genuinely learn from. I'm not claiming to be hugely successful, yet.

One of the things that I always see, on this subreddit and elsewhere, is people who think starting a business has to cost a lot of money. My approach is always to do as much as possible in-house, at least at the start. We make our own websites, do all of our own branding, run all our ads etc.

So I've decided to make a series on creating successful websites using WordPress. The series might evolve to include other types of videos as I go along. The focus will always be teaching ""quick and dirty"" methods. Not the most professional, but methods that give you quick results and help you to launch a lot quicker.

The hardest part about running a business is always (from my experience) getting customers. So I always try to get my product out as quick as possible. I can build the perfect website later on, once I've actually got customers.

This first video is showing how to make landing pages - but the skills can be applied to make any kind of page. If you don't think you have the skill to make a website, I'd recommend watching. If you dedicate a week of your time to learning how to make basic WordPress websites, getting new websites out becomes a much smaller task, which is awesome when you're starting up.

Very little coding knowledge required (a bit of CSS and HTML might help).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYKqUNgLjjM

tl;dr I'm making a video series based on practical advice for starting a business. The focus is on WordPress websites. I want to show people that doing a lot of work in-house can be fast, cheap and help you to launch much quicker.

257,a3ppu2,False,,317,Do not use GoDaddy to Register your Domain,Entrepreneur,"Other Domain registrars may do this, but it seems to be the most prevalent with GoDaddy, I'll just get right to it. They buy domains you are searching for and then try to re-sell them back to you as a ""Premium Domain"" for %1000 more or a lot of times even more, I normally see it go to the base ""Premium Domain"" of $2,500. They offer domains for $1 as a deal a lot of the times to get you searching for a domain on their website, through this I assume they check for trends and buy high trending word uses and popular phrases. This is such a dirty practice for a company who is there to offer an easy solution to purchase a domain for a lot of times peoples first company, website, and hosting plan.

The competition is weak. The market is growing. The costs and risks are low. The odds are good. You can analyze the market and make accurate decisions on where to enter. You can win.

Start small. Start low skilled and low risk if you don’t have any capital or experience. As the opportunities grow and you get momentum your business can evolve. If you have capital and are willing to invest the time and money you can find very profitable niche services. The more specialized you can get the better the margins and the better the chances of success.

These are not commodities. You can always add more value and avoid competing on price and racing to the bottom. There will always be customers willing to pay a premium for better and faster services. The biggest gap in most of these industries is speed. Service providers are overloaded so they are booked out 1-2 weeks. They have more business than they can handle. If you can deliver a consistent service tomorrow you can charge 50%-100% more.

If you have a tech background or can apply basic tech you have a huge competitive advantage in these spaces. The companies that currently dominate don’t have the tech to get you quick quotes. They don’t have the tech to manage employees or schedules or billing.

One of my co-founders u/millionaire_ made a quick [AMA a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ad6ht3/thinking_about_doing_an_amamaybe_this_will_be_it/) which seemed to get a lot of interest. I wanted to expand on some of  the successes he talked about and make a few posts around our marketing  strategies! If you haven't feel free to check out the AMA he did. There are some useful nuggets in there :).  
I've been following the r/entrepreneur and r/startups for  the past 4 years and have received some amazing advice, read some great  stories, and have contributed some of my knowledge here and there. I started my company a little over 3 years ago and have had great mentors along the way. Now I would like to give back a little and share some of  my own experiences.  
**Background**  


I’m one of 3 founders. We’ve grown our company to 20+ employees, 2 outstanding products, millions of dollars of revenue, and an 8 figure  valuation. We have a long ways to go and still have a lot to learn.  Every day is a grind and we’re all putting in about 10 hours a day. Are we burnt out? Not even close. We have a huge opportunity in front of us  and we’re all on the same page as to what our vision is.  


I'd  like to make a post every week going over different platform algorithms, destroying competition, understanding how to monetize your market, high level marketing, and much more! I'll start this first post off with a bang and cover some key things to consider in the competitive marketing landscape.  


**Marketing 101!**  


Sales and marketing are arguably the 2 most important things in business. They go hand in hand. If you have a product market fit and test enough marketing tactics, you will find tactics that work for your business. This allows you to scale a business at an extremely fast rate. Really understanding your metrics, customer's needs, retention, and other factors are key for any growing company. There are a few things that you need to consider before marketing.  


**1. Who are your target customers?**  


**2. Where do your target customers go?**  


**3. Who are the decision makers from these companies and where do they go? (For B2B)**  


**4. Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  


**5. Where do those existing relationships go?**

**Who are your target customers?**  


Identifying your target customer is very important. For my company, we focus primarily on home service companies. There are thousands of home service companies so we narrowed down to home service companies who have  websites. Then it turned into focusing on plumbing, HVAC, and electrical companies. Next, how do we know a company can afford marketing or technology products? We narrowed down to companies who have at least 5 service technicians. As we grew, we started to focus on companies who have 10+ technicians. Larger companies tend to be more stable, willing to spend more, and are easier to retain and build a relationship with. If they have between 5-9 technicians they should be spending money on  Google ads, Facebook ads, billboards, etc. If not, we don't waste our  time, or their time.   


This was just the beginning and how we started with our first product which was a lead gen product. As we grew an ancillary AI chat product that can cater to multiple industries, we expanded our target market with similar requirements. Now we target home service companies, dental practices, medical practices, attorneys, real estate companies, home builders, and larger enterprise deals.  


It's important to pinpoint who your target customer is so that you don't waste time and money on the wrong people. Your target customer might change as time goes on (it definitely has for us). Be mindful of deals that you are closing and try to recognize similarities between them all.  


**Where do your potential customers go? Primarily the decision makers!**  


First  you need to identify who the decision makers are from the company! In our case, the decision makers for both of our products are typically the marketing managers and sometimes the owners/CEOs. It's not always the CEO so be mindful of this. So where do we reach these people?  


**Are they on Facebook?**  


**Are they on Instagram?**  


**Are they on Reddit? (Most of our clients don't even know what Reddit is haha)**  


**Are they on LinkedIn?**  


**Do they check their emails? How do we even get their emails?!**  


**How can we get in front of them in person?**  


**How do they make their purchasing decisions? Online, in person, via demos...**  


These  are all questions you need to ask yourself. A lot of times you will know where your target customer DOES NOT go, so you can eliminate those from the list. For example, a lot of our customers are 40+ years old and have very specific purchasing patterns. Because of this, we didn't invest our time into marketing on Instagram.  


For  us, our most successful marketing campaigns come from in person events, email marketing, LinkedIn marketing (paid and organic), and retargeting on Facebook.  


Trade shows and conferences are huge for us. We typically bring 5 people from our team to have 2 people at our booth and the other 3 running around the event grounds talking to ANYONE THEY CAN. Clients, other vendors for partnerships, manufactures, literally anyone. We close deals on the spot, schedule demos for the upcoming weeks, and begin partnership conversations. Not only that, but people start to recognize our brand.  


After the event, we had collect so many emails, schedule meetings, and always purchase the event email list if we could. This is used to email market and our sales team would call everyone and say something like ""we were the booth with the nerf guns and gave away the free bags.""  By the way, free bags at events are HUGE because everyone becomes a walking billboard for you. ;)  


Now that they have seen us in person, we would add EVERYONE on LinkedIn (if  they had one) and set up some paid LinkedIn ads to the companies in attendance.  


Then we set up some basic Facebook retarget ads so they are seeing us everywhere for the next month. All of this makes the sales team's job much easier when they are calling the potential customers. Everyone is basically a warm lead at this point knowing we are a legit brand/product. We close multiple deals per day, per rep in the coming weeks after an event.  


**Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  


Now  that we're closing a lot of 'one off deals', we would think... ""how do  we 10x our growth""? What's slowing us down? With our AI chatbot, we install on a website, so during every sales conversation, we would have to get in front of the agency who controls their website. BOOM. ""WE HAVE TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE AGENCIES."" They are the ones who control the websites. How do we incentive them and speed up our growth? This was the start of our channel sales/marketing strategy. Give the agencies a revenue share to sell to their existing clients. We are very generous  with our revenue share, and we have the best product in the market so it's a no brainer for both parties.  


Now instead of closing 10 deals a week, we can close 50-100+ because of our channel partners. Our dev team built the backend and we made the  process as simple as possible for all of our partners. Now we're writing checks for tens of thousands of dollars to our partners every month. Better than spending it on marketing and investing in massive sales teams. Our main focus has become growth through channel partners. We have a small sales team and our margin is higher with them, but we grow  faster through our partners.  


Side note... This mentality can be translated to B2C through influencer marketing. Who are your consumers following? Instagram models are making a living for getting paid to feature certain products. YouTubers also  get paid to more money than their CPMs to feature products on their channel. If you can find the right people, it works like a charm.  


**Where do those existing relationships go?**  


In our situation, LINKEDIN is a goldmine. Not just from a standpoint of adding/messaging, but we pay for LinkedIn ads ever day. Once you add their decision makers on LinkedIn, start doing more paid ads, more organic posts showcasing top clients, the snowball effect begins. We try to schedule as many calls per week with agencies to get them reselling our product. We also meet a lot of people in person at our events so those conversations become pretty easy. Eventually, the agencies started messaging us.  


For larger partners, it's pretty standard to fly out to meet in person and get terms hashed out.  


Again, for B2C, your potential customers might be spending hours on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. Influencer marketing works really well and can  get a massive return.

This is my mindset for marketing. Who are the target companies, who makes the decisions, and how do I get in front of them? The ideology is pretty simple and just all about executing and making things happen!

217,95f6rp,False,,323,3 Years ago I started a company with my last $7k. Now I am making $19k pure profit per month! AMA,Entrepreneur,"Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/dCCWg7u](https://imgur.com/a/dCCWg7u)

A little backstory:

I used to work for a major corporation doing customer service & managing social media accounts. I could usually finish my daily tasks before 3pm. The job was not challenging at all, no chance at a promotion and I was bored out of my mind. I was literally counting the minutes until 5 o'clock. Although I was getting by fine, I figured this way no way to live my life. So with some free time on my hand I started to look for different ways to start my own business. I tried a bunch of different things ( affiliate marketing, dropshipping, etc ) until I found out about selling on Amazon. I figured if other people can make money doing this, I can as well right? So I started doing research. And I was serious about this. For the next couple of weeks I devoured every FBA blog, podcast, forums, case study on the web. All the information was out there for free and I wanted to read it all. So after I felt I was ready to pull the trigger I used part of my $7k I had in savings to place my first purchase order in China. It took about 2 months to produce & ship, but after that the sales kept coming! It took another 12 months before I was making more with Amazon than I was making with my day job. At that point I directly quit my job and went full-time Amazon FBA. Now 3 years later I am still growing every quarter and am currently making $19k a month.

If anybody is interested these were the requirements for my first product:

* **High demand**: At least $3000 revenue per month for competitors in my niche. **I check the demand with** [**Jungle Scout (Review & Discount)**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/jungle-scout-review-discount-coupon-code/) **or with** [**Viral Launch Coupon Code & Review**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/viral-launch-review-coupon-code-discount-2/) **/** [**Helium 10 Discount & Review**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/helium-10-discount-coupon-code-review-versus-vs-jungle-scout/)**.**
* **$15 + Sales price**
* **Low competition**: The competition should have around 50 reviews or less.
* **Easy to manufacture product**: I don't want to deal with electronics or anything that might break easily
* **Healthy profit margin**: Profit margin should be at least 33% of the sales price. So I want to make at least $1k per month on this product

**Update**: Wow thanks for all the responses! I get a lot of people asking me how it works with [estimating fba product demand](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/how-to-find-your-first-product-to-sell-on-amazon/), [manufacturing in China](https://garlicpressseller.com/manufacturing-shipping/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-manufacture-private-label-products-on-amazon-fba/) & [ppc](https://garlicpressseller.com/fba-sales/amazon-ppc/amazon-ppc-strategy-guide-tutorial/).

855,4tx3ev,False,,142,Simple harsh truth that changed my perspective on life,Entrepreneur,"Hello /r/entrepreneur.

I know that most posts here are about how to make money and stuff like that, but I would like to share with you a simple advice that I have read from reddit a while ago that changed my life.

Most of us here come from lower/middle class. Majority of millionaires and billionaires come from lower/middle class. A lot of us here went through a lot of shit since we were born. Not everybody had loving and rich parents. But even if you did have, there is a really simple thing that you have to understand in order to become successful. 

**Nobody owes you anything.** Nobody. Not even your parents. If you had happy childhood, good for you. If you didn't, good for you. In life, people only care about themselves. You did something embarrassing today on your way to work and somebody laughed? They will forget about it and they will forget about you in few hours. Nobody cares about your problems, they only care about what you can bring to the table and how you can help them. 

During past few weeks, there has been a lot of posts here about people who were feeling depressed because they failed. They started business, lost a lot of money and time and didn't get anything in return. That is what they all say. Every successful person will tell them exactly the same thing - that they didn't get nothing in return. They have got, probably the two most important things - knowledge and experience. Yes, you failed. Now you know what you shouldn't do. Try again. Majority of successful entrepreneurs failed dozens of times before they finally succeeded. Google ""successful people who started out as failures"" and you will see what I am talking about.

Realize that nobody owes you anything and that life will keep throwing shit at you. It sucks sometimes, but life isn't fair. Lets not cry about it and lets change it. I was feeling bad and I was depressed every time something bad happened to me. When something bad happens to me now, that I definitely don't deserve, I laugh at it. I see what I can learn from it and move on. I suggest that you also do the same. We are here because we know want to change our life. We don't want to be slaves and work 9-5 for the rest of our lives for someone else.

519,9f7ao5,False,,301,"If you are looking to start a business, go into the cosmetics/beauty/health categories",Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone, I know the sub is sensitive to spam/promotions but I don't have anything to promote here except I want to let entrepreneurs or business owners know that the cosmetics/beauty/health industries are 3 excellent categories to start or grow a new business. 

I had decent success in business by starting my own beauty (makeup & hair) brand so I wanted to shed some light on this category for anyone who is interested but doesn't know where to start. 

And no, I don't have anything to flog or market, got no links to share but I just want to share some ideas. Feel free to take these niches and run with them. Before anyone starts, sharing a good idea isn't the same as doing the work it takes to build a successful business in the health and beauty industry. I am happy sharing my insights because there is so much money to make in this market. 

These following segments are ripe for anyone who has even just $5K to invest. I started my beauty line with $1K:

* Colour cosmetics targeting women (Instagram still hot, Kylie & Rihanna are just two of the many business women making bank in this sector, women care about what influencers are doing)
* Hair extensions and hair products targeting women (More women are doing their own hair at home, salons are struggling to keep up with constant new products coming out onto the market)
* Organic soap lines 
* Bridal makeup services
* Children's hair line 
* Hair products dealing with alopaecia 
* Product line targeting men dealing with baldness or thinning hair
* Weight loss (I did alright in this sector as well, worth a go if you can do the fat burning angle)

**Markets that are too saturated at the moment**

* Beard oil targeting men
* Lip kits or lipstick only lines

**Why cosmetics/beauty/health?**

* Recession proof
* Repeat customers
* Loyal customers once you have created a brand

**What I learned from running my brand**

* **Use FB ads religiously** \- Stick with Facebook ads if you want to build a profitable beauty brand online - Almost all of our revenue was thanks to FB ads so I definitely have nothing negative to say about Zuckerberg and co. I found that Instagram ads didn't really work as well as I had hoped so we stuck mainly with Facebook. Our ad spend was about $3K per month and we generated around $20K+ each month. 
* **Instagram** \- Instagram is really important but it is too late now to do it organically because of algorithm changes. I spent money on influencers but I found beauty influencers hard to work with, they charge too much money and some of them have low engagement. Things picked up for our business once I stopped paying influencers ironically, invested more in FB ads and this caused people to search for us on Instagram themselves. Instagram beauty followers are stubborn and first movers - they move at their own pace so I found it was better to use IG as a mood board instead of a sales channel. I know that influencers have worked for many brands but for whatever reason, they didn't bring us clicks. 
* **Do weekly drops** \- Ideally if you have the money, you should release new beauty products every day but every week is a good way to generate recurring revenue and to keep your customers happy. Beauty customers want to see new products all of the time and you need to stay on top of it. 
* **Create a secret VIP group** \- We created a secret group of VIP customers where we invited top spenders of our beauty and hair products, and we told them that they could invite one other 'whale' to the group. This led people to call us organically asking to be in the VIP group and invariably led to people buying our products more because they heard about this secret VIP group. VIP marketing still works when executed properly. 

The bulk of our sales came from the sale of hair products first, then makeup, then skincare. 

The categories I've mentioned are competitive but if you can find a good niche for yourself, you can definitely make it. One rising trend I am noticing in the beauty industry is the launch of reality TV star based beauty lines and influencer based lines. These categories skew towards women more but I am also noticing more men are becoming customers in the grooming categories. 

You are leaving money on the table if you don't even consider these categories or segments. Hope this helps anyone who wants to start a consumer business in beauty/hair/cosmetics/health.

That said, what’s your brand? What’s the story too?  ",2018-09-12 12:28:54

A few days ago I did a little over $3,300 sales in one day (all with private labeling Amazon FBA) without any launches or discounting (so no inflated sales #'s) but a new product had organically ranked extremely well so I was selling quite highly. So I was thinking and realized my eccentric post when I first started was about 3.3k in a month and now I am consistently averaging 1.8-2k a day which I never would of thought possible, even remotely before starting this.

&#x200B;

(Alot of the advice below is specific to Amazon FBA, but can be applied to online entrepreneurship in general)

&#x200B;

I want to make this a comprehensive (as I can) thread of major discoveries / different viewpoints that can be of use to beginners or even other mid level sellers like myself.

1. It's ok to compete against name brands, I've never seen a guru who hasn't said this and I believe it to be very wrong. I rank next to one of the biggest brands in the world; probably one of the top 10 corporations in the world if I had to guess. I say rank next to because I wouldn't say im competing yet because I probably only take 5% of their market share which may be a stretch, their main listing does about 300k a month. All of my listings combined in that niche are currently doing about 50k/month in revenue. Theres alot of uni-dimensional and **incorrect advice commonly touted although each does have** ***some*** **truth such as:**

* Don't sell anything under $15 or especially $10 items. I got started with a $10 item and my average sales order is probably $11/order. Yes I make profit, great profit actually with 35% margin so yes; 3.5 dollars a sale isn't alot individually, but it is when you average 50 units a day for that single item. But under $10 is when you may get deemed addon status from Amazon which means your item has to be ordered with $25 worth of other items and it is a death sentence for your listing unless your item is very small, so I would recommend staying away from items under $10 that aren't very small i.e easily fits in your hand. In my first listing there's times I would drop below $10 to sell more and I would get labeled addon status even though the majority of the other items I never do. Addon status is an arbitrary and undefined label unfortunately.
* Don't sell anything too heavy. Weight *can* *be* a completely useless metric, you can sell something thats 30 lbs if its profitable, ideally yes lighter is easier and cheaper but it is a very restrictive and incorrect statement to say you shouldn't ever or at all sell something above 5 to 10 lbs. However you probably shouldn't sell something that weighs 10 lbs and is bulky dimensionally and only sells for $14 because after your shipping and Amazon fees theres virtually no way for you to profit unless you order in massive quantities.
* Don't compete against name brands. To expand upon my first point should you try and sell something like laundry detergent and compete against Gain, Tide, and arm & hammer? Probably not, unless you have tens of thousands of dollars for marketing and a genuinely great product. But there are niches that aren't *fully* dominated by a name brand that is selling under that keyword. There are plenty of brands who are big brands but have lesser known products that are not the said brands bread and butter, and that scares alotta people away but it shouldn't; it is an opportunity. For reference my first item's niche with the aforementioned big corporation, the top listing for every keyword is that companies and their listing has over 3,000 reviews; i'd say that scares away virtually everyone but me. And the reason I know that is every single other seller right now on the first page are Chinese sellers likely located in their mainland, so no other private labelers like myself. They may have 3,000 reviews but when I was looking I noticed all the listings below them didn't have tons of reviews (under 100) and alot of them were doing 8-12k a month in revenue. Then I examined those listings and thought, I could craft a much better listing than that. So I did, and its worked out pretty well and I don't think its just some 1 off lucky thing, this can be applied to any other niche as long as like I said early half the listings on the first page aren't owned by one brand. If it is just 1 big listing then other private labelers / chinese sellers who are still making decent money & you think you can make a better listing / better product then the fact that there's a name brand making alot of money is irrelevant.

&#x200B;

2. This should of been first but build an email list ***very soon, if not immediately.*** When it comes to your first product and your first order and you're clueless and it may not workout you don't *have to* go through the hassle of setting up an email capture page and doing product inserts to drive traffic to that page, but the second you decide to reorder or that you're going to stick with Amazon FBA and do a second product **you must build an email list.** Even if you solely want to sell on Amazon and you may think why would I need emails, 2 words ***legitimate reviews.*** Yes you can use friends and family for your first product (which would be breaking the ToS and im not advocating it) but that is not sustainable and everytime you use someone theres a big chance you wont be able to again so you will run out of people and be clueless how to get a review or have to rely on review services or launch services which review services are extremely sketchy and illegal and launch services are much better when done yourself and more effective if you know what you're doing. I highly recommend using Facebook ads hooked up with manychat to launch your product and collect email address and future reviewers, its an unprecedented way to get completely within ToS reviews AND email addresses for like $1-1.5 a pop to fairly *cold* traffic. If you're new you'll have no idea what that is but just youtube many chat fb ad launch method if you plan on launching an amazon product soon.

3. This is extremely important not to be misinterpreted but once you've *proven* you atleast have a solid idea of what you're doing which i'll define as 2 successful products that are consistently generating a decent roi. **Loans to expand your business can be huge** ***if and only if your growth is being heldback by capital***\*\*.\*\* And for those wondering why would you be held back if you're making money, for me I was making great money but every single month I was reinvesting thousands and even tens of thousands back into the business for more inventory so getting a chunk or a lump sum can be huge. I'm not saying to go borrow 30k from your family or 20k from a business lender but if capital is bottlenecking you and you know what you're doing you can make a $10-15k loan multiply your business by 2-3x even with a 20-25% interest rate. I spend $1.61 for a product that nets over $4 so the ROI is 248% so even 20-25% interest rates aren't bad if you have a profitable product.

4. Make sure you have products in the pipeline at all times and launch more as soon as you have the money to do so, when your first product is shipping to Amazon **be looking for your second** even if you don't launch it for 2-3 months have multiple potential products because when you do have the money you should not be impulsively choosing a product and quickly trying to get it selling because thats how you make big mistakes. In the same token though you don't need to spend 2-3 months eyeing a product, using junglescout or whatever tools you may use almost all of the product research tools available if you know what you're doing can in about 30 seconds give you the information in a niche needed to known instantly if a niche is worth possibly pursuing or not. I don't believe in tracking a product for 1-2 weeks I make my decision by looking at the exact rank over time directly from Amazon using the JS chrome extension and decide if it is a worth product. I believe this sets me apart from 99% of other people doing product research I'm much more efficient with it, although now I use Virtual Assistants to look for products.

I'm going to stop there, could definitely write some more but I dont want to ramble too much and it takes alot for me because I have an off and on relationship with writing haha. As I said drop any questions below, hope this helps someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/arjhwd/from_33k_in_a_month_to_33k_in_a_day_with_amazon/,797,Downvoted  ,2019-02-17 10:42:47
669,aj33zx,False,,389,Who are the top 1%? And what do they do?,Entrepreneur,"**EDIT: Due to popular demand in the comments, just created a subreddit to help all of us get to the top 1%.** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTop1Percent/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTop1Percent/) **Please subscribe and let's get the discussion going!**

According to the latest IRS data, the top 1% in America make $422,000+ a year.

This group is broken up into two components:

1. Self-employed business owners
2. Highly-paid professionals

Let's unpack both of those in specific detail:

1. &#x200B;

According to the Chicago Booth Review, ""the 1 percent’s income is being driven by owner-managers, mostly of small and medium-sized companies—specifically S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies."" These businesses range from a local restaurant chain to a dentists' office to a B2G enterprise software solution. However, according to Booth's research, ""The businesses earning the most profits in the bulk of the top 1 percent were physicians’ and dentists’ offices, professional and technical services, specialty trade contractors, and legal services."" The typical company in the top 1% category has over $7M in sales. With a 10% profit margin split between two owners, this would create two top 1% incomes. This by far is the most common path to joining the top 1%: small business ownership.

2)

According to research from NPR's Planet Money, the top 1% disproportionately hold jobs as physicians, an array of managers/executives, lawyers, salespeople, and financial specialists/accountants. The common thread? Extremely valuable specialized skill and revenue generation. A doctor and a lawyer have specialized, in-demand skills that people are willing to pay for. Managers, salespeople, and financial specialists all work towards revenue generation.

So how does someone join the top 1% of income-earners? It basically involves becoming a very specialized/revenue generating employee or founding a successful small business.

Hopefully this was interesting! Definitely consider your goals and don't obsess over a specific number or sacrifice things you care about to join an elusive group - it certainly won't make you happy. But earning a lot of money can give you the opportunity to make an impact, not worry about not having enough money, give things to others, and spend money for yourself. Good luck and please let me know what you thought!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aj33zx/who_are_the_top_1_and_what_do_they_do/,495,basically if your evil and ugly as holy fuck with no honor integrity or any redeeming characteristics=welcome to the 1% ,2019-01-23 19:00:39

\[Important: This post is not intended to sell or promote anything homie. It's my small way of paying it forward to entrepreneurs, a community I deeply care about. Can't be more clear than that.\]

# What we do

I’m the founder and CEO of **Smart Alto** the easiest way to set 15-minute phone appointments with homebuyers.

Real estate agents advertise homes on Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com and other places. The problem is when homebuyers want to meet with real estate agents to view properties, real estate agents almost never respond to the inquiries because they’re busy doing other stuff.

We built technology that sends text messages to those homebuyers within 2 minutes, asks them a few simple questions, and then sets 15-minute phone appointments on the real estate agent’s calendar. That way, the homebuyer always gets their questions answered and can then schedule time with the real estate agent to go see the home.

I used to work for a real estate brokerage to set appointments for real estate agents, so I know this problem very well.

# Pulling back the curtain on my startup.

I’m pulling back the curtain on my startup and going to show you exactly what I did to take it from $0 to $500,000/year and beyond.

This (admittedly) long post includes the exact Facebook and Google ads, landing pages, copy, sales playbooks, Facebook posts, integrations, videos, websites, pricing strategies and practically everything I’ve used to grow my business.

I’m going to show you what I screwed up (so you can skip my mistakes) and what I got right (so you can copy my success).

**It doesn't matter how fast you go if you’re running in the wrong direction**. I wish someone would have done this for me when I was a newbie. Instead, I had to piecemeal crap for years, lose money, and fight tooth and nail to climb the entrepreneurial mountain.

Well, you can skip that step because this post is your **Ski Lift** to the top of the mountain, so let’s make it **Snowfall** (inside joke, keep reading and you’ll get it).

These are the most important things I focused on to start growing fast (read: this is what you should focus on too).

\[Important note: Per the [PII guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii), I hid the names, email addresses and phone numbers of customers when necessary.\]

# Customers

Most folks screw up because they want to change the world with a fancy idea. They ultimately sell something no one wants to buy and go broke. Start with a hungry, burger-loving customer base and sell them burgers, man. [Click to see how I learn about my customers to sell them what they want.](https://imgur.com/a/zJFXhaT)

# Website

My main goal is to increase website conversions. I want at least 3% of website visitors to schedule a demo with my sales team. My website answers 7 questions. [Click to see the 7 questions my website answers](https://imgur.com/a/bBFxohU).

# Marketing

I pay for eyeballs. I’ve got an outdated blog and my SEO sucks, but who cares? I’m not a publisher so screw all the marketing gurus who demand I write new content everyday. [Click to see my entire marketing funnel, from the Facebook and Google ads I run to the landing pages I use. ](https://imgur.com/a/1Hvie3x)

# Snowfall

This is my secret weapon. The smartest thing I’ve ever done as a marketer is double down on showcasing customer results. This one strategy will have you feeling like [Franklin Saint from Snowfall](https://imgur.com/a/AA6HCTC) when he realized he was finally going to be rich. I created a handful of videos showing my customer’s results and blasted them all over social media, email and everywhere else my potential customers hangout. [Watch my Snowfall.](https://imgur.com/a/vuippBK)

# Community

If I can’t first build a community of people who trust me, then I won’t build a business. I want to be the [Pied Piper ](https://imgur.com/a/l554zQ5)for customers who desperately have a problem and money to solve it. My community has been ROI positive from day one and is the gift that keeps on giving. These fans know I have their best interest at heart, so they follow me. [Click to see me build a community that makes me thousands of dollars every month.](https://imgur.com/a/KLvLgHv)

# Sales

So far I’ve been talking about how to generate demos for my sales team. But demos don’t matter without a way to turn them into money. We created a simple playbook. No fancy scripts. No phony salesmanship. Just a simple process on what happens when we get a new lead. This isn’t as hard as you think. It just takes a little time and a lot of heart. [Click to see our sales playbook. ](https://imgur.com/a/mv7nhK2)

# Raise prices + annual deals

We started with a single $200/month price point. We left so much money on the table that I still cry every time I think about it. The best thing we’ve done is increase our price and start selling annual deals. Now we have customers who pay us as little as $300/month and as much as $70,000/year. Same product. Different prices. More money. [Click to see the evolution of our pricing strategy.](https://imgur.com/a/OrYgvQi)

# Takeaway

Okay folks, here’s the hard truth: I’m a country boy from the backwoods of Alabama. I was born without marketing knowledge, product knowledge, or sales knowledge. I’ve never studied business or design at fancy schools. I run a technology startup, but I’ve never written a single line of code.

I’ve learned everything from free YouTube videos, $5 books/courses, and expensive mistakes.

If I can do this, then you can too. (Read that last sentence again). I’m just a guy. I work hard, I'm smart, and I learn from my mistakes. But at the end of the day...I’m just a guy from the backwoods of Alabama.

Success leaves clues. There is no reason you can’t copy my work and tailor them for your own business. There is nothing new under the sun, you just have to make it fit your business.

**The companies that made this happen**

* Zapier (Automate all my workflows and send leads to hundreds of places)
* Active Campaign (Best email marketing software IMHO)
* Loom (Before I write anything I think “can I create a video”. If so, I use Loom)
* Webflow (Build a beautiful website with zero code. Tons of templates.)
* Group Leads (Add FB Group members to a spreadsheet. #LifeSaver)
* Twilio (Expensive, but reliable text and calls)
* Calendly (Set demos with my sales team)
* Design Pickle (Affordable, awesome design. Priceless)
* Lightshot (Capture screenshots of results I get for clients)
* Chargebee (Subscription management that makes Stripe easier to work with)
* Stripe (Say it with me, “Show me the money”)
* Trello (Manage all my tasks)
* Zoom (Demos all day baby)
* Pipedrive (Good CRM, needs more integrations)
* LuckyOrange (See what are folks doing on my website in real-time)

Congrats homie! You have reached the end, and now it’s time for the next level.

**This is where my case study ends!**

But keep reading if you want to go further into the Matrix and know the intangibles it takes to win. So far we’ve talked strategy and tactics. Sadly, that’s only 20% of the game.

Right now you’re Mario, but you want to be Super Mario flying through the air and throwing fireballs.

No worries, homie. I got you.

# How to win

## Focus

The things I focus on almost always get done. The hard part is figuring out what is important enough to focus on. I made this post because I wanted to share what I focus on to achieve success and give you a ski lift. Success leaves clues so just copy me.

## Personal relationships

It’s hard to do important work by yourself. Your job is to build a solid team and great partnerships. I love working with smart people. Don’t be the guy who sits in your basement working all day only to realize later in life your nerdy neighbor had the missing piece to your puzzle.

## Market > product

The number one thing I need to have a thriving restaurant is a starving crowd. Most folks spend their entire life savings making the perfect burger (product) only to discover customers (market) aren’t hungry. That’s Hustlin’ Backwards man. You can easily figure out what people are searching (Google), watching (YouTube), buying (Amazon), and sharing (BuzzSumo) in 20 minutes while watching Law & Order SVU reruns.

## Build a community

The best way to launch your product is to a group of people who know, like and trust you. This is hard work, but it’s worth it, bro. Give people value. Build influence. Grow your fan base. Everything else takes care of itself.

## Track your results

I measure the 3-5 most important things in my business. Then I ask myself, “how can I improve my metrics?”. The answers to that question results in my to-do list. That helps me focus. Focus is my superpower.

## Data > opinions

I don’t care what any **one** **person thinks**. I focus on what sizable groups of potential **customers do**. *Did you catch that?* I focus on what they *do rather than what they think or say*. People will often tell you one thing and do something entirely different. Screw your opinion. I set up experiments, collect data, measure results, and take action.

## Asymmetric risk/rewards

Ray Dalio, Jack Bogle, Jeff Bezos, and other folks I study all basically say the same thing: take affordable risks and look for outsized returns. With a 5:1 return, you can screw up four times and still break even with one winner. I like those odds.

## Partnerships

Partnerships are great, but they’re only worth pursuing after you’ve had some success. That’s true because people don’t really want to help you, they want to help themselves. And when you’re not successful it’s hard for them to see how working with you is going to help them. The more successful you are, the easier it is to land a partnership that skyrockets your success.

# My final thoughts

## Don’t take it personally

Most people aren’t going to support you. In fact, they’re probably going to hate and try to tear you down. Don’t take this personally. And don’t waste your energy by getting mad or upset. It’s not their job to believe in you, that’s your job, my friend. Become successful and then make a post like this one to help them out.

## You are the enemy

I’m literally giving the playbook and I’ll be around to answer questions in the comments. But most people haven’t read this far, and they won’t ask questions, and they won’t take action. Instead, they’re learning how to design their own logo using Sketch.

## Take massive action

Getting an LLC, designing a pretty logo, hunting for the perfect domain name, doing years of market research, overthinking your next move, listening to haters/trolls, etc are all reasons people never take action and ultimately fail.

## Be humble. Be confident.

Don’t be overconfident and think you have all the answers. In the same breath, believe in yourself and don’t over-optimize for someone else's opinion all the time. Collect your own data with small experiments/tests and take it from there.

## Be positive

I don’t want to get all Tony Robbins on you man, but YOU REALLY CAN DO THIS. It’s hard work. Sometimes it sucks (like, really sucks). The more successful you become, the more haters you get. Hobbies are lost, friendships fade.

But the good outweighs the bad by 1,000,000 to 1. So trust me, you got it. And if you need help then I got you.

If you’re ever in doubt then refer back to this post because this is your **Ski Lift**, so go make it **SnowFall.**

I hoped this post gave you the confidence and energy needed to get to work.

Hi Benny
 
Thank you for your email.
 
As you will know, King.com Ltd develops and produces online, social and mobile games, including the hugely successful “Candy Crush Saga” game.  In addition, King owns the trade mark CANDY (CTM 011538147), which covers for example ""online gaming, interactive poker, online gambling services; casino services; casino services delivered via the Internet"" in class 41. 
Your use of CANDY SLOTS in your app icon uses our CANDY trade mark exactly, for identical goods, which amounts to trade mark infringement and is likely to lead to consumer confusion and damage to our brand. The addition of only the descriptive term ""SLOTS"" does nothing to lessen the likelihood of confusion. You will appreciate that we need to take action where our marks are being used without our consent, with the consequent risk of our marks becoming diluted or damaged in any way or consumers believing that the goods originate from or are otherwise endorsed or approved by us. 
 
We understand that you might not have been aware that this was an infringement.  Now that you are aware of your infringements, please amend the name of your App accordingly.
 
We are aware that there are many games on the app store with CANDY in the name, this is largely due to the popularity of our game Candy Crush Saga. We review each of these apps in turn and take action where necessary. 
 
I hope this helps to answer your questions.
 
We reserve all rights.
 
Kind regards

After realizing i have no choice but to change it, cause getting a lawyer would be a waste of time and money, i sent back this reply. 

-------------------

Dear Sophie and King.com LTD,

After much thinking about my options, I have complied with your request to remove the word CANDY from my little iPad and iPhone app originally called “All Candy Casino Slots”. I am just now waiting for the review team at Apple to approve my new version. I have been approved for an expedited review since this is a legal matter that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. 

In it’s short life, I apologize for any confusion my app may have caused for other people because it had the word “candy”. Maybe they wondered why it looked and played nothing like Candy Crush Saga. The app was only released for less than a week so the damage on your brand was minimal. 

Clearly I meant no harm when I created the game name. Just searching the word “candy” in the App Store is like visiting Willy Wonka’s Chocolate factory. Candy here, candy there, candy everywhere. It’s all the candy you want, but with no calories or fat. 

I certainly wouldn’t want customers to confuse my app with your ginormous popular global game. It’s so popular that the word “candy” could cause some confusion in real life too. I’m sure when little kids say “I want candy”, parents are confused if they are talking about playing Candy Crush or eating actual pieces of candy. 

Just a few years ago, parents would clearly know what they wanted. How times quickly have changed. 

I never thought my app would be confused with Candy Crush in the least bit. It was not my intent. I’ll place blame on my bad sweet tooth for wanting to create a candy themed game. My growing waistline is proof of that.

I did not want to mislead the 1,524 people that have downloaded my app (compared to your half a billion and counting). I can only imagine the confusion from the person in each of these countries: Jordan, Slovenia, Suriname, Lebanon, Egypt, Nepal, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka, Peru, Saint Lucia, and Mongolia. Likely they were eager to play Candy Crush after seeing their grandmother request for more lives on Facebook.

I’m sure after they downloaded my game, they were very confused and wondered where the color bombs, wrapped candy, and the sweet sounding male voice saying  “sweet!”, “tasty!”, and “delicious!” were. I did not mean to confuse them, but hope now they will get to have the pleasure of the words “sugar crush” stuck in their heads after downloading Candy Crush. 

Just like your company, I am a person who creates games for people to enjoy. Sometimes played while on a bad first date, procrastinating from studying, bored at work, or sitting on the toilet. 

I hope we can get back to the main focus, which is making games for these group of people. Therefore, no more confusing candy games from me moving forward. 

Sincerely, 

Benny Hsu

157,b76d01,False,,210,Yelp tried to strong arm us today,Entrepreneur,"I wanted to share a recent interaction I had with a Yelp sales agent, a cautionary tale. I haven’t seen it documented on this sub so I thought I’d share my experience. If this is a repeat, my apologies for the repost.

The dark side of Yelp is pretty well documented; filtering positive reviews and moving negative reviews to the fore if you don’t advertise. I am a co-owner of a small business and shortly after we stopped advertising 2/3rd of our 5 star reviews vanished overnight. We were annoyed initially but figured it wasn’t worth raging against the machine.  Today a pushy, condescending Yelp sales rep called my business partner to sell advertising under the guise of compliance and a threat.  For some background, I handle the business side of things. I have 20+ years of business and negotiating experience working previously for a fortune 500 company. My business partner supplies the craft. She’s an artisan and amazing at what she does.  But she’s not a negotiator. She called me today distraught about the call she received from the Yelp rep. I later called the rep back and he pitched me the same nonsense.

He led with a flowery pitch in an attempt to confuse me. He said Yelp had an “obligation to the public” and that I need to log into my account immediately. He said there were 21,000 people who accessed our profile but didn’t convert because we didn’t enable something on our account. Mind you, there’s no way 21,000 visited our page. He spoke with urgent haste, was pushy, and implied that we were stupid for not enabling this feature. I asked him what he selling. He was taken back, as if surprised I figured out he was trying to sell something (go figure).  He reluctantly said advertising.  I told him I wasn't interested and he hung up. Now he didn’t get to try this bullshit on me, but he told my business partner earlier that if she didn’t oblige that he would have to do something to her account/profile. It was a threat.

771,5sdxji,False,,184,Why + How to ACTUALLY grow your instagram following (without using spammy bots),Entrepreneur,"Social media manager here...


So there was this controversial post this weekend on how to use bots + automation to automatically leave spammy comments on people’s instagram posts in order to get on their radar and have them follow you back.

If you’re interested in just increasing the number of followers and you don’t care about quality or actually using Instagram to grow your business… then that’s what you should be doing. If you DO care about building a tribe of potential customers (leads) and not be perceived as this spammy company that leaves fakes comments here and there, here’s exactly how I’ve been helping small businesses get more customers through Instagram:


**1. Post unique content, every day**

Research content on sites like Buzzsumo, Pinterest etc. to get ideas for the type of posts that work well within your niche. Use Photoshop or other graphic design software to create unique images. Brand is key on Instagram. You don’t want to be perceived as this crappy & spammy company with low quality posts. Play around with short Videos/Gifs once in a while and create unique content. Be consistent and post something *every day!*


**2. Follow relevant accounts**

To get on the radar of leads/future customers, you need to be proactive. Instead of randomly commenting on people’s posts, find influencers in your niche and start manually following their followers. Look at the people that are actively commenting/liking the type of content that's related to your business. Follow these people and a good chunk of them will follow you back. This is how you effectively build an efficient following.


**3. Why should I care about Instagram and posting stuff every day?**

One client of mine already had around 1500 customers when I started managing their Instagram Account. The problem was, they weren’t consistent in publishing content. Twice a month, sometimes 3 or 4 times a month… Why should you post every day? Because the more you post, the more interaction moments you create with potential customers. So when I started creating content for them every day, not only was I growing their follower base but more people started reaching out via comments, asking about the particular service they are offering. So by being on the radar of people, every-single-day (by sharing VALUABLE & UNIQUE content), you create more opportunities for your business to get noticed. This leads to more people wanting to know more about your business.  So while I was creating this consistent stream of output for them, they were getting more people asking specific questions about delivery, pricing, etc. Allowing them to spend their time getting new customers on board.

-

So for small businesses out there who already have a working product/service. Get started with just these steps. Create a consistent flow of output. Stick with it, and you'll start to understand the power of Instagram & social media in general.

703,279mzw,False,Case Study,67,How I developed social skills. Hope this is helpful for socially awkward entrepreneurs.,Entrepreneur,"I've been trying to think of a way to contribute content for this sub, so I wrote a post, hope it's helpful!

It's recently come to my attention that I'm no longer considered ""socially awkward."" When I tell people I've met in the last year that I'm socially awkward, they emphatically disagree. This was a huge accomplishment for me personally and my desire is to provide any insight to those who still consider themselves ""socially awkward."" I made it in list form for easy digestion.

To preface the list, I want to point out a really amazing mental framework for social situations. This framework sees life as a play. This play has actors, scripts, props and sets. Everyone is an actor. Everyone has scripts. Everyone uses props and wherever you are is the set. Much of being socially awkward comes from not knowing which scripts, and/or props to use in any given set. Realize that you can learn the scripts and get the props to play your part however you want. This is something that social engineers have understood for a long time, and it [can get you very far.](http://mitnicksecurity.com/media/CSC-Testimonial.pdf)

Once you understand this, here are the things I do on a daily basis to not be socially awkward and still express myself:

______________________________________________________________________________________________
1. **Care a lot about changing.** Yeah, you have to care about changing and getting better. You CAN change. Social skills can be learned. There is no doubt in my mind. But first you must care.

2. **Study body language.** This one for me was huge. Understand both how your body language affects you and others and you are a step closer to understanding other's body language. [This TED talk by Amy Cuddy really changed my life.](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are) Power posing has helped me so much.

3. **Reflect on your outward appearance.** In other words, [get your props in order.](http://ocw.nd.edu/sociology/introduction-to-social-psychology/eduCommons/sociology/introduction-to-social-psychology/lectures/class-impression-management) When I was younger, I was of the mindset that clothes, hairstyle, etc were irrelevant. They're not. Remember, props! People treat me so much differently since I have started dressing more nicely. (If you think you don't have the money to have style get your butt to a thrift store. I go to the Goodwill almost every other day for 10 minutes to check for vests, shoes or nice sport coats.)

4. **Exercise and meditate.** Both of these things, in conjunction with one another have helped me enormously. Not only in my battle with social normalcy, but they also help me keep my depression at bay. I cannot recommend these two things highly enough. I won't prescribe any single method of either for you, but do some exercise and meditate in whatever way you find works for you. You will be glad you did. [Start here if you need inspiration.](http://tinybuddha.com/blog/8-ways-to-make-meditation-easy-and-fun/)

5. **Observe carefully.** This one comes in handy for many reasons. Not only is it a great way to see how others are reacting to you, but genuinely listening and observing conversation, without being lost in your own thoughts, will do wonders. [Something like this.](http://www.wikihow.com/Observe-People) Watch. Ask questions. Listen carefully. People love to talk about themselves. People love to feel heard. If you are really listening, you will be surprised what you find.

6. **Strive to be the best version of yourself.** This one started as ""be yourself"" but that's not quite true. You don't want to just be yourself, you want to be the best version of yourself. Reflect on what the best version of yourself acts like. What do they dress like? How do they talk with people? What do they do? It's not a lie to practice being your ideal self, heck, you'll probably find you don't even really know what your ideal self is like until you start trying to act like them. In this regard, I highly recommend watching [this interview with Bruce Lee.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRcgk-Avj7c) There is a LOT of insight into how to do this.

7. **Practice, practice, practice.** This might be the most important one. [Push your comfort zone.](http://sethsandler.com/productivity/3-zones/) You will need to push your comfort zone. You have to practice all of this stuff. I started small. I would set small goals for myself and work from there . For instance, while walking down the street, make eye contact with strangers and give them a smile (you might want to practice your smile in front of a mirror.) Make it a goal to strike up small-talk with the cashier at the store, or your hairdresser, everyone. The more the better. When you start doing this often, it will become easier. Your comfort zone will expand. You will learn and grow.

8. **Be confident.** Nobody can give this to you. You have to make it. Confidence comes from within. I saw this video somewhere on Reddit from [Oren Klaff about pitching, it had some of the best insight for confidence I've seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXavS_IY42A) For me, confidence came from being tested. Waking up every day for weeks, sad, crying, depressed and working out of it through my own efforts has given me confidence. Finishing college also gave me some confidence in myself. Honestly though, this one is a daily battle between the negative self-talk. It gets easier over time, I think. [This TED talk has helped me with confidence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HYZv6HzAs)

Edit: I'm so happy this was so well received. Ya'll can be a tough crowd so I was nervous. I also forgot one TED talk about stress (this one helps me with pushing my comfort zone) [Kelly McGonigal on making stress your friend.](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend)

You can download all of them in one RAR file by following this [Bandcamp](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/releases) link.

**What's the total size of the library and in which format do they come in?**

Total file size varies in format. You can download the songs in MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, ALAC, WAV and AIFF formats. If you'd like to download the songs in MP3 format, the total file size would be 488MB. If you'd want to go with WAV format, then the total size would be 3.2 GB.

**What about the license? (CC BY 4.0)**

You can use any song in this library in anyway you want, be it as a sound effect in your game or as a background music in one of your Youtube & Twitch videos, even commercially. If you'd like to find more information about the license, please check this [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) link. Providing an appropriate credit (Either Composed by [onemansymphony.bandcamp.com](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) or patreon.com/onemansymphony) is required.

**Can I remix the songs in the library?**

As long as you provide an appropriate credit to the original album, you can do whatever you want to do with them.

**What is the future of this library? How can I support it?**

I'm planning to expand this library's content as much as possible, and doing so takes a great amount of time, and calls for new virtual instruments and tools to create songs in rich and different sound. My current goal is to keep adding more songs in different genres into this library as well as creating environmental sound effects in high quality. Due to this reason, I created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony) page if you'd like to support this project. By becoming a Patron, **you'll get access to the loop files, bonus and alternative songs and sound effects** that are not included in the public library hosted on Bandcamp.

**Are these songs loopable?**

Almost every single song in the album (with a few exceptions here and there) is loopable. While producing these songs, I always paid extra attention to make them as loopable as possible since some users would like to break a song into seperate pieces and just want to use that specific section of the song in their projects, and some people might like to extend a specific part of the song for adaptive sound design purposes. I am very well aware of that modern video games call for an application of adaptive sound design. A song which is made of different sections should be easily loopable & cuttable and any section of the song should be easily extandable. And whenever a transition occurs, it should sound as smooth as possible. These were the things that I kept in my mind while composing these pieces. If you'd like to create your own loop files out of these songs, you can use a free software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so and refer to its [manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) to learn more about how looping is done. If you don't want to spend your time with the process of looping, you can subscribe to my $1 tier on Patreon where you can get access to the loop files of the songs in the library.

**Is this album updated regularly?**

Yes! Whenever I add a new song or sound effect to the library, I announce it on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onemansymphony). I would suggest checking the tweets or the album page regularly if you're in need of new music frequently.

378,ducmx4,False,Best Practices,103,A really detailed guide to writing high performing Facebook ads,Entrepreneur,"The ad creative itself is - apart from product and audience - **the biggest single differentiator in determining whether** **your ad will make sales or not**, and is also the difference between making a click or not. 

To help you out with creating your ads, here is a list of important and specific principles that will mean you have a much better chance of performing better with them, based off my own experiences and also the experiences of many other digital ads agencies. 

Fundamentally: what sort of ads would have persuaded you? Those are the types that you should aim for.

I apologise in advance if some of this following guide is a bit abstract in nature. Unfortunately - unlike [interpreting Facebook ad metrics well](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/ds2ovu/the_ultimate_guide_to_facebook_ads_interpretation/) or [having a whole bunch of profitable plugins with objective ROI numbers to talk about](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsri50/my_list_of_most_profitable_plugins_on_my_shopify/), the creation of ad creatives is a very subjective topic and just requires looking at other people's ads to begin with. You can do that with paid tools or you can just find competitors you respect and see their ads at [facebook.com/ads/library](https://facebook.com/ads/library). 

Luckily, testing ad creatives and knowing which ones are actually performing well is a lot easier as there's some harder numbers there - just look for high CTR (&gt;1%), low CPC (&gt;$1), and whether there's actually any purchases above breakeven point. 

# 1. What's something immediately valuable I should know right now? 

**User generated content** (UGC) is far and away performing better universally for almost *everyone* with a reasonably successful store. Although you could spend a tonne on professional video ads, *don't.* **People are regularly disappointed by how much better UGC performs, since they spend so much more on that professional stuff.** The more native to the platform you're using, the more likely it will be a successful ad. 

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, this means trying to get videos from people that have purchased your product before. **You can repurpose all of your reviews (or Instagram influencer videos if you have any) for your ads,** with permission of course. 

Fundamentally, UGC works at all stages of the funnel. 

# 2. Is it the right ad for the right part of the funnel? 

As I talk about in [another post I wrote about funnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsisc9/how_understanding_funnels_well_allows_you_to_ad/), your audience exists some part of the customer journey, but both your ad copy and image/video need to hit the right audience at the *right time.* Your ads to cold traffic should look quite different to your ads to warm traffic. 

To get more specific on what this looks like and the kinds of ads that work: 

* **Cold traffic ads** (TOFU): 
   * Needs to focus on branding, trust elements, attention-grabbing ads, and social proofing to enhance your credibility
   * If you have products that are selling really well, focus on your winners  
   * Things like single image link posts and video posts work really well 
   * Whilst collections/carousels etc. can work (and I've had them work before), I'd personally save it for MOFU/BOFU parts of the funnel 
* **Engaged audience** (MOFU)**:** 
   * Images/videos will work here too
   * However carousels/collection ads will be the new type of ad creative to include here, now that there's some familiarity, allowing your customer to really dive deep and browse your catalog more 
   * You can also start to really focus on showing **more content that shows people using your product in real life** (i.e. UGC). 
   * **Testimonials also work really well here.** 
* **Warm audience** (BOFU): 
   * Testimonials perform especially well here 
   * Discounts also perform well
   * You can combine both of these together 
   * *Dynamic creatives* that directly call out your product name from your catalog often result in a significant increase in ROAS here too 

# 3. What sort of ad copy should I write? 

The best ad copy (writing) doesn't necessarily do all of the following elements, but will almost always have at least some of them: 

* **The words you use in your ads match the words that your customers are using.** If you're new to the game, here's my pro tip: look at the reviews on Amazon of your competitors, see what specific words people are using to rave about those products, and then take some of those words and use them. 
* **Your ad calls out your customer demographic.** Most likely it's the way they like to be identified, too. So for example, if you do yoga, an ad saying ""Yogis everywhere are raving about this new fitness gear from \_"" will be more appealing than simply saying you have some new clothes in stock. **Relevancy is key.** 
   * Note that you should be careful not to go *too* overboard with this. There's no everlasting consequences from it but Facebook will disapprove ads that ""assume a customer's condition"" e.g. if you start an ad with ""Feeling sore?"" then Facebook might actually not approve that ad. 
* **Does this product solve a problem for the customer?** Call out the problem directly. 

In terms of some more specific nitty gritty details: 

* **Varying lengths all work - no particular magic here.** I've seen two liners work, full paragraphs work, and extremely long 10 paragraph copy all work for separate products. Match it to your customer and the product. 
* Stuff like emojis and links are tricks - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but they're not universal. I've had ads perform with and without them. 

# 4. What sort of images/video/creative should I use? 

* **NOT overly professional ones.** Again, I'd like to super re-emphasize that you want UGC, *not* overdone stuff. Even if it's not actually user generated content, it should look like it. **The basic rule is: if it looks like it was shot on an iPhone and looks like it's appropriate for Instagram, then this is the right quality of image/video.**
* **Make the product at least 1/2 of the image.** It's silly to make a random coffee cup sized proportionally more than your product itself, and it does play out in terms of how well your ads perform. 
* For certain products, a bold splash of color will sometimes make a big difference. 
* For videos: fundamentally good ones are made of: 
   * An attention grabbing opening (split test these) 
   * Real usage of the product from real customers ideally 
   * Doesn't look like you're dropshipping from Aliexpress (...no matter how true that statement may or not be)  
   * They can be square or 4:5 aspect ratio, both of these work well 
* Ideas include: 
   * Testimonials
   * Demonstrations of the product 
   * GIFs showcasing your best performing *single image* creatives, all mashed together into a two frame image (powerfully simple) 
* Anecdotally, *no buttons* on a link post seem to perform better than having e.g. a 'Shop Now' button on a link post. I've only heard this from friends and haven't tested super extensively however. 
* **If using Instagram stories, make sure you're using an ad created specifically for it.** 

# 5. How much should I spend on my ads? 

This is actually a pretty tough question. 

You should generally try to have a 50x average order value worth of ad spend for a month, as a very very general rule - so for example. if your product makes you $20, then have an expectation to spend $1,000 in the month. If you don't have this kind of money, you *can* get away with less (e.g. $500), but the lower you go the lower your chance of finding a successful ad creative in time. 

Another way to think about this is to roughly spend about two times your baseline cost per acquisition per day. For example, if it usually costs you about $10 to acquire a customer through other means, then you might try to spend $20/day on Facebook ads. 

Unfortunately, it's just about rolling the dice enough times till you hit the one that really wins for you, with your money directly being the number of dice you can roll. 

That said, in terms of how you actually *run* the individual campaigns, that's a whole other topic in itself. But to keep it in general terms, you'd run some fairly low budget ad sets (e.g. $5/day) to individual ad sets in Purchase conversion campaigns, and then see what's working and what's not and do some intense optimisation from there. 

When it's working properly, it's not subtle, but actually fairly obvious. 

# Conclusion

If you read through this whole thing, you'll be miles ahead of quite a big proportion of other people doing eCommerce, or at the very least have a little bit more of a systematic approach to how you approach making Facebook ads. 

You may have read some of my previous posts before (as I particularly post a lot to /r/Shopify). 

If you like this sort of thing I'd like to be transparent and plug [this guide I wrote about an A-Z approach to Facebook marketing](https://fbadsblueprint.carrd.co/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=content_marketing&amp;utm_term=%2Fr%2Fentrepreneur). **If you've ever wondered about what types of audiences to target, how much to spend per ad set, what sort of ad creatives work best, and those sorts of questions - then this is pretty much my brain dump to all of the above question after spending thousands on Facebook ads myself.** 

However, once again, *I've tried to make this post as valuable as possible without holding back anything.*

966,787ic2,False,How to Grow,98,How To Grow Any Instagram Account [Complete Guide],Entrepreneur,"So, A week back I made a post about **Growing Instagram account** in any niche. The response was amazing and also got a lot of queries, So I taught I I'll make an extended post with more information. This will surely help any business/social media manager/individual etc who is looking to grow their Instagram account. If Instagram is one of your marketing channel then growing it in the right way is very important, there are tons of services offering so called 'organic growth' solutions which I highly suspect to be the case. So, I will share with you some methodology/tips/tricks using which any Instagram account can be grown.

I have divided the guide into phases corresponding to which I have explained the strategies you can try. This is from my experience of growing accounts for almost 2 years now. I am not saying this is the only way to grow accounts but this has worked for me time and again, so without further ado let's get started!

**INITIAL PHASE (0-10K Followers)**

So the baby is just born and it is time to nurture it, 

Find a neat profile image and an awesome description is very important because that is all you have to show off when you begin. Then also post 4-6 images and you are good to go.


**Growing the Baby**


Make a list of 5-10 huge accounts in your niche(100k+ Ideally)


1.Follow them and keep notifications on so that you get notified when they make a post.


2.Since they are big accounts they tend to get tons of likes in first few minutes.


3.Go to the list of people who have liked their recent picture and follow them!


4.These people get a notification, they tend to come to your profile and check it out(this why having a neat bio is imp) and if they like it they follow you back, Voila!


5.Rinse and repeat the process to get the first big push.

Do this until you reach 10k Followers, Depending on your niche this may take anywhere between 4-10 months. Now, Congratulate yourself because your baby is a teenager now!

**Tips**


1)Many of them asked which app do I use for scheduling posts, I know hootsuite is considered to be the best but my problem with them is they do not post it for us but only remind us. So, I use Gramblr as all I have to do is schedule posts and make sure the PC is on during the posting times. The disadvantages are that we have to login to Instagram and also there is no app version for this.

2) Myth : Use Hastags to grow! Please do not use hashtags when your account is so small. The whole point of using hashtags is that your post will make it to the top of those hashtags which is highly unlikely since your account is so small, in return you end up getting fake likes and followers because most of the bots will be configured to follow users who use 'x' hashtags. This will degrade the Quality of your account.

**TEENAGER PHASE(10-20K)**

Now the baby is a Teenager and you can try more things. 

1.Continue Follow/Unfollow but you can reduce the number of follows you do at once. May be instead of following 6k people reduce it to 3K and do it in two cycles.

2.Start Looking for accounts in your niche with the same following as you and frorm a group. This is called as engagement groups, but I advice you to only like each others pictures just to give it a push. Do not start commenting yet because it will start looking spammy. Do it at a later stage, for now this group must only focus on liking each others pictures. 

3.Start using hashtags now because now atleast you have considerable amount of following and the probability of your post getting into explore page is high (Because of the engagement activity)

**ADULT PHASE (20-30K)**

By now I am sure you would have formed a good network of like minded accounts. Continue the Group engagement activity and also start occasional comments activity (Allot random days for commenting), Please do not do it everyday because it will look spammy.

You can also start contacting pages with 100k+ followings and ask them to like your picture as soon as you post them. This will give you boost and there have been instances where I have got 200-300 followers in hours because of this. But finding accounts who would do it for free is the though task. This concept is called as power likes. 


**CONCLUSION**
This pretty much sums up the complete guide, I know you will have many questions about this which is why this thread can be AMA types. Feel free get all your doubts cleared before building your accounts! I would love to add more content and make it more structured, if I see a good response again I may consider making a very detailed blog post on this! Waiting to hear from all the entrepreneurs! Lets keep crushing ! :)

1. I was in a crap mood yesterday and seeing the positive responses from everybody helped to raise my spirits, so thank you for that. Glad to see that this resonated with so many of you!
2. A handful of people are mentioning the value of MVPs as a counterargument, but I think those people are misinterpreting the sentiment behind this post. Moving slowly and building an MVP are not mutually exclusive concepts. I just mean to say that one's life circumstances and personal balance might result in slow-moving development of an idea. This relatively slow movement could indeed be directed toward an MVP. Indeed, perfection is the enemy of progress.
3. That said, while I agree with the motivation behind MVPs I think the concept is a bit flawed.

174,d936xz,False,Best Practices,245,Dear Entrepreneurs: You need to charge more money,Entrepreneur,"You're over at a friends house for dinner, and they pull out a bottle of red wine.

They discovered it at a local vineyard while on holiday.

It's delicious. Velvety smooth with a balanced flavor.

So delicious that you want to buy a bottle for yourself[.](https://imgur.com/a/972M5fG)

You pull out your phone to order online, thinking that it'll cost about $40-50.

But after a quick search online you see that the price is only $8.99.

Before hitting the 'Add to Cart' button you refill your glass and take another sip.

Hmmmm.

Come to think of it, there's a bitter aftertaste that you missed before... and you decide not to buy.

**This experience of price influencing our perception is** **VERY** **common.**

We're primed to think that a higher price equals better quality.

A [study at Standford University](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/january16/wine-011608.html) even confirmed this effect on wine drinkers. Increasing the price on the bottle made it taste better.

It's a powerful effect, with many studies backing it up.

One of the most [interesting studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5533658_Commercial_Features_of_Placebo_and_Therapeutic_Efficacy) comes from Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational)...

82 participants received two small electric shocks. One before taking a pain killer and one after.

**In group 1**, they told them the pain killer cost 10c, and they reported less pain 61% of the time.

**In group 2**, they told them the pain killer cost $2.50, and they reported less pain 85% of the time.

But the twist was that both pain killers were actually *placebos*.

The reduced pain was all in their head.

So a high priced placebo reduces pain way more than the cheap one. This highlights the powerful link between price and perceived quality.

**Since we relate price with quality, it has profound implications on your pricing strategy...**

It's important to remember that true market value has very little to do with how clients judge your price.

It's all about *perceived value*.

If you can solve a big problem for your clients, then the perceived value is very high, and *you need to charge a high price*.

As long as you can show the value in your service (how much time, money, or pain you save) then a high price actually makes you *more* desirable.

**The importance of doing this cannot be overstated...**

Higher prices makes your services more desirable.

You'll attract better quality clients that *appreciate* and *value* your work.

This leads to better testimonials and reviews, more referrals and sales, and a flourishing business.

You'll be happier, less stressed, and able to reinvest your time and energy back into the business.

On the other hand...

Lower prices means you're competing on price, not quality. Your service has now become a commodity.

You'll attract low quality clients that expect you to work for peanuts while delivering the world.

This leads to bad reviews, less referrals and sales, and a shrinking business.

You'll be more stressed trying to make ends meet, deliver sub-par work as a result, and end up hating your business.

It's a downward death spiral that you do NOT want happening.

**Key Takeaway:** Avoid the temptation to drop your prices to attract more clients. More often than not it's a bad decision. If anything you should be *raising* your prices.

486,cnba47,False,,221,$35k/mo cleaning houses (Former Tech Employee),Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I started my business around March 2018, since day 1 my wife and I decided to make a business out of this, this wasn't just us ""cleaning houses"".  My background was in technology (I worked 10 years as a Network/Computer Engineer and 5 years as a Software Developer) and what really helped me was putting systems in place, even before we had our first client we decided to have the software in place to handle thousands of clients if needed. Every decision we took was based on ""Can we scale this system?"". 

In 2018 we ended up making $150k. We are now in our second year and we will be making $400k+ by the end of 2019.  

We learned a lot during this time:

**Systems**: This is the secret sauce, we created systems for every single action in the business, for example: now every time we hire a new employee we have a system in place to train that employee and making sure that employee follows the system.

**Culture**: Having happy employees is not about money, is about creating culture and a great place for them to work, we are a team, we are all employees.

**Clients**: You need to make sure you know what business you are on. We don't sell cleaning, we sell peace of mind.

We are now in commercial cleaning as well, this has opened a new revenue stream that could take us over the top. I found a passion in helping other business owners get to a comfortable level of success.

I have formatted this post the best I possibly could for Reddit, but it is still has a ton of images and reads a lot smoother on my site. I am not selling anything and have nothing to gain by having you read this on my site or here on Reddit. So if you want to read this article on my site you can do so [here](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-investment-6-month-update)

&nbsp;

##Intro##

I’m back with the 6 month update on how the $6,000 website investment has gone so far. You will see that things are going very well and it has provided an awesome ROI for both me and my parents. Before I give you all the fresh update, make sure to catch up on the previous two updates below:

&nbsp;

 - [I Just Bought a Website for $6k; Here’s Why](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/i-just-bought-a-website-for-6k-heres-why)
&nbsp;
 - [The 3 Month Update](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/3-month-update-on-my-6000-website-investment/)

&nbsp;

I would suggest reading those two updates if you haven’t already so that you can fully understand everything that I will be talking about in this update. However, for those of you who don't have time to read through the first 2 updates I will quickly recap everything for you below.

&nbsp;

##Quick Recap##

I have been building/buying/growing/selling websites for the past ~2 years and my parents have seen the ROI that websites can provide and were willing to test buying a website as an investment strategy. I found a website making $500/month and I purchased it for $6,000. The site itself makes money from Google Adsense ads, affiliate links and advertisers that buy ad space. The past 6 months I have been growing the site's traffic and earnings and I have been documenting the process I have been making. That's the gist of it, if you want more details behind it you will need to check out the first 2 updates.

&nbsp;

##What I’ve Done Since the Last Update##

It has been 3 months since the last update and to be honest, I have not done a whole lot to the site since then. I have probably put in about 4-5 hours total per month and most of that time has been emailing advertisers and optimizing adsense. The site itself doesn’t take any work as it will continue to earn at a constant rate due to the content being evergreen, meaning that it will always be relevant and will not age. I did do a couple things in the past 3 months and you can read more about them below:

&nbsp;

**Stopped Producing New Content**

The service that I was previously using to produce content ended up going out of business which left me with a decision to make.

&nbsp;

 - I could either find a new content producer via Upwork and keep the fresh content coming 3 times a week like I have been doing since I took over ownership of the site.
 - I could find a new content producer but, slow down the amount of content from 3 new pieces of content per week to 1 new article per week.
 - Stop paying for new content

&nbsp;

I opted to stop paying for new content so that I could take some time to determine if adding new content had a positive ROI for me. I have let this content sit on the site for 3 months and it is now time to determine if I should keep adding new content or if it is best to stop. I will be diving deeper into the results from this and my decision in a second but, I just wanted to let you know that I stopped adding new content these past 3 months.

&nbsp;

**Continued to Optimize Adsense**

The bulk of this sites earnings comes from Adsense so it is smart for me to keep testing and optimizing to find the ads that perform the best. Up until recently, I have been manually testing different ad placements and it has been a real pain in the butt to make changes and to determine what changes led to the most earnings. I was using 3 different plugins to get the ads where I wanted them to be on the site and I was unable to fully optimize the ads for mobile users. This was leaving a lot of money on the table because a good chunk of the sites visitors come via mobile.

&nbsp;

Luckily, I came across a sweet plugin that allows me to test different ad layouts and keeps the stats for each layout so that I am able to determine which one makes the most money. This plugin is called AmpedSense. The owner of the plugin actually helped me setup the plugin on my site and has been super helpful, great guy as well! Take a look at the screenshot below that shows the stats for a couple different ad layouts that I have been testing on the site:

&nbsp;

Stats from Different Adsense Layouts - [http://imgur.com/TFba3mK](http://imgur.com/TFba3mK)

&nbsp;

It gives you all of the stats that are important and in an easy to read fashion. I have only been using this plugin for around 3 weeks and I am excited to see how much I am able to increase the earnings over a longer period of time. One area that this plugin has helped tremendously is for showing ads for mobile users. Take a look at the stats for the ads that are shown to mobile users. The “Baseline” layout was what my site was originally showing before using the plugin:

&nbsp;

Adsense Improvement for Mobile Visitors - [http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX](http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX)

&nbsp;

Ignore the total earnings because the majority of it is from February but, I want you to see the improvements across the board with the new ad layouts. The CTR nearly tripled and the RPM more than doubled. This is HUGE. I’m excited to see how big of an impact this has on the earnings over a month long period. If you are monetizing your site with Adsense and you AREN’T using AmpedSense, you are leaving money on the table. I would highly suggest at least giving it a shot, it’s free!

&nbsp;

##Traffic and Earnings Report##

Let’s see how the site has performed in the last 3 months in terms of traffic and earnings. First, let’s look at the November:

&nbsp;

**November’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of November's Traffic - [http://imgur.com/QQhY945](http://imgur.com/QQhY945)

&nbsp;

A very solid month in terms of the amount of unique users and it was one of the best months since I have owned the site.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The majority of the traffic is still from social media, mainly Pinterest, with direct and organic following it up. Overall, solid month on the traffic side of things and let’s see how this translated into earnings!

&nbsp;

**November’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1](http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1)

&nbsp;

I have to hide all of the data from my Adsense account except I am allowed to show you the amount of earnings it made as well as the date. So in November the site was able to pull in $549.19 from Adsense! Through November, this was my second best month from Adsense.

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/5q26yyX](http://imgur.com/5q26yyX)

&nbsp;

Not a ton of money but, Etsy’s affiliate program made me $64.80 in November!

&nbsp;

Advertisers - Another revenue source is selling banner advertising on the site. I currently have 3 advertisers which add an extra $136 per month to the bottom line.

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in November:

 - Google Adsense: $545.19

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $64.80

&nbsp;

 - Advertising: $136.67

&nbsp;

Total November Earnings: $746.66

&nbsp;

A very good month in terms of earnings and through November, this was my highest earning month yet! Also, since I have stopped paying for content there was no expenses during the month which allowed every cent of the $746.67 earned this month to be all profit. November was my best overall month since I have owned the site. The traffic has increased month over month and it was also my highest earning month. This is awesome to see! However, you will find out that in the next two months the site begins to see even more success.

&nbsp;

**December’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of the Traffic in December - [http://imgur.com/UDISOIY](http://imgur.com/UDISOIY)

&nbsp;

There was close to 40k unique visitors in the month of December, which is slightly down from the previous month. With that being said, still a solid month traffic wise.

&nbsp;

Traffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy](http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy)

&nbsp;

The traffic channels stayed relatively the same since last month but, the organic traffic actually saw some nice growth. Around a 600+ more organic visitors and a 3% increase in the percentage of the total traffic from 16.8% to 19.5% from Organic traffic. This good to see because it means a bigger portion of the website’s traffic is coming from organic searches and is becoming less reliant on social media.

&nbsp;

**December’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ](http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ)

&nbsp;

December saw a decrease in Adsense earnings, although $487.41 is not a bad month by any means!

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W](http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W)

&nbsp;

$55.95 from Etsy! I am super pumped even though it is only 50 bucks because these affiliate links are only on a select few posts where the products make sense to promote.

&nbsp;

Amazon Affiliate - [http://imgur.com/8ouChJs](http://imgur.com/8ouChJs)

&nbsp;

Not much, but an extra $8.65 was earned through the Amazon affiliate program. It all adds up over time.

&nbsp;

Banner Advertisers - Same as last month, an extra $136.67 from the 3 advertisers that pay to have a banner ad on the site. Nothing much else to talk about here.

&nbsp;

Paid Post - I had one person contact me to do a paid post on my site for $50 and I accepted. The content they wrote was good and I made $50, pretty good deal!

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in December:

 - Google Adsense: $487.41

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $55.95

&nbsp;

 - Amazon Affiliate: $8.65

&nbsp;

 - Advertisers: $136.67

&nbsp;

 - Paid Post: $50.00

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in December: $738.68

&nbsp;

Another very good month! Back to back months with over $700 in profits and you will see that the next month was able to continue the trend, more on that below.

&nbsp;

**January’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of the Traffic in January - [http://imgur.com/3jYn88U](http://imgur.com/3jYn88U)

&nbsp;

January saw a HUGE increase in traffic compared to all of the previous months. With over 54,000 unique visitors in January it made it by far the highest amount of traffic in a month. Let’s look at the traffic channels to see where all of this traffic came from

&nbsp;

Traffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/u58xco2](http://imgur.com/u58xco2)

&nbsp;

You might have been able to guess it. Social media, Pinterest, was what provided the site with a nice increase in traffic this month. It would have been nice to see this increase in traffic from organic search because that would mean the content that I was producing 3 months ago is starting to see some rankings and bring in traffic. Nonetheless, still a nice surge in traffic so let’s check out if this was able to lead to an increase in earnings as well.

&nbsp;

**January’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Google Adsense - [http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F](http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F)

&nbsp;

That’s what I like to see! $641.85 was made this month via Adsense, which is $100+ higher than any other month.

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI](http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI)

&nbsp;

A solid $54.50 made from Etsy in January as well, not bad!

&nbsp;

Advertisers - Same thing as the previous months here, $136.67 was made from 3 different advertisers.

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in January:

&nbsp;

 - Google Adsense: $641.85

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $54.50

&nbsp;

 - Advertisers: $136.67

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in January: $833.58

&nbsp;

My best month yet! Thanks to the increase in traffic, there was a nice boost in the Adsense earnings which led to the really good month overall. If I am able to keep up this amount of traffic and combine that with my newly optimized Adsense layout thanks to AmpedSense, I should see some higher earning months coming up.

&nbsp;

##The First 3 Months vs. The Last 3 Months##

Now that I have owned the site for 6 months I can now split that time in half and see what kind of growth the site has seen when comparing the first 3 months to the last 3 months. 3 months is a long enough period to get a good idea of whats working and what isn’t. I will also be able to see the areas of most growth and where I could improve. This whole next section of this article will be comparing various stats from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, should be fun :)

&nbsp;

**Overall Traffic**

This is one of the most important metrics to any website and seeing growth month to month is vital to constantly improving the site. Let’s see how the first 3 months of traffic compared to the last 3:

&nbsp;

First 3 Months Traffic vs. Last 3 Months Traffic - [http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz](http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz)

&nbsp;

The image above shows the traffic stats from the first 3 months compared to the last 3 months. You can see that there has been some nice growth. There was a 23.85% increase in unique visitors in the last 3 months, which is a substantial increase! The # of sessions and pageviews also saw a nice boost.

&nbsp;

**Pinterest Traffic**

This is the sites main traffic driver and it accounts for over 50% of the sites traffic since I have gained ownership. I would like to see the site be less dependent on Pinterest for traffic but, nonetheless, it is still driving a ton of traffic each day. Let’s check out the growth it has seen from the first 3 months to the last.

&nbsp;

First 3 months vs last 3 months - [http://imgur.com/kxw076e](http://imgur.com/kxw076e)

&nbsp;

The first 3 months Pinterest drove 67,000 visitors and in the last 3 months it drove over 80,000, which comes out to a 19% increase! One of the major reasons for the increase is due to a handful of the new articles I published that went viral within Pinterest and they continually drive 100+ visitors a day back to the site. Pinterest is different from the rest of the social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook because the content on Pinterest does not get lost in the past. Old posts will continue to drive traffic on Pinterest because people use it as a search engine and popular posts will rank well. This makes Pinterest a very solid traffic source because it isn’t just one-off traffic, it is consistent and will continue to grow if you keep posting on Pinterest.

&nbsp;

**Organic Search Traffic**

Increasing the organic search traffic was a major focus during the first 3 months that I owned the site. I added a total of 42 new articles to the site during that time period and it will be interesting to see how well the organic traffic increased since then.

&nbsp;

First 3 Months vs. Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/hvriZcK](http://imgur.com/hvriZcK)

&nbsp;

There was a solid 33% growth in organic search traffic from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, which is pretty darn good! Organic traffic increased from 18,000 to 24,000, which is about an extra 2,000 visitors per month in the last 3 months. I think the site will continue to see growth over the next 6+ months as well because all of the articles will have enough time to settle into Google and start to rank for longtail keywords. So I would expect the organic traffic to keep rising over the next few months.

&nbsp;

**Keyword Growth**

One of my favorite tools, Semrush, does an awesome job of showing the growth that your site has seen in keyword rankings and how well that translates to traffic. Let’s check out how my site looks in Semrush:

&nbsp;

Traffic Growth via Semrush - [http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP](http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP)

&nbsp;

As you can see, a good surge in traffic growth according to Semrush. Semrush tracks keywords your site ranks for within the top 100 of Google and translates that to search traffic by looking at the monthly search amount. According to Semrush, my traffic grew by 100% but, as we saw earlier it actually grew by only 33%. So Semrush isn’t 100% accurate but I still feel like it does a good job of showing growth.

&nbsp;

**Keyword Rankings**

Like I said, Semrush tracks the amount of keywords that your site ranks for within the top 100 and you can see how many keywords you ranked for 6 months ago vs. now. That is what we will look at now:

&nbsp;

Keyword Rankings 6 Months Ago According to Semrush - [http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P](http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P)

&nbsp;

6 months ago I had just over 4,000 keywords ranking within the top 100 of Google. I feel like the keywords ranking within the top 10 of Google are the most important, so we will mainly look at that number. There were 18 keywords in the top 3 and 192 ranking in the 4-10 positions, which comes out to a total of 210 keywords ranking in the top 10 of Google. Now let’s compare that to my most recent month, which was 6 months later:

&nbsp;

Keyword Rankings in January According to Semrush (6 months later) - [http://imgur.com/W87AfRC](http://imgur.com/W87AfRC)

&nbsp;

6 months later I am ranking for close to 6,000 keywords within Google, which is close to 2,000 MORE than it was 6 months ago. Now let’s look at the top 10 rankings. There are 29 keywords in the top 3 of Google and 212 ranking in the 4-10 position range, which is a total of 241 keywords ranking within the top 10. The site is ranking for 31 more keywords in the top 10 compared to 6 months ago, which is a solid improvement. As you can probably tell, the majority of the keywords are ranking in the ranges of 21-50 position and 51-100 position. These keywords in these ranges don’t bring in a lot of traffic but, they do have the potential to increase in ranking over time. I think the 42 new articles I published on the site have accounted for a lot of the keywords ranking in this range, so I am hoping that after a couple more months they will be able to move up higher.

&nbsp;

**Adsense Earnings**

The Adsense earnings account for the bulk of my site’s earnings and I have also put a huge emphasis on trying to optimize these ads. Let’s take a look at how they have been performing.

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O](http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O)

&nbsp;

In the first 3 months the site earned $1,333.65 from Adsense, which comes out to $444.55 per month. This isn’t terrible by any means and is still a solid chunk of money each month.

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/3U9J12g](http://imgur.com/3U9J12g)

&nbsp;

In the last 3 months the site has earned a total of $1,678.45 from Adsense, this averages out to $559.48 per month! This is a $100+ increase per month which I am really happy about. This growth I think is mainly due to the increase in traffic the site has seen because with Adsense, more traffic = more earnings. However, I am super pumped to see how the earnings grow now that I have been using AmpedSense which has allowed me to fully test different ad layouts. I am thinking that I will be seeing some nice growth over the next few months in terms of Adsense earnings.

&nbsp;

**Total Site Earnings**

One of the most important metrics to track are the earnings and to compare the first 3 months to the last 3 months. This is looking at the earnings from all of the different sources as well.

&nbsp;

Earnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/UGpvEza](http://imgur.com/UGpvEza)

&nbsp;

Feel free to ignore the traffic stats section as it is in the same spreadsheet that I keep my earnings in so it was caught in the screesnhot. However, in the orange box you can see the earnings by each month. There was a total of $1543.61 earned during this period which averages out to $514.54 per month in earnings. Not bad!

&nbsp;

Earnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6](http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6)

&nbsp;

Once again, feel free to ignore the traffic stats and the large black blob. The total earnings for the last 3 months was $2318.92 and that comes out to $772.97 per month! This a large upgrade over the previous 3 months. In the last 3 months, the site was able to generate $775.31 more money and $258.44 more per month! This is some awesome growth and it was from a combination of things, one major reason was that I was able to land some advertisers that added a quick increase in earnings. That combined with the Adsense improvements helped increase the monthly earnings.

&nbsp;

**Total Site Profits**

Profit, by far the most important metric for any business and it’s funny because a lot of people seem to ignore this stat in their business and only look at the revenue. You can have all of the revenue that you want but, if that doesn’t translate to making ACTUAL money what does it matter? So the last thing that we are going to compare is the profit that the site made:

&nbsp;

Profits in the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH](http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH)

&nbsp;

There was a good chunk of expenses within the first 3 months since I was paying for content to be written at a pretty rapid pace, which caused there to be a large expense per month for new content. You may or may not noticed but, the profits are a bit higher than I reported in the last update due to my content writer giving me a partial refund for the content that they didn’t write for me. So if you noticed the discrepancy between these numbers and the the 3 month update that is why. The first 3 months accounted for $983.61 in profit, which is $327.87 in profit per month. This would value the site at right around $6,500 based on the 20x multiple if I were to sell it at this point. Let’s see how that value changed over the next 3 months.

&nbsp;

Profits in the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/acCsv2v](http://imgur.com/acCsv2v)

&nbsp;

You can see right away that these months were WAY better, mainly due to their being no expenses combined with a solid increase in earnings. A total of $2318.92 was earned in profit during this time and that comes out to be $772.97 per month. With the new 3 month average being $772.97 per month in profit, the site is now valued at around $15,500 if I were to sell it now! Remember, I bought the site for $6,000. I will touch on the subject of selling the site and the current value in a minute.

&nbsp;

##Current Return on Investment##

Remember that this website is acting as an investment vehicle and it needs to be giving a solid ROI for the investors, which are my parents. So let’s see the type of ROI they have seen so far from this website. Just as a refresher, my parents and I split the monthly profits 50/50.

&nbsp;

Total Profit - [http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG](http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG)

&nbsp;

The site has made a total of $3302.53 in profit since I took over ownership. This means that my parents have made a total of $1,651.26 on their $6,000 investment over a 6 month period.

&nbsp;

**What kind of ROI is this?**

My parents have seen a 27.5% ROI on their initial investment! Over a year long period, this would come out be a 55% yearly ROI, which is 5x better than the average stock market investment, especially during the current market conditions. Not only are my parents getting an awesome ROI on their investment each month but, I am also building up a sellable asset along the way that I can cash out whenever I want. It is hard to find an investment that provides this type of upside. I now want to walk through the idea of possibly selling the site and what kind of ROI we would see if we decided to go this route.

&nbsp;

##Should we Sell?##

Now that I have owned the site for 6 months and have a solid track record of earnings and of the traffic, we could now sell the site if we wanted to. Also, by not paying for new content and increasing the monthly earnings the last couple of months I have been able to maximize the site’s value. So right now would be a good time to sell the site if we wanted to. I’m not sure I have mentioned this before but, my parents buy houses and repair them and then flip them or rent them out. They basically do what I do with websites but with real estate. It runs in the family I guess :)

&nbsp;

However, my point of bringing this up is that they are looking to purchase another house and they would like cash from this website out so they can use the money with the new house they buy. So that means my parents are looking to sell the site pretty soon.

&nbsp;

##ROI If We Sold the Site Now##

If we decided to sell the site right now, based on the earnings through January, the site would be valued at around $15,500. I would probably sell the site through Empire Flippers which they they would take 15% of the sale price as a selling fee so we need to take that into account. This would mean that we would get around $13,200 for the site after the 15% fee is taken out.

&nbsp;

The agreement that I had with my parents for when we sold the site is that they would get their initial investment back of $6,000 and then we would split the rest 50/50. So after they got their $6k back there would be $7,200 to split between us from the $13,200 we made from the sale of the site. This would come out $3,600 for my parents and $3,600 for myself. Now, we add this $3,600 made from the sale of the site with the $1,651.26 of monthly profits from the past 6 months and that comes out to a total of $5,251.16 in PROFIT for my parents and the same amount of profit for myself. In this 6 month period, my parents made $5,251.26 in profit on a $6,000 investment, that comes out a 87.5% ROI through 6 months. That is an insane ROI in a very short period of time.

&nbsp;

I’m going to quickly break these numbers down so it is easier to digest:

&nbsp;

**Breakdown of My Parents ROI:**

&nbsp;

 - Total Monthly Profits: $1,651.26

&nbsp;

 - Profit from Site Sale: $3,600

&nbsp;

 - Total Profits: $5,251.26

&nbsp;

 - Initial Investment: $6,000

&nbsp;

 - Return on Investment (through 6 months): 87.5%

&nbsp;

My parents will be very happy with this kind of return and I am truly excited to be able to help my parents out as well. They were nice enough and believed in me enough to invest $6,000 into my idea and it looks like it is going to work out well. I’m extremely grateful, thanks mom and dad :)

&nbsp;

##Is Money Being Left on the Table?##

If we sell the site within the next month do I think there is some money being left on the table? Yes, I do. I think that the content that I published on the site 3 months ago is just starting to gain some traction within Google and I think continuing to add content will help grow the site. I also think that the Pinterest traffic will continue to grow if I keep adding new content as well. Combine this traffic growth with the fact that I am now truly able to optimize adsense ads with AmpedSense and  I think the site could get to $1,000 per month in profit within 3-6 months from now.

&nbsp;

Are we losing out on a TON of money? No, not really. I just feel like the site hasn’t reached it’s potential yet. However, I am 100% fine with selling the site. Please don’t think that I am complaining about my parents wanting to sell the site, because that is not what I am doing at all. I am just being completely honest with you all and saying that I think the site still has more potential.

&nbsp;

##Wrapping Things Up##

My parents and I have made the decision to let it earn for one more month and then see what kind of valuation it will get from Empire Flippers. Depending on how they value the site we will either list our site for sale or keep it longer. We will be making this decision at the end of February and I will make sure to keep you all up to date on what we do. Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoyed the 6 month update on the website investment. I hope that I have opened your eyes on the crazy ROI websites can provide you with.

**Understanding the basics of Facebook advertising**

Throughout the years, I’ve heard many explanations of how Facebook works. Most of them are complete BS based on ignorance and in 99% of cases those stories are nothing different than conspiracy theories.

Facebook is a content network and Facebook strives to serve ‘only the best’ content to people which find that content relevant. Facebook measures relevance by checking the ratio between content reach (impressions) and engagement rate (reactions, comments, and shares).

When your post or an ad is highly engaging, Facebook will mark it as relevant and give you a ‘push’ in distribution pipeline – in other words, you’ll get **bigger reach for less money.**

Every successful Facebook advertising campaign is contained from 2 factors – **Content and Distribution**.

[Content is the king... but distribution is the queen and she wears the pants.](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jonathan-perelman-former-vp-of-agency-strategy-buzzfeed.png)

**1. Content or ad relevance**
You need no more than 1000 impressions to see if your ad is working, or not. **CPM (Cost-per-mille, mille=1000 impressions)** is less relevant in this stage, doesn’t matter if it’s **$5** or **$75**. Focus only on metrics that will show you how your content (ad) is performing;

* CTR (Click-through-rate)
* Engagement rate (Reactions, comments, shares)
* Video view rate (Until which point (%) is your video being watched)

Through these 3 metrics you can see if you have an ad that can drive **engagement**, **clicks** and ultimately, **sales**.

*Note: This is not ad relevance score that Facebook displays in Ads Manager.*

**2. Distribution**
When you have an ad that’s relevant (and working), it’s time to start investing in outreach. In this stage, you should focus on metrics that bring you closer to the **desired action**, such as making a** sale** or **acquisition** and **overall CPA**.

* CPM (Cost-per-mille, mille=1000 impressions)
* CPC (Cost-per-click)
* CVR (Conversion rate)
* CPA (Cost-per-action)

Through these metrics you can have a direct influence on your sales record, a number of leads generated or apps installed.

For instance, you have a budget for Facebook Advertising which says **$500/day**. By lowering your CPC (Cost-per-click) by **50%** (and maintaining landing page CVR of **4%**) you can get your CPA down by **100%** and **double your sales/day**.

That’s the way that Facebook and Facebook advertising work.

**Video killed the banner star**

Original Buggles famous refrain from 1979 said ‘Video killed the radio star’, which carried a deep message about emerging trend of music videos. Radio was already dying and the video was about to explode. People could enjoy not only the audio aspect of music but a visual medium as well.

The same thing happened when Facebook introduced video advertising back in 2014. From an advertising perspective, it was just amazing, especially in the terms of distribution. Cost-per-impression in video advertising was drastically lower than banners. And it still is.

But not only that, the medium of communication changed. Two-minute video can explain (and sell) more than a greatly designed banner with a 2000 word copy. For an average reader (200 words per minute), it would take 10 minutes to read and they still wouldn’t get that special feeling of your product.

I’ve heard many times that videos are ‘expensive’ to produce, which is completely false. Solid video a.k.a. the commercial will cost you around $2000 to produce in HD or full HD.

If you’re selling something simple to understand, your videos can be shorter and done in a sequence. If you decide to go with animated explainer videos, it’s going to cost you between $500-1000 for something decent. If you want to get a video produced for less than a dinner for two, visit fiverr.com (not recommended).  In other words, possibilities are merely endless.


Now let’s break the math behind the Facebook advertising with video. Imagine that your total advertising budget is around $5000. Here’s the simple math behind it;

[Banner vs. video](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/banner-vs--video.png)

In this imaginary case, numbers say that video production would pay off (in the terms of distribution) in around 25 days. With a video, you could reach almost 20% more people just in the first month. If you continue running for the second month, the video would get around 1 million impressions vs. a banner which would get around 500K impressions.

**Don’t let your ads look like – ads**

No matter if you’re using banners or videos, your ad copy shouldn’t sound like an ad copy. Rather, make your ads feel natural. When people scroll through their newsfeed, they’re being bombarded with ads. Nobody likes that. People don’t like being manipulated or pushed to do something.

[Gary Halbert Quote](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gary-halbert-autor-of-the-boron-letters.png)

Don’t believe me? Just pick up the phone, type in the random number and start blabbing about the greatness of your product to a random person. In 9 out of 10 cases, they’re going to hang up. Your ads aren’t going to do any better than that, trust me.

**Call-to-action (CTA)** is very important part of every ad. That doesn’t mean that you should include it in the headline. Tell your story first and then ask for the money. The converse will not work.

Also, try to avoid buzzwords like *FREE, new, the best*, etc. in your first interaction with the target audience. Don’t bring the big guns to the game too early. You don’t want to sell them something just once – aim to build a relationship which will result in high customer retention rate. Just liked Rand Fishkin said;

[Tell me Rand.](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rand-fishkin-founder-of-moz.png)

Take a look at what we did with Breeo – ad did its job perfectly.

['The ad'](https://www.facebook.com/breeollc/videos/810066365799445/)

*All the credit for the video production goes to Jonathan and the team from Breeo.*

**Start with split testing**

Split testing isn’t about getting 100s of ads out and seeing which works the best. That’s not split testing, that’s not a scientific approach for long term results – that’s guesswork.

I’ve heard people talking about scaling in the same manner. Scaling campaigns is not just ramping up a budget from $10/day to $1,000/day, or even worse, $10,000.

In 99.9% of cases, it’s just a recipe for a financial disaster.

[Aaaaand it's gone](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/and-its-gone.jpg)

One simple, yet effective strategy we use for video advertising on Facebook is contained in **3 simple steps** and performs marvelously every single time.

Before you start split testing, do the research to get a feeling of your target audience. Male or female? Both? 18-35 or maybe 36-50? Go with something similar and don’t fear to go to broad. You’ll go more specific once you have an ad that’s working.

**Step 1 – Test video**

We won’t start from the fact that you have a good video. You probably don’t. Your video isn’t finished when the editor says so – it’s finished when you achieve decent view rates.

Average video view rate can easily tell you to which point is your video being watched and when it actually becomes boring and people stop watching it.

For products with mass market potential you should aim for 20-25% average view rate, everything below 10% is unacceptable. For B2B and niche high-end products, everything between 10-15% is ok, below 5% is unacceptable. Why? Because both business and niche high-end products are understood by smaller groups of people – even though you’re targeting well-defined audiences, most of the people are going to find your ad boring.

[Video view metrics](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/video-view-rates.png)

Also, track how much people are actually clicking through the ad and going to your website. Before you decide that your video isn’t working and you need a new one, make sure that you try strong call-to-action at the end of the video.

**Step 2 – Test copy**

Once you have a video that’s being watched and click you’re halfway there. Now it’s time to create a compelling message. In most cases copy on top of the video doesn’t have to be written by professional copywriter – it just has to catch the attention or briefly describe the problem or the solution in the video to the potential watcher. Including a question often does the job. Get the engagement going.

The best thing about Facebook advertising is social proof. Not just on Facebook, but on every social network. People tend to trust other people (even if they don’t know them). Having an ad with high engagement, especially if the engagement is positive, sells.

[Engagement rate](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/engagement-rates-and-social-proof.png)

High engagement results in instant brand awareness and instant sales.

**Step 3 – Targeting**

Here’s one trick that works marvelously on mass market products. It worked on Breeo.

Instead of having 10 different ad sets containing slightly different or same ads, try pointing 10 different ad sets to a single **PPE (Page-post-engagement)** ad.

[PPE campaign structure](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ppe-campaign-structure.png)

That way you don’t have to build up the social proof on 10 different ads, but just on one, which is for the start more cost effective. More engagement brings, of course, more engagement – which leads to the ad going ‘viral’ and you getting filthy rich (or not).

Ramp up the number of different demographics, see which lead to the desired action and which score higher engagement. 
**Then optimize and scale.**

*Note: This strategy works extremely well on cold traffic and product launches, but fails to deliver results on retargeting and retention campaigns.*

**Next steps**

Sticking to strategical points I’ve outlined above helped us to serve almost a half a billion impressions (498 million) to more than 200 million people across the globe for our clients, just in 2016. I’m quite sure that you can apply it to your business too, so get out there and start testing.

103,92onia,False,,289,IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MONEY THEN HERE'S SOME WAYS TO START TODAY GOD DAMNIT,Entrepreneur,"I understand this may come off as harsh, but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect - I KNOW how valuable your time really is and I so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself.

YOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM - TO SEE THE DOLLARS COME IN AND CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN DO IT!

If this post helps one person TAKE ACTION, I will be so happy! There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)

To be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.

You 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. 

I want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.

Not some long ass gameplan..

RIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!

This is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)

Personally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )

I know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. 

My path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!

Here are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..

(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)

'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'

There are millions of items out there that you can make money on..

Everything has a value.

I have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..

First of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..

'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'

Search 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.

Do not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)

'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'

+ Thrift stores

Check your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.

If you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!

Maybe even hundreds of things!

The most random crap sells for a lot online.

Teacups? Look them up! 

Old board games? Look em up!

Action figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!

Usually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.

I always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - 

Over the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!

+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)

Have a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.

Find community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..

Get up early!

My secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!

This way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! 

+ Craigslist 

Besides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

Personally I think this is a gamechanger.

Make a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'

Explain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. 

You wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.

People respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..

+ Ebay

You don't have to leave the house for this one!

Make an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..

This will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!

+ Ebay to Amazon

Most people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.

Because of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!

You can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!

*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.

+ Alibaba.com

Most likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.

Every fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.

This is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! 

Just a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)

It takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!

There are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!

I hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! 

Please please please let me know if you have any questions!

 I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..

Life can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!

Anyway that's about it..

Have a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!

474,gjzshi,False,,202,I am failing as a leader,Entrepreneur,"Backstory: I am a dentist and I purchased my first dental office last fall. It was and still is a great opportunity financially. There have been many circumstantial challenges and set backs early that I would like to think they were unique to my business, but I am sure they were not. I feel as if these setbacks could have been avoided had I not made tactical mistakes as the decision maker. In large part, we were getting over those setbacks around six months into ownership. 

Having a break due to COVID, I am able to reflect on my leadership and see myself as a **FAILURE** despite having nearly doubled year-to-date revenues this past February. **I am a failure because**

&#x200B;

* I overworked and under appreciated my team (disposable) 
   * We were understaffed. I failed to hire team members to replace those that left fast enough 
   * I failed to replace a leaking cavitron (machine used for cleaning teeth) 
* I made my team feel shameful by putting them in tough positions 
   * I failed to set up the proper system for us to answer phone calls with a high answer rate. Leaving my staff to answer to patient complaints such as ""We do not answer the phone"" or ""Never return voicemails"" or ""Said that we would call back but never did"" 
   * Early on I failed to keep petty cash at the front desk, meaning my front desk staff would have to come to me personally to ask for change, that I would sometimes pull from my own pocket 
   * I have interviewed candidates who while touring the office have the look that says ""I do not ever see myself working here"". To me that feeling must make my current team feel shameful. 
* I took motivated people and unmotivated them. Then I would internally criticize them for not meeting expectations. 
   * My team was made up of motivated employees. Yes, each one of them had their faults and things that they could've worked on. We all do. However, I burned their motivation to the ground. 
   * I look back at other leadership positions in which I have done the same and realized that I have a pattern of taking initially motivated employees and taking that away from them. 
* Financially insecure 
   * At times we were close to running out of very basic supplies in a dental office. My intent was to only order supplies in such a way that I did not keep thousands of dollars stocked up in supplies and was ordering them more on an as needed basis as we were closing to running out. In my eyes I was making smart financial decision, while I suspect that in my team's eyes it was saying that we don't have enough money as a business to buy supplies. 
   * I failed to process payroll by the payroll company's deadline for next business day fund transfer. There was no reason for that to happen. There were more than enough funds in the business account. It was simply a failure of leadership. 
* I lack credibility 
   * I do not follow through on what I say I am going to do. I am setting the same precedent for my team when dealing with patients and the same precedent for my team when dealing with me. 
      * I do not hold myself accountable. Nor do I hold my team accountable. 
   * Ex. ""We are going to implement this policy starting tomorrow"" 
      * I do not create a solid policy. If I do, it is half baked. 
      * I try to half a\*\* implement a half-a\*\* policy and fail 
      * I do not follow through and let the tyranny of the urgent get in my way. 
      * The policy becomes an after thought 
* Stingy and scare mentality 
   * It is traditional for dental offices to give staff a bonus at the end of the year. I failed to do so. 
   * I purchased cheaper paper towels, which my employees brought to my attention (since then, I have high quality paper towel) 
* Un-fun poor/work environment 
   * I was so caught up in the day to day that I did not realize that it was around Christmas time and we should put up Christmas decorations. 
   * The previous doctor and his wife used to mop the floor daily. I failed to do that. Nothing is dirty, but it is not naturally to the same standard as with the previous doctor 
* I micromanage 
   * I am over involved in every process. I generally believe I do know better. Even if I do, I need to learn how to make improvements to processes and evaluate in a way that is done without micromanaging. 
* There is no separation between my “business” and my personal life. I am consumed by working in and on my business and am compromising personal relationships.  
* Additionally 
   * My office is unorganized/unsystematized  
   * We have poor employee retention 
   * Weak employee retention 
   * This leads to suboptimal customer service 
   * We missed tremendous financial opportunity as a business 
   * We lose good patients due to my failures 

I am a failure. I am letting down my family, my team members, my patients, everyone that believed in me and helped me get to this point. I am failing myself.   


I am not depressed as I am fighting every day to make things better. The lowest of lows was probably in November and things were starting to come along. Up-to mid February, things cash flow was tight financially. We were producing revenue, but our AR was getting out of hand (we were not collecting) 

Something hit me today that led me to look introspectively at my mistakes.   


Nonetheless, I would still give myself a ""F"" in leadership even if things were looking better financially. This is not a cry for sympathy, but more so an exercise self reflection for clarity. 

&#x200B;

453,61r0l6,False,,67,My experience running Facebook ads and my cheat sheet on how to make them work for you.,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

I saw a lot of people posting on this sub asking questions about FB ads so I thought I'd start the week by sharing my experience about them and how to actually get started with them and have a positive ROI. For a long time I ignored Facebook ads because I heard horror stories about people losing money with them, bots, fake clicks etc. I was also simply focused on building my business and selling to customers and had no actual time to get started with them.

That said, Facebook is now actually pretty well developed compared to a few years ago and about 2 years ago I decided to give ads a go and did it for my own company, for a few SaaS businesses and for a few Ecommerce stores and there is clearly money to be made since billions are spent every year on ads.

# **The mistakes I see the most with FB ads:**

----

## 1. Business with no clear value proposition.

A lot of businesses try to start with Facebook ads but forget to actually build a sound business, with a great value proposition. 

Before you put any money on Facebook ads, make sure what you are selling is appealing to your prospective customers. Sales are usually a good indicator that there is actual demand for your product / service.

Facebook ads are just a way to create additional demand for your product and reach a wider audience through creative means but they will not correct the foundations of your business.

----

## 2. Not understanding the context of Facebook.

This is the second big one: When you go to Facebook you go there to relax. I like to take the tube in the morning and look at my Facebook feed to relax before meeting with clients. I certainly do not go there to buy anything. I go on Facebook because I see interesting content from my friends and family and get entertained.

This is a key aspect of Facebook: Facebook generates relevant and engaging content to you so you keep coming back on the platform and see ads. If we compare Facebook to Adwords, FB ads are about creating demand whereas Adwords is about supplying existing demand.

The good thing is that Facebook ads are generally cheaper than Adwords as a result. Adwords already knows that people are looking for your products and capitalize on that.

This thus mean that you have to create various ads to create and capture efficiently that demand. More on that below.

----

## 3. Not getting the targeting right.

Targeting is another big mistake I see with FB ads. A lot of people blindly use interest targeting and hope it will drive conversions. In all honesty, I do not 100% trust interest targeting and consider it like looking for a needle in a haystack. While I do sometimes use it, I mostly use custom audiences (For example: email subscribers, previous customers, people who watched a large part of a video I posted, people who visited my website recently, or even people who messaged my page on Messenger or interacted with my page). I then usually proceed with polishing that audience by excluding people depending on the objective I have in mind and double down with lookalikes. I sometimes also start with interest targeting but that is never my first choice.

Targeting the right customers also means your ads get cheaper and that you get a higher ROI as a result, since Facebook only needs to show the ad to a few people. It is a win win for you and Facebook. You'll get cheaper conversions and Facebook will have to show your ad to less people, which will make your ads cheaper as a result.

----

## 4. No clear strategy about what you are actually trying to achieve.

The magic of Facebook is that you can actually create a ton of different ads with different end goals. You can create video ads, you can create like ads, retargeting ads, messenger ads, and more. Each ad format usually performs best with a clear goal in mind. For example, I like to use video ads to create awareness, create lead ads for contests, and retargeting ads to engage with people who already know the brand or existing customers to upsell them.

This means that you need to have a clear strategy in mind when creating your ads. There is no one size fits all but customers are at different parts of your funnel. 

Usually there are three stages:

* 1) Customers who do not know about you
* 2) Customers who know about you but haven't bought 
* 3) Customers who have already bought from you / are power users of your product. 

Knowing that, you can create different campaigns so that you move those customers down the funnel.

## 5. Going too quickly to stop an ad / not putting enough budget in place.

Facebook ads take time. When you start a campaign, Facebook will take a few days to show your ads to people and will optimize it to serve it to the most relevant audience, so that they get cheaper for you. You also need to set up an appropriate budget so that you reach an audience wide enough for Facebook to properly optimize your ad.


----

## 6. Broken website or no clear landing page.

Make sure your website makes sense to users, that the navigation works well and that you have a clear call to action. You can also use a landing page service to make sure your users' precious attention is directed towards a precise action (for example: Newsletter sign up, clear add to basket form, etc.)

----

# **How to actually get started with Facebook ads**

----

## 1. Learn Facebook ads with Facebook's own Blueprint course.

This is a major resource since it is developed by Facebook itself. Go through the whole course, take notes and Google what parts do not seem clear for you.

----

## 2. Learn about copywriting and ad design.

In my experience, Facebook ads work well with highly visual content and little text. Start with creating a highly visual image (for example people faces, or close-ups of your product). You do not need to be a designer to do that and keep it simple. Your image / visuals matter the most and the text section is usually there to confirm for the user what you are trying to convey with your image. So focus first on your design and then write your copy as step #2. 

A good way to learn copywriting is to write a bit every day, and to read a lot. Write as if you would talk to someone in front of you, even if it is just a random subject.

----

## 3. Learn about psychology and generic advertising.

Mastering the Facebook ads platform is probably only 20% of the job and is only a technical aspect. The other 80% actually comes from you and your ability to create strategies that speak to your audience. My advice here is to look at what other businesses are doing. Learn about psychology / motivation and read a few generic books on advertising. The key here is to develop soft skills and empathy / emotional intelligence so that your ads matters to your audience.

----

## 4. Understand the metrics and KPI's you need to be tracking.

Your first step is to install the Facebook pixel so you can actually track the results of your ads. Secondly, you need to be tracking various KPI's (CTR, Frequency, ...) to make sure your campaigns make sense and are profitable for you.

Some of the most relevant metrics are the following:

* a. Your CTR (i.e:  Number of clicks divided by number of impressions) 
* b. Your Frequency (i.e: How many times your ads are shown to people)
* c. Reach: Number of unique people your ad reached.
* d. Relevance score: Numbers of actual and expected positive and negative feedbacks - it will impact the performance and costs of your ads.
* e. Your primary action metric: Whether it is video views, sales, website registrations, it is the most important metric you need to track in the end to have a positive ROI.

----

## 5. Practice! 

You do not need a ton of money to practice with Facebook ads. If you are running a local business or highly niche business it will even be cheaper. Practice for a few weeks / months until you are confident and never stop learning and trying new things since even the best advertisers have to change their strategies as users get fatigued / the platform is ever evolving.


----

# **My cheat sheet to make Facebook ads work**

----

I am a big believer in processes / systems and being organised as a whole. I therefore try to see patterns to make ads work and here is what I usually do when creating a new campaign:

## 1. I identify at what stage the business is / what are its primary objectives.

Is the business fairly new and needs more people to know about it? Does the business need to upsell existing customer and make them loyal advocates for the brand? My first step would try to understand what the business is trying to do.

----

## 2. I set up a list of medium to long term objectives.

I usually set up campaigns that automatically pause when someone jumps in another part of the purchase lifecycle. My purchase lifecycle is as follow:

* a) Person does not know about my product / company - I will create engaging content that make the person more aware of what the product / service is about.

* b) Prospect: visited the site / interacted with content  - I will set up a campaign that seeks to sell things to that prospect or continue to engage with that prospect depending on how high the intent is. It is also at this stage that I will exclude people that are not interested in my product / service.

* c) Existing customer: knows about the service / product - I will set up a campaign that seeks to make that customer an advocate for my brand and to buy even more products.


My ultimate advice for this one is : Understand vision. It is a big key in advertising and basically people have to envision in their mind what your product / service is about. 

To give you an example: If you can clearly picture the benefits in your mind of what the ad is trying to make you do, your brain will create motivation which will make you go to the next step. If there is no motivation, there is no action and there is no purchase / registrations as a result. 

Your end goal when creating Facebook ads is ultimately to motivate people to take action, by instilling vision. 

So how to motivate people to click on your ad? 

* 1. Grab attention with a promise (for example use a great visual that speaks to your user) 
* 2. Create vision by supplying your image with copy that reasonates / identifies with the user (for example: Imagine staying at this 5 stars resort with your loved one) which supplies a nice picture of a cottage on the beach. 

----

## 3. I fire up the campaigns (usually for 1 or 2 weeks) and tweak them over the time. 


The key here is to test everything. I constantly research the audiences, tweak the copy, and split test ads.


----

## 4. Measure KPI's and increase spend if necessary.

I use a few ad management tools and look closely at KPI's / automatically stop campaigns or double down on campaigns that are performing well. 

----

**Next steps**

----

This was only an introduction but there are more useful tools that Facebook recently opened to the public. For example reach and frequency buying  (you can create campaigns with a reach objective for example). My advice is to follow the announcements on the blog of Facebook and Google on strategies.

47,elckkv,False,Tools,198,I scraped the top 100 e-commerce stores using Shopify. Here are my boring findings.,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

Last month I realized anyone could pretty much find out who the biggest Shopify stores are since they're all hosted under the same IP: 23.227.38.32

Knowing this, I scraped the Top 100 Shopify Stores by Alexa Rank, using myips.ms - so these are the most visited e-commerce stores using Shopify in the whole world:

[Full list of the top 100 Shopify stores \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/GQ60XWl)

(P.S: I transformed the Alexa rank into Estimated Monthly Traffic for easier understanding)

Now, as for my findings:

**1. Clothing is king, and the whole Fashion niche rules over everything.**

[Full break-down of Niches \(Image\)
](https://imgur.com/59PrUEI)

Of the top 100 Shopify Stores, 29 had Clothing as their main niche.

Add Accessories, Footwear, Underwear plus Swimwear stores - which amount to 21 stores in total - and you have exactly **50% of the top 100 stores** belonging somewhere and somewhat in the Fashion niche.

Taking a closer look, the biggest store currently on Shopify is Fashion Nova, which is a fashion company (well, *duh*) with over 21 million visits per month. Their traffic numbers are actually 3 times as large as their 2nd competitor (which is a makeup store).

Now, this really is **The Mountain vs Oberyn** levels of competition.
 
Fashion Nova can essentially A/B test their landing pages and user experience until their conversion rates just blow away every competitor.

And even then, this as a whole will benefit the entire Fashion niche - as they can simply ~~steal~~ *learn* from Fashion Nova UX choices and improve their own conversion rates for free.

No other niche has this much free information to be studied and replicated online.

***Main takeaway:*** If you want to start a new e-commerce store or expand yours, a local needleworker can end up being more helpful than mindlessly browsing Ali-express.


**2. You don't need to have Walmart prices to sell like Walmart.**

[Full breakdown of the Best-sold Product prices \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/vhRiBSx)

Yes, some 29% of the Best-Sold Products on the list are under 25$, but 50% of the top stores have their Best-Sold product at a price point above 50$. 

Were you expecting this? I really wasn't.

This means big stores aren't obliged to do drop-shipping prices, even though some of these stores are (clearly) sourcing products for cheap in Asia.

**Branding up and niching down** seems to be the absolute key here.

And see it for yourself - go to any store from the list, and check if you can't identify their customer persona straight away.

All these stores have made the effort to laser-target their niche because that means they'll be the only ones able to satisfy it.

Finally, having a larger margin per product is also one of the very few ways these stores get to increase their sales - because larger product margins will mean a larger advertising budget, which in the end will mean a larger number of customers reached.

Remember that almost all of these stores survive and grow strictly through Facebook/Instagram ads - 93% of these 100 stores are using Facebook ads (trust me, I checked them one-by-one).

***Main takeaway:*** Always focus on selling the benefit and not only product features, so you can brand yourself and distance your product from the common Youtube drop shipper.

**3. Mobile Site Speed isn't a concern when you get a lot of traffic.**

[Mobile Site Speed breakdown \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/tiqCG9T)

Some of these stores are taking longer to load on mobile than Usain Bolt took to run 100 meters on the Olympics. 

It's this bad.

And because of this, it would seem that Site Speed doesn't affect nearly as much the sales or traffic numbers as one would predict.

However, this a *misleading behavior* that you shouldn't replicate.

Yes, these stores still have their traffic and large sales numbers for sure - but Amazon found in an early e-commerce study that for every 100ms (meaning 1/10 of a second) of site delay, they *lost 1% of sales*. ([Source](https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/))

Meaning many stores in this list could, in theory, **almost double their sales numbers**, by just working to decrease their site speed to regular values - and all this without ever having to increase their traffic numbers.

This is free money they're leaving on the table every month.

***Main takeaway:*** Focus on having your e-commerce site speed low (especially mobile site speed), because unless you already have traffic in the hundreds of thousands and/or an established brand, your sales will tank (or never even takeoff).

And that's it for today.

752,cx7hw1,False,AMA,137,I made my first ever sale today!,Entrepreneur,"In fact, I made 11! Totalling £450 in revenue totalling in £380 pretax profit! 

It’s been a long and hard journey to get to this point.

The most important thing I’ve done was to build my audience before launching the product. I amassed 220 email subscribers who registered interest in my product. 

This grew from finding my target audience on Instagram and creating valuable resonating content for them. I also ran ads in order to test my proposition and to validate if people would intend to buy the product or not (smoke test).

It’s early days but the fact I’ve sold something for real now makes it REAL! 

The secret is, the product doesn’t exist yet. It’s a pre-order purchase. It will help me learn if the price point is correct, and if people actually buy it (And they are! Whoop!)

943,9wyynx,False,Case Study,107,I have got 81% Open rate and 59% Reply Rate on my cold emails. [Templates included] Here's How. I have explained everything here.,Entrepreneur,"I have sent lots and lots of cold emails. It's a thing that startup entrepreneurs must do to acquire customers.

In the earlier stage, you need to go to your customers rather than waiting for the customers to come to you. And, there's nothing easier which is free and provides a better return over time spent than cold emails and cold calls. This is why you still receive lots of cold calls from insurance companies and banks.

I used to suck at cold email till a few months ago. I am still not best at it, but I am sure that I am better than most of you. Here's the proof.

My latest cold email campaign to 100 people got me 59% replies and 29% clicked on the links that I provided in the email. Out of that 59% reply, 21% converted. There were 1 email + 4 follow up emails. And yes, the open rate was whopping 81%.

**Proof -** [https://imgur.com/a/DzWSqpO](https://imgur.com/a/DzWSqpO)

I had spent a lot of time thinking that what was I doing wrong because I was not getting a good response to my emails. Out of 100 emails that I sent, I receive a reply on only 5-6 of them, and conversion rate was either 0 or 1.

Then I figured out that I was writing the emails from my perspective. I was describing the things that are adding value to my business, not the recipient's.

So, I changed the way of writing emails and started to write it from the recipient's perspective. I started to what would recipient get 95-97% of time. Rest of thetime, I wrote what would I get.

This is what I did.

## You need to automate your cold emails for better performance

Yes, you're right. You and I are human. If you keep on sending the cold emails manually then you'll forget to follow up sometimes. In some cases, if the optimal time for follow up is 2:15 PM, let's say, and you're not free at that time then you'll miss the follow-up. This is why it should be automated.

I used Saleshandy to automate cold emails. It uses my own email account to send emails. I just upload the recipients email and it will start firing the emails based on the template that I provide. The best thing is that it can follow up to the people who do not reply to email. So, if someone does not reply to my first email, Saleshandy will send the follow-up mail. If someone does reply to my first email, Saleshandy will automatically stop the follow-up email.

## Get the recipient first name, company name, and email address ready

Gathering the email IDs of the recipients is a pain. I use Norbert for this. Just write the name and company's website URL, and it will do its best to fetch the email address.

Per my experience, it has given my correct email address around 75% of the time.

## The subject that makes the recipient open the email

Subject line matters. If your recipients get lots of emails, be pretty much sure that he will read or delete the email based on the subject line.

Your eamil won't be opened if the subject is

* too much salesy ""I HAVE THIS FOR YOU. BUY NOW""
* very generic like ""An offer you""
* looks spammy like ""Buy now within 24 hours or the offer will go away"". However, this subject line works with the newsletters because people know the company which sent the newsletter. If I receive two emails with this subject line, one from Amazon and another from an unknown person, I may open the Amazon email and make the purchase but I wouldn't even bother to open the unknown person's email
* The IP from which you send the emails is blacklisted. Your emails would end up in the junk folder. What a waste.

**So, what's the best subject line?**

The best subject line is the one that summarizes the motive of the cold email. 

In my campaign, the recipients were coworking spaces owners and I was offering a month of a free magazine subscription to all of their members.

My subject line was

First Name, are you interested in talking about a free offer for your member?

Adding the name in the subject line makes a lot of difference. I have not seen anyone in my entire life who does not love his name. Your recipients are busy and they have more than 50 unread emails. Just by seeing the one's name in the subject line, attention directly goes to that email. You are already ahead of rest of 49 emails that ended up in your recipients inbox without his first name in the subject line.

Just as a proof, my email open rate was 81% which is very-very good number. The average is somewhere around 20-30%.

Apart from the first word i.e. recipient's name, the rest of my email was describing exactly what I was offering. 

## The body of the first email

The first two paragraphs and the last paragraph matters the most. This is what everyone reads. if the first two paras are not convincing, your recipient will not bother to read any further.

Before I get into the body of the email, I would like to write out what your recipient will think after receiving your email.

**Step 1 -** The first thing he'll notice is the subject name. We have already figured out what to write in the subject.

**Step 2-** He will start to think who are you. This is why you need to answer this question at the very beginning of your email

**Step 3 -** As soon as he knows you, he will start to know more about the offer and what does he need to do get that offer. This is where you need to write what will recipient get and what does he need to do to get that offer.

**Step 4 -** The last thing he will think is how much money does he need to pay for that offer. If your recipient is a part of a company which is making millions that he wouldn't bother about the cost much. If you're providing good value to him i.e. solving one or more of his company's problems, he would buy your product. So, the value is getting priority over cost. If he belongs to a company which does not make enough money, the cost gets priority over the value. If you're providing an offer to someone from a small company, make sure that you write the cost at the end of the email because this is what your recipient wants to see. On the other hand, don't bother to write the cost if the recipient belongs to a big company.

Based on that, here's the first email.

    Hey/Hello [First Name], [1]
    
    I am Vaibhav from I Innovate magazine. It's a digital magazine that provides painkillers to the entrepreneurs' problems, and I am its co-founder. [2]
    
    I would like to offer your members three months free subscription to my magazine. It's a digital magazine and your members can download it on their phones and iPads. [3]
    
    If you and I are willing to go ahead, I would be thanking you by writing your coworking space name, [coworking space name], in the partnership section on my website. [4]

\[1\] Put the salutation based on the culture in recipient's company. ""Hey"" is very casual. Use it for someone who belongs to casual culture i.e. someone from a small company. For big companies, go for ""Hello"" instead. If you want to be super formal, go for ""Dear Mr. Last Name"".

\[2\] I introduced myself

\[3\] I very briefly wrote what I want to offer. No need to be super-duper explanatory

\[4\] I provided one more offer. But the tone is set as I am giving a thank you present

\[5\] Always put a call to action at the end and the answer of the call to action should be as small as ""yes"" or ""no"".

\[6\] My signature was to the point. It had all the things that a recipient would like to see. It had my designation, my website, and my LinkedIn profile.

I received 29 replies on this email and 19 agreed to schedule a call. Rest wanted to me give more info over email. 2 got converted. That's 6% conversion rate. Not bad but not at all satisfactory. Rest 19 people converted after follow-up emails.

## The Timing of the email

This is a very important thing that you must consider. You cannot expect someone to reply to your emails that you sent at 1 AM in the morning. 

Although, I don't have any concrete time but sending business cold emails tend to work best at around 8-11 AM. Because this is the time when business people read their emails. But this is also the time when they are loaded with all the tasks that they need to complete within that day. So, they may skip your email. 

The next best time as per my experience is around 4-5 PM. This is the time when they wrapping up and they may reply to your email right away. I also scheduled my cold email campaign for 4:15 PM.

One thing I would like to mention is that sending cold emails early in the morning (5-6 AM) also worked out for some people I know, but it never worked out for me.

## Day of the email

People say that Tuesday works best for cold emails. but all weekday will work for you. I have tested sending cold emails every day of a week and all the weekdays performed similarly. Yes, the open and reply rate were a lot lesser on weekends which was obvious.

## I got almost all of the conversion in follow-ups

I sent 3 follow up emails + 1 closure email. I'll tell you what's closure email after writing the template of three follow-ups.

The first email was sweet and to the point. But it did not give enough info about the offer. The obvious questions in the recipients head were what do I need to do to avail this, what are the hidden charges, what's the background of I Innovate magazine, what else will I receive apart from this, and what would I Innovate get from this offer.

My next few follow-ups answered every single question.

**Follow up 1**

This follow up was automated with Saleshandy. This means that it would be sent only to those recipients who did not reply to my first email. I saved a lot of time by not manually following up.

Here's the template:

    Hey/Hello [First Name],
    
    Did you get a chance to read my previous email where I wrote that I am willing to offer a free subscription of I Innovate magazine to your members?
    
    One of the best things about my magazine is that all the stories are written by proven entrepreneurs. We don't believe in writers writing the stories for the magazine because they will simply rewrite the content that they find on the internet. They cannot add their own experience. On the other hand, entrepreneurs can add their experience also in the articles. I believe that it can provide a lot of value to your members as they are entrepreneurs and they can learn a lot from those who had been at their place and successfully crossed it. [1]
    
    Add on, we have provided an action item at the end of every article. The action items are checklists, templates, excel calculators, case studies, etc. They can be downloaded without even entering email IDs. Just click on the link and download will begin.[2]
    
    The next best thing about the magazine is that it's optimized for iPad. Unlike traditional magazines, your members don't need to zoom in to read. [3]
    
    Can you and I talk on the phone for 10 mins? I can explain more over the phone.

**Last email**

No offer was made in this email. The only purpose of this email was to give respect to the recipient. If he didn't reply to your email, it did not mean that he's a bad person. It just meant that his priorities were different and did not align with my offering. So, I paid a little respect and moved on.

    Hey/Hello [First Name],
    
    I see that you are not interested. No worries.
    
    I will not send any more email related to this offer.
    
    Enjoy the rest of your day, and yes, [coworking space name] rocks. 
    
    Best Regards,
    Vaibhav

This is all.

**Edit:**

I know that many people hate cold emails and they say that it's a spam. A cold email could be a spam for person A, but could not be a spam for person B. I had 59% reply rate and none of them asked me to stop sending emails because they were spams. It all boils down to the priority. So, my emails aren't adding any value to you, this is why you'd mark them as a spam. But let's say that you're a business owner and I come to you with a tool related to your industry that can greatly reduce your business cost, and all of your competitors are already using that tool. Plus if I offer you 50% discount in that tool, would you still mark that as spam? If your answer is ""yes"", you need to figure out that generalizing every cold email as a spam is not doing good to your business.

Another point is that cold email is a must for a startup. Some people here are saying that we should not be cold emailing and should be using legitimate ways to acquire new B2B customers. I agree with that. But there's no cheaper way present to acquire customers this fastly. Unicorn startups like Uber, Flipkart did this when they were new. Many of you might have heard of [canva.com](https://canva.com). Even that site uses cold emailing to grow its customers. I received a cold email from someone in Canva. So, if you don't like cold emails then you can simply delete the mail. There's no need to get frustrated over them.

952,8cgihw,False,,68,$92k/month selling products with cartoons on them.,Entrepreneur,"Hey - Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) again.

Today's interview is with Jonas Forth, who runs [Moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com).

**TLDR:**

- His company sells products **based on a popular, existing brand.**
- His business is **content-first** - focused on blogging and SEO to drive traffic
- The business turns over €75,000 per month

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

I’m Jonas Forth, managing director at All Things Commerce Helsinki Ltd. Our aim is to help Nordic brands based in art, literature and design reach a global audience through e-commerce and relevant content.

Our main product is [moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com) - through which we sell licensed products based on the [popular brand Moomin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins) and tell fans about its rich fascinating history.

Our most popular products are perhaps our ceramic Moomin mugs, a phenomenon that started in the early 1990s. But, we also have a wide array of over 700 items, ranging from lamps to toys and t-shirts.

On average, we have a monthly turnover of 75.000€ with annual growth of 20%, shipping to more than 50 countries every month. We are now looking at taking on more brands and expanding our operations with an on-demand model.

All Things Commerce Helsinki Ltd is now owned by the parent company Moomin Characters, to which it was sold to in early 2015.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

My background is in journalism and online content production, but I have also worked extensively with different companies on developing digital products. This has always given me a good understanding of the combination of content and technology.

My previous experience certainly helped when we originally conceptualized the site and online store. But it has certainly been a learning process as the e-commerce field is quickly growing and practices change.

We came up with the idea of ATC after seeing similar brands struggle with their online presence and decided to see if we could develop it into a service, combining content with commerce.

Nowadays, we mainly work with the global brand Moomin, and after four years with the brand, we have been able to test out different sales models and processes.

In practice, we work as Moomin’s official communications channel, ranging from creating high-level content in-house and managing all marketing efforts.

We’re hoping to be able to serve other brands with a similar content structure, perhaps with a stronger focus on the commercial side.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

Starting out, we spent approximately 100.000 € on the site, shop and logistics.

Half of that went into developing the site and shop, one quarter to initial salaries and one quarter into the setup of our logistics.

For a global webstore, 100.000€ is far from enough, but it got us started. We initially went with a custom platform called [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org/) but we have since progressed to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story).

> When people talk about scaling your business, some forget that flaws in your business scale as well but in a negative way. So make sure that all aspects of the business are working before trying to scale it up.

We also used another 100.000€ to buy inventory, but very little on marketing as we rely on our own content production.

Thinking back, I probably would have chosen a more scalable platform solution early on, as switching systems later requires more work and money.

We now buy items from over 70 different manufacturers, with the one thing in common that they all use the Moomin brand.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

We didn’t do a traditional launch, we sort of put it out there and let people find it on their own.

We did, however, focus on creating a lot of interesting content such as searchable and shareable posts, and we aimed for a high percentage of automatic turnover.

It took us about six months until we started seeing relevant traffic, and we did quite a lot of competitions, sales and hustling during the first months to get that going. Moomin Characters only had a Flash based site up until 2014 without any data analytics connected to it so we started out blind in terms of what people were searching for and what kinds of posts interested people. We only knew that we would have 50% commercial and 50% non-commercial material to strike a balance, and that is something we stick to to this day.

> This is something that I recommend to all brands that I talk to, as so many are putting their emphasis on social media. Your social media accounts can be shut down at any moment leaving you with nothing after years of working on them so make sure that you control your own base.

As the months went by, we analysed our data but also looked at all other existing Moomin sites to see what they had written about. We also did some link and story sharing with the other sites to get the SEO going. It certainly helped that we put out lots and lots of unique content, specifically product information, in three languages at the same time. Google loves structured data and Wordpress with the plugin [Yoast](https://yoast.com/) helps us do it fairly automatically.

Four years later, we receive some 75% of our turnover from organic search, direct traffic and automatic messaging through follow-up emails and social media retargeting, allowing us to focus on keeping up the positive loop. For social media, we use a low cost tool called [AdEspresso](https://adespresso.com/), which allows us to set up hundreds of campaigns at once and then up the budgets or turn off campaigns based on how they are performing.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Our main focus is on creating content that focuses on the brand and that provides value to virtually anyone to whom the brand Moomin is still unknown.

All our content is SEO optimized, from alt texts, to image naming and search term specification. That has allowed us to rely on traffic from organic search and we believe that it will grow significantly once the brand becomes better known.

If you would like to learn more about SEO, I would start with [Moz](https://moz.com/) and [the top posts from the SEO subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/top/), install Google Analytics on your site and just start measuring the results.

It’s very much a long play game and it takes months for you to see results, even with consistent work. Here’s some marketing tips from my experience:

* We’re very much landing page driven and we use our official site ([moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com)) and shop ([shop.moomin.com](https://shop.moomin.com/)) as our spine in all other operations. There are two reasons for this - we can only really convert to sales on our site and we want to build and own our media. This is something that I recommend to all brands that I talk to, as so many are putting their emphasis on social media. Your social media accounts can be shut down at any moment leaving you with nothing after years of working on them so make sure that you control your own base.

* Treat paid advertising as something that’s one-off, so once you pay for the views, clicks or conversions, **it’s over**. This means that you should try to get everything you can out of the paid traffic like Facebook or Google retargeting, email signups or people sharing you content.

* Map out what your traffic sources are and what your funnel looks like - where does your traffic come, where should it go and what should happen once it gets there? When it comes to e-commerce, three things matter - the amount of traffic you can generate, the percentage of that you convert, and the value of the conversion.

We’re heavy on building our own media - both on the site but also through emails list and partners who are willing to trade traffic. We post on social media but since it converts poorly for us, we rarely put emphasis on it. We have automatic ads though running 24/7.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

Things are going well, we’re into our fifth year of growth now and we’re looking at opening up a completely new business doing only on-demand items for other brands similar to Moomin.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

When people talk about scaling your business, some forget that flaws in your business scale as well but in a negative way. So make sure that all aspects of the business are working before trying to scale it up. We messed up when we tried to open up a similar business in another country without the proper foundation in place for it.

Focus on building a team that’s self driving and automate as much redundant tasks as you can. That gives you more time to focus on the important things.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

- Platform: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story)
- Email Communication: [Conversio](https://conversio.com/)
- Newsletters: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)
- Publishing: [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- Social Media Marketing - [AdEspresso](https://adespresso.com/)

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

Business Model Generation by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur is great for planning out your business.

I often listen to [Shopify’s podcasts](https://www.shopify.com/podcasts) as well.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Focus is most often the thing that companies fail to do and it’s even harder while growing the company.

Get a mentor if you can - once crud starts hitting the fan, it’s good to have someone bring you back on track.
