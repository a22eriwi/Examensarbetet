338,6uchsv,False,,0,I have started a child/family friendly lets play channel and would love feedback/support,kidsrights,"Hello everyone. I have started a [gaming YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwn6-MD4tWZQ0loPpYUQBUw/videos) for children and young people where the content can be reliably content appropriate.

I have worked with children and young people for over 8 years, and I have been a gamer for even longer.

With a lot of gaming content aimed at children and young people I believe that some of the games are not suited for them, e.g. grand theft auto and even five nights at Freddy’s can have a negative impact on younger children who are watching let’s play. In addition some of the language used by a lot of youtubers can be seen as offensive and most would not want their children repeating what is said.

There is also a flood of content aimed at children with a [malicious intent](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-39381889) (such as the videos with the most popular random tags to generate views or videos made to look friendly only to have shock value)  with many still getting though the YouTube kids app.

So, that’s why I have started this channel. The games I play will range between E for everyone and T for teens (e.g. overwatch). I will also be keeping the language clean.

This is the first time I have ever done video/sound editing as well as video game commentary. So it will be a learning process. I fear that it will start off abit cringey and low quality, but the more I do it the better I will get. 
As of this post I have only a few videos on the channel but I aim to have at least 3 videos added each week.

And as a final note, I just want to point out that I am not against violent or scary games and play them in my spare time myself. But having seen first-hand children’s reactions to content that they were not ready for (I have met parents whose children as young as 3 have had nightmares about five nights at Freddy’s and not being aware that the game was even from the horror genre or that their children were watching it).

So, I am the Good Natured Gamer. And I hope you and your family enjoy my videos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kidsrights/comments/6uchsv/i_have_started_a_childfamily_friendly_lets_play/,2,,2017-08-17 19:45:13

117,4u0o35,False,,1,[Rant] We need to change they way we parent children,kidsrights,"Parents should not be able to own their children. 

It might sound like hyperbole to say that the nuclear family is a system of ownership. However, when I compare what I know about parenthood to what I know about slavery, I see a resemblance between the two. I think that parenthood is slavery. I'm not saying this out of resentment for my own parents: I think that the parent-child relationship is systemically oppressive towards children. Consider the concept of ""setting rules"" for your children. ""Do not eat that"", sure, when your child is a baby, is a reasonable rule for you to enforce. But children quickly develop traits that naturally defy authority, such as: logical thinking grounded in empirical observation, the ability to perform risk assessment, a coordinate body possessing rudimentary athletic skills, and an individual willfulness operating within an emotional context. 

It is  natural and necessary that children defy their parents, and that they are immune to most or all of adult law and politics. To deliberately force your child into a prefabricated adult worldview is the very definition of grooming. Whether the parent's rule-making is sexual or simply authoritarian, they are social conditioning their children. You might believe that conditioning your child in certain ways is absolutely necessary in particular instances. For example, isn't it essential that you raise a child to protect themselves from danger? We do not live in an intuitive world, nor a safe one for young people. This is obvious to everyone. ""Won't someone please think of the children"" has fallen so far into the realm of cliche that it is never said in earnest. Everyone knows that the world is unsafe for children, and that is how parents rationalize owning their children. Parents believe, perhaps correctly, that they are owning their children for their children's own good. That raises two possibilities. 

In the first place, a parent could be mistaken. Believing their actions to be just, these parents take risk on their children's behalf. And it is principally the children, and not the parents, who suffer from the decisions that parents make. But suppose that a parent is acting in their child's best interest. Even if it's true that a parent is doing good for their child, it is still uncertain whether they are doing *the best* for their child. The concept of what should be best for a child is staggering in its complexity, and I am worried when people do not seem to ever doubt their own instincts when it comes to parenting. Parents have lived through weeks, months and years of direct, hands-on parenting, whereas I have none of that. But I am not trying to say that ""this type of parent is good"" or ""this type of parent is bad"". Parenting looks incredibly difficult from my point of view. (Although a lot of the work can be subsidized if you have the money.) The poor make hard decisions yet still cannot take away their children's hardship. The child of a subaltern grows into an adult who has suffered. But I think that all children suffer under our model of parenting, and all grow into adults who have suffered. But children suffer in a myriad of ways, and consequently grow into adults that relate only people who have suffered similarly to themselves.

What our society does is not only raise children to suffer, but also alienates them. From birth, every child is born into unique personal circumstances. These are the people who raised me, That is the home I live in, These are the things that interest me, that I am afraid of, that I want to do, These are the rules I must follow. But our child-owning culture has developed its own taxonomy of children, as if they were so many breeds of dogs. The black and white children. The girls and the boys. The poor and the rich. Children are alienated from their community of fellows. For every child who suffers in a given society, every adult is a participant in that suffering. Society owes children certain freedoms, protections, and opportunities. A just society would not normalize child ownership and *laissez-faire* parenting. Much as corporate freedoms do to the working class, so does parental freedom do to children.

My argument is not that no argument for child ownership is just. My argument is that the nuclear family is a monopoly that ought not exist, at least not as the only option a child has. I am in favor of children being allowed to decide (freely and without duty or punitive enforcement) to leave their nuclear family and spend time within a community network where no single individual has parental control, but rather the democratic community at large speaks in the voice of a parent. And, just as freely as a child may walk away from their parents, so too may they walk away from their community at any time, without consequence.  But even with the addition of community-model parenting as an alternative to nuclear-model parenting, the child is still not sufficiently free from the danger of ownership. A third option must be supported: voluntary exile from the community, and into an autonomous region which is available to children who wish to live independently, and where children are self-governing. These three institutions must come together to liberate children from tyranny, and they must be fully permeable so that a child's choice is never irrevocable. Parental-social contracts must be unenforceable except to the extent which they benefit the child.

Therefore: every child deserves free travel among these three institutions: 1) nuclear-model parenting, represented by their biological, adoptive, and alternative parents, 2) community-model parenting, represented by their extended family, neighbors, and community residents, and 3) self-model parenting, represented by the capabilities that the growing child possesses, which allows them to operate autonomously. And each of these institutions must prioritize the child over the needs of the parents or community, at least to the extent that the child is incapable of taking care of themselves. Even a child whose decision-making capabilities are wanting deserves to attempt to live autonomously, most of all because they deserve to learn for themselves what they are capable of, rather than merely taking the word of a well-meaning authority who would deny them the freedom to try. Children learn by doing, and any society that infringes on its children's capacity to learn is grooming them to perform a social function.

It is a goal among liberals and socialists alike, but especially among the postmodernists, that power must be diffused among many hands, because tyrants blossom when power is contained by the few. Power is itself the problem. A just society is one which recognizes principles of inalienable human rights. Martha Nussbaum recognizes ten central capabilities: life; bodily health; bodily integrity; senses, imagination and thought; emotions; practical reason; affiliation; other species; play; and control over one's environment [(Nussbaum 2006: 76–78)](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/capability-approach/#SelAggCap). To treat children as fully-human, they must be assured each of these.",https://www.reddit.com/r/kidsrights/comments/4u0o35/rant_we_need_to_change_they_way_we_parent_children/,5,"Thank you.

409,21hrlz,False,,0,Research involving children and their rights,kidsrights,"Hi,

I study international development and work for an organisation that cares for children (without parental care) part-time. I have been given the opportunity to write my thesis at work, as long as I share my findings with my employer. In fact they are actively encouraging me to do it because they have so little research on my topic. I find that pretty cool, because I know the channels I need to go through to do one thing I've been wanting to do for a long time: interview the kids in our care, and find out what they think about their rigths situation (particularly with regards to privacy and fundraising). I think this is something my org needs to improve on dramatically so I am very motivated.

My initial instinct is to interview a few of them, rather than write out some forms for them to fill out. I could adapt to their stories and opinions more easily, maybe find out more than I would from a piece of paper filled out by an eight year old.  I think the vast majority of the younger ones are not aware that they have rights, and the older ones only have a vague concept that I want to encourage and reveal.

Does anyone here have experience with ethical research involving children? How do I best go about receiving a child's consent / willing participation in something like this? Do you have any advice on working with children from difficult backgrounds? Also, this would likely be happening in West Africa - I am a white male, but at least I speak French. What kind of problems do you see me encountering?
