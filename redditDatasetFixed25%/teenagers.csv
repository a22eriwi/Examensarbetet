She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. 

Fast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said ""OK boomer"" and hung up.

I've never been so proud.

A lot of sex between people ocurr here and cheating and affairs and many gossiping. My prom is full of toxic snakes and I hate them profoundly:). Drugs haven’t being a thing but I know weed is around constantly and getting booze into school also. Additionally they make road trips (the prom) to a summer house of someone and that becomes like a sex and drugs weekend. And yes it’s real, no I don’t participate because I dislike it. I used to be a popular girl but the bad kind, until I realized I was an asshole. Now, I’m very glad I didn’t become them. :) ps: I wrote letters to my crush, 28 to be exactly and well we date.

While my school waa still open, some grade 9-10s cornered me and my friend, and gut punched us, kicked us, spit on us, slapped us, then ran. I was pretty hurt, but my friend was stronger than me, and sucked it up pretty quickly. All the school did was ask if I knew who did it, and then just made an announcement, saying racism is bad, and that's that. 

I've also had death threats made at me, water thrown on me, and been spat on. A LOT. Luckily, I always washed it of thoroughly with hot water and soap.

This god-awful racism isn't the answer to the virus cure. Beating up Asians won't do anything! Please, spread the word, MOST Asians only want peace, not violence, excluding the Chinese and North Korean government.

895,g8ku2x,False,Other,1548,I fucked up by using acne medicine instead of lotion while masturbating,teenagers,"Fuck me.

This fuck up occurred one month ago, and I will remember it for the rest of my life.

On one particular night, I was feeling VERY horny. My PP was definitely not coming down any time soon, so I decided I should jack off and call it a night. I draw my pink headed warrior, my spear of impregnation, my magic wand. I’ve always been particularly fond of my genitalia.

My friend had told me once that using lotion can make masturbating feel 10x better, so I said ”*hey, why not*?” and go to my bathroom. I scan the room for lotion, and my eyes fall upon a white bottle with a pump on the top. There it is! I pick it up and bring it back to my room.

I laid down in bed and pumped a small amount of the substance into my dominant hand and spread it around on my weewee, much like spreading cream cheese on a nice piece of toast. **Damn, that felt so good**. My hand could stroke so much faster. I pumped myself a handful of the sweet lotion and applied it to the pp.

I stroked harder and harder and harder. I kept thinking about my GF’s pair while doing so. These to aspects in combination led to the sweetest orgasm I’d had in a while.

There was no need to wash the lotion-like substance off, because it had been completely rubbed into my PP. God, what a mistake. Feeling satisfied, I lay down on my pillow thinking about seeing my beautiful girl again, and go to sleep.

I woke the next day at exactly 9:24 AM.

I remember my eyes shooting open.

**My dick was on fire**.

I shit you not, it felt as though a small supernova had been unleashed upon my meat scepter. I screamed and fell out of my bed. I pull my pants and and underwear out of the way to see what was stimulating such agony in my penis.

I will not describe what I saw.

All I will say is that it was something you’d see in a horror movie. Plain and simple. Pure hell released upon my once glorious dong.

I muster whatever remaining strength there was in my legs, and sprinted to the bathroom.

I turn on the faucet and set it to the coolest setting. When I put my dick under the cool jets of water, I let out a whimper. God, I wanted to take a greatsword and just cut it off. I bite my lip while tears roll down my cheek.

I look at the lotion bottle I had used last night. I check the label to see if it had Shea butter, something I’m allergic to. One word caught my eye: acne. I gasp in horror. I turn the bottle, to be met with the words **acne medication**.

A medication which is designed to dry up skin and to be used in small amounts.

**And I had rubbed an entire handful of it into my penis.**

I let out a scream, this one louder than the first. My dick was in absolutely agonizing pain. But then, in my self induced shock, I have a faint memory. I had recently been struggling with dry skin on my face, and had been handling it by using a special cream.

”*It just might work*” I mutter to myself. I grab the cream and begin rubbing it over my now numb penis. Instant pain, but also a feeling of relief. Tears of pain and frustration are falling, but I don’t stop. I continue this process for the next hour locked in the bathroom. Every hour or so, I rubbed a bit more into my penis. My mom would occasionally ask *”is everything ok honey?”* to which I would halfheartedly tell her that I love her.

Over the next two days, my dick had completely healed. It was a painful recovery, but I had done it.

**TL;DR**: I was feeling horny, so I decided to use what looked like lotion to help masturbate. Little did I know, it was actually acne medicine. This proceeded to fuck up my penis.

Fuck me, hopefully you got a laugh out of my stupidity.

627,exk4v7,False,Advice,1414,"Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)",teenagers,"1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

And with that, r/teenagers, I bid you farewell. I hope you all have an excellent 6 years of confusion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/exk4v7/well_rteenagers_its_been_a_fun_ride_after_today_i/,41228,Well number was is wrong so I can assume the rest are too.

One day, he asked me for a pencil, a basic wooden #2 pencil, and I gave it to him. He had never ever been that happy for a wooden pencil, . Moving forward to 7th grade, I was moving out of America and the kid was in the same class as me still. He was absent because of a really major seizure. On my final day of school, his mom came in and called my name. The kid literally gifted me a 20 dollar silver mechanical pencil just because I lended him a wooden pencil. Until this day, I have the box of the pencil on the desk of my room, and I wish to meet that kid again.

1. Q, What is Angelmans syndrome?

&#x200B;

A, Angelman syndrome aka happy puppet syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes developmental and neurological disabilities. They usually have epilepsy, and get attracted to water easily. But I hope that who ever suffers from this can rebound and shine like an angel.

2. Q, What do you think about Israel?
