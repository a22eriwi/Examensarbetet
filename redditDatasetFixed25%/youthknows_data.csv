41,e6onc,False,,0,Lean to touch-type,youthshouldknow,"As in be able to type on a regular keyboard without looking at the keys.  Way back in the day I took a high school class for just this, and it has paid for itself countless times over.  I've heard that the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing software is good.

My son taught himself both Qwerty and Dvorak keyboard, and is, um, multi-fingeral?  Anyway, he says he does better with Dvorak.  He carries around a thumb drive that lets him switch whatever computer he's using at the moment to Dvorak.  Drives me nuts when I try to use his computer.  That's probably half of why he does it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youthshouldknow/comments/e6onc/lean_to_touchtype/,1,,2010-11-16 00:53:47

19,guunxi,False,,0,I Moved To a Foreign Country and Was Stalked By My Creepy Landlord,youthshouldknow,"I moved to Israel last year and was stalked by my landlord. Worst of all he was that he had a key to my apartment and would randomly let himself in while I was home and not home. I once even caught him watching me while I was sleeping. My roommate thought it was just a big joke. I was interviewed about my experience on [Them, That and This](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-22-somewhat-stalked/id1492352561?i=1000475991267)",https://www.reddit.com/r/youthshouldknow/comments/guunxi/i_moved_to_a_foreign_country_and_was_stalked_by/,1,,2020-06-01 22:32:09
