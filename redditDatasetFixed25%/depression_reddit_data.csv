I'm incapable of vulnerability and sharing myself even with my therapist. How can I get over this,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fnw5b9/im_completely_incapable_of_trusting_anyone_and/,35,"Little bit at a time. This post is an example of one step, which is great! The next time you feel ready, take another one. Start by sharing with safe people, like a licensed therapist. Maybe one of the things you can work on is figuring out how to open up more. Therapy is a great place to practice conflict situations that can come up from not being willing to trust, so you can tell your therapist something like ""I don't trust you"" and they will work through it with you without forcing you to open up (if they're good at their job). 

I have a really hard time trusting people too, and it really takes time to get over. Some other things that helped were staying in-the-moment, and reacting to things as they happened instead of worrying about what bad things MIGHT happen later on. 

Also, sometimes it's helpful to talk to a pet, doesn't have to be an emotional support animal but it helps. You can practice saying things out loud that make you feel vulnerable before trying it with a person that you think is worthy of that trust. ",2020-03-24 01:17:27

879,bco6fa,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,26,Just need to talk to anyone,depression_help,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me.

658,ejy5n9,False,,6,I'm so afraid that I've messed everything up already,depression_help,"... And that I can no longer make something of myself anymore. For a little background, I'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. From a very young age I was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as I grew older I just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, I met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. A failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later I went back to uni now in an English course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. I lost the courage and the patience. I've been out of school for a whole year now and I've been faking it to the people I know by editing my grades on the internet. Now I've fallen out of touch with my parents because I've disappointed them too much and I'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. I also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her Doctorate. She's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. I feel like everyone's expecting something from me that I can't deliver. I've done fucked up so much that I don't even know where to begin fixing things. Honestly, I don't even know what has kept me going. Back in late 2018 I attempted suicide. Before 2019 ended I promised that I won't reach the New Year. But oddly enough I'm still here but I'm afraid I might finally burnout. I haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that I tried to do it with. I just wish my future didn't revolve around a piece of paper so much or at the very least I wish I was able to do things right the very first time around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ejy5n9/im_so_afraid_that_ive_messed_everything_up_already/,61,"Hey, 

  I’m sorry you’re in so much pain, let alone a host of extreme negative emotions. You are totally allowed to feel that way - it is what you do with those thoughts and feelings. And you are NOT a failure for your actions. Even though I haven’t taken any higher education classes, I have the same views of a degree as you do. You are NOT a failure. You HAVE NOT messed everything up. 

  I think it’s amazing you have gotten this far. When you are actually living life, DOING something with yourself - mistakes are going to happen. I’m not saying suffering is a sure sign of progress - but sometimes just surviving is all that you can do. Even if you’re treading in complete darkness. But you made it another day. Another personal victory for you. No one can take that away from you. 

  I’m the youngest out of five kids. Even though it may not even be close to the level of pressure and expectation life has placed on you, I understand, the feeling is completely mutual. Comparing myself to my siblings makes me want to crawl in a hole for the rest of my life. So in that regard, I can only imagine the pressure you face. I feel for you I really do. 

  It’s seems nearly impossible to think otherwise that life will get better. Especially when things like this has been happening for a long time. Just the fact that you are here, on earth, set up a Reddit account and shared that with us takes some serious guts. ",2020-01-04 15:47:04
344,amm2m7,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,36,High functioning depression,depression_help,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post.

I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.

I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 5-6 days a week, I'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.

I've had people who tell me my depression ""isn't real"" because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. 

I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no ""one size fits all"" depression.

I just need support that my struggles are valid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/amm2m7/high_functioning_depression/,97,"It sounds like you might have an addictive personality.

I spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. I have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so I get where she is coming from.
But does that mean that this feeling that I just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? She asked if I ever wanted to hurt myself and I said no because I've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). She said that it probably isn't a depression because of that.

615,eo8ob8,False,RANT,7,Life just feels over and I'm only in my mid 20's.,depression_help,"I just don't know how to get the will to keep going. I've been through hell, and I have no blood family left. 

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational. 

If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. 

Here's to feeling better. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eo8ob8/life_just_feels_over_and_im_only_in_my_mid_20s/,65,"Maybe you can think of things in a different way: obviously everything that happened is a tragedy, but those things are in the past. The silver lining is you went through a series of experiences that few other people go through until they are in old age. 

This will make you more mature. It will make you more empathetic. It may even make you more passionate, if you start using the bad experiences to motivate yourself.

Dwelling and ranting really doesn’t help. Thinking negatively doesn’t help. You have to try to switch your thinking or you will of course feel negative after constantly thinking negative thoughts and doing little to try to end the negative thoughts themselves. Not saying that’s easy, or sufficient to cure everything; but if you don’t even try to be positive and keep ranting and dwelling on everything that is bad - you have no chance of being happy. The first step is changing your outlook and way of thinking. If you feel overwhelmed by your thoughts and feel like you can’t change your way of thinking, try meditation lessons.

A phrase I always found helpful is “just stay on the bull.” Life can seem hectic and overwhelming at times / often, like you’re riding a bull. You can feel overwhelmed by reality and too stressed to think straight. But the key, as cliche as it sounds, is to hang in there. Keep fighting the day to day struggle and doing your best. You don’t need to fix everything now, you just need to stay in the game enough so your future self has a chance to succeed. 

Compliment yourself for the effort you’re making and the progress you’re making. Try to do healthy things like exercise and sleep to help manage your stress. Keep building and eventually things will likely get better. There’s no guarantees, bad luck happens, but you sound like you’ve already received your fair share of bad luck and you should be optimistic that life can really only go up from where you are now. You’ve been through a very disproportionate amount of tragedies for someone your age - it’s logical to think that the years to come will be better than the past.

Take it slow. Breathe. Do things at your pace. The debt probably isn’t as much as you’re imagining, and a few days of setbacks isn’t going to ruin your life. Get around to selling those cars, but if you don’t feel up to it, take a break. Just try to make small steps when you can. Over time it will get easier and easier. The hardest part is always the first few steps of a journey.

PS You can usually still refinance a loan that is in a trust. ",2020-01-13 19:10:50

Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert.

Healthy snacks high in protein and low in sugar may do you some good. Granola bars, dried/fresh fruits and veggies, nuts, etc would be easy healthy snacks. If you have time on the weekend, you could prepare healthy meals in bulk, then divide them into separate portions and freeze them for later eating. Cheaper than most fast food and frozen meals, with the right ingredients.

 If you're not feeling up to tons of laundry, you could drop your dirty clothes in the wash daily until it fills, wash and dry them, then set them aside until you do have the energy. 

Some daily b vitamins may help with your energy levels, although I'd consult with your doctor first to make sure there wouldn't be any interactions with your current meds. You could try experimenting with different ways to help you to sleep. [These](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-fall-asleep) tips might be beneficial.

 I used to limit my sugar and caffeine to daytime hours only, plus hot nightly baths to help me through rough depression patches. Hopefully you can find some things to get you closer to your desired amount of sleep and energy. ",2019-04-16 10:50:28
340,dy5tvu,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,28,Too depressed to even do basic things,depression_help,"Lately I’m too depressed to even have the energy to do basic things like shave, shower and get out of bed.

I’m already on antidepressants.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dy5tvu/too_depressed_to_even_do_basic_things/,100,"I also suffer from this. What I have to tell you is this. MAKE YOURSELF DO IT. I know, it's easier said than done. I'd rather stay in bed and pity myself. Or sleep. But no, I decide to fight with myself and make every effort to do those stuff. First, I make myself shower, then make the bed, and then I make myself clean the house. I don't like cleaning that much, but it makes tremendous changes to my mood. As a next step, I want to learn to wash my car more often. I am sure that clean windows and interiors will improve my mood and give me a sense of control, like cleaning the house is helping me.

  
For the most part of my life, I lived in a country that has bad records of air pollution. There, not cleaning a house for one week meant that the house will soon look like a zombie's nest. I never suffered from depression there. Maybe because I didn't have time to. Whatever I do, the house needed to be cleaned. Otherwise, it had been hazardous for health. The amount of dust everywhere would cause a problem with breathing and lungs. So I cleaned the house because I wanted to live. I didn't want to die from air pollution.   

  
I am amazed at how cleaning affects my mood right now. But don't expect to get out of depression quickly. Time took you in the condition you are in today. So time will get you out. It's about small wins consistently, every day. It's about making you each day count. Whatever you do, don't suffer alone, silently. ",2019-11-18 16:56:33

988,fkzm1y,False,RANT,3,Just a vent from someone who's having a self-loathing and hopeless vision of reality,depression_help,"Well... We live in somewhat complicated times, which is obvious. However, this is something that I can’t allow myself to care about. An apathy definitely became an inherent trait of my ego a while ago...

It has been about a year since I published an introspective analysis of my current life situation somewhere on the internet, besides what were the expectations before I decided to see a psychologist, trying to decipher what is tormenting me. Well... I can say that that first attempt was a failure.

I was only able to seek professional help for a brief period before I was fired from my previous job last year, interrupting the process. On the positive side, I was able to organize my professional life a little after that happened. But on the negative side... I could see that my demons being stronger than before.

Today, I'm approaching 30 years old, and given the circumstances, I’m not the happiest and hopeful person I used to be...

I have no one to blame. No one but myself... Countless wrong decisions have taken me to where I am today. Decisions that admit they can be corrected and put back by myself, thus making a fresh start. But... These decisions were much more severe with my inner spirit than with the others.

Apathy, hopelessness, and hatred... These are things that make me who I am today. The rancor of having to let myself go into this spiral of despair and my self-loathing prevents me from looking for something better... I don't feel worthy to be happy, let alone stop feeling pain. And you know the worst of it? All the eventual calls for me to seek support from other people sounds false to me...

Yes. It is a claim that it will really sound rude, but I have to say:

""I don't trust any of you. I’m not able to trust""

I’m sorry for that, as I’m unable to see any act of affection, empathy, and appreciation. I know that a lot of this isn’t true, but that’s something I’m unable to see...

Things like faith and hope lost the meaning to me, for having become something vague and inconclusive to hold on. Any acts of goodwill strike me as hypocritical and empty, just with the intention of shutting up someone who is about to recover. This world seems so fucked up that it basically causes me zero strength to care for a single drop with it.

Obviously, I am still a long way from acting belligerently, suicidal and sociopathic at this age of crisis, but I’m tired to wait any longer. The sad part of all this is that I have a wife and a son who I’m can’t have the strength to fight for them and keep myself sane... This is truly a Herculean task.

I really think I should shut up about this. Spare people from this senseless anguish... But I'm still human. I don't know if I'm going to stay whole if I can't shout in some way or another.

As for my future? Only time will tell...",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fkzm1y/just_a_vent_from_someone_whos_having_a/,33,"Something similar happened to me (actually, when I was 30), though it was brought on by very bad medical advice. I was newly pregnant, and since you have a child, you know that the OB won’t see you until you’re 8 weeks in. But my antidepressant that I’d taken for years had a big warning against taking while pregnancy, and I was terrified of something happening to the baby, and I called my psychiatrist, and he told me to stop taking it immediately. Not to cut it down, just stop. Within a week, I was in a bizarre state of what I later learned was anhedonia. Nothing made me feel anything. I was scared it would never go away - that was my only feeling. 

I did find a new psychiatrist, and since it’s not an easy specialist to get an appointment with, I stayed with him. He wasn’t the best, but he was sane. As I started taking my meds again, I also started a volunteer job which I loved. Things got better so slowly, I didn’t realize they were improving at all.

Three is my lucky number when drinking (that’s how many glasses it takes to make me go from totally social awkward to social butterfly). After that, I even go to the toilet with a girl I know.

As I am waiting for her, a glass in each hand, a girl I saw some times in school walks up to me. “Hey girl, I haven’t seen you for so long! How are you? Haven’t you been to school lately? Must have been some months since I last saw you. Is it true you’re dating Dave?” I don’t know her name, but thanks to the drink in my hand, it doesn’t matter. “Yes, we have been dating for some months now. You look mesmerizing tonight!”

I go out to meet my boyfriend again. Some time later the same girl, which now has a name, Anna, sits next to us and starts a conversation. I slowly open up, of course because of the alcohol, but she really seems to want to be friends. So, we hang out all night.

First things first. You've gotta distance yourself from this depression. It is NOT part of your character or part of your personality. Just like a zit isn't part of your character or personality. It's just something you are going through. It is something you are rightfully concerned about and talking about. So far so good.

Depression in of its own is not a disorder. It is the symptom of something usually deeper. You need to shop around for a therapist until you find one that you feel you can connect to. Might have to try out 3 or 5 different ones until you find that good one.

If you can't do things for the love of yourself, the second best thing to do is to do things for the love of others. For your fam.. for your SO.. but that will only exhaust you and carry you through for a certain distance, the next part is accepting and loving yourself.

I'm getting therapy and have the support of family and friends and it's not getting better.,depression_help,"From Mid December to March I witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. I've been working with my own therapist lately and I've come to the realization that during her depression, I went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame I was feeling.   


I feel totally inadequate as a person. I wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, I wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, I wasn't strong enough to save her. At the lowest point in her depression, She started cutting, drinking and smoking. She also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as ""toxic"" when things were good.  


I tried my best to support her with what I knew at the time. I always told her she wasn't alone and that I was there for her, I encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. When she asked for space, I tried my best. I never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), I avoided her triggers (the one's I knew about). I do have regrets though, I know I could have been a better listener. I tried to fix things for her even though I know now that I couldn't.

&#x200B;

In February she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and I did that for her. It was the hardest time in my life. I was so scared for a number of reasons and I constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from ""she's having fun without me and doesn't want me"" to ""she's going to commit suicide"". We met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and I was in a bad place. I felt totally rejected and I was very vulnerable in front of her. I cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. I know she wasn't in a place to support me, but I was a mess.  


After a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. She broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. I also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that I would be better without her in my life.   


After 6 weeks I've gotten to a point where I understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. I'm grappling with serious shame because I continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways I've acted since breaking up. In the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and I was able to comfort her until she calmed down. After calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. I talked with her after this and told her I'm always here to listen and support her, but I couldn't hear her say ""I love you"" or go back to being in a relationship. She apologized and since then we've barely talked.

Through friends, I've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. She's on the road to recovery without me, and I feel like I'm still in a downward spiral. She won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all I can talk about. It feels like every interaction I have with people,  I twist into a narrative that I'm a bad person. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, I can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. I'm feeling jealousy whenever I think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then I feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery.

908,dpb02k,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,15,I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,depression_help,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dpb02k/i_think_my_boyfriend_left_me_due_to_his/,35,"Not the same situation but I met someone who has depression.

This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that.

I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is    that, ""You should love yourself.""

I can't properly describe it, but I could not stop crying. And this happens almost all the time. No matter what I do or how I distract myself, the pain always comes back. It's why whenever I get done with a walk or finish doing something fun, I start crying again. I think it's getting worse. Nothing I used to feel better was enough anymore. I wanted to take a knife and carve the ache out of my chest, but it doesn't work that way.

So I thought about cutting myself. I always wondered what it would be like, but never seriously considered it until last night. I even went as far as getting a knife. I got scratched by my cat before so I figured if it was anything like that it wouldn't be a big deal. And cutting supposedly took away from the emotional pain, so it would be worth it. I ultimately didn't do it. Mostly because summer is coming, and I'd have to wear short sleeves. Also because I chickened out. I would like to say I'm proud for not doing it, but I'm mostly just upset and angry. I'm tired of this. As hard as it is living with depression, I never understood why anyone would want to cut.

And it eats up all the goodness we could have for ourselves. It’s usually passed to us, but our culture plays a part too. I say this because I’m more aware now through reading and my therapist. And EMDR which I would suggest to any one with toxic shame. 
Shame can be healthy, but when it rules us it can destroy a lot of good. I’m very introverted, but I know it’s due to my PTSD, and would force myself to interact with others. 

Listen you are a human being, not a human doing. Do you think the Buddhist monks tell each other how lazy they are because all they did was meditate all day and clean the temples. I think it’s a beautiful start when we can be happy with the boring cycle we are in and then expand. 

If you don’t take meds or see a therapist I would suggest it or just having the conversation with a doctor. I hate taking my meds. I have to take a big fat antipsychotic every night along with a mood stabilizer and antidepressant. But I don’t want to die.... some days suck.... but I’m not thinking of ways to kill myself... and idk if it’s the combo of educating myself (books and YouTube) and therapy and meds, but I can now say to my past self that it will get better, but it does suck to get there, but it’s better than where we were.

Don’t beat yourself up about going on the internet. There are great youtubers (don’t buy into the life coach bs) that are awesome psychologists and therapists that can give some good advice out there. And podcasts like mental illness happy hour. After listening I feel like I would gain a perspective I hadn’t before and it felt like I did something (because I did right lol)(even if my mind wandered shhh)

A great book by John Bradshaw called healing the shame that binds you is great. I think he even has some YouTube videos from back in the day. Another great one is by the university of Staniford  on how depression is biological plus the guy who lectures it is capturing enough to not make it boring. I couldn’t even read when I started and got into audible which made it easier.

You are not what you spend your time on or how you live your life. You are a human being that needs some love and compassion especially towards yourself. You deserve good things, and you deserve peace. I hope I could provide something. Good luck friend ",2020-06-08 00:37:32

In regards to the whole kms thing I also think about it alot bit don't really think I would ever go through with it...plus I have exams in a week, important ones, and I can't even think about revising it's just such a far fetched idea to me at this point, so I know how you feel... 
It's like a beyond emptiness where you only do things reactively and never proactively. It's by far and beyond the hardest thing I've had to deal with and it is so mentally draining but if I can offer some advice (given from a therapist):
It sounds lame but seriously it's worked for me quite alot: change your thinking, liturally tell yourself how and what you want to be/be doing. Do this over an extended period and trust me, at first it will feel rediculous but over time you will start to genuinely believe in what you're telling yourself and then, slowly but definitely surely, you start to feel like you're climbing a bit out of the hole.

I am super insecure in my friendships and relationships, not about the other person, but about me.

I have autism, its incredibly hard for me to read specific emotions, and also ""read the room"" as it were, which has lead to some serious issues with human interaction in the past. I overshare, overanalyze and overthink EVERYTHING. And it leads to me constantly feeling like I'm not worthy of any relationship, not worthy to feel emotions that I do feel, and CONSTANTLY question if what I'm feeling is fair, or even my own damn fault.

I'm deeply in love with my partner, he's everything to me, but I can't identify anything he does that annoys, or frustrates me. He has told me in the past things I do that frustrate and annoy him. He has said certain things that made these feelings of inadequacy worse. He didnt mean to hurt me, he deserves to be honest about these things, and I have been doing my best to work on them and better myself. 


But ALL OF THIS, together, has made me a depressed, anxious and nervous wreck. I want to be healthy for him. I want to work on myself and be my best. But I also want that for me. I want to be independant and secure in knowing that even though I do have things to work on, I'm still...worth it. Worth his trouble, worth his patience, worth his love.

I have no will or reason to live. I hate my job. I feel like I just live to work. Getting the company owner to pay his employees what he owes is a constant battle. He tries anything he can to fuck his employees out of their money. Even going so far as to threaten to take us to court for trying to challenge him, knowing that we can't afford it. I'm a sprinkler fitter apprentice and the entire company is basically run by apprentices. We have 3 journeymen out of about 20 people. One of those is a service guy, another is the superintendent. Only one journeymen actually works on jobs. It's illegal to have jobs run by apprentices, without a journeyman on site. Like two months ago the boss went off in a safety meeting about another employee being on a job by himself. Now, I'm on a job by myself with even less experience. He constantly bods jobs that we can't man so, we basically have one person per job at this point. 

I feel completely trapped. This is the only job experience I have. I've always found it extremely hard to get jobs because I have a really hard time with interviews. And it's hard to explain to people that I spent the first years of my adult life homeless and didn't get my first real job until I was 27. 

I rent a place with my dad. He got a DUI a while back and it's taking a lot of his money. I hate the place we live. I'm pretty much just confined to my room whenever I'm home. I can't get my own place because he won't be able to afford the place of I move out. Again, I feel completely trapped.

So, I went home early today. I have a rope that somebody gave me a while back that I tied into a noose. I stood at my back door for a good half hour, looking at the tree I want to hang myself from. But, I couldn't do it. Why? Because I'm too fucking scared of a couple minutes of pain leading up to my death. Or that somebody is going to see and try to talk me out of it. Or that I'll fuck it up and just end up permently disabling myself, but not dieing. Or what my dad's reaction would be when he comes home to see me hanging g over his fire pit. Even though when I first told him I wanted to kill myself, he said do it. So, I ended up laying down and fell asleep. Woke up to pouring ran and yet another reason to despise myself. I have no desire to live yet, I'm too much of a scared little bitch to go through with killing myself.

I have no real friends. I rarely get out. I'm a PC gamer. It's pretty much the only thing that distracts me from the fact that I despise being alive. So, everyone I talk to is online. Idk why I'm even posting this. I'm just gonna get the same generic bullshit replies that always come up when somebody mentions wanting to die but, here I am. I've never come this close to actually killing myself and all I can think is what a bitch I am for not being able to follow through with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bxz01s/left_work_early_today_with_every_intention_of/,46,"There are loads of people in the world suffering from the same problems as you.

What's the point of all that. I'm not happy at all, despite everyone saying that working on myself will make me feel some sort of accomplishment. I don't. Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people. But I'd have to force myself out there, put on some fake happy face and make friendships that won't hold because either A. I would have to maintain a false personality, forget that I'm an introvert and just go out there every fucking time someone wants to meet up and do something I will not enjoy or B. go on about my introverted life but in return people will just abandon me, as they tend to do because there's a lack of common interests in the end.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends. And, honestly, I think I'm even perfectly fine with my current friends situation. I just want someone to tell ""I love you"" to and the typical relationship stuff, but it's kinda hard finding someone compatible if I prefer staying home and cutting myself off of people. Dating apps? Fuck that, no luck there either. I understand you don't ""need"" that to survive and I could probably find some other purpose in life but this certain void in my heart will never be filled. And I can't just forget about it either.

 I asked my husband to let me know if he noticed any differences and last night he mentioned I wasn't responding normally and today even said I was being chipper.

1. Sleep: Go to Bed before 10pm. Get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.
2. Exercise: Walking, Cycling, Swimming. If you can, do them all and as often as you can. Forget Gyms, get out in the Fresh Air. Get back to Nature.
3. Medication: Find the correct AD dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. No shame in taking medication.
4. Meditation: Buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. Practice daily. I takes a while to get use to it so be patient.
5. Reduce External Stressors: This is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. Not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.
6. Stop living in the past: If you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. You will never be able to change what has already gone. Forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. Just try not to repeat any of them going forward.
7. Kick bad habits: If you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. These are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.
8. Loneliness: This is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. All i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. They saved my life. If you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.
9. Keep yourself clean and tidy: Wash each day and put on some clean clothes. It'll make you feel better.

274,favh7l,False,RANT,15,TL;DR my depression is making me spend more money than I can afford,depression_help,"Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow ""high"" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought ""well, what could happen?"". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000€ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600€ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid.

For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I called my doctor and she said, as some of you suggested, to call the pharmacy and ask for an emergency supply.

I want to hear more from others....I'm a very introverted person, and I'm smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting.

910,b5npuz,False,STORY,3,LOVE,depression_help,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.

To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.

One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.

In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. 

In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.

Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.

Many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.

Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.

Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.

This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. 

For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.

In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.

For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.

In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.

As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.

Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…

For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.

One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.

That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. 

As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.

What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.

One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… you've never experienced love or given love…. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on it's own is true love.

To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:

As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:

I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad… she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.

For me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.

It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.

So how the hell do we undo this?

Not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.

To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.

Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… it's not and never was a true representation of love… I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then I let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… I got angry at the injustice of life itself… I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli “Killing in the Name of” and “Give it Away” and “Sabotage.” In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.

Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.

From that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.

You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.

Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/b5npuz/love/,38,This is an excellent post.

101,goxyim,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,10,"To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.",depression_help,"My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/goxyim/to_everyone_who_actually_took_time_to_read_this/,199,"I'm sorry for everything you're going through, it sounds very stressful. From your post it seems like your mom really cares about you and that you feel bad about times that you've blown up at her. My advice would be to tell her about that, tell her that you feel bad but also that you feel like people are lying and whatever else you're feeling.

Importantly, I wonder if your mother can be your ally to advocate for you against your brother-in-law to get you some more iPad time. Tell her that you need to talk to your friends as they are part of your support system and how you feel when all these restrictions are placed on you.

On the topic of self-harm, my heart goes out to you. I also know of a close friend that does this and it breaks my heart but I've learned to not tell them to stop. The reality is that it is a coping mechanism for you, and you won't be able to stop until you've found another coping mechanism to replace it, so that you can deal with the stresses that come your way. Maybe your mom and you can look into harm reduction approaches that will minimize the harm that comes to you, like not using scissors (especially ones that could have rust on them) or how to know if you've gone too far.

I’ve wrote songs before, I’ve played many instruments before, I’ve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.

374,gw6j7v,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,18,This is a cry for help...,depression_help,"My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that.
I'm a step away from suicide. I've been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks.

Hi there. I'm a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that I'm an atheist and this is story isn't from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story.

I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smart-ass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings.

I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. 


One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know it's wrong. But it's part of the modern/religious culture that you live in.
For example you have to say ""I love you"" in the first month. Crazy, isn't it?
Also most relationships in iran don't include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. 
And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck.


So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please don't judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love.
She told me the same.
But after 2 months she told me that she can't get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. 

I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldn't love them and I still wanted that specific girl.

I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. 
How did that happen?

8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. 
A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. 
I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs (atheist) and her style and her face. She was kinda ""the one"". As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as ""Jane"". And, I refer to myself ""Jack"".

I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off.
I reached one of my girl-friends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20.
That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didn't care.

I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited.



But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her: ""did Jack say anything about me to you?""
She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that ""Jack is into Jane"".

She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too? 
I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. 

So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. 
A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. 
I started dating her and we dated for 2 months.

Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane.

Note: Jane is one month older than me.

I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know?
I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldn't get enough of each other.
Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic.
She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying ""I love you""

One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that I'm flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she can't tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about.

And I meant it.
I was 100% loyal and honest to her. 
But one time one of my friends (girl) from my ex-college  commented on one of my Instagram posts ""miss you"".
The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. 
I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it.
I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted.
But, I was heartbroken cause I couldn't believe Jane wasn't loyal and committed to me.

One night, she told me that she's scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and I'm in love with her.
 
Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didn't have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left.

This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys.
I couldn't believe everything was falling apart. 

She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I don't love her so her love for me has faded away.
She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and I've been acting like a kid.

Break: can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you can't blame them cause they have a lot of father issues,  but I really didn't expect it from Jane.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of ""acting like a kid"".

We broke up and she blocked me on everything. It's been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time.
I couldn't hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time.

After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest.

And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit.

Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I don't love her anymore. 
But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

I've been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, I'm still extremely depressed. 

I can't study, I can't workout, my appetite is fucked up, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I can't enjoy anything. 

I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy being single. I want to put my career and studies above my dating life but I just fucking can't cause it seems like I'm still seeking for the love and attention that my parents never gave me.

She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. I told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months.

I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school.

apparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for it

im really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever want

they have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothing

im sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revising

thanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning

Sorry about the delay, I was a bit embarrassed to check this account after rambling for so long, and I was afraid I wouldn't get any replies...

Thank you so much for replying, everyone! I really can't find the words to express how I feel.

All that I can say is thank you, and I hope you get through all your problems as well.

Finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.

It's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. It's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. Even if they're much better off than I am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.

There are also people far worse than I am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.

Thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying.

I tried two years of college but it was just way too heavy for me mentally. I thought I could handle it but I was absolutely wrong. I've lost lots of credits and not even sure whether I can try again in the future. I'm even too scared to call for information. My parents don't know about this. Not even my friends. Everyone keeps asking how I'm doing in uni but I don't wanna be judged so I keep it to myself and say that everything's perfectly fine. I'm planning to work this summer but no idea what I'm going to do the next year(s). I don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck and struggling just because my depression messed up my future. I don't know what to do and this has been killing me for the past few months.

590,g5lqp5,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,8,"In the “home stretch” for my classes, but finishing everything feels hopeless—any advice?",depression_help,"My classes went online about a month ago. I knew right off the bat this wasn’t going to be a good switch for me, motivation and focus-wise. In the beginning, I actually adjusted pretty well. However, now that it’s down to the wire (two weeks left of class), I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

The only big assignments I have left are three essays, two final exams, and a final project. I also have a few regular assignments to finish before all these are due. I’m attempting to work on one of the essays that’s due this Friday, but it feels hopeless. I feel like it’s going to be an awful essay, that I might as well not turn it in, and that it’s impossible for me to finish all these assignments over the next 2-3 weeks. 

My university is providing the option to take an ‘S’ grade for classes, so if I get above a D-, the class doesn’t affect my GPA at all. Part of me wants to take an ‘S’ for all my classes and simply give up on the rest of the assignments. However, I know the guilt will eat me alive if I do this. Plus, I can’t guarantee I’ll get above a D- in every class if I decide to take this route.

Is anyone experiencing something similar, or has in the past? Do you have any advice for dealing with this debilitating lack of motivation?

Was struggling to stay motivated before the switch to online classes, but now that I'm back home and everything's online I've been having a hard time even acknowledging my classwork, let alone finding enough motivation to do well on all my assignments. The best advice I can give is to do what you need to do to pass your classes, if you're anything like me failing the class and taking it again will just lead to more frustration and regret next semester. Just focus on that goal, that's what I've been reminding myself of whenever I feel like ignoring an assignment or just giving up because nobody will notice. ",2020-04-21 19:23:24

I have a long list of artists I can't listen to because they make me irrationally emotional, but once a month or so, I'll crack out the sad tunes and basically, purposefully let the music kill me internally. It's like I want to be overwhelmed with sadness and this is the easiest way to do it without the obvious actual self harming techniques.

612,g7p1o4,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,17,I (18M) think my girlfriend (18F) is falling into a depression and I don't know what to do about it.,depression_help,"Ok first of all I think this needs some context. We both live in a country where males are given far more rights and freedoms than females, and her dad is a tyrannical controlling misogynist and he doesn't let her do anything (basically she's been in quarantine her entire life). This is the main source of her sadness and it's really affecting her mental state negatively. She rants to me about it a lot and I try my best to make her feel better but I'm running out of ideas. 

About a month ago we were planning a way to get out of here and build a new life in a foreign country but, unfortunately, the plan flopped. Even without the coronavirus, there's no way to get her out of here safely without her father's permission. So the only way to get out is for us to get married, because when that happens I'll be the one legally in control of her (yeah, it's fucked up, I know). 

My family said I can't get married until I get a bachelor's degree (got 4 years left). This happened about a week ago and that really fucked my girlfriend's mental state up. She was sad before but at least she had hope for the future, now she says she feels like there's no hope for her and that she's losing her youth. 

At first I thought she was just exaggerating, because she was frustrated that our plan flopped, and I told her it was gonna be alright and motivated her successfully (or so I thought) but it's been a whole week and she's still depressed. I don't know what to do since we can't really be together because of this lockdown and her piece of shit dad. I send her motivating texts and constantly remind her that she's a wonderful amazing person and that she makes me really happy, but that doesn't seem to have any long term effects. 

We were talking today before she went to sleep and she said she was feeling down again, but this time she didn't have a specific reason to feel this way. that's why I'm worried and I think this is a much deeper issue than I previously thought. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said ""thanks but I don't think it'll help"". I just sent back some sweet messages that got a positive reaction then we said goodnight. 

I hope that this is normal sadness and I'm just overthinking, but what can I do to make her feel better or to maybe stop the sadness altogether? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g7p1o4/i_18m_think_my_girlfriend_18f_is_falling_into_a/,64,"Before you do anything just talk to her and check the true extent of the problem. As I said, she might just be a bit sad at the moment. If you find that she is reluctant to talk and open up maybe share your thoughts and feelings. Maybe if you talk about how upset you are that you can’t elope, or how sad you are that you can’t see her more etc etc it will ease her mind and she will feel able to open up to you when she realises that she’s not the only one feeling the way she is. Or who knows, maybe she is down about something completely unrelated! Or doesn’t even realise she is behaving in a way that is making you this worried. 

Are your family aware of this situation? I’m sorry but from the way you’ve described this situation I’m going to say what I genuinely think based on my life experience.

Nb: No matter what; all I want is the best for both of you so please know that everything I’m going to say is to try and help even if it seems a bit harsh

1. Can she not go to University too? That would give her some independence, a chance to get out the house etc. 

2. Are your family really the type of people who would ignore your happiness to this extent?

3. If she really has depression - she needs help. Being admitted to a hospital or taking her to see a doctor would be the best thing here as well as reaching out to the community/government/legal routes to see if there are any options for her. 18 legally makes you an adult in most countries so if she is 18 and is, in the eyes of the law, an adult, her father has no power over her. Moreover, if you are 18 you are an adult and therefore your family have no power over you.

4. You say none of the options people have given are realistic because you need your family to pay for your education. I’m sorry to say this but is your education more important than your girlfriends life? - if it is something you absolutely know you want and you have looked into every single way of getting an education and there is no way to get one then that is your choice. I am not saying this to be mean or anything I’m just trying to look at this from various angles. I have known too many people who have tried to and have succeeded in killing themselves. If she is genuinely very depressed, you can’t take for granted the idea that she will survive and wait for you for 4 years. She might be too depressed and take her own life if she is forced to continue living the way she has. 

5. If you absolutely cannot get married and if you absolutely have to get your degree then I would talk very seriously and honestly with your family. Maybe they won’t let you get married but maybe they would be able to help in some other way that you both, at 18, aren’t able to think of or don’t know about. Also, if your parents are made aware of the full extent of your girlfriends mental state and the situation with her father, they may reevaluate the situation.

6. If you can’t do anything to help her until you have gotten your degree, maybe you shouldn’t necessarily break up with her, but maybe you should be aware that expecting her to wait might not be the fairest thing for you to expect from her. - with this point I want to say that you need to be very careful. I would imagine she is upset because she loves you very very much and you are probably the thing keeping her going right now, so please know that I am absolutely not telling you to end the relationship, I am just trying to share some opinions from various perspectives because I don’t know where you both live or any more than you’ve shared. 

I don’t believe ending the relationship would be the thing to do here. I believe getting her away from her dad and/or to a doctor is the key here, I am just kind of playing devils advocate. Someone had said “wait until you’ve got your degree” but expecting a young woman to remain depressed and imprisoned for 4 years while you are off getting your education isn’t very fair and it would likely lead to a bad end. This is why I believe getting her into uni or work would be good to help her get her independence and maybe even save money, talking it over with your family to see if there is anything they are able to do or change considering your girlfriends situation and getting her to a doctor are the main avenues to go down.

Do try talking to her again before doing anything else though. She may just be a little upset. Depression can last a week or for someone’s entire life. She might just be a bit low because of the state of the world. Does she have much social interaction via the internet and friends etc? 

It’s clear how much you care about her and it’s really touching to see that you are her trying to get advice from others. As I’ve said, I know some of what I have said might seem a bit dramatic but with mental health you never know so I would rather say things to make you consider them than not say anything and for something bad to happen.

Last quick thing: you might have to choose between her and your education so maybe think about what you truly want - you’re 18 and you deserve everything you want in life but sometimes we do have to make difficult decisions.

Finally: I know you love her, but it is not your job to “fix her”. She is responsible for looking after herself too. It’s great that you are trying to help but don’t forget that you are not responsible for her life. There is only so much you can do, and you do need to think about yourself too. ",2020-04-25 06:44:33

I’d like to start by saying I’m not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this and will happily remove if incorrect. So I’m M 23 and ever since I was a kid my parents (mainly father more recently my mother. Well touch on that) have been a large source of my mental health issues. I’ve discussed this with them multiple times and was constantly told “other people have it worse” or when I break down in tears from everyday life being told “ he’s a grown man crying what a cry baby”

2 months ago I attempted to take my life and was put on short term disability until I was approved to longer be at risk to the company I work for and myself. It’s the only time I’ve felt they’ve taken the matter seriously until I found out that my mother has been talking about it to her coworkers and other family members without asking me first. 

So until I manage to find an apartment to move into I’m stuck with in a house where I don’t even feel welcome in anymore, and have begun to distant myself to the point where all I say is “okay” to any sentence and avoid conversations. I do see a therapist and things are going smoothly. I’m just at a lose on how to tell them they’ve been a large cause my problems. Not to have them take fault.

816,dw868j,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,21,Feeling like an absolute pile of rubbish. Psychiatrist has put me on another pill.,depression_help,"From UK. Long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. Cureently 29. GPs tried me on 8 different types of SSRIs in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. Been to many therapies and counselling sessions.
In 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. I was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.
He rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. He put me on a TCA called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. This is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (Had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as I was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.
Been on it for a while. This week he has prescribed me another TCA amitriptyline. I also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)

Anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. Everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. And now i have to take another type. It makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. My self hatred is so high and I can't switch off the thoughts.

you bottle everything up , so no one knows how you truly feel . you’re tired of the way things are & feeling this way . you’re tired of faking your way through life by pretending to be this strong & happy person . you’re tired of having to put up so many walls to protect yourself

you may feel put down by others & the things they say , but you don’t say anything because you don’t want anyone else to feel the way you do . you want everyone to like you , even when you know it’s better to just steer away from them

you’ve been hurt before , maybe more than once . you refuse to let anyone in because you fear they won’t stay . you want to be happy more than anything , but you’re scared you’ll ruin it . you fear that you’ll run off the only good thing that has ever happened to you
so many people who struggle with depression hesitate to get help because of a stigma . our society has conditioned us to be ashamed of our “negative” emotions

we’re reminded of how lucky we are , of how many would feel blessed to be in our shoes , etc . but in reality , that doesn’t help with depression . is depressed people know our circumstances & i for one often feel guilty for being sad despite everything

let me tell you something . you’re beautiful . you’re strong . you’re better than this . you can & will overcome it , if you believe you can . there are other people just like you , all over the world that are going through this with you . you’re not alone

there are people in your life that care about you & would do anything they possibly could for you . those people that hurt you aren’t worth you crying over . you should never let anyone make you feel less important than you are
one day you’ll be happy , look back on this & realize how much time you wasted worrying about people who don’t even matter . you’ll have people in your life that make you feel so blessed that you may even forget this

As it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. She helped me grow into a mature adult when I was still doing stupid young man shit. She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.
Ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which I can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. We've talked from time to time since then.

806,bn77he,False,Add a Flair!,14,I have no one.,depression_help,"I’ve been wanting to talk about this with someone for a while, but I have quite literally no one to talk to. I’m don’t make enough money to go to therapy sessions so this is the next best thing I guess. To start out, I have been rather tall and thin my entire life, it was never a problem, until high school started. As a girl it’s even harder to have the type of body I have. I’m 5’8 and 112 lbs.. Anyways, the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad moved my family to an extremely rural area on the other side of the county, so naturally I had to start at a new high school where I knew absolutely no one. The school I started was full of racist rednecks and I had never been exposed to those type of people. This is pretty funny (and I can’t wait until the day where I’m not so depressed about it that I can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that “she heard the new girl bleaches her asshole” lmao I know completely random. Well I have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if I did I would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and I said yes. So for the rest of the year I was called “butthole bleacher” and I haven’t shared this info with anyone bc I’m so embarrassed. This group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how I was shaped like a boy. I went home everyday crying because I had no idea people I didn’t even know could be so cruel. This one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. He was not joking at all which made it worse. I had no friends (still don’t), was told how ugly I was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it’s ok to laugh at it, I know it’s funny for people who aren’t me) I remember one day in particular I was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes “there’s the flatass who fucks everyone” . I was shocked and went into class crying. I was confused, I have still never even kissed anyone so I couldn’t understand where people were getting this information from. You may be thinking I’m over exaggerating but I’m not kidding when I say that everyday I was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. The day I hit rock bottom was in dance class. I had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. I had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. I waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as I began to approach them said “no, no, no we don’t want you” and the ENTIRE gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. He noticed I was sad and told me I should probably just kill myself. Everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as I could up a tree in my yard. I was crying and playing my favorite song “American Pie”. Then I saw my dad pull into the drive way, and I couldn’t do it. Then, things began to turn around. I was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, I’ve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. I love physics so I decided to major in engineering, But, i got a D in calculus II last semester so I was kicked out of the program and since  I had all my credits for high school, I just began working full time at my job. I still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. I’m so lonely and feel so ugly. Although now I’ve accepted the fact that I’m just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. Anyways, I found out I actually had enough credit hours to get my AA before even graduating high school, so I got that last week. I’m just so depressed and I literally have no friends. Like I’m not exaggerating at all. None. I feel so lonely and embarrassed. Next week is high school graduation and today I had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. As soon as I walked in all of the horrible memories came back and I got the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had. I pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. And then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so I looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. Then, the group forced a gap in line right where I was standing and said loudly “excuse me”, while the rest of the group laughed. I felt so humiliated. I have to actually walk with these assholes next Saturday and I’ve never wanted to not do anything more. I just want some friends that I can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned I have absolutely none. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. I got into University of Florida so I’ll be starting in the fall. I’m pretty excited for a fresh start even though it’s just an hour a way from where I live. But to be honest, I’m so sad right now and I’m back in a rut.

Even if I did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. My own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. If anything they only reminded me of my failures.

The majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. I went to a private University and none of my friends or anyone I knew even remotely experienced anything like that. 

Sometimes I get frustrated that a big reason why I couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. But I guess that's just life, it's not fair.

That comparison is going to push people away as you are creating a scenario where you isolate yourself. That’s the depression speaking. That’s what there is to fight. No one will be able to understand your experiences the way that you have. No one will be able to fully understand your pain. But don’t be resentful about it. Try and look at it as positively as possible. Maybe the people you care about that care about you won’t understand your learning disability, but remember that they are trying to, and that really matters. Perception is a huge part of depression.

Your pain is there and you don’t have to justify or quantify to other people’s experiences. All there is to do is move forward and try and find ways to be as happy as possible. We are stuck with the hand we are dealt so instead of being upset you got a shit hand, try and make the most of it. I’m really sorry that you feel this way, but no one is going to make it better but you. 

Think of the little things that make you happy, think of the people that care about you and mean something to you. Let yourself relax, and take things one at a time. You will find ways that work for you that help with the depression I know you will! Good luck :)

Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode 

So ages ago I came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. I have been searching high and low for it to share, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. If these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. 

In the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what I pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. 

[Note: I’m not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. These will not work for everyone. This is just a compiled list of things I have found useful, people I know have found useful, or I have read from other writers.]

Including: 
-The Very Basic Basics 
-Food 
-Personal Hygiene 
-Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross 
-Asking for Help 
-Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time 

**The Very Basic Basics**

1)Don’t Die 
It sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. So as long as you are still alive, good job! If you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help ASAP. Tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in America) or go to your nearest emergency room. 

2) Bare Minimums 
Moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. And I mean the absolute bare minimum. The more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. Once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. 

For example, my list is:
Get out of bed at least once 
Take meds/vitamin 
Fill water bottle to drink throughout the day 
Eat at least one (1) thing
Do one “Have To” and one “Like To” (see next point) 

Theres plenty of other things I shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just A Thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 

3) Have To’s and Like To’s 
Try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. This is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. You are moving through this depressive episode. 

Make your Have To’s and Like To’s  proportional to your energy that day. On an okay day your Have To might be a load of laundry and your Like To might be a long walk. On a bad day your Have To might be wash one fork and your Like To might be to watch a funny youtube video. Baby steps. 

Don’t worry if you are not actually enjoying your Like To. Depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. It will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. 

At the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! 


**Food**

So in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. To do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. Also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. 

[Note: I'm not a nutritionist. Note #2: I’m super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what I eat while depressed. Please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]

Buy stuff in advance 
You probably don’t want to go shopping when you’re depressed. So sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. I’m not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. Depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. Bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. Think things like:

Hearty soups/stews with protein and grains
Chef Boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie serving
Frozen Tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain 
 
Whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of “Open, Microwave, Eat.” 

It’s also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 

2) Grocery Shopping 
If your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: Asking For Help). There’s nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. 

This is your chance to get the things that you can’t store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. Again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. 

Stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. It depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of 
Yogurt 
Chicken or Tuna salad
Veggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) 
Hummus 
Cheese 
Sandwich meat 
Fruit (if you think you’ll eat it fast enough. Mine always ends up going bad) 
Milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) 
Pre-made sandwiches
Etc 

Also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like 
Bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) 
Crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)
Cereal 
Snacks (See below) 

3) When you can cook, use that energy well 
If you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. 

As with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. Extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. Think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. I always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. I know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. Whatever works for you. 

When I’m done cooking, I like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross) but I know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don’t have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 

4) Snacks! Make them useful 
Sometimes meals are tough. No worries, snacks are easier! But in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. You are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like 

Nuts/trail mix
Granola 
Protein/granola bars 
Beef Jerky
A giant spoonful of peanut butter (I know I’ve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) 
Or other foods with similar benefits

5) Drinks 

DRINK WATER. As much as those “all you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day” posts are utter BS, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. Water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. 

Whole milk and Soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. 

If you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast or something along those lines. If you find a protein powder that isn’t super gross, that's good too. Try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. 

Drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. V8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. 

Smoothies? I’m a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. I’m not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.

NO BOOZE. I know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. Alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. Also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. Just stay clear until you’re feeling better. 

And drink water. I said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. 


**Personal Hygiene**

OK so this one gets tricky, because I don’t want to be the one saying like, “meh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things” but when push comes to shove, if you can’t do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. So, a few points: 

1) Teeth:
If you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.

Mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it’s way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 

2) Showers 
Feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. 

You can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. So instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself “I’m going to get in the shower, and I’m going to wash my armpits, and then I can just stare blankly at the floor until I run out of hot water.” Odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you’ll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. If not, at least you don’t have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. 

Washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don’t let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. Some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. 

If you can’t manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. Again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 

3) Face 
Baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don’t have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 

4) Baby wipes in general 
Baby wipes are just in general great. Keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. Anything you need to be clean and you don’t have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 

5) Have a routine 
If you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. Ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. Autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think “Wait, did I brush my teeth before I got in the shower? Was that three days ago? Who knows.” 

5) Clothes 
Wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don’t stress too much. Clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. A good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. If you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. You are already 75% of the way there. Grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. 

If you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). 


Long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don’t let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. Do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.


**Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross**

The more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. Also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don’t want people to come over, either just for company or to help. So, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. So here’s some tips 

1) Trash
Don’t bother with trash cans. Ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. You’ve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. That's way too much work. 
 
Instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. Put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. Make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). Just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. When it’s full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. Or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. Done! 

2) Dishes 
Ain’t nobody got time for dishes. Piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. Buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. Seriously, it's a life-saver. I recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you’re eating out of a halloween bowl in June? When you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you’re good to go. 

If any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 


3) Disinfectant wipes
If your episodes are long enough that it’s unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. Just grab a Clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. Make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 

4) Overall 
Overall, try your best but don’t worry. Nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. 

If you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. If you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at.

 Ask for help before it gets too bad. It's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. If it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). Or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. Again, you’re sick, it's okay to be a mess. 

**Asking for Help**

A strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. Having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 

1) Again, Don’t Die 
I’m going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. If you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out IMMEDIATELY and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest ER. 

2) Explain your depression before an episode
Talk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. If they give you the “yeah, okay, I get sad sometimes too” face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. If they give you the “Oh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, I get that because I understand how bad depression can be” face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 

3) Ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family 

When you say you’re having an episode, a lot of people will say “aw, well let me know if there's anything I can do to help.” They say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. And it's true they can’t make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. 

When you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don’t have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. They will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. 

So ask for specific things. When they say “Is there anything I can do to help?” Say something like:

“Yeah, actually. I know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and I need a hand with it. Any chance you could come over and help? We can watch a movie while it's in the washer.”
“Yeah, I really need to do dishes but I’m having a hard time motivating myself. Can you come over and give me a hand? I think I would do better at it with company.”
“Yeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and I don’t know where to start. Can you help?”
“Hey, I really need some food, but I’m having a hard time getting to the store. If I gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? I’ll pay you back for them.” 

Its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. 

Also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. Mine is a lot less formal and a lot more “Hey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.” But whatever works for you and your support system. 

4) Be specific in what you need socially 
In the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. 
. 
This is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. A lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. It’s okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. Again, be specific. You can ask a friend: 

“Hey, I need some company, but I don’t have energy to go anywhere or do anything. Want to come over and watch a movie while I lay on my couch?” 

Or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don’t have much energy, same thing:

“Hey, I still have way too much depression for doing things, but I need a change of scenery. Can I come lay on your couch while you do stuff?” 

If a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you’d like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. If you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. You can say:

“I’d love to join, but I’m still dealing with a depressive episode, so I will probably just sit there. That okay?”

Or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don’t want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. Say something like 

I think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. Thanks for inviting me, though. I appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if I keep saying no. Eventually I’ll be able to say yes again. 
Or
I’m probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. I feel really bad that I have to keep saying no, so how about I tell you when I’m feeling better and we can start hanging out again. 

However BE CAREFUL when creating long-term distance from people. You need some people checking in on you, so it’s okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don’t have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.

5) Talking to casual acquaintances 
It's tricky to explain depression to people who don’t understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. People like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don’t like, etc aren’t owed that level of information about you if you don’t want to get into it. That is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. A lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally I just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. 

Everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. It's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you’ve been so off lately. Whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you’d like to share. 

Since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as “being sick.” The conversation I use most frequently goes as follows.
 
You okay? You’ve seemed off lately.
Yeah, I’ve been sick. I’ll be fine. 
Oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?
No, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* It happens sometimes, but I’ll be okay. 
Oh okay, well I hope you feel better. 

That establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) I clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) I’ll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. 

I use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why I’m not super peppy at work, etc. 

Again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 

6)Getting professional help 
If you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. Nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. 

I'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. Getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. You might have friends saying ""you should really talk to a doctor about this."" Tell them ""yes, I want to, but I do not have the energy to make that happen. Here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while I call and schedule an appointment?"" if you have to. 

I'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but I will say this: Talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. 


Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time
 Phew! Okay, that’s the guide. So to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:

Lists to make:
Your list of absolute bare minimums for every day 
Depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can’t be purchased in advance

Things to have:
Good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prep
Storable food items that need to be cooked, but are easy
Storable healthy snacks
Mouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you’re into that 
Plastic/paper bags for trash 
Paper plates, bowls, and cups
Waterproof box with a lid for dishes 
Disinfectant wipes for cleaning 

People to talk to/things to think about
Talk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not 
Explain the type of help you might need
Think about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask 

Please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps! Stay safe friends!

She dropped everything and came over and cleaned up the dead mouse (when I'm well, dead things freak me the fuck out and while she is grossed out she can still handle it). She helped me clean my closet, took some of my clothes, my bras, and my duvet home with her and washed them while I did some other laundry while we were cleaning. She has depression too and once had somebody do this same thing for her.

765,9b8p3u,False,,7,After years of issues I've just been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.,depression_help,"I hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. Some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. I think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. Hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. Here's what helped me:

Stop drinking completely. You may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. Alcohol is of course, a depressant. Giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in Western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. Alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. Try going at least a month without drinking. I expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. I don't know much about those though.

Exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. The endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. If you join a club you'll make some good friends too. Personally I think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. Group classes are good though. Track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. Go out even if it's raining. Once you've warmed up it's great.

Give yourself a project or ambition to work on. Immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. You might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. Or it could be something totally new. Some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, CAD. I hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which I don't think helps much. I think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. Just pick something to work on and do it regularly. Share what you do with other people.

Minimise your social media use. There have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. Dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. I'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. Same goes for reddit. Try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.

Find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. Therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. Good friends are better imo. Maybe some of them are having problems too. You could help them and feel good about it.

Get some quality sleep. Go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. If you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. There's a ton of stuff like that on Spotify. You'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. There's also Sleep Radio. Also important is getting out of bed on time. Have a little routine. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing Feeling Good and don't give a shit who hears.

Recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. This is hard. Sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. Don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. Get up and do something. Do that thing you've been putting off doing. Clean the kitchen. If you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.

Avoid shift work. It's really not good for you.

Get a pet. Or even just a plant. Look after it well.

Listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. If you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.

Spend more time around nature.

Help other people with their problems. It's rewarding.

This last one is going to be very controversial: Make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. Hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. Say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. I'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9b8p3u/after_years_of_issues_ive_just_been_diagnosed/,49,This post is helping me pull myself out of the rut of negative thinking I’ve been doing for the night.

750,do7trc,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,7,Two Depressed people in a relationship,depression_help,"I’m really struggling and need some support right now.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I’m constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

It’s really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/do7trc/two_depressed_people_in_a_relationship/,54,"Look, I'm going to say something you don't want to hear right now, but I say it in the honest belief that it is the right thing to say:

This relationship is not worth destroying yourself over.

Love just isn't enough sometimes. While I do believe in fighting past rough patches in relationships and supporting each other, I also believe that sometimes we encounter situations where our wellbeing might become damaged if we try to do that. This sounds like something that is going to be an ongoing problem in this relationship, so you need to consider whether it is worth it, and whether you can handle it. I'm not suggesting you break up with him, but I am suggesting that if you need to step back then do so.

Now that I've said that, I think you might do well to do what you can to help yourself first. Use that support system to keep yourself together as well as possible, and (if you haven't) read up on depression and methods of dealing with it. If he's luke warm about therapy, there are other tools out there he might be more willing to try. You might even suggest you do them together.

Also, if you're having trouble with intimacy right now, try replacements. Cuddling and massages are good physical replacements, and the former can be done watching tv together or something. Make it as easy as possible for him to be engaged or with you - even just being in the same room as him and doing your own thing will allow him to know you're there for him, but giving him space. He might be withdrawn, but trust me that knowing that you care for him and are around will be important to him.

That said, don't be afraid to take a few days break. Text him, message him, whatever, but go and do something for you. A small break might be exactly what you need to better support him and not implode. And, it might do him some good too.

Does he suffer from SAD? Winter months can be really tough for some people. ",2019-10-28 11:57:47
257,bdawhr,False,Add a Flair!,15,This is a post for all those who consider taking their own lives.,depression_help,"One week ago my little brother committed suicide. I am not going to tell you how, because I don't want anyone getting ideas and I also don't want to get too personal.

He was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. At least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. What no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years… The news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. Our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. 

Looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter… not a day has gone by since he left us that I haven't cried until I was completely exhausted; that I haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.

We were extremely close and I often let him know how much he means to me and that I will always be there for him, but still… he felt alone. It was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. And now it's too late. He can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. We now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. If you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.

You may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. It's your illness that makes you blind.

So please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. There are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. There is a way out of this suffering. I wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. I know this world sucks, I really do. We have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now I'm furious at the whole world. Please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. You don't have to be 'sexy’, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. All you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. Reach out so someone. There is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.

I wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. I know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me’ - I can assure you, that is a lie. It's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. It wants to win and to do that you have to die. Don't let it win. Please stand up and fight. You don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.

Edit: Thank you all for your support, there's not really much I can say at the moment, but please know that your kind words are appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bdawhr/this_is_a_post_for_all_those_who_consider_taking/,114,"I'm so, so sorry for your loss. I want to thank you for understanding, even when your loss is so raw, that people aren't being selfish when they take their own life. Depression lies and twists everything to fit its negative narrative, where nothing will ever get better and other people will be better off without you. Being made to feel guilty and ashamed for having thoughts of suicide doesn't help at all.

Personally, in my teens and early 20s I was really scared of being a failure and letting my family down. 

When I really hit rock bottom and seriously contemplated taking my own life I actually felt angry that I had to stay here suffering to prevent the people around me suffering. I've seen the impact that losing someone to suicide has, even on people who were only acquaintances.

I came to the realisation that just staying alive is enough, and anything I achieve while alive is a bonus. I managed to get out from under the crushing weight of expectations and it was quite freeing. I've quit multiple jobs and I live with my parents, while my friends are getting on with their lives and hitting goals like marriage and buying homes, but I've stopped judging myself by other people's standards. 

I really wish your brother had felt able to speak to someone and ask for some support. There's such a big problem with men not feeling able to reach out for help. Here in the UK the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is trying to change things. ",2019-04-15 02:31:10

Gratitude is important, because it focuses you on what you have, instead of what you don't.

Think about what you have, and what you don't and you really need. Make some lists. And this is how you get ideas.

Think about the problems you currently have, and see if others have them. If many people have a certain problem, see if you can solve it by developing a product or service, and see if people are willing to pay.

Ask for help. Visit associations, volunteer, meet new people.

There is a solution, but you are not looking in the right place if you are not seeing it. Break the pattern and do something different.

I already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago I was ready to kill myself.

I ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, I didn’t grow up in a healthy household and it’s still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).

I’m currently picking myself back up. I’m at the point that I know when I get a new job I will for the most part be back to normal. 

Whenever I talk to my mom about putting out applications and what I’m doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. 

I know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly I need to move out of here when I can (there are a lot of reasons that I won’t go into right now). 

But I guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. I’m trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say “you can do this!” I get this pity look. I don’t understand. It makes me go back into that thinking pattern of “what’s the point?”.

I don’t need praise in normal life, but with what I’ve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.

I don’t really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that I see occasionally. (Another thing I plan to start working on, making more friends).

723,byz4jp,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,47,Seeking advice for working with depressed partner,depression_help," Hi all,

I've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.

At first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. I understood that she was isolating herself, so I gave her space and tried to be understanding. We still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.

Now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. I've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. But it's beginning to take a toll on me. She's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but I understand that can disappear). She also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).

I think I need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that I can outline that I need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what I'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather I be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.

Could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?

For example right now my daughter has a blister on her foot and what does she do she says daddy my toe hurt. I could continue to be depressed today but I choose to go into daddy mode and make her ok.

I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue misunderstandings, people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

And I find it absolutely maddening how people chastise me for trying to isolate myself from the world. The environment around me is objectively, fucking ugly. And the only way I can deal with it is by spending time in the virtual world; video games, forums, writing. It's literally been my life support for years.

In other words, if your daily life is miserable, trying something new wont be as bad and it can help you see options and doors where there were only walls. As for spending time in the virtual world, if you like video games so much you can work towards a career there. The gaming industry is booming. Or if you're a really good gamer you can post youtube videos and get a community going. I'm also into virtual worlds (Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, LOTR, GOT).

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

I can feel emotions. When I’m with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I can’t seem to get past a 5 at most. It’s like my brain is saying “this is funny you should laugh and feel happy” but I just don’t feel that? At least not fully. It’s like my 5 is other people’s 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much they’re in tears and can’t catch their breath I’m only chuckling, even though I *know* the situation is funny. I can’t even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile it’s like i’m not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside I don’t feel anything. It almost feels as if I’m acting but I’m not because I do know the situation is funny. It’s like there’s a disconnect somewhere. It’s hard to explain. 

And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that’s toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/amtpud/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_saturation_in/,80,Do some mushrooms 🍄 ,2019-02-03 20:37:14
714,ej0qkv,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,6,I feel anxious about going back to college,depression_help,"Winter break just ended and I have to go back today. I’ve been feeling down the whole last semester. I have one last semester left before I graduate. I feel empty inside and I feel like I haven’t done much fun stuff with college. 

I’m 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although I have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it’s eating me up, because I feel like no one wants me. The few girls who I got “close” with (and by close I mean talking) turned me down, and last semester I got friendzoned by the girl I liked. I have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. All of my friends have had sex/dated and I feel so left out. I’ve lied to people about my lack of success just so I don’t get mocked.

I’ve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to put on weight or bulk up. I’ve never been athletic and don’t have anything to show for that. I’m also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. I don’t have enough money to travel, and don’t really have any unique hobbies or skills. When I was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which I feel has socially stunted me. 

I don’t know if I’ll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when I return home i feel like I’ll be stuck at there NEETing and working minimum wage jobs. Two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.

I know when I graduate I’ll be miserable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ej0qkv/i_feel_anxious_about_going_back_to_college/,54,"Hey, brother. I'm 26 (also a virgin who's had little luck with women) and doing my second graduate degree in another country far away from my home. I have to return to school next week to finish my internship and to start my master's thesis. I'm very nervous about going back, due to the pressure of work and school. Being on the other side of the planet and far from my family doesn't help either. I also have serious regrets about what I studied for my bachelor's and my first master's degree, as I've found it incredibly difficult finding work in my field. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time by choosing poorly regarding what to study.

As sad or discouraged as you may be feeling, I strongly recommend that you look for some fun/interesting hobbies; not so that you sound like an ''interesting'' person to others, but rather for your own personal/mental development. Trust me, from my personal experience, it helps so much as a distraction from and a way to cope with whatever negative feelings you may be having. Also, you have a lot of time to change what you want to study or to pursue a completely different field altogether! Don't feel trapped or like your career is headed for a dead end. There are always other options. :)

I hate being the 5 billionth person to be complaining about the pandemic. But I need to get it off my chest. I wish this could all be over. Everything’s getting worse and worse. I’m not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven’t seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I’ve been counting. And I don’t know why. All I know is that I might not make it. Online school has been stressing me out beyond belief. The work load has just tripled and I’m constantly rushing to get shit done. We’re running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can’t go to work because she got infected. She won’t see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can’t go find work because everything’s closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won’t be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don’t know when this will all be over, and I’m losing everything. I’m close to losing my friends. I keep lashing out against the people I care about and I don’t know how to stop.

It’s becoming a problem. I haven’t been able to physically interact with another person in weeks. I’m desperate for any human touch at this point. I think it’s making me more horny.... which is becoming a serious problem.

I wish my mental health wouldn’t crash down like this man. But it did, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t know if I’m outright suicidal. Maybe borderline. Again, I wouldn’t mind if it took me. No one would care anyway. My boyfriend will find someone new, someone better than him. My friends will move on. It would be fine.

I was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for DECA. This diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. Naturally I started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. April rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. It all came to a head when I wasn’t allowed to run for student government next year and that night, April 18th 2018 I overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with NyQuil. I laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then I had a dream where I died and everyone I knew wasn’t the same next thing I know I wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and I knew what the universe was trying to tell me. So eventually I continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because I knew school wasn’t for me. I spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. Fast forward to October and for DECA there was a fall conference that I was really excited to go to and I knew would help put me on track. I was denied because my “penmanship showed I didn’t care.” I again felt so defeated and started skipping school. My friends wouldn’t try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. My grades where dropping and I was just feeling like killing myself again. This time around I knew better so I started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. I got stuck on a island (I live on the west side of WA), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and I was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. During this rebellion I found this app called Yubo and for the next few months I made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. Also during this time I switched to online school. I eventually was banned off Yubo because of “threatening behavior.” But the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that I still talk to to this day. All of my “problems” seemed to go away once I deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday I got myself a puppy. Now I’m going back to my seasonal job at Nordstrom and I’m only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. I started off on the top, hit ROCK bottom TWICE, but with the help of therapy, support, Prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage I’m in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20’s debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt<3.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. 

And that's only half of my issue. 

I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobody's there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I can't do that. Not at this age. 

I'm just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse.

I may be a cynic and that's why but I do feel like, instead of helping, positive thinking makes me feel like an incompetent person, like I'm being talked down by the superior other that is going to come down to tell me the universal answers. It sounds like the one doing the positive talk is patronizing me. Is not that I'm the one who has ""low self esteem"", it definitely sounds like you are the one with ""superior complex"" and or humble brag. *""It's so easy to to be happy, just do what I do, it worked wonders for me, how can you not be happy with what you have? I care about you, you are so strong (smiley face thumbs up  heart kitty)""*. Ugh... It's like baby talk. It's condescending.

I would prefer to talk without pink filters. Trying to think that *""everything will be ok""*, *""don't worry, you have people that loves you""*. No, it won't be ok, it will suck ass and i will have to confront it one way or another anyways and trying to color it doesn't help me prepare for it. I prefer to grab that sadness and anger and use it in a productive way instead of trying to cover my eyes and go to my happy place ignoring and avoiding everything that I cannot change thinking that tomorrow will be a happier day, watching the beauty of the world around me. That only works so much and doesn't solve anything. 

Sometimes saying ""you know what, yeah, it fucking sucks and there might not be a solution to it"" it's much better because I can stop focusing on it and start trying other things. Sometimes a smack on the face on someone that is being a dick to you is what is needed to stop certain situations. Let me lash out at the world and let others know that something might be wrong with it and it won't get better unless it changes too.

I would prefer not avoid not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because I can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what I actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.
