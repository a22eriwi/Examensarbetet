Geared turbofan is not a new idea, it's obvious that if you make an ""ideal turbine"", it's rotation speed will never match the ""ideal fan"" speed. A gearbox fixes that but such a high power high speed gearbox was not economically viable before. 

Most of that 30 years it was not ""in development"" as much as on the back burner.

Also that 16% figure is highly suspect. It's more efficient than a similar sized turbofan, not more efficient than all other turbofan designs, that reduces the competition a lot. ",2015-10-20 01:32:49

509,7m4acz,False,[GENERAL],103,Always remember: you’re a free agent!,engineering,"As we approach the common time of the year to sit down and see what colony leadership determined raises are this year, it’s a good time to share the best advice I’ve ever heard: remember you’re a free agent!

As engineers we are blessed to be in an extremely lucrative job market.  Even though it’s very tough for employees to find solid engineering talent or pays dearly for it, it’s still uncommon to offer non-managing engineers retention bonuses.  

If you’re lucky, HR and management at your company is in tune with the job market and is compensating you at market rates.  If you’re unlucky like I previously was, HR views their job to keep costs down by doing just enough to keep you around then using other motivational methods to boost retention.  Eventually I found myself managing engineers who just graduated school and made more than me out of the gate!

I used to feel a sense of loyalty and tried for over a year to work with HR to fix this obvious mistake.  It turns out the mistake was I was being loyal to a company that had no interest in loyal employees other than underpaying them and milking them along.  Someone pointed out if they were so loyal we’d have contracts to make sure we didn’t leave.  No contract?  Don’t feel one once of guilt if you’re looking.  For me I found a job I like much better, get paid much better, and work for a company that uses their HR department to make sure their valued employees stick around.  

Corporate HR departments will frequently set up systems that make you believe you have no control.     “Raises are capped at 4% which is industry standard”, or my favorite “we want you to always be below the midpoint in the system so you can continue to get larger than average raises”.  This is all BS if you’re a good performer and not being paid at least average.  Systems like this tend to leave loyal long term employees behind the market. Just remember the most powerful tool you have is your free agency.  If you don’t love your job or they aren’t paying you what you’re worth go out and get it!  

I truly hope you love your job, have a great employer, and can mutually benefit each other with a long term relationship.  Reward those employers! Those employers deserve us  to look around so they can get the best ones!",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/7m4acz/always_remember_youre_a_free_agent/,527,"I think only a few specific fields are lucrative (Software, Civil).

I love teaching and sharing, and he had limited experience in my field (welding) so I was excited to introduce him to what I feel is some pretty cool stuff. 

I prepared a great project, that would challenge him, keep him engaged, allow him to do some work with his hands, and gather relevant data for our organization. I also put together some training materials to teach him about our welding and testing processes.

All I asked was that he get in at 7 since our lab mostly runs from 6-2:30 and I couldn’t leave him alone in the lab. 

He showed up every day at 9, took 2 hour lunches, and left at 2. No matter how many times I, or my boss, or anybody talked to him about getting here, his actions never changed. 

He blew off any attempt I made to teach him about what’s going on, and now he has to give a presentation to our upper management, mostly clueless, which reflects poorly on me. 

When he was here, he was mostly on his phone on Instagram. All told he completed about 10% of his total project. 

What he did do was attend every single intern fun event or plant tour that was offered by our company, of which there are usually 2 or so a week.

This past week during one of the  (virtual, of course) Big Meetings I proposed that the Big Machine should have a certain design feature.  It was a minor detail but one that would have high visibility in some circles.  It went something like this....

Inigo:  I think it would work best if the Flux Capacitor used a single 1.21 GW power supply rather than the two 605 MW power supplies that we've used on similar machines in the past.  It will simplify the design and halve the maintenance requirements.

Project Manager:  Would the Powers That Be even allow that?  I've never even heard of someone doing it that way before.

Inigo:  I agree that it would be an unusual configuration but I believe the only reason it hasn't been done before was availability of 1.21 GW power supplies.  Tell ya what, I'll take the action item and talk to Head Honcho to get his buy in.

[that afternoon in an email]

Inigo:  Hey, Head Honcho, during the Big Meeting about the Big Machine it was proposed that the Flux Capacitor be run off a single power supply [...].  Do you have any objections?

[fast forward a couple days... And Inigo's phone rings]

&#x200B;

The other day, I was browsing Reddit and I stumbled upon yet another echo-chamber of deluded people who were encouraging these so called **S*****oftware Engineering boot camps***: ""*become a Software Engineer in* ***three months***!"" I kid you not when I say that the comments were along the lines of ""I got bored one summer so I took a three month course and I am now a software engineer!"".

Excuse me? Are we a joke to these people? Most importantly, have the companies that are allowing them to be hired under the title of ""engineer"" gone mad? (hint hint: it's so much cheaper to pretend programmers are engineers, pay them way less, make them feel important and allow the release of buggy, faulty software that one day might actually result in disaster - because to these people, software engineering = programming!).

In some countries, the title engineer is, for some arcane reason, not (as) protected (as it should be), meaning anyone can legally (find a way to) call themselves an engineer. Engineering is a serious profession and requires years of carefully regulated formal education to acquire the theoretical background and tools to support the practical applications of said theory.

It seems as if an alarmingly large amount of people believe that Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Software Development and Programming are all *synonyms*.

**They are not**. You **cannot** ""boot camp"" your way to becoming an engineer in the span of three months (and so many of these boot camps **do** exist, just google them) just as you cannot boot camp yourself to becoming a psychologist, a mathematician or a physicist. You can learn anatomy, you can learn to solve equations, but that is just a *tiny* portion of each profession. I feel like the same must be said about software engineering.

Engineers are supposed to have knowledge in Mathematics and Science, amongst many other things, enough so to apply them in the designing and manufacturing of systems and in effectively solving a problem.

**Please** stop calling yourselves engineers when all you have are 12 weeks of training in programming languages. Software Engineers are so much more than that! Understanding to its core how a computer functions or how neural networks are structured, applying differential equations to solving mechanical movements in robotic arms, designing a quantum computer system capable of running trillions of calculations in the blink of an eye without crashing or drawing too much power to black out an entire city. These are just examples of the many things engineers can do, given adequate time to **adapt** to each scenario.

**We do not work our butts off to learn how to program the ""Add Friend"" button on Facebook or the ""Order Now"" button on Amazon.** Sure, we can do that and a numerous amount of Software Engineers choose software development as their career path, which is wonderful and diverse, but the difference is in the **method**, the **attention to technical detail**, the management of resources. The difference is in the fact that **an engineer has the background to adapt** to changes, any changes. We don't simply code what we're told to code and go home. We take a problem, dissect it, figure out the most efficient, safe and practical approach, and structure a proper testing of said approach.

The Software industry is turning into a mess, where standardized approaches and international standards are thrown out the window. Do you see many buildings, bridges or satellites spontaneously crumbling or blowing up? Maybe a few here and there, but they are by and large well built, solid works of engineering. Notice how many websites, databases, and applications, save for a few lucky cases where true professionals are involved, are constantly broken, sloppily designed pieces of copy-paste code put together with duct tape.

Now, I understand that *civil* engineering, to make an example, requires more regulation due to safety reasons, but let's not forget the implications a poorly designed system can have on a rocket going to Mars, or in a centralized home automation system that can ultimately result in catastrophic failures and the loss of lives.

Software and Computer Engineering should be treated with the same respect any Engineering field merits. Software Development is a practice that Software Engineers should be capable of doing with excellent skill, but is in no way the only thing we do. When I see amateur programmers being given the title of engineer in companies, I die a little inside.

Ultimately, I believe the problem stems from the fact that in this oh-so-young profession, there is so much money to be made in developing websites for large companies that many engineers have shifted their focus towards this market. Just look at how much money FAANG companies are willing to throw at you. It has been forgotten that engineers do so much more than just basic Software Development.

Given that society is rapidly approaching a future where software governs our lives, I believe firmer regulations must be extended to all fields of engineering, including software. After all, automated-driving is a rapidly approaching reality and Tesla is already the top seller in many places. What would happen if these purported ""boot-camped"" engineers laid hands on the core self-driving software that ultimately decides the fate of so many lives? Let us never find out.  


EDIT 1: I will further emphasize this as I do hope nobody misinterprets me - I am in no way elitist and saying that formal education must be a requirement to do anything. That would be silly. There are infinite ways people can learn things and not everyone has access to the very fortunate avenue of University, for which I am eternally grateful. A certification from three months of summer camp is not enough, however. Just to be clear :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/g8stxy/engineering_boot_camps_need_to_stop_the_title_of/,1241,"Haha OP I thought you meant real engineering, like mechanical, or chemical.

Software engineering is coding, you don't need a deep knowledge of physics or mathematics for that! 

I agree with you tho, the day I found out satellite engineers install satellites on the side of houses I decided I wouldn't stay in the UK after my degree. ",2020-04-27 03:33:42
