782,fpknny,False,Essays,52,The absolute stupidest essay that got my friend into Carnegie Mellon,ApplyingToCollege,"Proof that going full tweak gets u into genius schools

Prompt:
Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to
share. Tell us, don't show us (no websites please).

Response:
One thing I would like to emphasize that is extremely important to me is my intense disdain for everything Andrew Carnegie stood for. As a person who believes that the American Dream should be accessible to everyone who is willing to work for it, Carnegie's actions in the American steel industry could never be justified in my eyes. 

Andrew Carnegie was the son of a humble immigrant steelworker. Never would any respectable person ever expect him to be the monster he inevitably became. ""Robber baron"" does not begin to describe the total absence of decency in any corner of his empty criminal soul. He mercilessly monopolized American steel and destroyed the lives of the American middle-class. 

I strongly believe in the idea that businesses should not be able to monopolize an industry as it gives them too much control over the lives of the people who require the resources it produces. As such l can only condemn Andrew Canegie as a man, despite his contributions to social welfare through his building of libraries and schools. While his legacy may be greater
than just his worst qualities, his despicable actions and crimes against the common American
man were too much to forgive. His workers were underpaid and worked in horrible conditions.
His brutal exploitation of his workforce was all to only contribute to building the monstrous steel
throne that Carnegie attempted to build for himself.

Regardless of my undying loathing for Andrew Carnegie, I do not wish to live at odds
with any person, living or dead. I would hope that by attending the university Carnegie founded
over 100 years ago I can reconcile my differences with the Ghost of Andrew Carnegie, and I
could once again be at peace with the word.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpknny/the_absolute_stupidest_essay_that_got_my_friend/,1060,But Carnegie was a philanthropist who donated millions to fund libraries and schools. He wrote the Gospel of Wealth to encourage rich  Americans to uplift the poor. ,2020-03-26 22:01:10

604,g8i1rs,False,,446,Unfortunate truth for people making final college decisions: School prestige does matter quite a bit for finance.,ApplyingToCollege,"I ended up browsing this a sub a lot this year to get back to speed on the college application process to help my sibling. Fortunately, people know that school prestige isn’t everything, but there is some misinformation regarding it for finance. 



School prestige DOES matter a lot for finance. This is due to the fact that you are in a client-facing role and you’d rather have an analyst from Wharton or Stanford representing you over someone from Penn State, all things being equal. While there are plenty that break in outside of the “target” schools, outside of students from UVA, Mich, Berkeley, Kelley, etc. You don’t see much from schools like Iowa or PSU.



This is somewhat of a cycle, as alums from targets prefer students from their school, but it’s not impossible to break in. That being said, if you’re looking for the easiest route into Wall Street, I’d consider taking on more debt to go to a “better” perceived school.



Edit: didn’t even get to mention top management consulting firms. If you’re shooting for MBB, if you don’t go to a target AND have a near perfect GPA and resume, you have almost no shot. Even I couldn’t get an offer there back when I was in undergrad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g8i1rs/unfortunate_truth_for_people_making_final_college/,1240,I doubt that your undergrads matter that much to them.

Like you have interests and ambitions, you have good grades, but at the same time you’re not special at all. There’s nothing that makes you stand out from any other ordinary applicant. It’s like you can’t see why any college would ever want to accept you.

479,gjv9um,False,Rant,87,Prestige changes people...,ApplyingToCollege,"Long story short, I was accepted to a top university. It’s the first time this has happened in my area so everyone was pretty impressed. 

However, going through high school I was never really liked by most of my teachers. I worked hard but they didn’t like me due to my family connections. Both my mom and sister went to the same high school I did, and they both had mental disabilities that made them difficult for the school to deal with. This meant that they were a hassle to teach, and therefore not liked by the faculty. This ended up also applying to me as I went through high school. Even if I did well, I didn’t have the right last name and often got kicked to the side. 

Now that I’ve been accepted into a nice school, everybody likes me now. My old teachers who unfairly graded me and refused to recommend me or nominate me for school positions are now friending me on facebook, making posts about how they’re so proud of me and that they are honored to have taught me, and sending me personal messages of how they are glad they helped me in my journey. They’re talking to my mom, who they once treated so poorly, about how proud they are of her and me both. She knows it’s all lies and attempts to take credit for me. 

These teachers did the bare minimum to help me, and now it pisses me off that they’re trying to take credit for the success I’ve had that they tried so hard to keep me from. I hate all of it. I was always teased at my school by the principals and guidance counselor for applying to big schools. They would always mock me or say I was wasting my money. And now that I’ve actually done something, they’re so excited to post me on facebook and brag about me on senior day. 

Sure, I’m happy that I’ve gotten this far, but I hate that everyone is trying to take credit for my own doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gjv9um/prestige_changes_people/,1433,Haha I felt the same you do until I got accepted to some prestigious schools.

Hello everyone! It's here at last, the RD/ED II megathread. Spring is in the air, and with it, the hint of college decisions. 


If you want an official megathread for a particular college, send me a PM or comment below with the college's name and, if you have it, the exact date and time of the decisions release. Please give me ample time (~1-4 days before the decision date) to create your megathread, otherwise, the results might come out before I am able to fulfill the request.

College acceptance megathreads will be listed below, as well as expected release dates and times for those not yet released. If you have any information about release dates, please send me a PM/leave a comment with that information so it can be included in this thread.

DO NOT create a new thread about your acceptances or an unofficial school megathread. Such threads will be removed on sight.
We're excited to celebrate your achievements with you!

644,gsxou5,False,Serious,204,Asian male in CS? Ivies are overrated,ApplyingToCollege,"Hellooooo people!

So if you're a rising or graduating Senior, this post will either be helpful or veryyy relatable, so please do read carefully

I'm going to argue that attending your state school or a top public university is better than attending an elite ivy league university if you wish to study computer science, and become a traditional software engineer or technical product manager at google, facebook, amazon, apple, microsoft, etc. you get the idea

First off, cost. I get that your parents come from an upper-middle class background and can pay for that, but don't underestimate just how much undergrad costs. For most students who cant get fin aid, it costs around 75k*4 = 300k for an undergrad education.

State schools on the other hand, especially if in-state, might cost around 30k, and can be done in 3 years with AP Credits. So, we're looking at 90k.

You've just saved 210k

Now, you're probably wondering ""but, hey! ivies have prestige and lead to a better life and have more opportunities""

You're right in some ways, but if you're a CS person, you seriously couldn't be more wrong.

Employers in the tech industry go to many of the top public universities, and heavily heavily recruit. I'm talking the public universities some ppl on this subreddit love, like UVA, michigan, berkeley, georgia tech, etc. but I'm ALSO (and this is the imp part) talking ab random universities you've never heard of, like North Carolina Agricultural and Technical Universities. You know those universities with 70% acceptance rates? or 50%? or 60%? Guess what! Google recruits there. (look at pitt, google has an office literally in pittsburgh, and they just pick up the top cs majors at pitt; it's not all cmu)

The point is, you don't need to go to some super prestigious school and pay a shitton of money and get depressed that you got rejected by a lot of other elite universities.

Save yourself the trouble for once in your life. Be HAPPY going to Berkeley or Michigan or your local state university. Don't cry over getting waitlisted at Cornell or Penn or rejected by Harvard and Columbia. If you're at the top of your public university, you can literally get any top CS job you would like.

In hindsight, I wish I recognized this. I personally was accepted by all 5 of the top 5 PUBLIC universities on US News, but at the same time, rejected by several ivies. For a while, I didn't appreciate getting into Berkeley, Michigan, Georgia Tech, etc. to study CS because I was so caught up with the elitism and prestige of Penn or Duke. Don't make the same mistake I did. Be happy and be proud. You got this.




P.S. Keep in mind, as much as some ppl want to deny it, every ivy league university does heavily consider race in building their class. As an asian male applying for cs, you're in the most overrepresented highly qualified demographic there is. Elite universities like duke or penn are looking to build a diverse class, so naturally they can't pick all the numerous highly qualified cs ppl. However, big state schools, like gtech and berkeley, don't care about your race. They look for raw, untamed MERIT: your POTENTIAL to succeed. As much as I hate the budget cuts and huge ass classes at these big public universities, that trait to be race-blind is exactly what I think will make them far stronger over the next decade.


P.P.S There are a *few* exceptions to this, but the colleges that fit into the exception are not ivies. Only three: MIT, Stanford, and CMU SCS. These three do have a some unique CS opportunities (especially if you're going for quant or fintech) that might not be readily available elsewhere. However, a great bulk of the CS graduates from even these institutions work the same software engineering jobs as their counterparts from strong public universities. Feel free to include Berkeley, Harvey Mudd, Caltech, UWaterloo, etc. as part of this bunch too. Berkeley and Caltech are self-explanatory, Harvey Mudd has an intensely rigorous engineering/CS curriculum, and Waterloo has a killer co-op program (like GT!).

391,fbjckd,False,Other Discussion,48,"With RD season coming up: When you decline admission or withdraw your app to a college, they’ll ask you for a reason, and you should say it was for financial reasons.",ApplyingToCollege,"Colleges use the questionnaire as data to help them know who’s accepting, who’s declining, and it’s not a stretch to think it’ll be used to benefit the school especially in increasing their yield in the future.

So if you put down that you’re going to another school and put the reason as they have a better program or something else, they’ll make a note of your stats and may use it to make a more informed decision in whether to accept or decline a similar student in the future. You’ll be required to give a reason in the questionnaire too, and sometimes they require you to put down the school you’ve accepted instead too so you can’t leave it blank.

In order not to let your data be used in this way and to put pressure on colleges to give more aid or decrease tuition, put down financial aid as the main reason. There are no downsides to this. You won’t screw future classes over, and if enough people do it, it’ll make a statement. College is too fucking expensive.

EDIT: Not condoning lying, but if you’re choosing another school for multiple reasons with financial aid being one of them, put financial aid down as the reason since they’re usually only asking for one.

EDIT 2: Hey everyone, wow I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up like this. I’ve wrote a few loooong comments as replies to people who think colleges using data like this is a ludicrous idea, but I figured a lot of people won’t see them, so putting some info here. More links in the comments.

How are colleges using your data? Well, already pretty unethically. At the University of Wisconsin-Stout and over 43 other colleges (at least the ones The Washington Post found), [they](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) collect your data and use it in such a way without feeling the need to tell you because to quote Buff State: “You have a choice of not interacting at all” referring to the fact that people make a choice to visit the website and they can get their info through phone calls or social media posts instead. Ludicrous, right? They’re saying you’re agreeing to colleges using your data to score you when you’re looking up information and need to make a choice between a detailed database with answers to most of your questions and an Instagram post. I think you need to access the website to find the phone number too.

At UW-Stout, they use an algorithm to assign you a score out of 100 to determine what’s the likelihood you’d accept an offer if given and use it to make decisions. It’s also not said (hmm) where they got the data for the algorithm. I’m a CS/Philosophy major, so the role of trust in an online relationship is super interesting, but to me, I think these events have diminished, perhaps obliterated, any trust in the relationship between you and colleges. Perhaps better advice would have been to not answer the questionnaires at all and forgo making a statement. Your data is valuable, so protect it. This is another way colleges obscure the admissions process to increase the power imbalance in their favor, and transparency and organizing as a collective is how we get the power back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fbjckd/with_rd_season_coming_up_when_you_decline/,1602,"This is just misinformation all around and I encourage students to do the opposite - be truthful in your reason in choosing another school so the school can actually get informed data and better itself.

The data you provide is not “screwing future students” in any way and to say so is just false. It’s hard to imagine a single school that even uses the alleged method to weed out future classes. I can also assure you mass reporting “financial aid” as the reason is NOT going to change tuition rates or scholarship offerings. Why? Because supply and demand, the school filled its class with people willing to pay, so why change?

Be honest. That’s the number one rule for college admissions. ",2020-02-29 21:24:52
3,9vw5qw,False,Interviews,823,I got roasted in my stanford interview yesterday.,ApplyingToCollege,"TL;DR at bottom. 


[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&sh=96d699ce) 

Yesterday, I had my stanford interview. 

I arrived ahead of time and was just taking notes in my notebook, seems a small detail but it’ll be used later on. 

When he came, I shook hands and he insisted we sat outside. It was freezing cold, but I obliged nonetheless. He asked quite naturally to just introduce myself and I did... but he just interrupted me and went “sorry, I didn’t catch you. I just saw a beautiful girl. Could you repeat?”. I kinda got an odd feeling from the off with this. 

He asked me about what I do in IB, and I did so and explained my extended essay to him. He then proceeded to critically question it with various complex issues with the experiment I did for it (it was in physics, and he has a PhD in electrical engineering). He asked for the equation I derived, and obviously I can’t remember so I told him it was a long formula but I can’t quite remember. He responded by essentially telling me my experiment is quite simplistic, and it can’t be that long and complex. Then flexed his thesis that derived an 11th order formula. 
For reference, my extended essay was predicted an A. 

He asked about my econ coursework for the IB as well, and we had a short debate about monetary policy of the Fed. However, when explaining my opinions to him using simple economic concepts, he simply told me I don’t make sense. 

This was about 10mins in. 

He then proceeded to tell me “you spend your whole life studying. You won’t succeed at Stanford, you will struggle massively.”

He hadn’t asked once about what I do outside of school or ANYTHING. Nor had he seen my resume or common app beforehand. Zilch. I am convinced in hindsight he made such a comment simply because I was so into our academic discussions as an Asian. I’m convinced it was racial stereotyping. 

I refuted that claim, naturally. 
I explained all the things I do and he decimated each and every one. 

I run a funny podcast with friends for enjoyment. He ripped into it as “it does not have a purpose” despite me explaining we do it for the enjoyment and entertainment of content creation. 

I explained the two international honours I’ve received. One of them was a 3rd place. He asked me why I didn’t win, and when I gave my answer, he asked what the first place team’s project was. He told me “that’s actually innovative, all you’ve done is manipulate a few numbers. “. 
I explained my next one, and he said “I’m not interested in things you’ve done for competitions”.  

He asked me why stanford. I give a whole host of reasons ranging from the culture and how I clicked with students when I visited, all the way to specific societies and research groups that sound interesting to me. He told me “that’s not quite good enough. You can find that entrepreneurial culture in any university.”  He asked where I’m applying other than Stanford, then told me “you don’t make sense. these universities don’t have any entrepreneurial culture at all”. 

The colleges I named? Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, USC, NYU (am applying to more but didn’t want to rattle off a list of 10). He also insulted USC and NYU saying they’re simply “party schools with average academics”. 

Then he asked me what my “thing” is. I asked him to clarify what he meant, and he said “everyone has something they’re amazing or world class at such as sport, drama or music. What about you?”  

Now I’m sorry I’m not an Olympic athlete, a talented actor or a world class musician. I can’t help that. I do what I do and have excelled at what I enjoy- and I enjoy a few areas. He called me “uninteresting” and told me “you will blend in with the 50,000 applicants, you’re not differentiated. “

He asked me about what I want to do when I’m older. I told him I want to start a company.  He responded “there’s no evidence you can do this. You have no evidence. You’re 17,18, why haven’t you built a successful company already?” 

I have family responsibilities and don’t even know which area I love most to start a company in. What does he expect from me?
He then told me “real passion and evidence” is like this example of a girl who did debating since she was 9. 

He then asked about what drives me. I open up about what drives me... and he completely shut me down and told me it’s “not really a motivation”.

He questioned me on if I drink alcohol. Obviously I say no even though I do.... then he criticises me and says it’s “ridiculous that You follow your parents wishes even when they’re  not around”. Eventually I break my guard and say I have the odd beer with friends. 

Then, he wrapped up the interview by telling me “I know what I’m saying is probably making your mind race at 100mph behind that superficial smile of yours but you have to drop that. “ in a serious tone. 
He told me I “don’t have a story, narrative or drive in life” and to go and “find them and email it” to him. 

He said he would email me what he’s going to report to stanford and “not to be disheartened by it”. 

Then, as he’s leaving he tells me “take your little notebook, reflect and sit there and take some notes on what I’ve said. “

As I said, in hindsight his comment about me spending my life studying was imo racially driven. In hindsight, I should’ve respectfully terminated the interview there and then. 
He had no right to make such a comment. 

I should’ve been self aware of the situation, instead I was taken aback by his comment and too involved.

Advice: if an interview is going badly, be self aware. Don’t take shit, even if you think your future is in their hands - because it really isn’t. 

Honestly I’d rather have taken the L there and then from Stanford (most likely happening anyway) than sit through and defend myself against a constant unfair, unwarranted bombardment of criticism. The tone he took with me was condescending at best. I was nothing but polite and sincere. Luckily, I’m not too upset by this. Just pissed off. If it were someone sensitive, with the way he spoke, they could well have been in tears. 

TL;DR: Interviewer was a huge asshole and constantly criticised me. I believe he stereotyped the fact I’m Asian  when he told me I “spend my life studying” and thus will “struggle at Stanford” without knowing anything about me. Advice: don’t take shit from interviewers. I should’ve walked out there and then.

731,bgcxt1,False,,43,I love seeing my friends fall in love with their college decisions,ApplyingToCollege,"One of my closest friends just committed to Stanford, her very last acceptance after a slew of unexpected rejections. One of my best friends is attending Loyola Marymount for film, one of the best film programs in the country. Another one of my best friends had to pick between USC and in-state U of A and fell in love with U of A and its unique physiology major. Several of my other friends are going to ASU’s Barrett Honors College and pursuing amazing things like Economics with a focus on Public Policy and premed and engineering and interior design and psychology. Two of my closest friends visited and committed to Utah State because of the amazing environmental studies program they have up there. We had some impressive acceptances as an entire class as well - MIT, Yale, Harvard, Rice, Duke, Cornell, Brown, Vanderbilt, WashU, NYU, UCLA, Berkeley, UChicago, Williams. A ton more from smaller name colleges with just as rewarding and exciting academic, professional, and personal prospects for the future. 

Yeah, I’m ecstatic for my future college experience. But it excites me so much to see my friends and peers fall in love with their futures and make these huge, inspiring decisions. I’m so lucky to know such talented, kind, and energizing people. I absolutely can’t wait to see the things they do in the future. I’m fueled by their success. I’m so happy for them, and it’s such a privilege to be able to ride out this crazy college admissions and decisions journey together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgcxt1/i_love_seeing_my_friends_fall_in_love_with_their/,1100,What tf type of flex is this ,2019-04-23 06:14:16
628,aclutj,False,Best of A2C,107,Up Close and Personal: The Interview. Here's my Interview Cheat Sheet.,ApplyingToCollege,"I'm seeing that lots of you are getting invited to interviews and have questions about whether you should do them or not, or what they are all about.  

**Do the interview.** Data for some schools shows a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t if the opportunity is available to them. So, if the school offers you an interview, it’s in your best interest to accept. That’s even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is no such thing as truly ""optional"" in college admissions language right?).

Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews, so you need to **read their websites carefully.** For some, you are automatically put on an interview list when you apply. For others, you have to sign up and arrange it. Additionally, at some schools, they will automatically add you to a list for an off-campus interview if they have them available in your area. 

**Interview time is also an excellent time to start regularly checking your inbox for communications, as well as your spam and junk folders, and make sure you have your voicemail set up and cleared out on your phone. You don’t want to miss any communications from the college** (which you should be opening for demonstrated interest reasons), especially not for something like an interview. Note — one of my own children missed a couple of interviews because he wasn’t checking spam. It was definitely a lesson learned the hard way.

# Advice for nailing the interview

It’s easy to become anxious and stressed about interviews, especially if you’re in the midst of the interview swamp right now. It’s fun, but can be a little sticky, and gooey, and uncomfortable. Or dry and desert-like maybe. Or maybe even moist and dessert-like.

Regardless, you can do this! You’ve made it this far, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, and putting together your application. So instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy into what you can do right now: prepare.

## Top Ten Potential Questions They Might Ask You

You shouldn’t memorize your answers to these questions, but it won’t hurt to think a little about your answers. Focus on how these questions can help you authentically present yourself, not how you can make yourself seem like the most impressive, perfect candidate of all time (the interviewer will see right through that). 

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
2. “What do you like to do in your free time?” Follow-ups: Be prepared to talk about some of your extracurriculars and why you enjoy them, how you got interested in them, etc. 
3. “Why X College?” Follow-ups: Here you should have specific details — amazing classes or professors or programs you’ve heard about. What first drew you to this college and why do you think you’re a good fit? What will you contribute?
4. “Why do you want to study X?”
5. “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” As follow up: What do you do to remedy those weaknesses?
6. “Describe yourself in 1-3 words.” Some say one. Some say three.
7. Be prepared to talk about “supplemental essay” questions: 
   1. Your favorite X (author, mentor, person, etc.)
   2. An obstacle in your life you’ve overcome
   3. What has influenced you the most in your life
   4. Talk about a time when you had to resolve a conflict
   5. Talk about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership, etc.
8. What are your plans after college? You don’t have to be super specific — maybe say what field you’re generally interested in, and perhaps offer one or two ideas you have in mind and why.
9. “What would you do differently about high school if you had to do it again?”
10. “If an alien offered to take you on an epic space journey, but you could never see your friends and family on Earth again, would you go?” (In my experience, sometimes interviewers like to throw weird or unexpected questions at you just for fun.)

## Preparing for Your Interview

In the days leading up to your interview, instead of preparing and memorizing whole paragraphs to lob at the interviewer, think about why you love the school so much. What is it that you love? Because what you love is the version of “you” that you see there. And “you” will be wherever you go. Figure out how you fit that school (it all comes back to fit!).

I suggest bringing a one-page resume. There are others who disagree with me, so go with your gut, but if the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to bring a resume or anything, I recommend bringing a one-page highlights resume. This way the recommender has something to refer to as they talk to you and as they later write their notes. Simply hand it to them when you meet them. If they toss it to the side or say they don’t need it, no biggie.  See below for my one-page resume suggestions.

Also, bring a notepad and pen so you can take notes if you like. 

The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your outfit is clean, pressed, and ready to go. Check out the route to the interview location to anticipate transportation challenges and make sure you make it on time. Go over the next day’s schedule and make sure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. Get a good night’s sleep. 

## Making a Good First Impression

**Appearance**

Contrary to what some students believe, you do not need to wear a suit to your interview. But you must have a tidy, neat appearance.

For example, you could wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You could also wear a clean skirt or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in if appropriate. Or you could wear a nice dress (but nothing too fancy). Wash and brush or comb your hair. No need for anything too elaborate, clean and neat hair is fine. Shave or trim your beard, if you have one, so it looks controlled. If your hair looks a little messy and you think you need a haircut, well, maybe get a haircut.

Wear something you are comfortable in, and that makes you feel confident. However, DO NOT WEAR inappropriate t-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Avoid t-shirts, hoodies, and ripped jeans if you can — even if they tell you it’s casual. If you wear tennis shoes, make sure you clean them up. Also, I personally feel like you should take out any piercings beyond ear piercings, but maybe that’s just me being old-fashioned and frumpy *\[AdmissionsSon’s note: yes, that is definitely you being old-fashioned and frumpy, though unfortunately many interviewers are also old-fashioned and frumpy. Students, try to gauge your audience a bit with this one. I’d be totally cool with whatever piercings.\]*

**Arrival**

Arrive early, so you don’t stress yourself out rushing to the interview. Plan how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time. So yes, you might be 30 minutes early. That’s ok. When you get there, go to the bathroom. After you take care of your business, look at yourself in the mirror and put your hands on your hips and stand up nice and tall. Do the Superman Pose and take some deep breaths.

**Introductions**

Smile! Don’t force a big fake smile, but you’re not at a funeral, right? Again, the interview is going to be like a little chat between you and the interviewer. You might as well relax and try to enjoy it a little bit.

Make eye contact. This is very important. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye, so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. But like, not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Just be confident but natural. 

Introduce yourself. The easiest and most casual, confident way to do this is to simply state your name during the handshake.

Shake hands. Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door.

## During the Interview

Put your phone away.  Silence it and tuck it away. Don’t take it out again until after the interview. The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. If you do show them a picture, make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!

Remember to breathe.

Listen to your interviewer. The one piece of advice that the Admissions Counselors for Colleges ask us to share with you is for you just to come and listen to the questions and respond. Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly practiced. They could end up noting that in their write-up.

Being nervous is ok. Own it. Many of you are shy and introverted. Lean into your nerves. You can tell the interviewer. They might be too, and this will help them know to help you along. Your interviewer’s not looking to catch you in an awkward moment or waiting for a mistake to pounce on. They don’t want you to fail.

## After The Interview

Ask for a business card so you can write a thank you note to your interviewer! When you get home after the interview, jot down a quick thank you note and send it in. Here’s a good rule of thumb — if your interviewer is your parents’ age or older, a hand-written thank you note will be great if you have his or her home address (without creepy internet snooping); otherwise, an email is fine. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be sure to bring up something they talked about in the email. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.

**THE RESUME**

In most cases, the interviewer, especially if they are an alum interviewer, won't have any heads up about your application, so this gives them something to work through.

HEADING: Your full name, ID # for that school, email address, cell phone number, and home address 

EDUCATION: High School (s), GPA, SAT, ACT, SAT Subject, and AP or IB scores if they are helpful (note-i had a redditor tell me last week that some schools want to be sure you don't include your GPA or test scores. I'd never heard that before, but obvy if they say that to you, then leave that part out)

EXTRACURRICULARS: what do you do outside of school? It doesn’t have to be a school organized activity. 

WORK EXPERIENCES 

SUMMER EXPERIENCES 

HONORS AND AWARDS 

SKILLS and INTERESTS 

Obviously, this is you distilled into one page, so brevity is key. They may or may not look at the resume, but that’s ok. You just hand it to them when you get there. Some will politely set it aside or just say they don’t need. Others will refer to it and use it for notes. It’s out of your hands once you pass it to them.

&#x200B;

**INTERVIEW NO-NOs**

Don’t treat the interview as the magical ritual that will automatically get you admitted to the school of your choice. As stressed above, this should be a conversation, not an audition, not a monologue. You need to treat your interviewer with respect. Above all else, you need to let your best self shine through.

To achieve that goal, avoid these common interview mistakes:

* Arriving late
* Wearing dirty, torn clothes
* Having your phone out/Looking at your phone
* Offering a limp handshake 
* Being over-prepped
* Spewing canned answers that sound like you’ve tried to memorize them
* Coming with an agenda of what you want to or think you should talk about
* Not listening to the interviewer! The number one thing admissions officers and alums tell me to tell students is to LISTEN in interviews. They say far too many students come with rehearsed responses and you are not actually listening and responding to the questions presented to you. Listen. Be present. Smile. Engage. Breathe.

# 

# tl;dr

* Whatever it looks like, an invitation for a college admissions interview is awesome! It’s an excellent opportunity to have one-on-one and personalized contact with the school, and it adds a lot of useful information to your application.
* There are different ways to get an interview — you might be invited, or you might have to sign up. Keep an eye on your email inbox (check spam and voicemail too) and read the admissions page website for more information!
* Don’t be upset if you don’t get a ton of interview requests, or if you don’t get any at all. Lots of kids get into amazing colleges without an interview.
* Don’t overthink your interview performance. That means you should not memorize answers ahead of time. 
* Before, during, and after the interview, put your best foot forward. Look clean and neat, be attentive and polite, and send a thank you note afterward. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aclutj/up_close_and_personal_the_interview_heres_my/,1213,[deleted] ,2019-01-04 19:47:56

381,gx5612,False,Discussion,111,Miracles DO Happen,ApplyingToCollege,"I saw someone else's post on their waitlist miracle, so I wanted tell you about mine. 

I only applied to 3 schools (don't come at me lol). 1 was my dream school -- UPenn -- while the other 2 were target and safety schools. In March, I found out that I was waitlisted at Penn. After writing a LOCI (and sending it the same day I got the decision), I was informed in May that I got accepted off the waitlist.

My financial aid came in a few days after my acceptance, and once again I was disappointed because there was no way my family and I could afford it. After sending in an appeal, the financial aid office gave me more aid, but it was still not enough. 

*So I sent in another appeal...*

After waiting for two weeks and making tons of phone calls, I realized that the financial aid office did not see my second appeal. One of the counselors there eventually told me that Penn does not usually review 2nd appeals and suggested that I take out loans. However, after making a few more calls, my mom was able to contact the actual committee that was in charge of reviewing financial aid. They told my mom that they would look at my second appeal the next day and update me that evening. 

I'm happy to say that Penn gave me even more aid, making the price around **$40,000** *less* than the amount I originally had to pay. And now, Penn is even cheaper than the state school I originally committed to.

505,bbs8f2,False,Other Discussion,75,What I wish I could tell my 17 year old self-- Reflections of a 2 year post-grad,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all,

Not sure if this kind of post is allowed, if not, feel free to remove.

About me--I started college in 2014. I had a good time and got what I needed out of school, but I’ve also felt lonely and made mistakes. Here’s what I wish I could tell my freshman self. I know a lot of this may not apply to others, but I wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. Good luck to all of the incoming students :)

1. You aren’t having an existential crisis; you aren’t taking care of your basic needs. Good sleep, good diet, exercise, social contact—a lack of any of these things will mimic the symptoms of depression! Seriously, take care of these things first, always.
2. A class cannot be called “hard” unless you pay attention during lectures and put honest, good effort into doing practice problems, homework, and reading the textbook.
3. Undergraduate classes are not that hard. A reasonably smart person will be able to get an A in most of them with EFFORT. If you are not doing well, then something is going wrong with your study habits. Find out what it is so you can fix it.
4. When people say you have to choose 2 out of Grades, Social Life, and Sleep, they’re wrong. You have to choose 3 out of Grades, Social Life, Procrastination, Sleep, and Wasting Time on Social Media and Netflix.
5. There is nothing shameful about being poor; likewise, there is nothing shameful about  having your parents pay for your needs. Instead of pretending to worry about money, show your parents how grateful you are to them.
6. Your new college friends care about you a lot less than your parents do.
7. You need to wash your sheets, towels, and comforter cover. At least once a month.
8. Buy a trash can with a lid and empty it regularly unless you want your room to smell like trash.
9. Your apartment or living space needs a “deep clean” every so often. Buy heavy duty cleaning supplies early on, and use them. Don’t forget the bathtub.
10. You should put pride in your appearance. Your outfit and surroundings affect your behavior. If you wear PJs to class, you’ll act like someone who wears PJs to class. You don’t have to wear collared shirts or makeup, but you should put in a modicum of effort.
11. Roommates are not worth it. The privacy of having your own space is invaluable. Housemates strike an ideal balance between companionship and privacy.
12. You CAN have long lasting and meaningful relationships in college. You can find your life partner when you’re 18 or 38. The former does not make you immature or white trash. Love and companionship is underrated for young people.
13. Stop drinking once you feel the effects of the alcohol.
14. Don’t take dating advice from people who aren’t happy in their relationships.
15. Don’t be friends with people who don’t respect you.
16. The mental states of the people around you will affect you more than you affect them. If you spend time with people who are unhappy or anxious or overly competitive or narcissistic, you are much more likely to become those things.
17. Think about what kind of career you want early on.
18. It will all go by so fast, enjoy it as much as you can.

I graduate in about week and haven’t been spending much time on here lately because my college apps process is done. I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while but just never got around to it because I kept putting it off. I’m going to list off some tips that helped me during the process.

To start, I’ll give some background. I’m going to be a CS major next year at a pretty good CS school (PM me for more info because I'm not trying to give away a lot of personal info, but I would say it's one of the most popular schools on here. It's not an Ivy, but it's near the top for CS).

***

Research now what you need to do. I found out last September I needed two recs and SAT subject tests for some schools. Make sure you find that stuff out now so you aren’t in trouble next fall.

***

I think essays are a big source of anxiety over the summer before senior year and your first semester of senior year. It might sound crazy, but my honest advice is to not take them so seriously. Like, yeah, they matter, but you can literally write about almost anything. **You don’t have to write about some life-changing event.** All that matters is that it says something about you. Looking back, I spent way too long thinking about what to write about, but it became clear after the process that I didn’t need to dedicate so much time and energy to picking a topic. Have fun writing your essays. It sounds wild, I know, and I actually enjoy writing when I get to write about a topic I’m passionate about, but just chill out and write about whatever the hell you want. It’s supposed to be a view into your personality, not your best rendition of Joey's letter for Chandler and Monica. I’m the kind of person that doesn’t take things too seriously, but I know not everyone is like that, so this advice might not work for everyone. But I’m just giving my $0.02 on this whole process, so that’s what worked for me. I remember everyone freaking out about essays and what to write about last year, and, sure, I was stressed, but I just didn’t think of it as that big of a deal. Be yourself, that’s it. Some of this is on the schools too. It’s really freaking hard to write about why you want to go to a school. I’ve seen people say, “If you can’t write 300-500 words on why you want to go to a school, you shouldn’t apply there.” Maybe it’s just me, but I struggled to reach the word minimum even for my top schools. Shoutout to schools like UChicago and Georgia Tech and other schools like that for actually giving us a chance to showcase our personality. For the Why X schools, I kind of just BS’ed them. Just wrote I thought they wanted to hear and left it at that. It was in the Common App essay and other more personal essays that I took my earlier advice about just having fun writing and not taking myself to seriously.

***

Second, there’s a *lot* of great info on this subreddit. That said, there is a *lot* of misinformation too. Again, I don’t want to get into this too much because I’m trying to keep it private here because people from my school go on this subreddit, but I know way too much about my top three schools because I researched them hardcore, and I have seen a lot of wrong things on here about them. Still, in general, this subreddit is hugely helpful, especially for someone who didn’t have much help from parents throughout this process.

***

Keep an open mind. The school I’m going to next year wasn’t even on my mind in August of last year. My counselor gave me a list of schools he thought I should apply to, and I went back and forth on even keeping it on my list. Come December-January, it was my top school.

***

Don’t ED unless you’re 100% totally sure you want to go there. My top school in October didn’t have ED but I probably would have ED’d there if they did. I’m glad I didn’t.

***

Start essays early. I say it, everyone says it, and I know you probably won’t. For me, it’s not that I was so super stressed in late October, but instead it was looking back later and knowing I could have done better if I started earlier. That probably didn’t make sense. Let me rephrase: I started most of my essays about a week before they were due (I know, I’m literally the worst). I finished in plenty of time because I didn’t go crazy trying to think of ideas and nitpick every single thing. But I looked back at my essays in March (after I had gotten my decisions - *never* look at your essays after you apply until you get your decisions because you will drive yourself nuts finding tiny mistakes) and realized that I had gained so much knowledge of the college apps process since applying and I would have done a much better job if I started research earlier. Do that. It helps. I know you probably won’t, but you can’t say I didn’t warn you when you look back at your essays next year and kick yourself for how much they suck.

***

Finally, don’t be a dick. Don’t brag to others about where you got in and didn’t. I made a point to be vocal with where I got rejected because I think it’s important that people know it’s not the end of the world. Ask “Do you know where you’re going yet?” instead of “Where are you going next year?” because some people don’t get in anywhere they applied. Don’t look down on others because you never know what they’re going through (money concerns especially. College is expensive). I heard someone say, “Oh, I thought you’d go somewhere better” to one of their friends. They probably just didn’t think before they said that and meant it as a complement of their intelligence, but, I mean, come on, don’t say that. People say it’s a crapshoot, and that applies when you get in as well as when you’re rejected. Be humble when you get in places because a lot of people didn’t, and brush it off as best you can when you don’t in places because there’s another place out there for you. I’m not a big believer in the whole dream school idea because I honestly think a lot of schools can give you pretty much the same experience. We sometimes fetishize certain schools in our heads even though you’ll probably have a relatively similar experience at most of the schools you apply to. At least for me. I know some people are just applying to the top X schools for their major. Miss me with that. I would despise life at Carnegie Mellon even if they’re really good at CS. I’m just different than that socially. Not trying to hate myself for the next four years, you know? Editing to add this last part in now because this sounds like I’m just roasting CMU. I’m not. I just mean it’s not right for me personally. It’s perfect for a lot of other people. I just think I wouldn’t like it there.

***

Before I go, I want to echo what I talked about in my first paragraph about not taking this process too seriously. That’s not to say it’s not a big deal - it is - but don’t base your self-worth around where you’re going to college. My parents were pretty hands-off throughout it all so I didn’t have that much pressure, but I know some people’s parents aren’t like that. Sit back and think every once in a while, like, whoa, I get to pick where I study. I get to pick what I study. In X months, I’ll have independence and be living on my own in a place I earned the right to be at. That’s pretty fucking cool. Make this thing fun. You only get to/have to do it once. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to get accepted to all of these colleges. If you had told me this a year ago, I would have sent you to /r/wowthanksimcured because I know you can’t “just stop” putting so much pressure on yourself, or at least most of you can’t. Just, please, try to have some fun with this. College isn’t the end, it’s the beginning (and now I’m a philosopher I guess). This is the start of your new world of independence, but thankfully you’re eased in with the help of parents and teachers and counselors. Enjoy it. Sit back and smile and think about how you’re picking your own path.

***

That’s it. Definitely not proofreading this so my bad for any typos. Again, PM me for any personal/CS-specific/school-specific questions. These are just my $0.02 so YMMV. This process is different for everyone, this is just what helped me.

***

One more thing, about ECs, I literally had 0 CS-related ECs. 0 math competitions. 0 science competitions. No DECA or Science Olympiad. Nothing like that. I had a couple years of varsity sports, community service, and some clubs I’m interested in. Do stuff you like. Not stuff you think colleges will like. I’m not going to lie and say it wouldn’t have helped me if I had USACO Gold (I honestly don’t know what that is but I’ve seen it on here as a good thing), but I don’t think the cost of trying to get that (and probably failing) is worth what I would have given up.

192,g37nsu,False,Best of A2C,76,"My personal system for easily creating fun, original essay topics. Introducing: ""Half-Ideas""",ApplyingToCollege," In my experience, the majority of problems students run into with their application essays are based upon picking a bad topic. By ""bad"" I generally mean the topic falls into two categories:

1) Done to death

2) Too weird for its own good

The first one I can easily provide samples for: probably my most common one is running track. A lot of students run track and want to write about their experiences. That's great except that a lot of other students also run track and have similar things to say. There are only so many ways to write about track - see if you recognize any of these classics:

\- I joined track and was bad at it, but then I tried harder and now I'm good

\- I'm really good at track and here is a list of my accomplishments you already saw on my EC that prove how good I am

\- I'm just ok at track, but through the team, I have gained other skills like leadership that are important to me

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. But then I got better and now I can again

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. And I still can’t. But it’s ok I figured it out

\- I don't actually like track, but in being forced to do it, I learned some valuable lessons

\- Here is a live recap of me running the anchor on the 400 relay, with every student I pass symbolizing an obstacle I have conquered in life to get where I am

That last one is a bit of a joke. But it's indicative of the problem that I think drives elite students to get so...creative in the framing devices on their essays. You students know track isn't that special, but it is something important to you, and you want to talk about it. The end result is...well…

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i\_think\_modern\_elite\_essays\_are\_terrible\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i_think_modern_elite_essays_are_terrible_and/)

And then the other problem is with ""le quirky teen"" essays. These never seem to work out as well as anyone wants. That penguin collection may be as important to you as you write about, but without anything more substantial to link those interests to, the essay falls apart.

So, what do we do about all this? How do we manage to write about what matters to us, but in a way that's still fun and original? 

The answer is *half-ideas*.

""I like track because it taught me responsibility"" is a half idea. So is ""I have trouble sleeping when I'm nervous. So is ""I collect stuffed penguins."" So is ""I like making people laugh and try to lighten the mood when things are hard."" A half idea is anything about you or your world that you think colleges should know about. What makes half-ideas different from normal ideas is that we want to come up with these ideas with the full intention of *combing those ideas together to create an original topic.*

Some people stumble upon combining half ideas by accident. I did! I wrote an essay ten years ago that perfectly encapsulated how easy and powerful combing two ideas can be. My two half ideas for the topic were:

1. I have ADHD
2. I like to run 

Either of these topics could be converted into a competent, if unexciting, essay on their own. I guarantee AOs will read hundreds of similar essays this year.  But luck would have it, I combined those two half ideas into a full idea that worked a lot better. All I had to do was look at those two topics and try to find a connection between them. I've found that the best connections will pop out to you. Mine did:

**How running helps me deal with my ADHD by giving me a way to quiet my mind and think clearly** 

The hardest part of my ADHD is getting my brain to stop moving so fast. As quickly as I start to think about something important, that thought gets batted away by garbage. I like running because I find when I get tired enough, my brain will quiet down, and I can think about things that are important or bothering me. I get most of my best thinking done six miles into a run. That's my essay. 

I guarantee there aren't many students writing that essay. By combing two ideas into a single one, I make the topic much more personal and unique. I also build myself a natural narrative structure by both presenting a challenge and a way I conquer that challenge. ""How X helps me with Y"" is a great way to frame an essay  Cool, right!

So let's get practical. The first step is to build as many half-ideas as possible. Just start posting as many ideas as you can. Don't worry about how you'll match them or if they're even worth matching. You've likely heard similar ""just write; it doesn't matter what!"" advice before, but I think that advice kind of sucks because it DOES matter what you write. With half-ideas, you should feel more comfortable posting weird factoids about yourself because you'll no longer have to worry about turning those ideas in a full essay. Just write them. Here are some sample list groups you can start with, along with as many personal half ideas I can think of for each.

**Cool stuff you've done that would make a traditional essay**

4 years Cross Country

3 Years Track

2 Years School Newspaper

4 years Parli Debate

Hosted a school zombie tag game

Active non-fiction writer

Started my own College Consulting business and made a sweet website, nbd (CollegeWithMattie.com)

**Obstacles you've overcome** 

ADHD

I suffered through chronic illness in my 20s

Colorblind

**Weird ""quirky"" facts about you**

I love cats and have one named Penny

I love football and refuse to work on Sunday

I taught myself piano using a video game

**Positive Personality Traits**

My mom says I'm funny

I'm easy to talk to and once won a bet by speaking about my cat and college admissions for 3 hours straight

I think differently and often come up with solutions for problems no one else has (like this one!)

I see patterns well and am always looking for a more efficient way to do things

**Goals/Passions/Proof of those passions**

Want to be a private college admissions consultant

Finishing UC Berkeley certification on topic

Worked past three years as a counselor with company

10 years of writing experience

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

That's just a short selection. Locate any ""idea suggestion"" posts and you will find more topics to think about. 

Now that I have my list, it's time for me to look for connections between the two. Often the best value for this method comes when one of the half ideas is from the ""challenges/hardships"" section. This is especially true for URM or any other student with a background hook. You want to present that background but do it in a way that's more tasteful than ""I grew up X, and here's why it was hard."" Combine that half idea with another interest of yours, so the topic becomes ""How Y helped me overcome my Childhood as X"". Yay half ideas!

When looking at my list, two ideas that come to mind are my history of illness + that I taught myself piano. I decided to teach myself piano two years ago as a way of signifying that my life was going to be different now that I was better. It turned out that way, and now I celebrate my piano playing as a symbol of the fact that life doesn't take things from me anymore; I gain from it.

Pretty good topic, ya? Seeing these topics all out in front of me made it easy to compare them to one another and see what kind of connections I could identify. 

Here are some bonus tips as you develop your half-idea stable:

**Your ideas don't have to share 50/50 content.** 

Sometimes one topic is just more interesting than the other. Don't be afraid for a single idea to encompass 80%+ of an essay, with another idea coming in as support. Maybe you write about charity work and realize that every time you read to a kid in the hospital you leave him with one of your stuffed penguins. That's exactly why you want to introduce those penguins earlier so you can add it to your experience.

**You can even have third ideas. Whatever**

Going back to my illness/piano essay, I'd probably also want to add my wish to be a counselor in near the end. Just as I gained piano in my life, I also want to obtain success in counseling. Seeeee? It's so fun and eaaaaaasy!

**Focus on the interaction between the ideas as much as or more than the ideas themselves**

Somewhere out there is another essay involving both a love of swimming and a keen interest in robotics. Simply having two half-ideas existing in an essay is not necessarily going to make it work. Instead, I find it’s the way those ideas intertwine -the connection itself- that is most interesting. I think it’s because that connection entirely relies on you and how you view the world. That’s where the magic happens. 


**Keep every half-idea about you**

This goes into advice for another blog post, but keep the focus of your essays on you. Your friends, family, famous people, politicians, and everyone else can cameo in your story, but the vast majority of content needs to be about you. The easiest way to ensure this is to keep all half-ideas that way from the start.

**You can think of half-ideas retroactively**

Write something and just feel like it's missing something? Think hard about other aspects of your life that may fit into the essay you've already written. Maybe you wrote about a big camping trip. You can bring up the fact that you're always the one who tries to keep the group calm, so when things were rough, you took it upon yourself to provide moral support. The goal is writing an essay that showcases what happens when different aspects of your life come together.

**Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative**

Utilizing ""how"" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.

**Don't go insane**

You may have a topic or two that are awesome and don't need tinking with. Don't! This may be advice for essays 2-27 you'll be writing. Keep the list of half-ideas handy and constantly be adding to it. You never know when you'll be inspired by it.

986,f9zxlk,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,96,Ranking t20s based on the distance to the closest Chick Fil A,ApplyingToCollege,"Everyone has their own metrics for judging how good a school is, maybe small class size makes a school more attractive, maybe it's a great grad school, or maybe it's an insane ratio of women to men students (I'm looking at you, American!) In any case, everyone has a different perspective on what makes a college truly great, and everyone ranks colleges differently. It is because of this discontinuity that I am pleased to announce: 

The A2C Ranking list of US News T20s and A Couple of Other Schools I Liked Based on their Proximity relative to Chick Fil A According to Google Maps (Or the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM for short). It is my hope that this life In this list will finally provide us with a stable metric on what ranking colleges really are. I've ranked the us news top 20 undergrad schools, along with some other schools I thought were cool. The results were as follows:

# #2: UVA, with a distance of 0.2 miles to the nearest chick fil a, it will take you approximately 5 minutes to walk there. Definitely worth it, Chick-Fil-As in the south are always incredible. Kind staff, good food, and an all-around great atmosphere, I've never been but I'm going to assume that it is amazing because it is a Chick Fil A.
# #3-5: Duke, Caltech, and William and Mary, with a distance of 0.3 miles to the nearest Chick Fil A. Big shoutouts to these schools for having super close chick fil as that you can easily walk to under the cover of buildings, so if it's raining or something you can get there while staying relatively dry. 
# #6: Georgetown. Georgetown also has a distance of 0.3 miles, but it appears to be an on campus chick fil a, making it worse than normal. No good thing has ever come from an on-campus chick fil a but you gotta give them credit for trying. Nice job georgetown!
Keep in mind the top 6 all take appoximately 6 minutes to get to from the center of campus as described by google maps
# #7: Rice, with a distance of 0.6 miles, taking approximately 15 minutes to get there.
# #8-11: UPenn, American, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt. Each is approximately 0.7 miles away from Chick Fil a, and it will take an estimated 15 minutes to walk there.
# #12: Washingotn University in St. Louis. Washington is special because you need to cut across a park to get to the Chick Fil A, which is nice and calm. It takes about an hour to walk the 2.6 miles required to get there, but it looks like a nice walk, and I wouldn't mind strolling by on a sunny day on my way to the chick fil a. Yay. Alliteration.
# #13: Johns Hopkins, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required to get there. Johns Hopkins was a pain to find because searching ""chick fil a near to johns hopkins"" brought me to some random road like 8 hours outside of the city so I had to find chick fil a myself by searching for chick fil as in baltimore.
# #14 Emory University, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required.
# #15: Northwestern. 3.7 miles. 1.16 hours. Keep in mind when I type like ""1.16 hours"" that just means 1hour 16 minutes, im just too lazy to type it all out correctly
# #16 Brown, 4.8 miles, 1.37 hours
# #17 Columbia, 5.8 miles, 2 hours. How are there not more chick fil a in new york city. That's baffling to me. glad i didn't apply
# #18 Yale, 5.9 miles, 2 hours. 
# #19 UMich 6.6 miles, 2.12 hours. However, the chick fil a near UMich is an Express Chick Fil A in another university, so not only is it far away, but it's probably really bad too. 0/10 would not recommend applying to UMich. (EDIT: APPARENTLY this chick fil a is fine. nice.)
# #20 UC Hicago: 7.3 miles. 2.26 hours. I'm not gonna recommend you walk alone through Chicago at night just cuz ur hungry, but for Chick Fil A it might be worth it.

# #21 Stanford: 7.8 miles, 2.44 hours
# #22-23: Harvard and MIT, 8.8 miless, 3 hours
# #24: Princeton: 12.7 miles, 4.4 hours away. Very sad!


And now, our special mentions. You probably noticed that #1 was missing. This is due to just how incredibly small the distance is. You could practically crawl to chick fil a here, and it would still only take you about 5 minutes. With that introduction, I present to you:

# #1 UCLA! UCLA absolutely demolishes the competition with a distance of **EIGHTY FIVE FEET!!1** it would take you approximately **ONE MINUTE** to walk to chick fil a from UCLA, making it our top school in the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM ranking system. 

Now, for sadder news. Coming in at last place, we have Cornell and Dartmouth. 

# #24-25 Cornell: 59.4 miles, and 19 hours. Even worse is Dartmouth, with 91 miles and 34 hours walking speed. I could walk to Baltimore from my home in Virginia before I could walk to a chick fil a from dartmouth or Cornell. honestly quite shameful. very displeased.


In conclusion. UCLA absolutely owns the competition with an incredible performance, but lots of schools located in the Southeast United States give UCLA a run for it's money. Schools up north or on the west coast traditionally performed very poorly, probably because they are more liberal and hate chick fil a for some reason. buncha nerds tbh. if you want my stats here is the link to my epic spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M59TKDfW6cOLsUXsI_LvhMf2MDa51tJdzzQUZStnErg/edit?usp=sharing

I have been religiously following this subreddit. I just kind of wanted to share because I'm still in awe.

I got in to every school I applied to! Xavier, UMass Lowell, Mizzou (*with an automatic transfer scholarship), and IU East. Now I'm a 29F who graduated in 2008 and when I said ""graduated"" I mean by the skin of my teeth. I was a lazy high schooler who had to go to summer school, night school, and Saturday school just to walk across stage and get my diploma at a 0.97 GPA. I really just didn't think school was for me, even though I felt for the most part capable and intelligent. I had no drive.

After a few years of retail jobs that I was miserable at and seeing my fellow slacker crew graduating I began to feel a bit envious and enrolled in my local community college where I discovered a love for education I wish I had years ago. I somehow managed to get a 3.6 GPA and join the Honors Program and now I'm staring in disbelief as these acceptance letters come in.

I'm so grateful for online programs that are going to allow me to finally be a college graduate (alas, because of work Xavier is a no-go as it doesn't have a fully online degree program =[)

Anyway, I just wanted to let any other adult that thinks maybe it's too late or they can't work a full-time job and go to school that it's entirely possible. Also for any other slackers that every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.

Thanks guys for listening to my rambling! Now to choose, which is proving to be super difficult haha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gbjltr/i_cant_believe_i_did_it_some_hope_for_the_out_of/,1377,Congrats! You deserve it. This was so inspirational. ,2020-05-01 14:57:14
0,ap8rk6,False,Serious,469,I'm dying in two months.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey people. 

So I made a post a while ago, about how I discovered cysts in my lungs that were life threatening. Two days ago, I was told that the disease has spread, making transplant inviable. I'm very light on the details, because really, I just don't wanna know about it too much about it myself. I consulated one of the best diagnosticians in my country. It is what it is, no point knowing what to google to find reports and probabilities, ya know? 

So yeah. I've graduated from maybe dying to surely dying.

So one of the things on my to do list is to thank as many people as possible for making life a little better. All of you are number 46 to be thanked. So thank you for the laughs, the celebrations, the kindness, the ""st anford""s, the chance mes. The last two years, I've visited this sub everyday. So I know all of you are gonna own college and life. Go get that bread.

I'm gonna get off Reddit now and try to do everything I can while lugging an oxygenator around. Gonna try to keep smiling and celebrating life till the end. It was wonderful knowing you all.

926,cbp698,False,,72,Don't Fantasize,ApplyingToCollege,"Hello everyone. I'm a senior who graduated two months ago and would like to warn all you upcoming seniors about your college application process. The past year has been rough for me and the college application experience was fucking brutal. Hear me out for a second. I am a computer science major who applied to 10 schools and they were hard to get into for CS. I am an Illinois in the Chicago area resident and I applied to schools such as UMich, UIUC, Berkeley, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and the likes. I ended up getting rejected by all except two of my safeties (UIC and Loyola) after being waitlisted and given blue balls by Berkeley. When I was rejected by my schools I was devastated as I felt like my hard work was a waste of time. I decided to commit to UIC and I wasn't happy.

&#x200B;

Here's the point: Please do not believe that hard work alone will get you where you want to be at.  I remember grinding the SAT practice tests while watching videos about student life at my schools. I went through a lot of anxiety and worrying my senior year believing that maybe, JUST MAYBE, all my hard work and challenges would put me in a school where I would enjoy myself. I imagined myself on campus, where I would spend my time at making friends at my schools, and what activities I would be a part of. DO NOT DO THIS. It's like the saying ""don't celebrate too early"". Until you get accepted that's when you can start fantasizing. As much as we like to imagine that the world is just and that in the end we get everything we deserve, it is not like that. We like to imagine fairy-tale scenarios. The sooner you realize that you cannot control this shit is when you finally understand how to be happy. Please do not say ""I'm for sure getting into this school"" because when you don't, it is devastating. Life doesn't give a fuck about what you had to go through, you just gotta accept what it throws at you and make the best of it. I remember spending hundreds of hours reading about past students' stats and calculating my chances of getting in. I used to say stuff like ""I'll be the lucky one who defines the odds"". It was all a huge waste of time.

&#x200B;

After cooling off for the past couple of months, I'm not even mad about going to UIC. In fact, it may have been a huge lesson being rejected from all these schools as it taught me that hard work doesn't equal a good future. Luck is a big part in all of this too. So make smart investments and don't put too much effort / emotional investment into something that is not certain. The whole process is like gambling, it gives you a rush and if you lose it can hurt you. Good luck, upcoming seniors and please, be realistic. Don't fantasize about a perfect future but rather make the most of the present moment. If anyone has questions, don't be afraid to ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cbp698/dont_fantasize/,916,"If you’re feeling bad, remember that the biggest factor in financial success in America is not drive, “grit”, IQ, or motivation, but your parents’ income.

659,c34ng2,False,,95,How much will a generic first name hurt my chances of getting accepted to Harvard???,ApplyingToCollege,"This might sound odd, but please hear me out.

My first name, Jacob, was ranked the most frequently-given baby name of 2001 (ssa.gov). Since I know that elite colleges look at applications ""holistically"" and want a diverse class, will having an extremely common first name like 'Michael' or 'Matthew' drastically lower my chances of being accepted? There was a person at my school two years ago (who I think was originally called James)... he switched his name right before application season to 'Tichawonka' and got into Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Tsinghua, etc. Coincidence? I doubt it; he flunked nearly all his classes and had virtually no ECs.

My mother and the 11 out of 12 of my private college consultants believe that I should replicate this in compensation for donating only one building to Harvard this year. I really don't want this to happen (I prefer my current name to some of the alternatives my parents have suggested). To make matters worse, we've already hired a big-name lawyer who ""can get it done within a week"". I'm very skeptical... is it really a good idea to legally change your first name in order to boost your chances at these top institutions?

190,9qfjl5,False,Other Discussion,137,A little bit of perspective from a 21 y/o college student,ApplyingToCollege,"So, I did everything right in high school. Great grades (APs/Honors courses too), stellar SAT and ACT scores (back when it was out of 2400!), leadership positions, national debate awards. I got some acceptances to private universities, some rejections. I got three full rides to T100 public universities, and I thought that I was failure. Not only did I think that I'd never be someone *important*, I was convinced that if I went to a public school I wouldn't even be able to get a job.

&#x200B;

God, I want to smack myself. I'm in my senior year of college now and the last three years have been the most amazing years of my life. I know without a doubt I wouldn't have had the same experience had I gotten into my 'dream' school. I wanted share some of my experiences below for those of you that are fixated on certain schools. 

**1)** **If you think it's competitive now, think about what the your dream college will be like**.

During college I've been a part of my school's debate society, which is probably one of the most well-funded and well-respected public debate unions in the country. I wouldn't say the college debate circuit is dominated by Ivies, but certainly Harvard/Yale/Princeton regularly send lots of teams to every tournament. Over the years I got to know a lot of them since we see each other almost every weekend. On the surface, they all seem perfectly content, like debating 30+ hrs a week on top of a rigorous courseload comes easily to them. Many (not all) of the people I've talked to are deeply unhappy.

Seriously, think about it. If you go to an Ivy/T20, you're among the best, if not \*the\* best at your school. You eat, breathe and sleep getting into \*this\* college, because goddammit you're *special*. You're not like any of the other chumps who took it easy their junior year, those losers who aren't doing 3+ extracurriculars at a state or national level, because you're *driven* and *going somewhere.* Probably your entire life you've been the brightest in your class, and you get a lot of validation from that. 

And when you finally get to this college, you're the norm. Average. Honestly, for most of us, probably below average, or at least that's how you'll perceive yourself. There is always someone with more money, more connections, more national or international awards, more *oh my god you're taking differential equations as a freshman?* 

And this is where the competition really starts. Competition for finance internships, for campaign staffing, for professor recommendations, for spots on the \*D team\* in your college's debate society (yes, even if you went to ToC). 

I don't want to hammer this point home too much. My friends at Ivies constantly talk about how competitive it is just to join an extracurricular, the feeling of always being inadequate, the sometimes shallow friendships and transparent social-climbing. And? You still have to compete with people from every other university in the country for the 'good jobs' that you were promised by this institution. 

I'm not saying that being under pressure isn't valuable, or that everyone who goes to these schools are deeply unhappy. But for me, going to a university where there wasn't cutthroat competition just to join extracurriculars let me shop around and join things I never thought I would. I felt like I had the latitude to experiment and grow as a person because I was surrounded with friends and professors who genuinely wanted that for me, not waiting to put me down so they had the feeling of getting an edge. 

**2)** **Don't get into debt.**

School is f\*cking expensive. It's absolutely ridiculous to be just starting out in life and have $100k+ of student loan debt hanging over your head. *Go wherever gives you the most money*. People say that (most) high schoolers have no conception of money and that it's criminal to lure them into thousands of dollars of debt. As a high schooler, I was convinced that \*I\* knew what I was getting into, and that I would willingly pay any price to go to a ""good"" school, because of course it would pay off.

It's golden handcuffs. When you know you're graduating with debt, the pressure to get a good job skyrockets. No summer to go backpacking with your friends in Europe, you *need* that finance bootcamp so you can work at Goldman Sachs next summer. Going to the bars or a party with your friends? No, the stochastic calculus and corporate finance classes you took requires at least 20 hours a week studying. Can't risk graduating with anything below a 3.8 if you want a finance job. And doing the bare minimum at these jobs once you graduate means working 80 hours a week, minimum. For years. Until that debt is paid.

More importantly, unless you are literally trying to work for Goldman right out of college, I promise you it matters less and less where you go to school because employers do realize how expensive school is. Internships at boutique finance firms aren't hard to come by and they really don't care what school you go to, and once you have work experience you're golden. Look at the list of schools Harvard and Yale Law accept students from; it's mostly public state universities. 

**3) Be a big fish in a small pond, if that's what you really want to do.** 

If you really are Ivy material, and you really do think that you're better than 95% of other students, go to a state school. Think about getting a stellar recommendation from a professor at an R1 (high research) university, vs. competing with *everyone* in your upper-level econ class for a tepid recommendation letter, or not one at all. Think about less competition for research assistant positions, leadership opportunities, conference travel funding. If you're a grad school admissions committee, which looks better? 

Most importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end. Think about what you really want out of life. If the only thing keeping you going is the validation you get from the name on your diploma, seriously reevaluate your life. The competition for external validation doesn't end when you get to an elite college, **it only gets more intense.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9qfjl5/a_little_bit_of_perspective_from_a_21_yo_college/,2182,Basically you're disappointed you aren't a big fish in a small pond anymore? ,2018-10-22 16:41:34

428,cqakh4,False,,72,UPDATE: Applying to college with a 1.4 GPA.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi everyone! I made a post last fall as a senior in HS regarding my low GPA, basically asking if I had a chance at getting into any school other than community college. I decided to log back on and update anyone who read my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9or8i0/14_gpa_do_i_have_any_chance_anywhere/) and/or cares.

I was able to get a fee waiver so I applied to ten schools. I emailed each school with a brief explanation of my circumstances and asked for my applications to be analyzed with more weight on my senior year grades than my previous three-years. Four schools told me they'll write a note about it in my file, three assured me that they review the applications holistically, and three straight up said no.

Out of the ten schools I applied to, I was accepted into two, waitlisted at two, and rejected from the other six. I interviewed with, and was accepted into a private school in my state with about an 82% acceptance rate. The second school I was accepted into has a 96% acceptance rate. One of the ones I was waitlisted to was my absolute top choice.

For a while, I considered attending the private school I got into, but I just didn't love it there, the campus feel wasn't for me and I'd have preferred a bigger school. The other one that I was accepted into is beautiful but across the country.

I decided to go with community college. I took 16 credits this summer with a 4.0, and recently began the Fall semester where I'm taking another 16. I'm applying to a few schools as a Spring 2020 transfer, including my top choice which I was previously waitlisted to, but I haven't decided for sure if I want to transfer this Spring or wait until Fall 2020.

For all those with low GPAs, for whatever reason, don't lose hope! I remember feeling so depressed about how low my GPA was. My high school was very competitive and had high standards, I used to see other girls crying in the library because their GPAs were 3.8s instead of 4.2. There is nothing wrong with community college or schools with high admission rates. If I was able to get accepted into two schools with a 1.4, you'll get into college.

I've had friends who only applied to matches and reaches for either undergrad or grad/med school because they were confident, but ended up getting rejected everywhere. Safeties can normally save you in the worst case scenario, so apply to safeties.

Getting my main point across, here's my experience with college decisions this year.

I'm a senior who initially decided to apply for Computer Science at UCs, Cal Poly SLO, USC, Harvey Mudd, and Brown. Around November of last year was when I had to choose which UCs I would apply to. I saw Davis, Irvine, and Santa Barbara as match schools, and I was confident that I would get into one of these schools. Maybe my GPA was a bit low, but my other stats could balance my application out. I selected the top 6 UCs and saw adding the ""lower-tiered"" ones as unnecessary because of how much money the applications costed, as well as the idea of prestige.

However, as I was finishing up my UC application on the final week of November, I felt an ominous gut feeling that told me to add UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz to my list. I felt as though if I didn't include them, something terrible would happen. I didn't have a reason of why, but I didn't want to risk ignoring my gut feeling. Going back to my UC application, I added both of them as safeties and then submitted my application.

If I had ignore my instinct then, I wouldn't be in college right now.

Turns out that my safeties were my targets, and my targets were my reaches. I got accepted to both Riverside and Santa Cruz for Computer Science first, which made me feel relieved. However, after that was constant rejection from every other school. Got rejected from every other college I applied to, with a single waitlist from UC San Diego.

It hurts getting punched in the gut with 9 rejections in a row, and there are so many people on San Diego's waitlist that it's nearly impossible to get off. However, without my initial acceptances, I would be hurting much more inside, having to accept that I wouldn't be able to start on a campus my 1st year.

I'm glad that I'm lucky enough to get accepted in a college and get that gut feeling that changed my future for the next four years. I'm lucky that I'm going to a school where I love the environment and can focus on CS, a topic that I actually care about. For the next 4 years, I'm proud to say that I'll be attending UC Santa Cruz with plans to major in Computer Science.

Rising seniors and future years, regardless of how confident you are, how high your grades are, or what you have done, apply to safeties that you would enjoy going to, and make sure that your targets aren't actually reaches. College admissions is an incredibly random and competitive process. Sure, there are people who manage to get into college while applying to no safeties or even only reaches. However, don't risk trying that like what I nearly did. Add more safeties. Good luck, and do your best! 😃

You guys. 

Be real.

Don’t be ashamed of your awkward self. Some of y’all don’t have social skills because you’re not social, not because you tried hard in school. 

It’s so annoying to see this narrative of people feeling like they missed out on high school because they tried so hard at school. This isn’t real. You were weird or awkward or lacked any romantic finesse with the opposite/desires sex.

You’ll get into a good school, enroll, and then continue to be awkward. This won’t change. You are who you are. Embrace it. 

In a way, this should be comforting. Your lack of a social life is your own fault. Don’t blame your academic success on your miserable high school years. So if you don’t get into a good school, don’t mourn your lost high school experiences; you wouldn’t have had them anyway.

Second, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores).

#Part 7:  How To End An Essay Gracefully

Ending essays is hard, and most students struggle to end their essay elegantly.  Mistakes here can linger in the reviewer's mind and really bring down what might have otherwise been a strong essay.  They often seem to end:

**1.  Abruptly as if the word count snuck up on them** and tackled them from behind just as they were drawing a breath to continue.  Sometimes this is actually what happened and the student didn't edit very well (if this is you, see Part 5 linked above).  

**2.  By simply rehashing something that was already stated** – a casualty of the common yet misguided advice to make your point thrice over in your introduction, body, and conclusion.  Other times students turn to their academic BSing skills and just say the same things a slightly different way to fill out the word count.  If this sounds familiar, see Part 6 linked above.

**3.  With a trite aphorism or sweeping generality.**  Examples include phrases such as ""striving to achieve our full potential,"" ""making the world a better place,"" etc.  These are commonplace and lame, but worse, they say nothing about the student.  Instead, they make the AO instantly aware that the author is trying to make an impression with such a statement and it causes skepticism about the sincerity of everything they just read.  

#So how do you end an essay in a compelling and purposeful way?

Obviously you want to give the sense that the essay actually ended intentionally rather than being stifled by the word count or trailing off into awkward silence.  You also want to leave a final good impression.  You need to close gracefully, sincerely, and purposefully so they continue to feel positively about you and reward you with a top score.  Here are a few ideas - there are more in the full guide available on my site.  I'd love to hear any others you have in the comments.

#The Comedian's Call Back

I'm fond of the ""call back"" commonly used by comedians (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy)). You reference something from earlier in your essay to say one more thing about yourself. Sometimes this is something that you used to start the essay off. Other times it's something that was a major theme of the essay, a big part of the story you told, or a salient insight or twist on something you mentioned before.   

#The Interchapter

Another option is to depart from the story and inject something more about you. Examples of this in literature include the socialist meeting Jurgis stumbles upon at the end of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged.  You obviously don't have the space to elaborate here, so one or two sentences is probably enough.  You will want to work in a smooth transition though so it doesn't feel jilted or like it ""breaks the fourth wall.""  One example of a good way to do this is to end with a quote about you spoken by one of the characters in your story.

However you choose to end, try to show depth of thought, introspection, maturity, and humility.  Just like great stories, when you do this right, the AO finishes the essay wishing it had continued longer.  They want to know more about you and are intrigued by the personality you presented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c6mckh/how_to_end_an_essay_gracefully/,972,!remindme 330 days ,2019-06-28 16:34:19

664,dtml35,False,,54,"On all the ""philosophical"" admissions negativity...",ApplyingToCollege,"The admissions process isn't fun. That's just a fact. But lately I've been seeing all these posts on A2C criticizing the process in a philosophical/""deep"" way. I just wanted to address the trend. To the people who have been writing these: you're great writers, and I'm sure you'll go far in college and beyond. This isn't supposed to be a call-out post for you. I'm just trying to make the process a little better for everyone.
The admissions process might not be everyone's favorite thing (it sure isn't mine). Everyone has one part they hate more than the rest. For me, it's essays. I just can't seem to write them in the right way. For other people, it might be standardized testing, or ECs, or just schoolwork in general.

But here's the thing: **If you want to go to college, you have to apply.** There's no school that's going to magically show up at your door and offer you admission. If you want to go to college, you're in the application process right now. (If you haven't started your apps yet, close this window and open the common app.) If you're reading this, you probably want to go to college. So you have to apply. Yay! What does that mean? Cue the dramatic A2C posts...

*I've wasted the past 4 years working on homework and schoolwork in hard classes!*  
*I've spent time doing things I don't even care about just to look like a ""good student""*  
*I had to take this super pointless test a bunch of times and waste my time and money!*  
*And now colleges want me to reduce myself into 600 words!!!*

I used to say stuff like that too, until I realized three key things: 

1. If you hate the process, you're doing it wrong.  
You don't have to love the College Board, or enjoy taking the SAT. But if you hate your extracurriculars, you probably picked the wrong ones. If you hate spending time in class, now you know what subjects you shouldn't major in. If you absolutely hate writing your essay, change the topic! You're not trapped in the things you do. You haven't ""wasted your time"". You've gotten one step closer to college, and learned things you'll need to know in the future - even if it's just what you don't want to study. So when you go off to college, you'll be better prepared for it. And who knows, maybe you even had some fun along the way. You know, just a little. :)

2. It's really not that deep.  
Colleges aren't reducing you to 600 words or a 4 digit number, as much as it might feel like it. The essay isn't asking you to condense yourself into 600 words. Honestly, you're already in the application. Your ECs, transcript, recommendations, accomplishments, and maybe interview all tell enough of a story. The essay isn't forcing you to fit yourself in a text box. It's giving you the opportunity to put your own voice in the application, and just talk to the admissions officers.  
In the same way, the numbers aren't everything either. Colleges look at your SAT and GPA (but not really GPA, more the transcript) to make sure you're academically prepared. But for most schools, the stats don't make the decision. They're just one way you can show you're ready and you've accomplished a lot. That can also come through in your ECs and recommendations. Don't stress about the numbers. You're so much more, and colleges know it.

3. (the most important one) Complaining doesn't get anything done.  
I'm not saying you can't complain. Complaining is fine, and honestly it's healthy. But don't get yourself so worked up about the process as being ""horrible"" and ""unfair"" that you lose all motivation to work on your apps. I've been there. My friends used to go on and on about how awful the process was, and it made me lose some of my motivation to get them done. If you're positive about the process, you'll have so much more motivation, and writing those apps becomes so much easier. Just try it out for a couple days. You'll see the difference.

So just remember: The process isn't all that bad. It is what it is, and if you want to get to college, you have to make the most of it. Even though it's perfectly fine to complain, don't worry too much about how ""awful"" it is - just focus on how great your applications are going to be! :)

844,bgkuik,False,,179,Can I just give out an advice to all Americans who are planning to apply to college soon to give British schools (or overseas schools) a look. Especially if you are middle class.,ApplyingToCollege,"I’m an American, went to a top American high school, watched all my friends get into top American colleges, and I decided to go to London to study at one of the best schools. 

I was also trapped in that middle class problem. Too rich to quality for financial aid, too poor to afford college. 

Well British schools are significantly cheaper. Tuition is around 25k usd a year. And then you can choose where to live. No on site residence requirements. Also most degrees are three years long. And did I mention drinking age there is 18? And you get to experience another culture. 

Look into Oxbridge, UCL, KCL, LSE, and other top colleges. I guarantee you will love it as I have!!

My college counselors at my American school didn’t even tell me about British colleges, so I wish I had applied to more British schools in hindsight, but I’m so glad I came here. I just wanted to share that UK might be an option for you!!

EDIT: a lot of people here are saying that I’m being misleading by saying that tuition is cheaper. I only say that it is cheaper than the US if you don’t qualify for financial aid in the us and you want to go to a private school AND you want to still go to a prestigious school. For example, if you were to choose between Harvard full price vs Oxbridge full price (they are same level), Oxbridge will be much cheaper. For me, I chose between paying 65k USD a year for four years for mediocre American colleges vs. choosing to pay 40k USD a year for a top global university that carries a name.

Also can I just say that unfortunately there aren’t that many scholarship options for American students and I really recommend familiarizing yourself with the system as unfortunately, American college counselors have almost no clue as to how to navigate the UK system.  

Also for everyone telling me I’m giving out a bad advice because I say it is cheaper, well first of all, I’m not giving a bad advice. And all I’m saying is to take a look into it, familiarize yourselves, and perhaps something will change your mind. E.g. some British schools have now opened up common app so you don’t even have to apply UCAS. Also if you want to do medicine or law, you can apply straight into these degrees even though it may be hard to practice them in the USA once you get there degrees. Still something to THINK about. Please don’t roast me thx

EDIT again: https://www.studyacrossthepond.com/ is a helpful organization from what I have heard. I did not use them, but I have heard things.

EDIT again again: Clearly, I've rubbed some people the wrong way here. Sorry but I can't change the title and I am sorry if my understanding of middle class is different from yours. And sorry if the finance bit is triggering. Of course it depends on everyone's individual circumstances. For me, I did not do a STEM subject. My fee per year was 18,000 GBP when I started, which is a bit less than 25,000 USD today. I also managed to keep my yearly cost to 10,000 GBP, so all in all, I paid 40,000 USD for THREE years for tuition, room, and board. Considering how some schools are 60-70,000 USD for FOUR years, this was a very good option for me. And as other redditors have suggested here, if the UK is too expensive, check out other schools in Canada, Netherlands, etc!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgkuik/can_i_just_give_out_an_advice_to_all_americans/,989,UK is a big risk tho.

290,b11h76,False,,169,I just got a full ride and I'm stunned,ApplyingToCollege,"Going into this, I knew I fell into the awkward bracket of ""too poor to pay for college comfortably but too rich to recieve any good financial aid."" I was already terrified of the $100,000+ student loan debt horror stories.  Matters were made worse by the fact that I wanted to become a Veterinarian. I did the math of state college + state vet school, and was looking at potentially $300,000 worth of debt by the time I was 30. 

So I obsessively applied to colleges. I was desperate. In the end, I think I applied to around 40. State schools. Private schools with good financial aid programs. Literally every. single. school. that emailed me offering a free application. I was writing supplementals during my lunch period and waking up at 4am to revise. It consumed almost every moment of my first semester. 

On top of this, I was also applying to full ride scholarships. Literally any and all that were available. By the end of January, I'd written around 65 essays. 

I've been accepted into 25 so far. Decent scholarships, but not enough to graduate debt free, which was my ultimate goal. On the other end of the spectrum, I was rejected from every full ride I applied too. Except one.
 
I had to fly to another state for an interview, conpeting against 100 other finalists. Here's where I started to panic. I'm autistic. Wasn't diagnosed until the second semester of junior year, but it's very obvious when you speak to me that something's off. I'd read the interview advice tips, practiced mock-interviews, but after I interviewed I was convinced I'd bombed it. I was too robotic/soft-spoken/antsy, didn't make enough eye contact, weirded them out, etc, while everyone else seemed so charming and funny and naturally well-spoken. I had no chance. 

And I got the phone call today. All four years, full-tuition paid. For once in my life, I didn't screw up. I did it. I fucking did it. My future is mine to mess up, and I couldn't be happier.

590,hac2u8,False,Serious,52,A message to underclassmen: please choose the right friends.,ApplyingToCollege,"In light of me (finally) being a senior and starting college apps, I just wanted to put out a word of advice for any underclassmen out there. Please, please, please choose the right friends in high school. And I don’t just mean your typical “stay away from bad kids” advice. Choose people that will lift you up and motivate you in a POSITIVE way. 

I don’t know if it’s just me, but I barely ever hear anyone talking about how important it is to give yourself the correct type of motivation in high school. Imo, one of the biggest mistakes I made was filling my surroundings with negative motivation and not positive motivation. Friends are people who hype you up and motivate you to challenge yourself because *you feel confident*, not people who make you do something because *you feel incompetent compared to them*. It’s good to look up to people, but it’s super important to recognize that line where self-motivation becomes self-criticism ESPECIALLY in high school, where people can get super competitive and toxic. Chances are, if you feel like you’re playing a never-ending catch-up game and being put down for your class choice/grades/test scores, it’s negative for you. 

Unfortunately, the college application process is hyper competitive. That being said, look for friends who value having fun just as much as they value academics. Personally, I made the mistake of surrounding myself with people who cared about nothing but college admissions, and it made my junior year miserable. I was stuck prepping for AP exams all day and didn’t have any time to do, you know, regular teenage stuff. To this day I haven’t been to a single concert, gone to the beach with my friends, or gone on a shopping trip with them. This might sound silly, but trust me. Having fun in high school is just as important as studying and taking the SAT. Getting into an Ivy or T20 is not the whole world, and while it’s important to work hard/aim high leave some downtime for yourself too. 

That’s all I have to write for now. I realize that this might sound a bit cynical, but I just wanted to write this out and clear it off my mind before I start college apps. Peace ✌🏼

EDIT: Wow thank you for the upvotes and award! I didn’t foresee this happening, but thanks so so much.

EDIT: A second award?! You guys are really generous. Some ppl brought up really good points that I think are worth reiterating: As it is with basically everything in life, it’s important to find the right balance of both fun AND academics in high school.

I would consistently show up late or occasionally skip school, and I only started working on assignments the night before they were due. I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties. 

&#x200B;

I ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about. More importantly, I found the motivation to work hard and go the extra mile because I was sick of not living up to my own expectations. 4 years later, and now I'm the first person from my department to ever attend MIT.

483,fznzys,False,Fluff,42,my backpack predicted the end of high school!,ApplyingToCollege,"Just thought I'd share this (kind of) cool story with this sub, you guys have all been so helpful to me! When I was in the seventh grade my mom bought me a backpack after my previous one had ripped. Now I was beyond excited to have this backpack as it was the kind that had so many pockets you forgot where they all were and whistle that you could blow on if you ever found yourself lost in the woods and nice reflective patches that glowed under the street lamps when you made your daily walk to the bus stop. I had become very attached to this backpack over the years, not just because of its physical attributes, but also because it remained the only reliable thing in my life. This backpack was there for me when I got bullied by the mean boys on the back of the bus for not being good enough, it was there when I had rushed to the hospital after school to find that my younger sibling was diagnosed with brain cancer, it was there when I started high school, it was there when I had lunch alone in the bathroom stalls, it was there when I threw up on the kid in front of me's head waiting in line, and it was there for so many tiny, but life-defining experiences. Though a month and a half ago as I was walking, I felt something round hit the back of my leg. I looked down and found the mandarin orange I had thrown in my backpack earlier that morning. After further inspection, I was distraught to find a big, threads hanging, completely irreparable hole at the bottom of my backpack. I called customer service, then the store I had bought it from, only to find that there was nothing I could do. My backpack couldn't be saved and I would have to finish the last 3 months of highschool using a tote bag or whatever else I could find. I had hoped to end my academic journey thus far with this backpack, do the kind of symbolic send-off that only happens in feel-good paperbacks. Three days later school was canceled because of COVID-19, and two days ago I was informed that school would be closed for the end of the year, marking the official end of my high school career. I just found it kind of oddly sweet, a little nod from the universe, the ""death"" of my backpack almost directly coincided with the ""death"" of highschool for me (and for all of us). I don't know if I'm reaching and maybe it's just a simple coincidence, but I just felt compelled to share the nice story of my oracle backpack amidst everything that's going on. I hope everyone's doing well :)

Answer these and you'll be prepared for any college interview.,ApplyingToCollege,"This is what I tell my kids that I  interview each year. And I'm very forthcoming with them from the initial  phone call/text/communication of the ""questions"" that I ask. They're  not really questions but they are objectives.

Tell me about your background and what you're interested in studying.

(I  personally don't care about why Stanford because you wrote about that  on your app presumably. Most interviewers will care so you need to have a  very solid, specific answer to that which goes beyond the academics but  gets into fit more than anything else.)

Tell  me what's not on your application that you want to share with the  admissions staff. This is your last shot to communicate with them so  make it count. Tell me about additional context or more detail on your  accomplishments or weaknesses. Family circumstances, health issues,  mental health crises, anything. I want it all and the kitchen sink because this is  the gold that helps make you more human to the admissions committee.  This is where we spend most of the time. In my interviews it is 50% of  the interview. We both brainstorm what else we want to add to strengthen  your app.

What are your questions  about Stanford? I tell them that I only answer questions that aren't  googlable so don't be offended if I shoot your question down just move  on to another one. Hint: asking me questions that involve my opinion or  make me think a little bit are useful.

So  I tell my kids everything I've written above to you. Total  transparency. I don't want to know your stats but I do ask where else  you apply because I give them feedback on the culture of those schools  and whether they think it's a fit for them.

I'm  not the norm but I am one of the university's most experienced  interviewers and I have developed my own method that works well for me  and adds something to the application. I hope that others in the future  will follow suit with the transparency aspect.

If  you can answer these confidently you'll be prepared for any college interview.

I  go into it with the attitude of being your advocate rather than another  person to judge you. I want to share my experience and help you as much  as I possibly can and I often stay in touch with my kids forever  regardless of the outcome.

Sure, you should prep yourself for possible questions by thinking on it and maybe brainstorming your response, but wouldn't it be better to set aside all notes during the interview and just talk? I think that would humanize the applicant a great deal more than reading off a script. Also, do you think that's something I could do? It's not that I'm trying to skimp on work, I just don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to stand out otherwise. ",2019-11-07 15:24:09

I am an incoming college freshman. Before I tell you where I am going, here are my stats:

SAT: 1230
ACT: 25
GPA: 4.2

I came from a low income household, so much so to the point where I was supporting myself my last year of high school, working insane hours to pay for my college application fees, graduation cap and gown, etc. 

I hated school until I was in sophomore year, when a teacher told me if I didn't get my shit together, I wouldn't graduate. I started to study, and actually cared about the grades I got. The only access to a computer I had at the time was to the public library. I actually transferred high schools, because I wanted to become more academically driven at a college prep school (despite the rumors from classmates that I got expelled from my previous school). 

The highest job my mom ever held was a shift supervisor at Carl's Jr. The highest job my (long gone) dad ever held was a drug dealer. 

I worked 6 months prior on my essays to colleges, and worked so hard for my extracurriculars that I had 500+ hours of community service. 

I got rejected from these colleges: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly SLO, San Diego State, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, USC. 

The three I got accepted to:

CSUN, Cal State Long Beach, **UCLA.**

I got accepted as a Biology major, and am attending this fall. So if you think you have a zero percent chance, that is bullshit. The college decisions are wack- of course you have a chance.

If you are in the mix and have the stats and have a chance to afford it, you've got to apply. You owe it to yourself to take your shot and while you are likely to be rejected, you gave yourself a shot.

My father and I both graduated from MIT and my kids were hit hard when they got rejected, but they were in the arena and had a legitimate chance to make it. 1960s MIT was very different from 1980s MIT, which was very different from today's MIT, but I would have done anything to have my kids go there.

That being said, you shoot your shot and you make the best of where you end up. There is way too much emphasis on picking your 'fit' in advance. More emphasis should be placed on resilience and deciding that where you end up is the 'right' place. Lay your acceptances out in front of you and pick the best academic/financial/future prospects place for you and the \*decide\* that your choice will be your future.

Make it your place for success.

My son ended up transferring out of Purdue. My Daughter is navigating the virus at Michigan, but I am confident that they are both finding their way through the vagaries of life, starting in college. Life will never follow your plan. You are best served by picking your best option at the given time and planning to adapt to what life presents to you.

In an official statement released to the press, Harvard, representing the League, explained that ""Cornell had failed to maintain the humanities and liberal arts focus necessary to stay in the League"".

Cornell supporters were devastated, claiming that this decision was an attack against Cornell's high acceptance rate and its mission to educate the masses. The Institutes of Technology - MIT, Caltech, GeorgiaTech - watched as the debacle unfolded. Together, they decided that they would do something to right the wrong. 

On a Tuesday morning, Cornell received a phone call, ""Hi Cornell, it's MIT. We have some things to discuss...""

Cornell arrived at The Conference. Inside, sat MIT, Caltech, and GeorgiaTech. ""We've brought in some powerhouses to help us with what we're about to do"", MIT announced.

Carnegie Mellon entered the room. UC Berkeley entered the room. Stanford entered the room. 

A document was passed around, gaining signatures from each of the schools. On it, read ""The reign of the Ivy-League ends today.""

On September 1st, 2025, the Techvy League declared war on the Ivy League, flooding the airwaves with billions of negative attack ads.

During the 2025-2026 admission season, acceptance rates for each of the Ivy League institutions rose to an all-time high while acceptance rates for the Techvy League institutions fell to a record low. Slowly but surely, Ivy League alumni stopped providing donations to their alma maters, and endowments at each of the Ivy League schools began to dwindle. 

By 2033, 8 years after the war had started, the Ivy League surrendered. Running out of money and no longer able to fill their freshman classes, the Ivy League had come to the end of the road. Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, and Columbia had already boarded up their campuses while Harvard, Princeton, and Yale pleaded for mercy. None was granted.

671,gwl8f4,False,Serious,66,The school I applied to 2 months late became the school I’m now committed to,ApplyingToCollege,"Just something I was thinking about that I wanted to share in case anyone else found it interesting or whatever. It might look long but I rlly don’t think it’s a terrible read 🥺 read if u would like, The title is basically the TL;DR

I live in California so it was expected of me to apply to 4 UCs and 4 CSUs. I did that and also applied to Stanford, USC, and Cornell (uw gpa 3.2, w gpa 3.7, sat score 1210) I had no chance of getting into most of these schools. My only match schools were the CSUs I applied to and one of the UCs.

ANYWAYS, fast forward to college decision season and I was rejected from all of these schools (except 3 CSUs). I made a dummy mistake and literally chose the CSUs at random because I thought for sure I’d get into just one UC and everything would be chill. But I was bombarded with rejection after rejection from all these schools and I just kept thinking “it’s okay there are still more decisions to come out!” And then the final rejection letter came. It was from UCLA and I cried for like 2 hours straight over it and I had to leave the group chat for a few days because my friend got in to UCLA and I was so sad about everything. I thought my essays really gave me a chance and it sucked that not one school I wanted wanted me back.

I started looking into community college, and 2 community colleges near me are feeders into UCLA for transfer students. But then I came to reddit and saw a giant list of schools that are still accepting applications off rolling admissions. I had no clue schools were still accepting so I looked through and googled them and applied to some more. Off rolling admissions I applied to DePaul, Pitt, and Penn State. I was accepted to all of these schools but had to decline Penn state and Pitt because of financial aid.

I decided I wanted to apply to more schools in case DePaul didn’t work out, so I used the college search feature on college board’s website and found Syracuse University in NY. It was the last school I applied to. I actually applied to this school 2 months after their deadline, they weren’t accepting off rolling admissions. I applied to this school and like a month and a half later I got an acceptance letter into the exact program I applied to. DePaul never ended up giving me my financial aid package, and I was bummed because it was my first choice and I had grown a little bit attached to it, but Syracuse is an amazing school and they offered me amazing financial aid. I was offered about $60k in grants and $10k in loans, but I can always apply for scholarships or save up money from work study, summer jobs, or whatever so that I don’t have to take out loans after this year. And I don’t have to make any payments at all!! Which is so amazing because my family can’t afford to make any payments for college right now. Their housing and tuition deposits combined totaled $950 and they waived both of them for me, so I was able to commit for free! It was a huge weight off my shoulders because I couldn’t cough up $950.

Ik I could’ve made this a lot shorter, but I just wanted to add some extra details that maybe someone here could relate to. It’s funny that the last school I applied to (2 months late) wasn’t even accepting rolling admissions but it became the School I’m committed to. I just thought it was a little interesting and also I wanted to use this as an opportunity to tell people not to give up right away, unless you’re fine with how things turned out. But if you’re unhappy with what schools you were accepted to, just try to apply to some more. Maybe even apply to these schools that have rolling admissions EARLY, so that you have backups before the big schools’ decisions come out. Don’t just give up. If you’re fine with or happy to go to a smaller state school or community college, then of course do it! But if you’re a person that just really wants a shot at a larger 4 year, or a school maybe a little further from home, there will be schools accepting applications, and some of them are amazing schools with great financial aid! You just gotta put yourself out there and know not to give up because it really isn’t over until you say it’s over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gwl8f4/the_school_i_applied_to_2_months_late_became_the/,1162,"Hey!

Hey everyone! Last week I posted on here asking for you guys to fill out a survey of pretty much everything about you guys -- colleges applied to and results, demographics, stats, etc. Well, after 15 hours of going through all the data, I'm proud to present the r/A2C Class of 2023 Profile.

Some quick stats for you guys:

- There were 605 individual applicants who applied to a combined 397 colleges (amounting to 5,224 individual applications). 44 states and 32 countries are represented (Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho, and Mississippi people wya?).

- From those applications, 2,732 of them were accepted, 1,724 rejected, and 711 waitlisted.

- A whopping 27.5% of us are from California; the next two states with the most representation are New York with 7.5% and Massachusetts with 5.6%.

- Our overall acceptance rate was 52.3%, 21.3% of deferred applications were accepted, and our T20 acceptance rate was 23.4%.

- There was a total of 770 different pieces of advice submitted to aid the current juniors and future classes.

- The most popular colleges to apply to were UCLA (169), UC Berkeley (162), and Stanford (145). Similarly, the most matriculated to universities were Undecided (109), UC Berkeley (32), and Stanford (19).


[The infographic I made is a bit more in-depth \(and prettier\), so be sure to check that out here.

There was no way I could go through all the advice on my own, so after cleaning it of toxicity, I put them all in a Google Sheets document.

I just got into the scholarship program of my dream

As a broke international student withouth any parental support, this is literally a dream come true. At a point I thought that I wasn't even going to go to college. 

I can't thank the /r/A2C community enough. 

My school literally doesn't have a college counselor because so many of us fail to even graduate high school, and navigating this whole American college process withouth a counselor was something I never thought I could do. I could barely afford taking one SAT test, let alone expensive private counselling.

222,fp1o6k,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,43,BREAKING NEWS: Northeastern University decides to just not do decisions this year,ApplyingToCollege,"In a truly unprecedented move, Northeastern University has decided to not bother finishing to read their remaining Regular Decision applications and revoke admission from all those accepted in the early rounds.

""We deeply regret to inform all our potential applicants that we will no longer be able to send them short, impersonal letters this year."" noted Assistant Dean of Admissions Stefanie Kane. ""It was lots of fun sending them confusing and vague emails about our decision date, though. The funniest part? We weren't releasing decisions in the first place this year!"" Kane also scoffed at the idea of institutional oversight and transparency. ""We only hope our decisions release process is as nonsensical and sporadic as the University of Michigan's. The website crash in January simply wasn't enough."" 

Experts suggest that the move may have been an effort by Northeastern to manage their yield and US News ranking. ""If you don't accept anyone, your yield rate automatically rises to 100%."" noted many high school seniors disguised as college admissions experts. Additionally, Northeastern's ranking is projected to rise significantly next year, making it competitive with similarly named institutions such as Northwestern, the South Eastern Conference, and Southwestern Missouri Community College. 

Many A2C members were at first inconsolable, but soon realized that they didn't want to ""fuckin attend a school named after a direction anyways"" and it was all ""yield protection"".

If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.

**The sports injury essay**

It was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. ""NO!"" I gasped. ""Not on the day of the big game!""

Coach looked solemnly at me. ""Your career is over,"" he said. ""You can't play in the big game now.""

Suddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. ""Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit.""

A burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. ""No, we won't,"" I said, standing up resolutely. ""I'm going to play.""

Coach looked at me in awe.

That game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.

**The ""thesaurus"" essay**

I cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.

**The sob story essay**

My life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.

It all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.

**The overly descriptive essay**

At 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.

**The inspirational service trip essay**

Through my service trip to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.

**The ""intellectual curiosity"" essay**

For as long as I can remember, I have always asked ""why?"" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.

I have been attending reunions, football and soccer games, and other events on campus since before I can remember. I even met Elon Musk, one of my idols, there. I’ve been wearing Stanford sweatshirts since 4th grade and my house is littered with Stanford shit. At a very young age, I made it my goal to attend the school, and as I grew up, I fell deeper in love with it and envisioned my life there. Stanford was my dream school in every sense of the word. 

Yesterday, I was rejected. Obviously, I didn’t expect to get in, but the rejection was initially painful nonetheless.

As time passed and I gained distance from the news, a few things crossed my mind. Anyone who has or will face a college rejection should consider these things:
- As we travel through life, we find ourselves facing forks in the road at important moments. One of these roads was just blocked. I have little doubt that the path we find ourselves on will be more beautiful than we ever could’ve imagined, and that we will be incredibly grateful for the rejection in the long run.
- We know our accomplishments. We know how hard we’ve worked. We know how good of a friend we are, the joy and laughter we bring to others, the contributions we make in and out of the classroom. Don’t let a college be the source of your validation. Recognize the things that make you awesome, and understand that the amazing people in your life are a reflection of who you are. 
- Just because we didn’t get in doesn’t mean we aren’t smart or accomplished enough to do well there or that we aren’t smarter or harder working than the people who go there. Considering the other people from my school who got in, I know that for a fact lol.

I thought I'd share it again this year to console all you seniors about your rejections. I'm on a new account because I couldn't log into my throwaway account again.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. \*\*Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.\*\*Sure, there are some exceptions.

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.**(There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some high school students say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.

&#x200B;

Edit from this year: A sophomore at Stanford who's kinda Twitter famous had this one tweet that read:

***Elite universities are pillars of a colonial past, present, and future. Institutions like st\*nford, h\*rvard, etc. are not meant to mold free thinkers, only the next generation of capitalists & imperialists.***

Think about that the next time you see a Stanford or Harvard grad proclaiming to do good for the world in their college apps only to do a complete 180 flip (\*cough [pete buttigieg](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) cough\*).

196,fuzm72,False,Rant,116,UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions,ApplyingToCollege,"Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of ""influencers"" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the ""SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!"" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...


**""What really got me into x university was...""** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?

**""What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!""** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should ""focus on your extracurriculars!""?

**""I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!""** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you ""write nice,"" I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score. 

More and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical ""HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY"" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: ""Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school."" That is it.

 It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fuzm72/unpopular_opinion_being_accepted_to_a_t20_doesnt/,2169,Lol I didn’t read ur post and I’m kinda stoned but I do have my admittance to Stanford last year. Tbh idk why I’m still on this sub but the truth is I spent so much time being a good student and the SATs because the odds were stacked against me. Being an asian applying to elite schools from the Bay Area is tough but it was tougher that my parents didn’t go to college and I didn’t grow up with elite resources. I only needed the determination and grit to try my hardest.

989,8a1fkl,False,,108,"Fuck my 1600; or, why I wish my parents had made learn the violin.",ApplyingToCollege,"Around this time, most of you have probably gotten your results back. Some of you are disappointed. Some of you are pleasantly surprised. And a very small, elite bunch of you are absolutely over the moon. But let's stop talking about you and start talking about someone I know much better.

Me.

Not too long ago, I fit into that third category. Yup, a perfect 1600. I don't know everything there is to know about this godforsaken test. Lord knows I practically guessed between the best two responses on a couple reading questions. And I actually made a mistake in the writing (blessed be thy curve). Hell, I did awful on the essay: a 6/3/5.

But hey, I got a 1600!

And I'll tell you a little secret... You know how when you're in the shower, fantasizing about whatever little thing, and you start playing that scene in your head, of hitting f5 on your keyboard, seeing that stupid acorn cb logo pop up, and then seeing the number in front of your eyes...

...It's fucking amaaaazing. Probably the single happiest moment of my life, pathetic as that might sound. Texting your friends, calling your family. Hearing your mom in the other room calling her friends saying ""Oh, the SAT? Oh, he did well. Very well, he actually got a perfect score. No, really. Yeah, a 1600."" As much as I had hyped myself up for that, it still exceeded my expectations.

Of course, that's nothing but a honeymoon period, and I was well aware of it. Life goes on, there's chem exams to worry about, and before you know it, you almost forget. But, there is one thing that sticks.

The ego.

But not any kind of ego. It's the feeling of confidence.

You see that kid over there? He plays basketball. Well. Meanwhile, I can't even do five push-ups without being sore for a week.

But, hey.

You got a 1600. He didn't.

Is it pathetic? Yeah. But it really, really helps. It's not that I lack confidence. It's not even that I'm insecure. It's just that I'm a narcissistic piece of shit. And hearing that voice inside my head is rather soothing.

Flash forward only a few weeks. I decide I should take the AMC 12, despite barely knowing it exists until some two weeks before the test day. Alright, I tell myself, Of course, this is a hard test. But I'm a fucking god at math, aren't I? Of course I am. Math is the one thing I'm better at than anything else. I'm the best person I know at math. I need to be in the top 5%. Small fry! I was in the top 0.03% for the SAT, and that's half reading, which I'm nowhere near as good at.

I got an 82.5. Respectable score, of course. But not even close to AIME qualifying. My mom told me I shouldn't think twice about it- Anyone doing well on this test studied for it for months, like I did for the SAT. I only did for a couple weeks. But still, I felt insulted. I'm BioticAsari-fucking-Babe. I fucking drink math for brunch, bitch! How the hell did I stare at a geometry problem for 15 minutes and come up with no good ideas for how to solve it? Am I dumb? Am I just not meant for math? I hope to god not. If I can't do math well, I can't think of anything that I can do any better. The notion of someone out there being better than me at Math drives me up the wall.

I move on.

Last week I went to a chamber concert. It was a piano quartet by Brahms, followed by a piano quartet by Walton. The Brahms left something to be desired- the violin was a tad loud, and the piano was a tad quiet. The Walton, though, was beautiful. It had this grand sense of theme and space. Gorgeously played. I can't help but think to myself- I'll never play like that. Sure, by the time I'm their age, I might play half-decent. But I won't be a virtuoso. Chances are, I'll never be a virtuoso.

Yesterday I was watching a video by this chess guy. It was about this 13-year old German kid who beat several grandmasters to win the Grenke open. Damn. I hear him again. I won't be that good when I'm 70.

I've been feeling two feelings lately, that I don't think I had ever felt before. The first is envy.

I had felt material envy. I had felt envy for my friends for all having phones when I didn't own one until I turned 17. I had felt envy for my friends for having driver's licenses when I don't because my parents can't afford the insurance. But this was a different kind of envy. A personal envy.

I didn't envy these people for what they had. I envied these people for what they could do.

What a bizarre feeling that is.

I envied the violist because she could play the viola. I want to play the viola. I envied the cellist, because he could play the cello. I want to play the cello. I envied the pianist, because he could play the piano. I can play the piano. But not very well. And I lack the time or money to truly pursue it to the point of playing even as a pro-am. I envied the chess kid, for playing chess like a god at his age. To my comfort, I'm sure many envy him. Even chess grandmasters, who know they weren't as good as him when they were his age, and he'll be much better than they are when he's their age. But I still envy him. And I still envy those kids that got into the AIME.

I'd like to comfort myself by saying it isn't fair. That they're somehow better off. But that's not true. They just spent more time practicing than I did. I would know- that's how I got a 1600 on the SAT.

The second feeling is contempt.

It isn't contempt for my father, for working upwards of 60 hours a week, practically breaking his back, all for what amounts to little more than peanuts- and all just out of his unending love for his family, which I am eternally grateful for. It isn't contempt for my mom, for being the best mother she could despite being in effectively 24/7 pain the last 8 years due to medical issues. It's not contempt for my grandfather, who was an awful father to mine (and a marginally better grandfather, at that.) It isn't even contempt for my uncle, who's got a million or two sitting on the dow, and who hasn't once offered to, say, I don't know, take me through Italy wine tasting.

I'ts contempt for me.

But not the me of now.

The me of later.

Why? Because I feel like a slave to him. Of course I will never be a piano virtuoso. But he might. So it is for him that I learn the piano. Of course I'm not smart enough to qualify for the AIME. But he might. So I buy 50 dollars worth of AoPS books, and study them on end.

But why must I do everything for him?

I've never even met the guy!

For all I know, he's an ass. Maybe he looks down on me not with pride but with shame. To think, that I was ever such an ungrateful child.

Why can't I make a hundred grand?! Not him, the me of ""the future.""

But me! I want my Wikipedia article, dammit. I want to be good at things! I want to write the Beethoven's 9th of the 21st century- BioticAsariBabe's 1st. I want to find the non-trivial zero to the Rieman-Zeta function with an imaginary component other than 1/2.

And I remind myself that he might. Maybe he will do all these things and more. But god, this whole process has made me hate him. I got a 1600 so that he can get into Stanford. I spend an hour at my shitty 90-dollar keyboard so that he might one day play the Emperor Concerto.

The men and women who have effected change or beauty (or disaster, even) in the human civilization did not do it by getting a perfect score on a standardized exam. Why can't I be them? Not him. ME!

Fuck my 1600.

I would gladly toss it to the curb if it meant I could truly do something well.

Edit: before someone mentions it: no, this is not an Asian parenting thing. Both my parents are extremely proud of me and have expressed that if anything, I should go a little easier on myself. Also: I definitely meant to title this post ""made *me* learn the violin.""

In elementary school you called me thick-headed and hopeless. And no, not out of friendly teasing as you insist today. You'd watch me in legitimate disgust. 

In middle school I worked my hardest to please you and my father and it resulted in OCD towards school assignments and grades. I strived to be the perfect student. As a result I because anxious and shut everyone out of my life. At which point i was no longer thick-headed but instead you called me anti-social, awfully nerdy, a loner, pestered me on my weight (i was a ""whopping"" 80 pounds just btw.. wtf even), my looks, how i dressed, and decided i was just outright strange. 

My self esteem plummeted and by high school my grades dropped (I know- great timing right). The stellar student in me became a shell of what i once was. Now to you I have been distracted and academically challenged. Whenever we'd drive around Seattle by one of my reach schools (in-state) you'd laugh and say ""Look, it's the school you'll never get into"". You insisted i'd have to attend community college. 

Today I got into that reach school we would drive by, University of Washington.

591,fst2i9,False,CollegeBoard Discussion,43,CollegeBoard is the best organization ever. Here’s why.,ApplyingToCollege,"I just want to show my enthusiasm for this amazing new sponsorship for A2C. Here are my top 7(I have to go to bed soon so I can’t list all 696 reasons) on why CollegeBoard is the absolute best thing to happen to us.

1: They are a nonprofit. We know as fact that the $80 registration fees for the SAT and AP tests are put to good use. And the $800 million they earn each year is of course used for scholarships and other wonderful causes.

2: They provide an excellent test to determine our readiness for college. Scoring a 1600 shows my superiority over someone with a meek 1580. The only reason I didn’t get into Harvard was because I only scored a 790 in the SAT Gender Studies Subject Test.

3: AP courses are the best way to prepare us for college. Who cares if taking 13 AP classes in one year damages us psychologically? At least we’ll be ready to thrive at SUNY Ithaca.

4: They are brilliant for introducing curves onto a standardized test to help all of us out. -30 for one question in Math is an awesome implementation.

5: They reuse tests to save money, which is used for all the wonderful causes I mentioned earlier.

6: When they accidentally screwed up the June 2018 SAT, they didn’t refund anybody. In fact, they didn’t even apologize. This shows that they were too busy working on fixing the issue that they didn’t even have time to refund or apologize.

7: It’s so wonderful that we get to send scores to colleges directly from collegeboard! And it’s free, too, if you decide to send it before you actually receive your scores.

So there it is! CollegeBoard is the best organization I have ever encountered in my 18 depressing years here on this planet. A true non-profit, and I can’t wait for the amazing things they will bring to r/ApplyingToCollege .",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fst2i9/collegeboard_is_the_best_organization_ever_heres/,1258,"1600 over 1580?

I have reminded him countless times that they were supposed to be due on the 1st but nope still nothing.

1. He only teaches maybe 3-4 classes, meaning he has 4-5 free periods
2. Every time I've asked him, he tells me ""he'll do it by the end of the day""

How do you feel about introducing my (eventually) 14-year-old to this sub?

What leads me to reject the *llaissez faire* approach are the kids saying ""I got rejected by all the top 10 colleges I applied to"" and ""I can't afford to go to any of the schools that accepted me"" and (in a related sub) ""I got a 1240 on the SAT, how do I get into the 1500s in three weeks?"". 

IMO, it's good to start early so kids have time to learn what they need to succeed on the SAT and college application process. My focus with my 12-year-old is on getting him to read a lot, which I don't do by fiat but by explaining how that will help him and by providing him books he enjoys reading.

Jori Johnson took the practice SAT test as a high-school student  outside Chicago. Brochures later arrived from Vanderbilt, Stanford,  Northwestern and the University of Chicago.

The universities’  solicitations piqued her interest, and she eventually applied. A few  months later, she was rejected by those and three other schools that had  sought her application, she said. The high-school valedictorian’s test  scores, while strong by most standards, were well below those of most  students admitted to the several schools that had contacted her.

“A lot of the rejections came on the same day,” said Ms.  Johnson, a 21-year-old senior film major at New York University, one of  three schools that accepted her out of 10 applications. “I just stared  at my computer and cried.”

The recruitment pitches didn’t help Ms. Johnson, but they did benefit the universities that sent them.

777,d1hmal,False,,77,a message to those applying to college right now,ApplyingToCollege,"hey, seniors. i know it’s a really stressful time of the year and it feels like your entire life depends on how to gift wrap all the hard work you did the past several years..

i was in your shoes a year ago. damn, i depended my life on college admissions and applications. it’s all i talked about, it’s all my “friends” talked about, it’s all my parents talked about. 

as if it’s life or death. terminologies like t20, t10, legacy, scores, ranking, fafsa,..all of it stressed the shit out of me.

it felt like if i don’t get into a certain level of a school then i’m pretty much fucked for life or something, you know? like if i don’t get into a t10 i’ll think, fuck, i could’ve been this or that and now i’ll never get that chance. just because i missed 30 points on the sat and didn’t get this score, just because i didn’t stay up the extra couple hours to study for the ap exams. 

but honestly, although i’m only a freshman at uni now, i don’t think that’s the case. it definitely is not. 

&#x200B;

your school and the value is what you make of it. sure, the label of a prestigious school can help. but what’s more important is the experience and the quality of it. 

and once you go to the school you choose, you won’t think back and hate yourself for not studying harder for the sat’s or ap’s or revising your essays more. you’ll be so caught up in the moment trying to make most of what you have in front of you and as long as you make it really worth it for you, it’ll be worth so much more than being accepted into some ivy or a goal school of yours. 

because from now you are focusing on what’s ahead of you and what you have now. and by all means, try your hardest to get into the school that you want to go to. don’t hold yourself back. what i’m trying to say is, don’t stress so much about what you could miss out on. focus on what you got. don’t look at what other’s have because everyone will deal with what they have differently. focus on you, what you want, and what you can do with what you have. 

don’t beat yourself up for not being “good enough” because there is no such thing. you are. you are all unique and have your strengths and ambitions and no school is “perfect” or the “best” for anything. 

&#x200B;

i’m a bit of a hypocrite and sometimes i think about how i could’ve gotten in somewhere better but honestly that has not helped me. being upset about it. instead, i'm getting involved on campus and building myself up so i can create myself. i don't have to make this school define me but i can create experiences of my own. i think that's what's most important. 

&#x200B;

710,7hs45h,False,,110,Don't be like me,ApplyingToCollege,"I know early decision and early action decisions are coming out soon, and as a current college freshman who frequented this sub last year, I wanted to give some advice on how to handle the decisions and enjoy the coming years.

When I was in high school, I was a good student like most of you. I was consistently ranked top 10 in a class of 600 at a competitive high school in a competitive area. I scored 240 on the PSAT and 2400 on the SAT when I was in 10th grade, and decided to take the ACT later just to prove a point to a friend that I could ace all three. I participated in a bunch of math contests - I won some local awards and went to ARML and qualified for AIME for those who are familiar with the math competition circuit. I did environmental research with local town officials during three major research projects over the course of my high school career. I entered in the big science contests (Siemens, Intel, etc.), but didn't win anything beyond the local level. I did some other clubs (Science Olympiad, some honor societies), did some volunteer service, did a summer math program, and had a sport outside of school that I was good but not great at. 

Over the summer entering my senior year, I constantly checked this sub for advice on my essays, how to present myself on my applications, etc. I made a list of 13 colleges to apply to, ranging from guaranteed full scholarship safeties to some of the best colleges in the world. I kept reading here how top colleges were never a guarantee for anyone, but I was confident I could get in minus maybe one or two. I submitted all of my applications regular decision. I heard back from my 2 safeties (both outside of top 50 on US news) first. But then when the other decisions started coming in, the results weren't quite what I expected. In total, I was accepted at my two safeties, 3 that were in the 30 - 50 range on US News, and one top 20. I was denied from 4 (all top 10) and waitlisted at 3, including one state school ranked outside of the top 25. I was shocked, angry, upset, everything. I was expecting to maybe not get into the top ivies, but to be waitlisted at multiple colleges outside the top 15 was a shock.

For the coming months, I was bitter and resentful toward everyone. My best friend was accepted at MIT, his top choice, and instead of being happy for him, I was resentful that I had better stats but didn't get into schools of similar caliber. I eventually committed to a top 20 school, but felt that I was above it, that I deserved and was entitled to better. Everyone congratulated me, and I outwardly thanked them, but I was still bitter. I would spend my free time on the College Confidential threads, getting mad at the people who got into Harvard or Princeton or wherever with ""only"" 34's on the ACT or 3.8 GPAs, thinking that they didn't deserve it. 

When I got to college in August, I pretty much isolated myself from everyone else. Every time I would pass by a black kid, or hispanic kid, or athlete, my mind would immediately switch to a sense of anger, mad that they supposedly only got in because of the advantages in the admissions process. I didn't bother to go to any of my classes because I figured I'm so much smarter than everyone here that I could beat the curve without even trying. I pretty much just stayed by myself in my dorm room all day wishing I was somewhere else.

It wasn't until the first midterm grades started coming in that I realized I was being ridiculous. I was under-performing on tests and hadn't been handing in any work. I realized that I needed to change and finally, 10 weeks into the semester, I went to the medical center and got therapy for my issues. I finally started to realize that I was lucky to be at a prestigious school (even if it's not the most prestigious), and started to put more effort into classes and developing relationships with other students. Now, during finals week, I've been going to class and hanging out with people in my dorm and doing normal college stuff. But I can't help feeling like I missed out on almost an entire semester of positive experiences (and GPA points) just because I was stubborn and entitled.


So please try not to be like me. If you don't get into your dream school, or even any of your top choice colleges, it's not an indictment on you as a person or even as a student. Remember the top colleges get many more applications than they have space for. All the time you hear of kids getting into Harvard and not Brown or MIT and not Carnegie Mellon. With the exception of maybe a few handfuls of truly brilliant and incredibly accomplished students, no one is going to get in everywhere. But as long as you continue to work hard, you'll end up somewhere good. Every college has smart and talented students. Maybe some more than others, but no matter where you go, if you work hard and rise to the top, you'll have the same opportunities as everyone else, whether it be for graduate school or jobs or anything else (except for maybe at Goldman Sachs but they're a bunch of pretentious babies anyway). Assuming you applied to a range of colleges where you'll be happy attending, you'll be fine wherever you go. Don't let a few rejections ruin the experience for you.

All of my friends were on that path and pretty much everyone who was average at math or better at my school seemed to be on this path (yours could be different!)

I am a senior, and I am only in Pre-Calculus. Months ago I was really paranoid and asked both this sub and r/chanceme if I would be able to get into T20s without having been in calculus or even having the prerequisite for calculus; I got a resounding “no” from pretty much everyone. Whatever, I still applied and worked my ass off on my applications.

So months pass and just a few weeks ago, I get my acceptance to Vanderbilt. What???

I got comments from these subs telling me that even as a social studies major I wouldn’t be able to get in because I wasn’t on that path. I applied *STEM* and got in!! 

The school system likes to shit on us, and tell us how good we’ll be at math in the future and decide what path we’ll be on in High School as early as the 5th grade with no chance of mobility onto the upper path. I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the “dumb kids” path for the entire rest of my K-12 years. 

It CAN be done. I wanted desperately my junior year to make up for my lack of rigor in math by doing well on the ACT section, and I still ended up with a 28 max on the math section because my school only catered to kids on the “smart” path for ACT prep. However, I was still damn proud of myself for getting a 28 math while i was only in the middle of Algebra 2. I managed to get a 35 or a 36 on every other section and get a 34 SS, and even though I only scored a 28 on math 3 times in a row, the ad board at Vandy apparently still saw something in me that they thought would lead to me being an incredible STEM student. 

I will reiterate for the last time that IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. I’m sorry if you were deemed “dumb” in 5th grade and weren’t able to move into the “smart” path like I was, but if you show that you have kickass ECs, a passion for what you want to study, and a thirst to do well despite your circumstances, you will be OK!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fg1xme/psa_you_can_get_into_t20s_without_being_seen_as/,1742,or it’s largely chance so there will always be stories like this attempting to break the mold ,2020-03-09 21:09:57

What does all of this mean? It means that if you apply to the ivies/T20s, your intelligence and drive is reasonably likely to lead you to just as fulfilling and successful of a career as an ivy grad.

447,aa7hr3,False,,149,Does it ever strike anyone else that this entire process is completely and irrevocably fucked?,ApplyingToCollege,"Basically every college has an essay that boils down to ""Why do you want to go here?"" and I'm pretty sure we all feed them complete bullshit. The actual answers boil down to:

""This college is financially reasonable for me and of sufficient proximity/lack thereof (if you really just want to leave home) that it is convenient, and also you'll probably accept me.""

""This college is prestigious and I think I might have a shot.""

""Everyone needs a backup.""

""My parent(s) went here so you'll almost certainly accept me and I like the idea of it.""

""My dad bought you a building."" (for those asshats who can say that)

They must know, right? Most students are going to get a perfectly serviceable education pretty much anywhere. Barring post-graduate work and actual research, most colleges are going to be pretty much the same. Colleges are like people: everyone around them tells them they're special, and all those people are lying. Do they just pick based on whoever lies most eloquently? I don't mean to suggest we lie about the basic facts of our lives. No one would make up an extracurricular or fake a grade, because they'd get caught, but we definitely misrepresent ourselves to be way more invested in each *particular* college, when really we're just happy if we get accepted by *any* college we'd find acceptable. Why the hell do we grovel at their feet, when they are far more invested in us than we are in them? FFS, we get spammed with email and actual physical mail advertising to us. (Hint: We grovel because our parents are not-so-secretly completely fucking terrified that we might do worse than them, and if that happens, it means they're FAILURES AS PARENTS PANIC PANIC PANIC)

Also, the hell is up with letters of recommendation? My teachers have actual jobs. It is not part of their job to help me beg a college for admission. It is their job to teach me. Not to mention the quality BS that goes into recommendation letters, as well. Numerous teachers just keep form letters, then fill in names and adjectives.

Standardized tests, too, are a whole crock of shit. They're tests we pay to take from people who encourage our anxiety over them and then sell us test prep in order to profit from that same anxiety. We act as if they reflect the entirety of our self worth (at least until it comes time to show colleges our essays, at which point *they* become our self worth).

Just... for fuck's sake, we've created an educational system that puts people into so much debt that they spend their entire lives paying it off. We have *serious elected officials* whose platforms include programs specifically to deal with the debt incurred by buying one's way into the middle class (because that's what it is, make no mistake. If nothing else, the growing popularity of business majors should have keyed us all in to the fact that college hasn't been about education for a long time).

749,b73rci,False,,111,"AOs Can't Actually Detect ""Authenticity"" Or ""Passion"": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior",ApplyingToCollege,"(on a throwaway)

&#x200B;

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

&#x200B;

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

&#x200B;

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

&#x200B;

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

&#x200B;

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. **Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.** Sure, there are some exceptions.

&#x200B;

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.** (There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

&#x200B;

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some admissions counselors like u/admissionsmom (I think she's amazing, just wrong on this one aspect) say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

&#x200B;

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

&#x200B;
