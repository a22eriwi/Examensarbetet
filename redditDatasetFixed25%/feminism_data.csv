830,94i79k,False,,81,WHY SOME WOMEN AVOID GOING OUT LIKE IT IS THEIR JOB.,Feminism,"STORY TIME BECAUSE I AM ANGRY.

*****IF YOU ARE A ""NICE GUY"" WHO CLAIMS TO RESPECT WOMEN, BUT TURN AROUND AND CALL US ""BITCHES"" ""SLUTS"" ""FEMINAZI'S"" WHEN WE REFUSE YOUR ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL ADVANCES, THIS POST IS NOT FOR YOU. I, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR OPINIONS ON HOW WOMEN (AND MEN) ARE TREATED. WE ARE NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF.*****

I was at the bar earlier, walking back in from having a smoke, and some wife-beater-wearing-fuck-boy GRABS my waist, forcibly pulls me in, and demands that I kiss him. I looked at him and with a calm, but VERY stern voice, told him to let go of me, and to not touch me again. He was persistent, grabbing me with more force and continuing to demand that I kiss him.. 

He did not let go of me or stop grabbing me until I looked at his group of guy friends with a stare that said ""come get your fucking dog off of me"". One of them stepped in and told him to forget about it, they were leaving anyways. Only then did this asshole loosen his grip and walk away from me. 

WHY DO YOU RESPECT YOUR FRIEND TELLING YOU TO STOP MORE THAN YOU RESPECT A WOMAN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW TELLING YOU TO STOP? So I'm really angry.

Not once did I give even the slightest indication that he could touch me. I honestly didn't even notice his presence until he put his hands on me. I should have hit him square in the face right then and there, after I very clearly told him to take his hands off of me and he refused.

But that's the problem right? Us ""feminazis"" are overreacting. We are ""violent"". Our cries for help and our demands for personal space and respect, our screams of being uncomfortable, it is just us ""crazy bitches, sluts, whores"" getting what we deserve. 

This has turned into a drawn-out ramble, I am aware. But I think its very important. I guess the main message I want people to take away is, instead of saying ""NOT ALL MEN"" try saying ""THE MEN THAT ARE GIVING YOU A HARD TIME NEED TO BE STOPPED"". Once again, a very important PSA from yours truly.

ALSO, why am I being made to feel like I was in the wrong? Why am I made to feel like I should have brushed it off because he was drunk? Why am I trying to make excuses for HIS obscene and brash behavior? 

For far too long, men and women who have been harassed or abused in any way have felt the need to make excuses for their abusers behavior. ""They were drunk."" ""I started the argument."" ""They are only angry because they care so much."" 

THAT IS ENOUGH. NO MORE EXCUSES. Drunk guy at the bar isn't being held accountable for his actions? Then neither am I, tell your face to say hello to the curb üôÉ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/94i79k/why_some_women_avoid_going_out_like_it_is_their/,638,[removed] ,2018-08-04 10:27:58

935,9s9nub,False,,58,"I just watched ""Feminists"" on Netflix. It has completely changed how I see the world.",Feminism,"I am 25 years old. I am from Canada. I have always taken equality for granted. Within my living memory, I have perceived little to no inequality. I was not raised by a feminist. My mother was a strong, independent woman who was the breadwinner for our family. I always assumed that women's rights have been entrenched in society for a very long time. I don't know exactly how long ago I assumed that these rights were achieved, but I never really thought about it.

I just finished watching the Netflix documentary ""Feminists."" I don't even know what prompted me to press play. But oh boy, was it an eye-opener. The images of the rallies, the stories from women who had terrible experiences, and they're not even that old. It wasn't so long ago.

I had no idea how much these women had fought for. They built a better world for me, and I took it for granted. Some of them, I even knew of in some capacity, but nothing beyond the superficial surface of their work. What especially bothered me as I watched the documentary was the memories of my family making fun of Jane Fonda because of the time that she had done aerobics videos. I wonder if they knew about her contributions to furthering women's rights, or if they chose to just ignore this and reduce her to a ditzy actress, just in it for the money.

I cried a few times during the documentary. I want to reach out to these women and thank them for all they've done to make the world a better place for the next generations. It's so sad how people my age view feminism now; we don't fully grasp why it's necessary and so many people equate it with ""man-hating."" I myself am guilty of shying away from the term, preferring to say ""egalitarian"" when asked. From now on, I will be proud to say I am a feminist, and will dedicate time to learning about the history from which I benefit.

Edit: It's so upsetting. I saw a girl speak up about something revolting that happened to her and then this guy thought it was the right time to express other issues about men.

Edit:

This isn't an example because I saw this in a comment section on YouTube.

But anyways in a nutshell: Girl speaks up about sexual abuse, guy comments under her comment and comments statistics about mens issues which has nothing to do with her story. That's it. It was disrespectful. Good intentions or not just inconsiderate.

I did it because she wanted to finally call out the perpetrator but was afraid, so I offered to do it for her. It included a story about a teacher's failure to investigate the matter after she reported it.

After posting it, plenty of people who graduated at the school started reaching out to me about sexual harassment and bullying either done by or enabled by teachers. I've discovered this has been a long cycle of abuse, and I decided to contact someone from the school. My complaints have fallen on deaf ears, though. They just flat out told me that times have changed, the school wasn't the same as it used to be. And to be careful about posting about the school because I might get sued. 

I can't just ignore all these girls being sexually harassed by their teachers. Some of them have recently graduated and confirmed that this is still happening today. I want to fight for them but I'm also afraid to get into any legal trouble. (I live in the Philippines)

I've learned a bit about feminism growing up, but it wasn't until I began entering the world as my own, individual person, that I ever felt much of a connection to this so-called 'feminism'.

But then, I grew up. 
I entered the real world. 
I learned of injustices ranging from severe human rights violations, down to subtle differences in social acknowledgment.

I began hearing of atrocities happening around the world, while also becoming more and more aware of when people treat me differently than a male counterpart.

And, to be honest? I'm tired.
I'm tired of explaining why that joke just isn't funny.
I'm tired of explaining why his advances are inappropriate.
I'm tired of explaining why progress doesn't negate the fact that there's still work to be done.
I'm tired of keeping my composure during someone's inappropriate behavior.
I'm tired of justifying why bodily autonomy is so important to me.
I'm tired of holding my tongue while his eyes slide over my body, as if I'm a piece of meat being considered in a market.

I'm tired of explaining that, no, feminism isn't about hating men.
I'm tired of breaking down the need for feminism to someone who has no interest in actually hearing them.
I'm tired of having to demonstrate that feminists care about issues involving men as well. 
I'm tired of having to prove why my experience does, in fact, matter.

How do you know? 
Why don't you care? 
How can you justify that? 
What do you feel that you are owed by us?

If people wanted to argue that more young women turning to sex work for money Is a growing issue, I would be on board. A woman shouldn‚Äôt feel like selling her body is her only option. That would be oddly enough, an actual way to help women in need and protect teenage girls. Of course that‚Äôs not the case. None of these men want to help these women, none of these men would even consider donating to a women‚Äôs charity because they don‚Äôt think the oppression of women exist anymore. Societal views on women are enough to argue that we are not ‚Äúequal‚Äù and aren‚Äôt treated with the same respect as men. Just because women can legally ‚Äúdo whatever they want‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean women don‚Äôt face a significant amount of societal pressure for so many things it‚Äôs ridiculous. A woman can‚Äôt even own her own body without men putting their 2cents regarding it. 

For clarity, I‚Äôm speaking about the men that shame women for sex work. Apparently, a woman benefitting from her own body is so obscene that these men feel the need to retaliate and get angry at women they don‚Äôt even fucking know. News flash, just because you are attracted to a woman doesn‚Äôt mean her actions are of ANY importance to you. YOU.DO.NOT.OWN.HER. I‚Äôm sorry that a chick you would fuck in the right circumstances isn‚Äôt all what you hoped to be, go look at the other women you thirst for on a daily basis. You are not loyal to her, so why would she have loyalty towards you or any of the other men that follow her only because she‚Äôs hot?

Women are grown ass adults that can hold themselves accountable and know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. We don‚Äôt need men‚Äôs approval and I don‚Äôt know why these men react to Onlyfans as if we do.

Judging by social media, a lot of men have an issue with the use of the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô. They‚Äôre so quick to take the blame off of other men by pouting ‚Äúnot all men!‚Äù It‚Äôs as if they are purposely taking feminist/women out of context. Of course we aren‚Äôt talking about EVERY SINGLE man in existence. If certain men are willing to be offended by the general use of the word ‚Äúmen‚Äù, they should be willing to accept and admit the privileges they have as a man. If I say, ‚Äúmen created beauty standards for women‚Äù do not respond with ‚Äúnot all men!‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt make what I said any less of a problem and doesn‚Äôt generate hope for men because I‚Äôm not talking about the men who don‚Äôt perpetuate the problem.

Two men who sexually assaulted a female soldier in Korean army for ""being lesbian"" both separately have been found not guilty by the High Court for Armed Forces.

in  2010, a female soldier ""A"" was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Lieutenant Commander ""B"" and was made pregnant.

After she got an abortion, she told Commander ""A"" what happened, but instead, he sexually assaulted her as well. 

According to her, after she told ""B"" about her sexuality, he replied ""That's because you don't know about men. I'll teach you how it feels"" and sexually assaulted her.

Suffering from PTSD, she reported it in 2016 and the perpetrators were arrested last September.

 She pressed charges against them, in a first trial, ""B"" was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and ""A"" to 8 years.  But the HCAF overturned the first ruling, acquitting ""B"" today(Nov. 19. 2018). Commander ""A"" was already acquitted on Nov. 8.

Because you have to fight against 'boys will be boys', but what does that mean except males being a form of predators? ",2019-07-09 11:17:48

She was allegedly being held as a sex slave at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who was a friend of Trump's and is a convicted pedophile with a preference for young girls. After the alleged attack from Trump ended, the girl says Epstein proceeded to rape her. An employee of Epstein's witnessed the rape and corroborates the survivor's story. Trump has been accused of a violent rape before by his ex-wife Ivana Trump, and of attempted rape by a former business colleague.

The mainstream media hasn't reported on this lawsuit, reminiscent of the underreporting of the Cosby rape allegations for over a decade. Another sign that the media reflects the interests of the wealthy and powerful. Infuriating.
