275,fnr5fc,False,Success/Cheers,204,It took a pandemic,povertyfinance,Well last month we were facing eviction and having an impossible time finding an affordable apartment. Then COVID shut down happened and everyone left my town. Broke leases and moved back home when school canceled. Then apartments got cheaper and I got a bigger apartment than I currently have in an affordable price range! We used our tax return to pay off our previous eviction. The Governor canceled all evictions so we are able to finish our lease and we can pay off the money we owe in back rent instead. The apartment isn't going to file anymore. Now we wont have any negative marks on our credit. We still have money to get a (new to me) bigger couch too a benefit of school closing is students dont move with their stuff.

I hope my title is not misleading. i tried to best explain the concept in 1 sentence, but hour from now i will possible realize an error or un-intentional mis-representation of the issue. So apologies if that turns out to be the case.  

Listen to the episode, it discusses how people in certain types of stress, like financial stress essentially justify purchases without realizing it is a bad idea.  

This can even effect those of us with plenty of money. It is about the mental blocks we create when we feel a scarcity in some way. so this is also a good listen for people in all kinds of situations even the middle class and wealthy. It just happens to focus on financial scarcity.  

Anyways, even if it does not directly solve an issue, i always find it good to understand how our minds work, and then maybe we can catch ourselves when and if we go into these mental states.  

If only to stop us at checkout and make us think ""Hey, wait. Am i doing that mental Justification and not actually making a good choice right now?""

DISCLAIMER: This is hidden brain not some media news show trying to tell you how to think and live. Hidden Brain tends to be an extremely open minded podcast. It simply discusses studies and observations. It is not always delivering absolute facts. Sometimes it is just debating a topic and has no final conclusion. In fact it often leaves many things up in the air and just gives you various sides of the topic to think about.  I am not saying this is some absolute fact and neither are they. It is just an interesting thing to think about and possibly watch out for. If it can help 1 person and applies to no one else.

989,ehp010,False,,183,Poverty Finance essentials,povertyfinance,"I did a top posts of all time search looking for a few good pieces of PF advice. I figure I would start a conversation today regarding some PF essentials. Hopefully this thread will help lay a good foundation to start (or continue) our journey towards financial freedom.  

Things that I learned from this sub and have implemented:

1. Spend less: Pretty obvious but you would be surprised how much spending we do when we are not conscious of spending money. 

2. Make a budget and stick to it: I count calories in order to lose weight on a weekly basis. I applied the same concept to spending money. I can only spend X amount on groceries, X amount at a coffee shop, X amount when I go out, etc. 

3. Get on a plan to pay off debt: Paying credit card debt can take some months, even years, but the more CC debt you pay down (and not add too) the more the debt will decrease. If you stick to a payment plan and are disciplined it is just a matter of time before your cards are paid off. Also, if you have school loan debt seek out forgiveness options. Thanks to this sub I was able to get on a 10-year plan to have my debt forgiven. 

4. Find a low-cost lifestyle: Nights out in the club and checking out the new movie releases every week can crush a budget. Some cheaper options for entertainment I‚Äôve enjoyed include reading at the library (or coffee shop), writing on a blog (free on WordPress), playing fighting games (high cost of entry but once established it is ‚Äúfree‚Äù to play and improve), and not drinking alcohol.

5. Get in shape: I feel it is easier to deal with being poor if you are shredded compared to if you are in bad health. Working out has really helped me with the day to day stress of dealing with denying myself in an effort to save more money. Also, make sure you are getting an adequate amount of sleep. If you suffer from insomnia or struggle to sleep look into remedies (meditation, consistent bed time, exercise, journaling). 

Any other pieces of wisdom will be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/ehp010/poverty_finance_essentials/,719,"These are all great ideas! I catch up with friends at their house every couple of weeks for drinks and just bring my own alcohol, which I usually limit to a couple of beers.

560,fmtcj1,False,Success/Cheers,69,It paid off.,povertyfinance,"It finally paid off.

Foregoing the fun Friday nights.

Not spending my salary on a new vehicle.

It all paid off.

Me and my girlfriend can afford our normal lifestyle for a year. No matter what happens. A year. I haven't been laid off, but if it does happen we're okay. I'm so proud of us, even though it took sacrifice. We're not scrambling to figure out ""what next?"", because we budgeted and planned for this.

*EDIT* Below I have included financial information. A recent job change has possibly made me not ""poverty"" level anymore. If so, I will remove my post. I dont want this to be a ""pat me on the back"", and would like to share how we have prepped for the ""apocalypse"".

Financial Information:
Job: Inside sales. (27K base, extra 13K if quota is reached)

Previous Employment: Truck unloader

Education: Bachelor's in Business Administration (cheapest state school I could find. Had one scholarship).

Current Debt: 16.5K (All Student Loans).

Rent $736 a month

All Bills: Approx. $200 a month. The season is a factor.

How we did it:
Canned foods, Intermittent fasting to put us at 2 meals max. Paid off my vehicle with double employment. Cheap meals where leftovers gave us 2-3 meals a week. Light prepping in the pantry, so we wouldn't have to shop if something kept us in. MOST IMPORTANT: Odd Jobs. I made some very decent money on ranches, and farms. Hard work but it paid. In some cases I lived on the ranch, did work, left for my evening job, then woke up to do it again. It was how I paid for my car, and a chunk of my education.

573,ale8y6,False,,286,A Warning About TurboTax,povertyfinance,"I went to file my taxes yesterday the same way I have done for several years, with the TurboTax free file. I noticed a few things that I thought I'd share: 

When I got to the section for the child and dependent care credit, the software kept telling me that I don't qualify. I knew that I still qualified for the credit so I googled it. Turns out, when you enter your W2 at the beginning for you and your spouse, it defaults both of them to one persons name (so it appeared that I made too much money for the credit, while my husband had no income). As soon as I went back and assigned one of the W2 to my husband I qualified for the credit, which boosted my refund by $600. 

Because I filed for a specific credit, TT software said I needed to pay the $39.99 as the free software didn't cover one of the forms I'd need done to file. I was already finished by this point and was getting money back so I figured ok, I'll pay it, and that I will just file by hand next year. TT gave me the option to pay this fee out of my refund, saying something like ""no need to reach for your wallet, we can just take this from your refund"". Nowhere on this page did it indicate that there would be a fee to do so. When I was completely done and ready to file, TT asked me to consent to the charges and hit submit. I noticed that the fees suddenly went from $39.99 to 79.99 and I didn't understand why until I searched the internet and found dozens of complaints from last year. Apparently TT is charging an extra $39.99 in order for them to take the original fee from your return with very little explanation and quite deceptive language on their website. I paid the original fee with my credit card and filed without issue. 

I know this is a bit strange and I am not trying to blast TT in general, but I do think it is fair that people be aware of these fees and quirks of the software. Hope this helps someone! 



EDIT: WOW Silver! Thank you kind stranger! 

This is by far my biggest post on Reddit! I've compiled some of the resources suggested but it appears that the most popular free tax filing this year is Credit Karma.

Shortly after the pandemic, my leaseholder went awol. Won't answer phones, text messages, emails, nothing.

Today the property owner came, demanding his back rent. Despite explaining the situation, showing him proof, and practically begging for time, the man was adamant that we had to pay if we wanted to stay here.

Since none of us can come up with $6000 and I'm still looking for steady work, we will all likely be kicked out.

The other three have somewhere else to go. I don't. So for me, it's back to the shelter.

one of my clients has a real estate attorney in my inbox giving me some useful information. Turns out, even if there wasn't a pandemic, the landlord is going to have a Hard time evicting us.

When you eat out, order water to drink. I love this tip, because nobody thinks your doing it to be cheap, they think your doing it to be healthy. BONUS: It is a healthier choice.  

Drink water at home too. Prices aren't nearly as bad for a soft drink or glass of wine when you buy for home, but they are still a lot more than water.  Invest in a filter of some type. I'm using a brita pitcher until I can install a filtration system. Shoot, depending on where you live you might be totally fine with tap water.

You likely don't have a $1,000 emergency fund, and you're close to the worst case scenario. I know it, I've lived it, and I want to help as many people as possible get out of it.

So, what are you to do in this situation? How can you get through all of this when you‚Äôre only bringing home around $600 every two weeks? The answer a lot of people will get when they are honest with themselves is that sacrifices will have to be made. Whether it‚Äôs cable TV, the new iPhone, or your free time, if you are in this situation where you have this little cash coming in AND you have debt, you probably are either deluding yourself that if you keep on the treadmill things will get better, but the fact is that interest every month when you don‚Äôt pay off your cards is speeding that treadmill up, and eventually you‚Äôll fall off.  An overdraft or two, and suddenly you‚Äôre eyeing a payday loan place just to solve the problem. Stop. Now. If you‚Äôre in this situation, let‚Äôs back up the cardiac arrest, take a few deep breaths and give you a rational plan to deal with this:

Gather up all your monthly bills and pay stubs, pull up your online banking, too.

Look at what you spend your money on, and decide what you want to cut.

**Keep cutting until your bills and expenses are less than your take home pay.**

Next, make calls to all of your credit card companies, and ask for lower interest rates.

Add up all of your minimum monthly payments and monthly recurring bills.

Open a new checking account, preferably without a debit card.

Set up your direct deposit to go to two accounts: one for half the amount you got in step 5, and one for the remainder.

You‚Äôve now built a self-funding small emergency fund.

The remaining money should cover your expenses (groceries, gas, etc).

At the end of every two weeks, the night before payday, take any remaining money, and pay it on your highest interest account. You‚Äôll pay down your debt a little faster and start to see some progress.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, and you‚Äôre still having some trouble making ends meet, go back to step two, and be honest with yourself.  Cutting cable TV alone will save you between 600 and 1200 a year. Cutting other things should be on the table.

616,8mjqo1,False,,301,"I make an extra $1,000 or more every month with beer money sites AMA!",povertyfinance,"Hey everyone. I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/?ref=share&ref_source=link) a few weeks back detailing how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through the use of beermoney sites. Beermoney is, according to Urban Dictionary, ""Extra money for non-essential payments, available for spending on luxuries, hobbies, or a fresh pint of your favorite draft."" I use this definition, because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will explain why I chose this as a way to make money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

Since getting married, I have needed extra money for various bills and saving for things we wanted (down payment on a home). Essentially, I was just tired of barely scraping by every month after tax and savings. Because of this, I have been investing more time in all of these sites over the last 6 or 7 months and the cash flow has been steadily increasing as time goes on. I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner (I am 3 months ahead on payments), have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates, and have built my emergency fund to six months of bills. I am now also able to wake up and see that money came in while I slept. It has been rad.

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix, rather than having to listen to another boss everyday, worry about getting fired, and deal with more people. This works better for my temperament and my preferences. 

The tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

921,ae1qmm,False,,243,"Remember a few months ago when someone posted that you can make quick cash by selling plasma? Well, I did it and here's how it went.",povertyfinance,"**TL;DR:** Donating plasma is real - it's legit.  It takes some time out of your day, but is otherwise low-effort.

A few months ago (maybe over the summer?) someone posted that selling plasma could get you some quick cash.  Ever since then I've been meaning to do it, but kept putting it off.  Finally, I decided that the new year was a great time to stop procrastinating.

The first thing I did was a quick internet search to find out which facilities were near me.  There are two in my area: CSL and B Positive.  I didn't have a lot to go on, so I randommly chose B Positive.  It's a little bit far from my house, but very close to work so I thought that might be convenient.

I went to the B Positive website and read all the FAQs and informational pages.  I'm glad I did because there's some paperwork you have to bring with you.  You will need: a photo ID, your social security card, and proof of address.  I couldn't find my SS card, but according to the website you can also bring your W2 or 1040.  I brought my 1040 and had no problems.

The website said that first time donations take about 2.5 hours.  I arrived at the facility at 9:30 am on Saturday morning.  I needed to leave by 12:30, so I thought that would be pleny of time.

When I got there, the place was cclean and brightly lit.  The other clients were a bit rough around the edges, but I don't know what I expected - a bunch of brain surgeons and fighter pilots?  Anyway, the staff was super nice.  The front desk lady looked at my ID/paperwork and set me up as a donor.  You have to have your fingerprints taken electronically and they take your picture.  

Next you go to a computer kiosk where you log in via a finger scanner (hence the need for fingerprints) and your DOB. You have to answer a series of 52 questions.  If you've ever donated blood, the questions are really similar.  If you've ever had sex with someone who had sex with someone who had sex for drugs, in France, with Ebola while getting a tattoo with a dirty needle, you can stop reading now because they're going to reject you.

After I answered the 52 questions, I waited to be called for my physical.  This is the part where I didn't plan ahead.  It took a loooong time.  It was a busy time of day, and I waited like an hour.  Finally, I realized I wouldn't be able to finish before my 12:30 deadline, so I had to leave.  I did come back later in the afternoon, though, and it went much quicker.

So, when I came back I had to answer the 52 questions again at the kiosk, and then waited a much shorter time to be called.  My ""physician or physician's substitute"" took me to a private exam room and did the usual weight, blood pressure, temperature, etc.  She did a finger prick and had to get a tiny tube of blood to check my iron, protein, and something else I can't remember.  She asked a million questions, a lot of them repeats of the 52 kiosk questions.  She marked my finger with some invisible blacklight ink, and explained that the other place, CSL, marks a different finger - so they'll know if you're trying to double-donate.  She checked my arms for ""bruising"" (aka track marks), checked my eye dialation, felt my stomach, and asked my favorite question - ""Do you want a snack?""  Well heck yeah!  So I got some pretzles and a Powerade.  Then I had to listen to some guy read 23 statements about the process of donating and answer ""Yes"" that I understood.  That part made me feel good because I know some of the other clients are probably not the strongest readers, and by listening to the information it was assured that everyone had access to it.

Before I left that room, the physical lady gave me my Visa card and explained how to set it up and everything.  **HERE'S THE BEST PART:** they pay you according to how much you weigh and fat people get more!!!  My time has finally come!

FINALLY, I got to go back to the donation floor.  It's a giant room with rows of recliner-ish chairs.  They kind of reminded me of those zero-gravity lawn chairs you can get.  The chairs each had a USB port and a plug, so you could use your laptop or charge your phone.  There were also big screens throughout the room in case you wanted to watch TV.  I'd say there were about 40 seats?  The whole thing looked very dystopian, but very clean and legit.

I was directed to a specific seat and the person in charge of that section came over and prepped me for donation.  They verify your name and DOB.  YOu can choose which arm you wan to use - I gave from my left the first time.  They rub you down with iodine and then jab you with the needle.  It was a slight pinch, but not painful at all.  Then they start the machine running.  You have a blood pressure cuff on and while the cuff is tight you're supposed to squeeze and release your fist - that's when the blood is coming out.  When the cuff loosens, you don't have to squeeze any more - that's when the leftovers are getting put back in.  The machine cycles through the whole time you're hooked up.  Once you're done, the person removes the needle and puts some gauze on the site (at my place they wrap it liek a hundred times with bright tape, so if you like attention you can definitely get some!)  The they make you sit up for a few minutes and drink another Powerade.  Finally they let you get up and leave.  The donation part probably took an hour all together on my first try.

From start to finish the staff was **incredibly** nice. 
 Afterwards I felt perfectly fine.  I did drink more water as per the instructions, but didn't have any problems.  Later that night I checked the Visa card balance and sure enough there was 50 buckaroos on it!

That was all on Saturday.  Today I went for my second donation after work.  I went straight to the 52-question kiosk and that checks you in.  Your name appears on a big screen in the waiting area - like an arrivals board at the airport.  I didn't wait long at all, then went back for a mini-health screening (weight, temp, blood pressure, finger prick, check your fingers with a blacklight and re-mark you.)  From there I went to the donation floor and got hooked up.  Today it actually took 2 hours from start to finish, but I don't think that's typical and I'm pretty sure it was my fault.  I think I moved my arm and jostled the needle so I was less ""flowy.""  People who came in after me finished before me.  My best estimate is that you can probably get in and out in a little over an hour.

All in all, whoever wrote that original post was right - donating plasma is easy and you get cash money. AND you're helping someone who really depends on it.  There was a poster in the donation room that said it took 1200 donations per year to treat *one* patient with hemophilia.  That's crazy!

167,9o5zcn,False,,454,"Do not underestimate the effect of working a few extra hours a week. Every dollar of high interest debt you pay now will save roughly two dollars in the long run. 10-12 hours extra a week can pay off $10000 in one year by eliminating $5000 in future interest, or take nearly a year off your mortgage",povertyfinance,"Ever wonder if taking a second job or extra shifts is really worth it? Wonder if your spouse working a light job will really help? 

If you have high interest debt like credit cards, the answer is absolutely yes! 

At the average credit card rate of 15% or higher, every dollar you pay now saves 2 dollars by the time you pay it off. So that extra $7.75 or $10 per hour becomes $15.50 or $20 per hour when you take into effect how much it saves you when you put it towards paying off that high interest debt. 

Even if you don't have high interest debt and you have a decent mortgage, over the life of a 20 or 30 year mortgage you pay nearly $2 for every dollar you took out. 

So paying an extra $5000 a year up front from a 10 hour a week second job will end up saving you nearly $10,000, or almost a year of payments for every year you work the second job.

If you work an extra 10 hours a week for 10 years and put that towards the average mortgage, it will save you 10 years of payments for the equivalent of only 2.5 years of full time work. 

So yes, if you work a little extra and put that towards your debt, you can dramatically improve your debt situation and free up years of your life in the future.

152,er1qws,False,,835,Why you need to let poor people buy coffee in peace,povertyfinance,"I somehow found myself in another ""Why don't you just cut unnecessary spending?"" spiral, so I've decided to do some math that I and anyone else can copy and paste as needed.

&#x200B;

Why don't you stop buying Starbucks/Netflix/beer/movie tickets/whatever occasional purchase you use to feel a little better? Won't that fix your financial situation? Why is the snack/trinket/experience worth more?

Let me lead with this: Money has no intrinsic value. You avoid spending money on one thing so that you can spend it on another. That's the reason. You can choose to not spend as much on one thing so that you can pay for something else. If the savings on one thing are not enough to purchase the other thing, it makes no sense to not get the enjoyable thing that you can afford.

The example:

Let's say you want to buy a car. You can get a nice, new car for $25k. We're ignoring trade in value or savings for a down payment in these calculations because poor people don't tend to have significant equity \[update: not because you are poor in this scenario but because we're going to work from zero with our numbers\]. We're starting from the bottom. The average interest rate for a new car loan in the US is 4.21%. This would make your payments $463/month.

Now, let's say that you don't want to get that car loan. You want to avoid that pesky interest rate. It just doesn't make financial sense, right? Instead you opt to ride public transit until you can save up enough for the car. The average cost of a transit pass in the US is $67/month. That's $396 less than the car payment, so that's $396/month out of your transportation budget that you can tuck away.

It will take you **over five years to afford that car**.

That is five years of only going where the buses run while the buses are running. That is five years of dealing with other people's smells and sounds. That is five years of walking to and from transit stops.

This is a best case scenario. What if you don't live in a city with adequate transit? What if it's more expensive in your city? What if you work overnight, and the buses don't go in the direction you need at the times you need them to? What if a drunk person pukes or pees on you? Because that happens.

Given the choice, many of us would just pay the extra to commute in clean privacy for those five years. It's worth it to be able to go where you want when you want. The benefits would outweigh the costs, as evidenced by the number of Americans with auto loans.

**The only other way to compress that timeline is to be able to increase your transportation budget.**

This is why broke people buy lattes instead of investing. It's because if you bought a frappuccino every day, it would take **nine and a half years** to spend the equivalent of a 7% down payment on a $250k house. It would take **almost four years** even for a $100k house.

**You cannot nickel and dime your way out of poverty.**

If you wouldn't sit in someone else's urine stains for five years, leave the poor person buying an avocado alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:  Yikes. Where do I begin?

I thought that the first paragraph explained my purpose clearly enough, but this is a scenario meant to explain a certain type of opportunity cost to someone living above a certain standard. Imaginary scenario guy is obviously not that hard up. I'm thinking it was a certain line that confused people, and I've edited it accordingly.

The daily frappuccino example is a theoretical maximum pulled from a common trope of ""financial advice"" columns. No broke person is buying one every day, but even if they were, that's the absolute most they could save. No, that number isn't nothing, but that's an imaginary peak. The point is that it's not the coffee that's keeping people out of escrow.

But look what people did.

They fought tooth and nail to explain why an imaginary person with the space in their budget should not buy something they want. I've been accused of making up interest rates, never having ridden a bus, never having seen a homeless person \[projection much?\], etc. All my numbers were pulled from national averages compiled in the last year. Some of the numbers were surprising enough to be in headlines. The pee scenario? Pulled from a true story. The struggles of public transit? From my own experience in my city. I've been to cities with beautiful transit that could easily replace a car, but for myself and many other Americans that's just not a realistic situation.

I was just trying to give people a tool to make a point. That point is that it's not anyone's business to police how somebody else makes their way through a long term problem. (And for a lot of people poverty isn't long term but actually permanent. It's just a fact that many people die in poverty. I'm not being pessimistic. It's a statistic.)

If I might get something in ten years, it's up to me to decide whether that's worth chipping away at the quality of the days in between. It's not anyone else's job to pass judgement on that decision.

847,88rhfp,False,,129,Can we ban the suggestion of giving up your children?,povertyfinance,"This is something I saw and even heard in PF, but hoped not to find here. Alas, I've seen one outright suggestion and one allusion already this morning. While I admit that truthfully giving up your child/ren would likely improve your financial situation, people making these suggestions are either not giving this suggestion enough thought or simply making a political point. There are a plethora of legitimate reasons not to consider this option. Medical condition with genetic factors are most likely to be seen and recognized by biological family members, for example. Different studies show that adopted children are frequently less favored than natural children. Older children are less likely to be adopted and more likely to be placed in foster care, which is a vipers nest of its own. Culturally parents who give up their children may be shamed, even by their family and essential support networks. The list goes on and on. No one knows the exact circumstances of someone's parenthood and their decisions to keep or give up their child. This suggestion is often cruel, and almost always pointless.

Edit: I've been up all night and have an Easter Egg hunt to do before I can sleep. Ultimately the point I'm making is that this suggestion is trolling, regardless of the commenters actual intent. Most people who've been around PF for a while have seen this argument before and it plays out the same way every time. It hurts and angers people and accomplishes nothing. It should be considered trolling and gotten rid of when seen. If you have a legitimate reason why we shouldn't push the mods for this, please say so.

Edit 2: Oh, also, we all know that at least like...half the people who say this stuff are just doing it to take a jab at ""poor people having too many kids and living off the system."" It's a political statement made in such a way they think they can get away with it. That's already against the rules.

I guess we just need to examine what is one's true motivations when being on this subreddit. Are we trying to survive or flourish?

I don't say this for political value, I say it because think about the financial commitment (which is one of the main conversational foundations of this subreddit). Your reasons for not giving up children are all reasons to keep this financial burden and therefore not really trying to flourish and live financially. 

I honestly cannot see how one can try and live financially responsible and not consider adoption an option. 

I have a $230 a month car payment, plus $160 in car insurance. If I gave up my car, that's $390 I could be saving. People will shame me for being poor, but screw em.

They are trained in high pressure sales like a car dealership and put profits over health.",povertyfinance,"[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/)

This article sums it up pretty well but I'd also like to share my personal experience. A little background information: I'm 21 and due to not having dental insurance haven't seen a dentist since I was 19. My teeth are in pretty good shape and I have no major pain / visible issues. I only wanted to see a dentist due to the amount of time it's been and paranoia that I may need dental work due to this. I went to Aspen Dental because they offered a free exam and advertised $80 cleanings.

They got me checked in and after a short wait took some X-Rays of my teeth. I waited for a bit more and they got me in the chair where a dental hygienist reviewed my X-Rays and looked in my mouth briefly. When I say briefly I mean she examined my mouth and X-Rays for less than 2 minutes. I'm not a professional but it seems like you would want to do a more thorough examination. She claimed that I ""almost had"" periodontal disease and showed me on the X-Ray where I had allegedly developed deposits that lead to this. I asked her to show me my other teeth and to my untrained eye there was no visible difference and she wasn't able to show me any difference between my ""healthy"" teeth and my ""diseased"" teeth. Though I believed her as I am again, not an expert but I was skeptical as I have brushed my teeth twice a day for as long as I can remember and regularly use mouthwash and floss. I don't smoke or do anything that puts me at risk for disease, but again, I am no expert, so I took this all as truth.  She prescribed scaling and a follow up cleaning for this.

I waited a bit more and the dentist came in and did another very quick examination. The first thing he said is that I should get braces because I have an overbite. I told the dentist that I have had braces and wore my retainer exactly as prescribed and that I used to have a severe overbite and the braces corrected it. He immediately changed his tune and said that I should get braces because my wisdom teeth are going to cause crowding. (This didn't make sense but again, he's the dentist). He also said I need to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, and get 1 filling.

They then took me to the finance office, where they handed me a ""treatment plan"" for $2,545. I about passed out. I looked at some of the items on the bill. $135 for a toothbrush, $45 for a ""Listerine rinse"" (mouthwash), $87 for a problem related exam prior to the extractions, $450 for each tooth extraction, $16 x4 for each quadrant of the mouth for ""oral irrigation"" (pressurized water). And other absurd charges. I told them upfront that I couldn't afford this, and she offered me financing options, with 48 MONTH and 60 MONTH loan terms. With a 15.99% APR!!!! They wanted me to take the same loan term with a higher interest rate than I do on my *brand new car* . Or a 12 months deferred interest option with *28.99%* APR.

The woman was trying really hard to pressure me into agreeing to one of these finance options for procedures I wasn't even sure I needed. She said all she needed was a signature. She kept claiming it was just permission to schedule the appointment even though the terms on the document were clearly for a credit check. They wanted me to be paying $72/mo for 5 years to get all of this done. My wisdom teeth aren't causing me any pain, grew in straight and in their entirety, and aren't even touching any of my other teeth. A quick google search of the symptoms of periodontal disease showed that I don't have any of the signs, and I certainly don't need a $135 toothbrush. I want to emphasize there's a chance that they are right as I'm no expert, but this is still absurd, even more so if they are trumping up the procedures I need (there is evidence to prove this company does this). She just wanted me to sign the form and they kept trying to disguise it as something besides a credit check.

I worked at a car dealership for two weeks and quit because of how disgusting it felt to take advantage of people and I can assure you they were using the same tactics that car salesmen use.

The sad part is that I didn't get the worst of it, if you read the article I posted above, Aspen Dental has a history of recommending extractions and other procedures when they aren't needed. I'm not saying this is my case because I recognize that I am not a dental expert in any capacity and I don't have the ability to diagnose these things, and I recognize that I may very well need all of this, but these ridiculous charges and insane financing options are predatory and disgusting.

Please avoid companies like this if you can, it's really hard to get dental care in the US without insurance and I'm still assessing my options. These corporations are the source of most dental complaints and the regulations for them are VERY LOOSE, they are not held to the same standards as your family dentists and reports say that many dentists for Aspen and other corporations are unqualified and perform poorly. They bait you with the free exams and try to convince you to pay for absurd amounts of work. These aren't people you want working on your teeth.

Obviously for those with lower credit scores that may be quite a significant bump down if you were to lose 20-30 points. Not saying that you will, but it may be worth calculating. 

The way loan consolidation works for credit reporting is simple. The old accounts are closed and a new one is opened (consolidated account). Stinks, but I essentially lost 50 years of ‚Äòaverage age‚Äô in one day when I consolidated (5 loans each with a 10 year history)!

There are a lot of free sites to get full credit reports now. I recommend getting one report from each reporting bureau at least once a year:
- Equifax
- Experian
- TransUnion

Be careful using certain sites, a lot claim to be free but a lot of them also charge or ask for credit cards. By law, everyone is entitled to one free report from each Bureau per year. 
One of my favorite free sites is Annual Credit Report. 
[AnnualCreditReport](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) 

Once you have a report you should be able to see all your accounts listed, see their age, and calculate your Age of Credit History. Then remove those accounts you would be consolidating and add in a new account with age of 1 month and you should be able to get an approximation of your new ‚ÄòAge of Credit History‚Äô. 

For anyone interested in consistently checking their credit scores and details throughout the year on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, I recommend Credit Karma. Great site with a wonderful app as well. 
[Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) 

At Credit Karma this is free viewing of your scores and details whenever you want. You will see two bureaus (TransUnion and Equifax) where you can click onto the details to see the following (with red/yellow/green highlights throughout which is extremely helpful):

1.) Credit Score

2.) Credit Factors 
- Credit card utilization 
- Derogatory marks
- Total Accounts
- Payment History
- Age of Credit History
- Hard Inquiries

3.) Credit changes 

4.) View full credit report (this may be similar to the Annual Credit Report site I listed above, I honestly haven‚Äôt looked into this). 

For most category / subcategory above you can click on the details to see where in the red/yellow/green scale you fall, and what type of impact that particular metric has on your credit score (low/medium/high). It will show the ranges for that particular metric in red/yellow/green so that you can see what would make you jump up or fall down into another category. 

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to provide some details and free info to everyone to help with any decisions related to consolidating loans or just credit scores and oversight into them!

Have a great day redditors! ",2018-08-29 13:50:51
514,alpzqd,False,,36,I know it's a small victory but I haven't touched my savings during this year's winter slowdown at work,povertyfinance,"Winter is hard for landscapers. Work dries up, and the ground doesn't. Even when you have work to do, the ground is either too frozen or too muddy. You go from weekly overtime to on call. Last week I worked 10 hours.

In the Dave Ramsey typology of spenders/savers and nerds/free spirits I am both a nerd (love to budget, every penny has a job) and a spender. So in past years when the lean times came I would incrementally wipe out my savings to maintain the same way of life, defeating the purpose of my obsessive budgeting. 

This year I decided - here's a radical fucking idea - to change my lifestyle in response to a change in income.

I have a beautiful partner, a tiny kitty üò∫, a full tank of gas, food in the fridge, $28 of ""allowance"" (grocery) money until next Wednesday, bills paid through 2/15 (through 2/27 as of next paycheck), and most importantly my untouched savings. I have books to read and people to have over for dinner instead of going out. I'm still putting the same percentage of my income towards savings and debt. Just yesterday I put a deposit towards a secured credit card (my first CC ever, at 29yo lol) to start trying to boost my ~~""I love debt"" score~~ credit score.

Instead of SAVING as the goal.... my new goal is to not buy things I do not need.

I started with simply RETURNING all of the dumb shit I did not need or use. Or bought thinking I might need or use something... that turns out... I neither needed nor used.

Hardware store: $63+ back -- I planned to grill this summer. I swear I made elaborate plans. I bought a mini grill for $58. And... I HAVE NOT USED IT IN THE 3 WEEKS SINCE I GOT IT. That went back to the store.

Grocery Store: $27 back. Yes, I did return the 42 oz of high-heat grill oil I bought a week back thinking I would grill. I HAVE NOT GRILLED. Returned!  Alongside the long grill tongs.. I did not need either of these things. So i returned them.

Hulu: ~$48 - How did I end up paying $15.99 for this? I cancelled my subscription, emailed customer service, and they refunded the last 3 mos of charges. I have not logged in for that pong. Thanks Hulu.

Netflix: $20. Not as generous, but you know what? I'm happy they refunded 2 mos of charges for something I wasnt fucking using at all when they could have chosen not to.

Was it a smidge embarassing to return an unopened walnut oil bottle to the grocery? A little. But not embarrassing enough to justify not getting my $16 back from this gentrified grease.

You know what's a lot more embarassing? Being $16 short on rent because I was too proud to return some shit I didn't need.

That's my brokeass thought.

&#x200B;

I can't begin to describe what I'm feeling right now. Relief, joy, a drained bank account, but overall happy.

I just submitted the final payment on two of my cards and $450 on the last one, of which I still have a remaining balance of $166. It's still a decent amount of money but it's nothing another paycheck can't fix. But I'm not totally debt-free, I didn't post this in my original post, but I do owe some money to my mom ($1,500 for helping me get back into college, I kept putting it off because I didn't have the funds, nor the saving habits I have now. She agreed to pay for the first quarter on the stipulation that I pay her back and do well in school. Grades are good, just have to pay her back) as well as my brother ($300 for driving me around to the dog sitting gigs) and on the upside, I'll have my own car to drive myself very very soon so I won't have to rely on him anymore. 

&#x200B;

I've set all my cards on auto-pay, with notifications if I go over a set amount (well below my 30% utilization)  the banks will text me about it. 

&#x200B;

To celebrate I'm gonna go out with friends for dinner, and then on Saturday I'm going on a 3 day trip with my boyfriend until Tuesday, gonna relax and unwind and wait for the next paycheck (which will be larger considering one week I worked 41 hours when I was only scheduled for 28.)

Living below the poverty level is hard, but I feel really blessed in some ways, so I wanted to share some things I'm thankful for and let some of you share yours.

1. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - even though the government keeps trying to take these life-saving programs away from us, they haven't yet. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have the blessing of these programs to enable me to have a place to live and health care. 
2. SNAP - Even though I don't eat like a queen, I eat well, and being on SNAP has made me much more conscious of how I spend my food dollars. I don't eat as much junk food, and I'm the queen of stretching a small amount of meat and veggies into a 3-day meal that is also healthy. Knowing that no matter what, I'm going to have food every month is such a blessing to me.
3. My apartment - When I was looking for a new place to live, I thought I'd never find anything I could afford. I can't even remember how I found this place, but I'm so happy I did. Not only do I have a really nice apartment for the money, but there is a courtyard and space outside where I'm allowed to garden. Management is awesome, and my rent only goes up about $10 a year. This place has been such a blessing!
4. My health - while I'm older and have a few health issues, I'm still able to do most things for myself and be independent. Without a car, I walk to a lot of places and really enjoy it. I'm still able to enjoy my gardening, although on a much smaller scale. My lupus is now ""inactive,"" so I must be doing something right.
5. Giving people - I've gotten so much help from loving, giving people. They've given me everything from clothes, food, and furniture to free plants for my garden. I owe so much to the generosity of others. It's truly a blessing.
6. Reddit - I have met so many wonderful, caring, loving people on Reddit; people who are willing to give of what little they have to help other people in need.

Planet fitness is my personal favorite because they‚Äôre often 24/7 so you can do this at times with lower traffic and they also serve pizza and bagels at times. 

Also: if you‚Äôre struggling with finding a job and need one immediately, look into pizzerias or local family owned businesses. A lot of them pay under the table, have a high turnover rate so they‚Äôre likely looking for people, don‚Äôt have the long and drawn out hiring processes and you‚Äôre more likely to talk directly to the owner. 



Edit: wow everyone, I was not expecting this much feedback but I‚Äôm glad other people have used this tip as well. Granted, it depends on where you are and how the gyms in your area function but a little research and calling can go a long way to make sure you at least have a place to shower. 

Edit 2: as someone mentioned (thank you for that) just because the place pays under the table, it does not mean you shouldn‚Äôt pay taxes. Put some of the money aside once you have enough to eat to pay in April. Not only is that fraud (uhm.... duh) but it can bite you in the ass down the line.

And I believe getting rid of the car could help you out a lot. Without serious drawbacks. And if you live in some weird place where you really need a car - think about moving.

And fun fact. These days I use taxi to travel everywhere. I checked cost of the taxi and I compared it to cost of a car, fuel, maintenance etc thinking I would switch cars every 5 years - car is still much more expensive than using taxi constantly. ",2018-09-27 18:18:45

I'm decluttering, and in one box I found a bunch of fabric, including half a roll of muslin I had forgotten I had.

There is enough muslin to make a back for it, and I have an old sheet I can use to back the quilted part, since it won't be showing.

The stuffing on the comforter I have is still fine, but the outside is pilled and worn. I got it as a gift from my deceased mom, so I hesitate to just get rid of it. This way, I don't have to. I can just make a nice duvet cover and still have my comforter with a bright, pretty new washable cover.

947,8hq3li,False,,111,Preparing For A Baby: A Single Mom's Guide,povertyfinance,"At the end of 2015. I found myself pregnant with my now 20 month old son. It was not planned, I was not in a position to rely on my son's father, and I've always been poor. I did have a full-time job, a beater car, and an affordable rental home but almost no cash or resources to spare in preparing for my first child. I thought I'd write up a post that may help other women (or fathers/couples!) in a similar situation and explain some of the things I did or learned along the way that really helped me. 


1) I applied for pregnancy Medicaid. I received this immediately and it covered ALL of my routine ob/gyn visits as well as almost the entire labor and delivery. I  had an emergency c-section and ended up staying in the hospital with my son for 9 days. Medicaid covered almost the entire bill; I ended up owing about $200 after the hospital stay but the hospital I delivered at had a financial program for low-income women (you have to ask!!) so my final out-of-pocket cost was $40. Absolutely amazing considering what it costs to have a baby and I was able to attend all appointments and never thought twice about having to see my doctor unexpectedly for issues along the way. All of my prescriptions during pregnancy and for three months afterwards, were absolutely free so ask your doctor to prescribe prenatal vitamins. You should take them anyway but buying them OTC is expensive so get them free from the pharmacy by telling your doctor you need a prescription because of cost. It does seem though that the quality/availability of care through Medicaid is very dependent on your geographical location as I've spoken with other mothers who did not have such an easy or good time with pregnancy Medicaid. Talk to your case manager when you sign up and ask about your best options. It really pays to do your own research as the system is usually really overwhelmed and your case manager only has so much time/effort/care they can give you.  Also, sign up for WIC and SNAP right NOW. 


2) Lean on your family and friends. Everyone loves a new baby! I was very, very fortunate in that I have an incredible, supportive family. My sister bought me so many gifts that I'm not sure I could of done it without her. My dad assembled so much baby equipment and furniture for me that it was basically a second job for him. Cousins, aunts, co-workers, friends all bought gifts. Do not be shy about accepting them or telling them exactly what you need if they ask. Which leads me to number 3.


3) Have a baby shower. If you don't have anyone close enough to you that will throw one for you, plan it yourself. It absolutely does not have to cost a ton of money. You can make cheap but good foods like cold pasta salad and hamburgers; just host it at your home or in a public park (weather permitting of course) to save on a party hall rental. I know this seems like a social sin to throw your own baby shower but you have to do what you have to do and most people won't care anyway. People will bring gifts so I would highly suggest creating a registry. When I was pregnant , babies r us was still around and they had a million options at a million price points. They even gave you a gift card worth 10% of the final amount of things bought off your registry a few months after your due date so search around online for the store offering the best options for deals near you. Even if you don't have a shower, create a registry at any store that offers incentives. Add the items you're going to purchase for yourself and then buy them off the registry to get the incentives. 


4) STOCKPILE. I knew I would not be paid for any type of maternity leave so I began buying supplies I knew I'd need immediately to have them on hand when I was out of work after my son's birth. This GREATLY reduced my financial burden and the accompanying stress because I didn't have to worry about diapers, wipes, etc. Every month of my pregnancy, I bought at least one jumbo box of diapers and one jumbo box of wipes. I also suggest buying bulk sale items when you come across them and have the extra money. I have not bought diaper rash cream, baby lotion/shampoo/soap, or baby sunscreen since I was pregnant because I still have stockpiles of it and my son is now 20 months. I managed this by buying a ton of it whenever I came across a good sale. You will always end up using it and most products have a very long shelf-life. If an item(s) is very heavily discounted and you know for certain that you will need it but not for 9 months or so, I'd buy it as long as you can store it. It's also helpful to stock up on children's Tylenol and such because when you live alone, there is no one you can send to the store at 2 am when baby has a teething fever. 


5) Buy what you can second-hand and then resell it when you no longer need it. Bassinets, pack-and-plays, clothes, etc. Browse thrift stores and places like Once Upon A Child very frequently because they get new items often and you have to be quick when something good comes in. Buy clothes in sizes 1-2 up when you come across good deals on them because you're going to need them soon anyway. I bought my son clothes all the way up until size 12 months when I was pregnant and never had to buy any the first year of his life. Also try Facebook marketplace, Craig's List, and friends with growing children. Do not worry about fancy equipment like electric bottle warmers or lace dresses, buy basic. If baby is clean, fed, and well looked after, it does not matter if his outfit is trendy or if you have a baby wipe warmer. I had never been around babies so I solicited the advice of a million different websites and almost every parent I came across. Gather information about what you'll really actually need and use vs. what you want or are not sure about.


6) Sign up for coupons. Companies love to throw coupons and the occasional free item at new parents. Sign up for formula coupons (I know for sure that both enfamil and similac offer them) even if you plan on breastfeeding. They'll bombard your mailbox with good sized samples and substantial coupons. Look online for rewards programs like the one Pampers offers, too. Sign up for all of it. This is questionably ethical but I also had my sister sign up for the same coupons using her address and my due date. I was able to use twice the amount of coupons this way. 

7) Find out about subsidized daycare. There may be a waiting list so see if you can get on it now and research the daycares that accept it. Research and apply for every single social program available BEFORE baby arrives. 

8) This last part is mostly for the women who are doing it alone like me. Do not be scared to ask for help whenever you need it. I was and I suffered. I look back now and wish I just would of spoken up. If you need a break (and you will) from baby, please reach out to someone you trust who can babysit for a few hours while you take a nap or do something for yourself. Do not burn yourself out because your mental health and parenting skills will suffer. Look into mommy groups, talk with other women online, see a therapist, whatever you need to do. I have found that most of the women in my situation are desperate for friends who understand what they go through so find some. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. Ever. These things happen, we do what we need to in order to survive, and we love our children. PM me if you need to talk. Pursue child support adamantly. The state will file for you if you receive assistance but you really have to stay on top of them to actually achieve anything. Also, don't rely too heavily on the child support. Think of it as extra cash because if you end up losing it or never getting it or whatever, it won't hurt your finances so badly. Caring for a baby alone is SO FUCKING HARD and if it ever gets easier, I'll be sure to let you know but it is possible to do it. 


Edit: This is getting some attention so I wanted to add one more bit of advice. If you haven't put any effort into it before, it's now the time to construct a plan for financial longevity. For me personally, this meant education. Be honest with yourself about the amount of effort you are really willing and able to put in so that your plans/goals are achievable and grounded in reality. It's great to dream big but don't end up racking up debt in an attempt to get a BA in your childhood dream field of philosophy only to drop out after two semesters because life is hard (it is!) or eventually graduate with hefty loans with no job prospects. Don't put it off either. It's going to be really difficult but it's going to be difficult in our type of situation anyway so try to do something that will put you in a better earning position within a few years.

A little more background information! 

I tried the best I could to not incur school debt, but I was a first generation high school graduate and definitely had no idea what I was doing. In the end, I borrowed ~$30,000 for school loans, which in the grand scheme of things wasn't much, but I'm glad to be out from under it. 

I took the semester off between high school and starting at community college. I worked 84 hours a week and saved up a tidy sum to help me through the first semester. I had a pretty decent scholarship/grant package that paid my tuition for my first 2 years of community college. I worked part-time in my field to gain experience. I transferred to a Big 10 School, and received a similar financial aid deal for tuition, working full time in the summer. 

I used student loans to buffer my paltry paychecks, allowing me to live in an off-campus apartment, by myself, and save my sanity. I also used some money to travel, and to attend lots of work shops related to my field. I worked an AmeriCorps stint after graduation that paid a lump sum toward my loans, but the rest has been diligently plugging away at them.

But I used to ignore people when they said **just set your direct deposit to automatically transfer money from your paycheck to savings** . I thought that just wasn't *me*. I thought I'd inevitably end up taking the money out.

For some reason, I decided in October to try it. I set my direct deposit up to put $150 per pay period into savings. (You could set it to anything you can afford to spare. $10, $25, $500, $1000, whatever.)

Lo and behold, I've actually been able to stick to it. Sure, it's been insanely hard. I ended up with $4 in my checking account for about a week and ended up eating ramen several times. 

But that's okay because now I actually have a decent emergency fund. The thought of my car breaking down or my dog having a medical emergency doesn't give me panic attacks.

824,fd287t,False,,32,I‚Äôve reached $500 in my LONG-TERM SAVINGS for the first time while on disability...,povertyfinance,"... and I have nowhere else to share this and I just need somewhere to put it into the world.
I‚Äôve been on disability since 2015 after two back-to-back psychiatric hospitalizations in 2012/13. Leading up to that I was working 72 hours a week as an STNA in the home health field. I worked every single solitary day for over two years. Although I‚Äôve struggled a lifetime with mental illness, this was the first time I was on my own and free from my abusive parents. I was advised by my at-the-time psychiatrist to no longer work due to a diagnoses of catatonic schizophrenia (now deemed two separate illnesses). It was a very hard thing for me to accept. As a child, my parents involved me with what was happening with finances. They frequently used scare tactics of losing the house vs. food, filing for bankruptcy, and honestly too much for a child to carry. My dad always drove into me with intense frequency that you should ‚Äòwork hard while your young so you can retire early.‚Äù Sprinkled throughout is, imo expectedly, more heartbreak, trauma, and emotional scarring that over 13 years of therapy simply hasn‚Äôt fixed yet. All of that had a huge blow to the opportunities set ahead of me and it was seemingly for the purpose of destroying me. I was given only the advice of, ‚Äúcredit card BAAAADD. saving is GOOD‚Äù and that‚Äôs where it ended. Although it is not entirely bad or wrong advice, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs just not like that. I never applied for a credit card, believing that I would be doomed for eternity to financial suffering and I would be denied because of my disability. And it‚Äôs all just a bunch of bs to keep me small. I know. What assholes???!!

Well I‚Äôm happy to say that my parents didn‚Äôt break me and they didn‚Äôt stop me. I now have had a credit card for 4 months, a paid off student loan for a year, a credit score at about 680 and finally... the cherry... however small.. is the $500 in my long-term savings. Although paying off a student loan is huge, a good score is... well, GOOD.. I honestly have felt that that long term was stuck. Everything saved was kept short term and depleted time and time again. Even being on the wimpy ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù income I have from SSDI I was able to do all of this. I just wanted to share that with you all. I want to only be a quick reminder that you can do it. We can all do it. Even on limited income. We will not be broken and we will not remain broke.
Thanks guys

984,duj2wp,False,,23,Finally have a savings account in the black for the first time in awhile!,povertyfinance,"So I've been struggling with finances for a long time after having both no financial education given to me when I was younger and a habit of spending myself into stupid holes with crap I don't really need. With no one to guide me and bad habits coming back to bite frequently, I finally had enough. I've been listening to a lot of financial advice videos and podcasts (like Dave Ramsey among others) and have been getting my budget on track for the first time since... 2014, I think? It's been really helpful and I think I'm starting to make progress even if I'm not where I want to be long-term just yet.

Over the last year from August '18 to now, I've accomplished the following:

1. Bought a new (used) laptop that's much better to work with in school (as I am a college student) than my last laptop, and I paid cash for it (about $2,000 with side equipment).
2. Built up an emergency fund on my main bank account to $1,000, as that is Dave's ""Baby Step 1"" before tackling debts elsewhere.
3. Balanced all of my bank accounts so they have (at the time of writing this) at least $300 in savings each, and I'm putting a small amount back into each account every paycheck. I have 4 accounts and for the last several years, typically 2 of them were in overdraft at any given time, so this is a huge improvement. My goal is $1,000 in each account minimum.
4. Beginning to pay down my student loans while I'm still in college, and also beginning to pay down medical debts from six years ago (which I foolishly ignored and let double, so tackling those feels good).
5. Bought a used car for the first time ever instead of having one given to me; saved about two months for that and paid it off in full last month. About $1,200 plus registration fees, and it's very high fuel economy (Geo Metro) and is saving me money against what I used to drive. I pay about $40 per month in gas for it and I'm driving 50 miles a day.
6. Paying all my bills every month including renting an apartment with a friend (instead of living on campus on financial aid or in someone else's house); renter's insurance, car insurance, electric, groceries, etc. and still having enough left over to pay down the older bills I mentioned above.
7. Not spending as much money on frivolous stuff and keeping track of the miscellaneous things I do buy, making an effort to spend less and less each month on things I don't need and put the rest into savings.
8. Currently have enough to pay about 2.5 months' worth of straight bills if I remain conservative with what I spend. Not including separate savings I have which are education-specific (Pell Grant, Scholarships, AmeriCorps service award), I've got about $2,000 to my name outside the car, the laptop, everything I own, and the bills I'm working on. I haven't had anywhere close to $2,000 readily available in over five years and back then I wasn't paying my own bills, was living with family, and only ever reached about $5,500 after working two jobs with seven-day schedules for about 6 months straight, then I mistakenly blew that in about two or three months. So I'm not back to where I was just yet, but I'm still doing better overall and should surpass my goal in 2020 if I stay moving straight.

This feels really good, guys. I know it sounds like I'm bragging and I apologize for that, but I just genuinely feel great about where I'm at for once. I work full-time while in school so I have very little free time, but it's starting to pay off. I don't use credit cards (both out of principle and because the medical debt shot my credit score, so oh well), and I'm only making $17.50/hr, but even that I'm grateful for as it's more I've made in other jobs I've had. I'm feeling like I might actually have hope for the future and be debt-free in a few years. It's a fantastic feeling.

**EDIT:** This became more popular than I was expecting so I should add some additional info for clarification. I'm 25, and this progress has largely come about since I was 24, hence the mention of ""over the last year"". However, everything from the list (items 1-8 stating with the computer) has been from November '18 to now, and August was when I started college after a 6-year gap. This story starts further back in 2012 when my dad passed unexpectedly and not long afterward, I was homeless living in his car. He didn't teach me how to handle money properly; in fact, he was terrible with it and died in debt (which I had to pay off myself at 18) and he ruined a lucrative family business and stole money from his family years before, in essence teaching me what not to do instead of what to do. When he was gone I was on my own, moved in with an uncle who gave me a better example of how to handle money, and in 2014 I started saving up that $5,500 I mentioned with the hope of going back to school that much sooner. It didn't happen, I made a series of dumb decisions, and was homeless a second time. At that point I only had myself to blame, but after some medical crises I moved in with my mom, who is still alive but equally as bad with money as my dad was, and she also stole money from family albeit in a more indirect, morally ambiguous way. So between both of them, I had no guidance and no direction. I spent whatever little money I had from work on extravagances and learned to get by without saving for the future, which is a poor plan in just about every way. In early 2018 my mom was put under investigation for something unrelated and our family structure collapsed. She lost our house (not the first time, and dad had done the same thing years before) and it left me trying to pick up the pieces. For a second time I moved in with my uncle, this time determined to not let his generosity be in vain. After fucking around and accomplishing little over six years since leaving high school, I studied for the ACT and SAT in my hours outside of work, all the while paying for storage for my mom's things while she got her situation figured out. I drove 180 miles to the nearest ACT test facility last summer, got a score good enough to get into college with, and finally went back to school on a shoestring budget, knowing fully well the only way I would afford it was to work full-time throughout. From August '18 through now, that's exactly what I've done, as well as having incorporated a move to a cheaper school in another state to help stay within my budget and pay off bills. So I went from being homeless and dealing with my parents' poor decisions to where I'm at now, and I think that makes it all the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/duj2wp/finally_have_a_savings_account_in_the_black_for/,738,"Hey, you're working hard and smart.

* Paid several hundred dollars to my partner who has, over time, loaned me money.
* Saved money for deposit on new apartment.
* Paid my share of rent.
* Paid phone bill & other utilities including laundry for the month.
* Saved money for nutrition program that has been highly effective in addressing my current obesity.
* Bought groceries.
* And treated myself to a few nice things on Amazon!

I have money left because of my regular income and I no longer owe anyone anything. THE FEELING IS AMAZING. I'm fully aware that others have larger debts, but that's totally not the point. I just feel... lighter. Ya know?

916,993l7b,False,,140,Borrowing your way out of generational poverty.,povertyfinance,"My whole family has been poor going pretty far back. Recent history is my grandparents were born deaf and discarded by society, and took crap odd jobs to make ends meet. Grandma got pregnant as a teen, my mom also got pregnant at 15, and then I myself got pregnant as a teen. I was pretty uneducated about life in general and most certainly about money, and how much money it took to raise children. I just knew you were supposed to have kids and struggle, that was life and that's just how it is. Graduating high school was optional.

When I got older,  my world view really changed. I was determined to raise my kids middle class so they could have all the things I never did. I was (still am?) pretty illiterate when it comes to money, so I borrowed my way out of poverty. I ran up all kinds of credit cards and loans to fund a middle class lifestyle. My kids got to dress in new clothes (even though they weren't name brand, they weren't hand me downs!), they got to do extra curricular activities. My husband and I moved to a decent school district, bought mid-range cars. We were so deep in debt this whole time. 

Now both of my kids are in college, and they still live at home so we can pay their living expenses while they are going to school. They are the first generation in my family to go to college right out of high school. And I'm proud of that. 

My husband and I are working hard to pay off the debt we've accumulated throughout their childhoods, but honestly I don't regret any of it. Borrowing money allowed us to get to a place where we could live in a regular house, wear regular clothes, buy regular food. And I feel like we broke the poverty cycle - now my kids are in college and are set up to get good paying jobs, and we can help them save money while living at home so they can move out when they are financially ready to. We are trying to teach them about money, and not getting into debt, but it's hard when I don't really know much myself. 

Sorry for the long post, me and my husband were just discussing it so I thought it would make a good discussion here also. I read an article that said movement between the classes doesn't really happen, I think we were able to but probably not in the best way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/993l7b/borrowing_your_way_out_of_generational_poverty/,879,"I would not have done this and I didn't do this with my kids.

Just bought an 11 year old car for $5k with all service records (gov't vanpool vehicle). I'm retired younger than most all people because I was frugal and the kids are doing great. 

To me, and this is my own view, is that you haven't broken the poverty cycle. It's faking it, if it's a facade with all of that debt you still carry. Carrying debt for so many years is poverty. ",2018-08-21 14:26:45

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm not at what anyone would consider the poverty level, but I do have a terrible habit that causes me to live paycheck to paycheck and has put me into some scary situations here and there.

I have money automatically deposited into my savings account every paycheck. I also have a certain amount that I put into a second checking account that my regular bills come out of. My primary checking is for groceries, gas, and some spending money.

So I have this HORRIBLE habit of overspending. And it‚Äôs not because I buy crap because I want it... I‚Äôm just buying things I genuinely need, like an apron so I don‚Äôt ruin my clothes when I cook (I‚Äôm messy and keto involves a lot of fatty foods lol). No, my one big spending problem is eating out. I kind of panic if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast because I don‚Äôt have time to eat lunch and breakfast ends up being my only meal until dinner.

Anyway... about this time in the pay cycle (four days until payday) I‚Äôll have to start transferring money from that savings account to my primary checking account because I only have $11 left or something. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. This is twice a month this happens. Every. Damn. Time.

But this month!!! This month I made some changes. I said no to frivolous purchases (passed on a beautiful robe on the clearance rack to replace my slightly worn one), took my lunch to work, made dinner with leftovers to spare, was a lot smarter about how much food I purchased (from a big family, hard to learn to just cook for two), and got creative with cheaper recipes like different types of salads. The biggest thing I did was say no to eating out. I‚Äôm not actually hungry, I‚Äôm just not planning ahead and panicking when I think I won‚Äôt eat for the rest of the day.

What‚Äôs amazing is that I didn‚Äôt actually sacrifice that much! I was able to spend $50 on new workout pants and bras. I took my boyfriend out for a drink on Easter Sunday. I even bought myself a Starbucks.

And here I am, sitting on $52.81 for the rest of the week!  THIS FEELS AMAZING! Just those changes made a massive difference! I actually kept what I put aside in my savings account (I officially have $405 now). And I don‚Äôt need to spend that whole $52.81. I know I can make some of the veggies from last week go into meals this week and I have lots of deli meat, eggs, and bacon left. So I plan to grocery shop for what I need for the week and if I have any money remaining, it‚Äôs going into that savings account... and then I‚Äôm going to do the same thing this next paycheck.

671,9t2535,False,,164,Some tips from a former bank employee on fees,povertyfinance,"Hi everyone. I really qualify as ""poverty finance"" level myself so I'm not trying to come in here and preach. It's just that I noticed a lot of common 'mistakes' or things people in our situation could be doing to avoid problems and fees at the bank.

1. Read your account disclosure. You know that booklet of tiny text that you got when you opened your account? I know some people view it as 'just another legal thing that is hard to understand' but they are usually written pretty simply if you actually read it. **You can skip to the part that talks about your specific account type.** You don't need to read the whole thing, but do read it in order to know how your account works.

2. Do not sign up for automatic payments. I've seen this go wrong far more often than it has actually helped anyone. They are nearly always impossible to cancel at the last moment if you are close to overdrawing your account. If you do use them, make **DAMN** sure you put them on a calendar with alerts and stay aware of what is coming up for the next pay cycle.

3. Do not habitually overdraft. Almost anything is better than overdrawing your account. Even credit card interest is FAR less than an overdraft fee. If you do the math, that $25 or whatever per charge is worse than a payday loan in almost all cases. I've seen people who had over 300 overdrafts in the last year. At $25 each, that is giving the bank thousands of dollars of free money. There's always a better way than doing that, but it's not like the bank is going to call you up and volunteer that information. You have to ask for help if you *are* in that situation.

4. Understand the posting order of your account. Charges don't always come out in the order in which they occurred in real time. Please talk to a bank associate if you don't understand this by reading your account disclosure and they would be happy to explain it, as it works differently at every bank. But at the bank I worked for, ACH (direct debits) would come out before debit card transactions. So let's say you had $600 in the bank. A $599 direct deposit came out for your rent. Then you did 6 debit card transactions for $2-5 each. You would actually get charged 6 overdraft fees even though you barely went over. There are a lot of situations where our posting order *helped* customers, but also situations where it royally screwed them over.

5. **Free checking accounts still exist.** You are getting ripped off if you're being charged every month just to have your checking account open. Period. Look into local banks and **ask** for the free option. They're not always advertised. And if they don't have one, go somewhere else.

6. Understand how ""opting out"" of overdraft fees works. Federal law requires banks to allow you to opt out of getting fees for most debit card purchases. However, you can still get fees for ACH (direct debits that I warned against earlier), checks, and **subscription services**. Yes, that $7 netflix subscription can cause a $25 overdraft fee even if you opt out.

7. If you do get an overdraft fee for something stupid, feel free to call and explain the situation. However, know that customer service reps are required to *justify* each refund if asked by a supervisor. If they just give you the refund despite the fact that you've overdrawn your account 10 times in the last year, they could *lose their jobs*. So cut them some slack. 

8. Do not rely only on online banking. It sounds oldschool, but keeping a checkbook register is the most reliable way to avoid overdraft fees. Online banking has no way of knowing if you have a check outstanding, for instance. It also has no way of knowing that you added a tip to a restaurant bill until the restaurant processes it. I've seen many people become overdrawn because of this.

I hope some of these tips help. It killed me to see people lose so much money on fees.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9t2535/some_tips_from_a_former_bank_employee_on_fees/,1629,"9. Don't bank at a national or international bank.

I grew up dirt poor. My father was highly intelligent but was a ‚Äú the grass is greener on the other side‚Äù guy. He switched jobs a lot. He had one year in college before dropping out. My mother did not graduate high school. 

I grew up in a run down house in rural California (yes, there is a rural California). The town I grew up near was the drug gateway into Los Angeles. It had one Sheriff. In the 70s and 80s the Hells Angels warehoused their drugs there. In the late 80s 90s they were pushed out by cartels. 

I grew up in a two bedroom hovel. We only had a tub that had fallen through the rotted floor of the one bathroom. We often went without electricity and water. We rarely had trash service. I grew up taking the trash out to the backyard and throwing it into a pile. A pile that became taller than I was. Rodents and cats would tear open the bags and spread the trash around. It was common to find piles of maggots infesting the garbage stack. 

My mother had a mental illness and suffered from severe depression. She had to have a tumor removed that was the size of a basketball. After that surgery she was bed ridden because of her undiagnosed depression.

This all seemed normal to me, because, I did not know any different. I didn‚Äôt know that most people did not have ceiling collapsing inside their homes. I did not know that when it rained not everyone had to grab buckets to collect the rain water that came through the leaky ceiling.

I was pretty self sufficient from a young age. I did my own laundry, and scrounged for my meals. I got myself ready for school. In many ways I raised myself. Like many poor kids I lived on hot dogs and bologna. Most meals consisted of toast with gravy on it. 

College was never talked about in our house. College was for rich kids. School was not even that important. It was just a place that I could get a .20 cent lunch. I was always in trouble for fighting. I took out my frustrations on other people. I had the most detentions and suspensions of all my peers. This happened even through high school. I was threatened with expulsion many times. All of the staff and resource officers knew me.

My senior year of high school I had a 1.8 GPA. I was also missing a few core classes. The school made me take night classes at the adult education campus. I ended up graduating with a 2.0 exactly.

I spent two years after high school working low paying jobs. I was homeless and stayed at wherever someone would let me. I slept on a lot of couches and floors. I got into drugs. I frequented crappy strip clubs. 

After 9/11 I joined the military. I had dyed blonde hair, nipple piercings, and was covering myself in tattoos. I was a freak.

When I took the Asvab I scored two points away from max. This surprised me. It was the first time I had really done something even slightly impressive. I went in as an Aircraft electrician. During AIT I had the highest grades of all of the classes during that training cycle. I was the Distinguished Honor graduate.

While in the military I took a few community college classes. I carried a pretty high gpa and made the Dean‚Äôs List every semester. 

After the military I went to work and college at the same time. I had a wonderful wife and young kids. I worked during the day and went to school at night. It took me another two years to earn an Associates. It took me seven years to get a Bachelors. It took me another three years to earn a Masters. 

Meanwhile I worked as a mechanic. I became a Master Mechanic. I have never made over a $100,00 in a W2 job. In fact I probably made around $30,000 to $40,000 most years.

While going to school my wife and I financed two new fancy vehicles. We ran up $25,000 in credit cards, I took out $30,000 in student loans that was not always spent on school. My wife had to work nights. I had to take online courses. We were digging ourselves a hole.

One day I was switching stations on the radio. I came across Dave Ramsey and listened to him. His advice seemed stupid-simple. I told my wife about Dave and we both jumped in with the goal of being debt free.

We took both of our cars down to Carmax and sold them. Luckily we broke even between the two. We literally ate rice and beans and threw every penny at debt. It took us two years to become debt free. I drove a really old teal Mazda 323. My wife drove an old Mazda Mpv mini van that was this horrible shade of purplish-blue.

Once we were debt free everything became easier. I put a lot of money into my 401k. My wife became a stay at home mom. I kept earning better degrees and found myself making a whopping $72,000 per year. 

We ended up moving and rented out our old house. We bought another house for a crazy low interest rate. Our rental property was cash flow positive.

I started a side business while working for an employer. It is a service based local business. I started it with a partner. I cashed out my 401k of $78,000. My partner was supposed to do the work while I performed the administrative functions and financed the business. My employer ended up firing me for having a side business. His reason was ‚Äúif you had told me I would have wanted to be a part of it‚Äù.

My partner was a liar. 

A year after starting the business I found that my partner had squandered tens of thousands of dollars. He ended up getting a lawyer and threatening to sue me. Meanwhile the business was crashing and burning. I settled with my partner for an amount that I could not really afford.

Everything I had was at risk. At this point I had borrowed over a $100,000 for the business. I could not sleep during the weekends. I remember thinking that my two choices were to go crazy or fix this. I couldn‚Äôt go crazy because I still had young kids.

So, I showed up two hours early everyday and stayed late every night. I focused on ‚ÄòI need to do one thing everyday to make the business better‚Äô. Meanwhile I had a handful of customers threatening to sue me over my previous partners actions. I was getting demand letters every month. 

I just kept moving forward. Trying to do one thing better. Putting out fires as needed. 

Three years later I bought out another small business. Today, we have multiple locations. I am involved as a partner with a handful of new businesses. I directly manage a handful of businesses. I own rental properties. My net-worth is skyrocketing. 

My business debt is paid off except the debt I have against assets. 

I am 41 years old and I consider myself retired. I have managers that manage aspects of my business. I sit in my office and mentor my high-potential, high-value management staff.

So, how did I go from a 2.0 to this? More importantly how can you go from where you are to your own version of success?

Education: people get paid for what they do. People get paid more for what they know. People that continually learn and apply that learning no matter what age they are get paid the most. People that take what they learn and apply it independently of an employer create their own job security. 

Control: control what you can control. Don‚Äôt pay much attention to what you cannot control. I could not control my partner‚Äôs actions. The sooner I metabolized that fact and moved forward the better it was for me. 

Options: most people‚Äôs version of success is based around options. You may think that I should substitute being debt-free for options. The fact is that being debt free just increases your options. What I have learned in my life is that options are the only thing that separates the impoverished from those that are not. If I need to move I can move. If I need to close a business, I can close a business. If I need cash, I can come up with cash. If a business deal comes my way I can pull resources to become part of that deal.

I tell my young daughters that everything they do in life, every choice they make, should be based around which one gives them the most options. With options comes power over the unexpected. Life is not about money....it is about options. However, money usually goes hand in hand with options. 

I love my poor people out there. I just want you to know that you can not only do what I did, but, you can do it better. Educate yourself, control what you can, give yourself options.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/cvp92o/my_example_how_i_went_from_poor_to_not_poor/,802,"> Control: control what you can control. Don‚Äôt pay much attention to what you cannot control. I could not control my partner‚Äôs actions. The sooner I metabolized that fact and moved forward the better it was for me. 

I really wish I grasped this earlier in life. It has made the biggest improvements for me.

345,aav7j3,False,,348,A Troubling Trend I've Noticed on this Subreddit,povertyfinance,"In the past few weeks, I've noticed a common response to ""I have trouble saving"" or ""I have trouble meal planning"" is the Ramsey quote (I'm paraphrasing) ""Children do what feels good, adults are responsible.""

Some commenters say things like ""You have no self control""; ""You don't understand the difference between a need and a want"" and other variations on ""You're immature and ignorant about the world.""

How is that helpful?  

Maybe I'm just an immature child but it took me a few years to get really good at saving.  Self control and self denial are like muscles, they're built up over time.

Not everyone is taught how to budget at home, not everyone is resourceful enough to figure it out on their own.  

I don't agree with choices a lot of people make on here, but at least they're trying to improve their situation by coming here and asking for advice.

613,9r7yhb,False,,124,I'm finally breaking the cycle.,povertyfinance,"To set the stage - 
In 2006, I was broke, freshly transplanted to  major city California, and had 1 job, 30 something hours a week as a baggage handler at the airport.  
I made $11 an hour, and slept on the couch of a friend's apartment.  I never set foot in a grocery store.  Everything was fast food.
I lasted 3 months.  Failed.  Moved back home.
2007 and 2008 had the same cycle.  Pick a state.  Move.  Find a job.  Find a roommate.   Fail.  Move back home.

In 2009, I started college, a cheap university high up in the mountains.  
A Pell Grant was enough to cover all my expenses, and I could have lived modestly.  4 easy years, living on the governments dime while I got a degree.

Instead... Shitty friends, fast food, weed, and booze. A car I couldn't afford but looked good.  New clothes to not wear to the classes I skipped.

In 2011, I failed out.  Car had been repo'd.  Work fired me for missing days.  Bank charged me for overdrafts. Rent came due in a hurry, and I didn't have it.

I had no job.  I was becoming homeless.  
I stayed in a shelter for 6 weeks, working as a dishwasher in a buffet, and server in a dine-in pizza place.  I saved all my money, for 5 full weeks... and blew most on drugs and alcohol.  Its amazing how many friends you accumulate when they're drinking your beer for free.

When the money ran out... The party stopped.  And I failed again.  Crashed hard.

I sold everything I owned, and mom chipped in the rest for a bus ticket.

In 2012, I moved back to my home state (in my late 20's) with $0 in my pocket, half a bag of rolling tobacco, and my skateboard. 
The only good thing in my life... Was my credit was too shitty for a credit card.  So i had no CC debt.  I was truly at $0.

I slept on the living room floor of an old friend's rental house, because the couch was already claimed.
I got on SNAP benefits.
I found a job.  $10 an hour.
I spent as little as possible.
Found a trailer to rent.  Found a better company doing the same work...
  
And for 6 years, I've done my best.  
And it has been hard. 

Like... Grown man lying in bed breaking down crying in fear and stress and anger and frustration, and somehow...
Lasting one more day.  Telling myself... This is not your best.  This is good for now, this is a good today, and I can make tomorrow better. 

I've worked on my own car, taken side jobs, asked for raises and more hours, and accepted any task thrown at me.  
Scrub food out of the floor sinks in the kitchen every night?   Ok.
Work from 5am to 230pm, then go assist from 9pm to 3am on a grease trap replacement inside a restaurant?  Sure.
Drive an hour every day to the jobsite?   You've got it.

 
Now, I'm soon to be married.  Stepkids.  A house in the near future.  A car loan.  A solid job.  A company vehicle.

We paid our wedding off already.  $100 a week each, instead of dining out or going to the movies or buying makeup or clothes.  It took almost 7 months.  

I've learned how to cook for 5 people for $100 a week.  $20 per person for 12-15 meals, since the kids are still in school.  Eggs and potatoes and onions go far.  Pasta is a mainstay.  Rice is a miracle filler.  

We pack lunches and take snacks to work. 
I wait for the sales on brand name cereal and buy 10 boxes for $15. I buy a dozen gatorades when they're 58 cents each through the grocery store app, instead of $2 each at the gas station.  I go to the spanish grocer for cheap produce and off brand cleaning supplies.  

We buy clothes from discount racks, and entertainment secondhand.  Bikes and video games are from CL or Letgo.
Fish and turtles are dirt cheap pets, and you can find a tank for $10 or less.  
A football or soccer ball is maybe $5 at goodwill, and gets the kids out of the apartment and playing with friends.

Our next goal is to stop paying rent, and start paying a mortgage.  We'll get there.

I've been seriously working on Me, for 6 years now, so I didn't repeat the cycle again.  I didn't have a car for almost 3 years.  It took me 4 years before I had an emergency fund.  It took 5 years before the money in savings stayed there.  

And it's working.

It's getting better.

And if I can do it... Me, the loser pothead dropout failure with crooked shoulders and scrawny arms, that used to make your pizza, mad at the world, and deep down... Hating myself for being the situation I was in..

If I can do it...
You can.

934,8owibx,False,,43,My journey out of poverty,povertyfinance,"My husband and I married out of high school and had a baby at 20. We made some poor choices and both dropped out of school.  



We were barely able to make ends meet, working minimum wage part time jobs. 



I applied for SNAP, WIC, and Medicaid. We worked opposite shifts (I took days, he worked nights) so we wouldn‚Äôt need daycare. And we survived the first year. When my son was a year old, I filled out FAFSA and got a PELL grant with additional exceptional need assistance. I quit my job and went to nursing school. When I graduated, my husband went to technical school. 



We are now financially comfortable and able to support our family and pay back into the system. We made it out of poverty by using the social safety net. That was our one saving grace. 



There is no shame in using these social safety net programs. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8owibx/my_journey_out_of_poverty/,854,"OP, IMO you and your husband are precisely the type of people what the system should be for! 

You got married young and had a child too soon (and made some poor choices). But you make positive changes (rather than milking the system).  First responsible thing was working opposite shifts. That eliminates the cost of daycare.  You both then went back to school one at a time to better yourself so you can have higher paying job.  Well done!

729,8widg2,False,,106,"All of you with posts that start with ""mom/dad wants me to..."" - please listen",povertyfinance,"When it comes to your relatives then words such as 'sign, loan, use credit' are words that you want to avoid. See it this way, words are actions in a way and with action comes consequences.  

On this sub there are countless stories about sons and daugthers who got screwed over by their mom and dad bc mom and dad just wanted to borrow a bit of money, just this once and of course they will pay their sons and daughters back. But history tells us that mom and dad are incapable of handling money. They have student loans from 40 years ago, and they dont own their house even though they had 30-40 years to pay for it. 

Always see the big picture when it comes to your parents. And ask yourself ""if the bank won't let mom and dad take a loan, then why should I?"" ""If they can't sign, then why should I""

You are not the guardian of your mom and dad. 

You are not responsible for your mom and dad. 

You have the right and I would almost say obligation to say NO. 

Just say no. You have your own life to live and your own financials to take care of. Not their financials. 

When you say no, they will be angry with you but you have to look out for yourself and build your life on solid financial foundation.
