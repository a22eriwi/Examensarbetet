706,gb3ygh,False,Help,1,Can user programs directly access physical addresses?,computerscience,"I have a doubt regarding address binding in OS. I saw a statement that read ""User programs can never directly access physical addresses"". It can access physical addresses using logical addresses using MMU. 
I also saw that in compile-time and load-time binding, the logical address and physical address is the same. So, won't the user program be able to access or see the real physical address. When taking this case, isn't the above statement false?

Another doubt I have is :
The compiled code has the absolute address of physical memory in it. Doesn't that create a problem? I mean, the logical addresses itself is created to protect the data on the physical memory. If the compiled code has the absolute physical address, then the true meaning for using logical addresses is lost, right?

The programs themselves never see or even know any address translation is occurring. 

However, for some hardware - like certain microprocessors commonly used as Arduino targets without any significant OS that performs such memory address translations - the addresses a program references are exactly the same as the physical address. This is also true for certain data processing systems that must be certified for critical processing (think flight computers onboard a commercial airplane) so the chances of failure are as small as possible.

That means if you only have 1 core it takes 1600 minutes, if you have 100 it's 16 minutes.

>I processed 100 samples using 1 core -> 1600 minutes from above this means that processing 1 sample n 1 core takes 16 minutes

Formally:

    samples
    ------- = time
     cores

If you have more cores and same samples, it takes less time.

If you have more samples and same cores it takes more time.

If you want to speed up you either need to increase the core cunt or decrease the samples.

>How many cores/year does it equal to? This question does not make much sense

I am not sure how to understand this question. Do you mean: how many cores do you need if you want to process 100 samples in exactly one year?

>If i want to do 40000 samples in the same amount of time( just for the sake of the example) do I just multiply the cores week computed in (1) by 400 to get the required cores/year?

I assume the same amount of time refers to the 160 minutes you mentioned before in this case  cores / year does not make any sense at all.

No offence (I'm sure I'll get downvoted anyway) but if this type of question is troublesome for you then Computer Science might not be the right science for you.

When picking out a profession it is important to have an interest for the topic itself, regardless of whether you are managing people or not. If IT is something you're interested in, start learning and building stuff now. You don't need a company to do IT. 

IT Manager is not a professional field in itself, it is a job that more experienced IT professionals who happen to have a desire to coordinate other professionals tend to take on.

In IT you typically have two directions to go after being in an entry level role for a few years. You can double-down on technical expertise and become a 'tech lead'/'subject matter expert'/'senior engineer' or go down the management route.

If the people-skills aspect of being a manager is what appeals to you, consider exploring professions that allow you to lean into that passion, like HR, training, or social work.

If you you are interested in getting started with IT, a computer will be important. Contrary to what other people might say, at your age I do not think you should focus on a checklist of things you should learn. Learning that way will get boring and tire you out. What you need to do is get excited. Think about something you want to build: a website, a game, a blog. Start googling (e.g. how to make a simple website). Soon enough you will branch out organically into the different parts of IT. At this stage in your education, having fun and getting obsessed with trying to make an idea come to life is more powerful that any textbook. If you bump into a problem that needs math to solve, you can learn the math then (ask your math teacher to help you!). Learning math with the hope that it will somewhere down the line help with IT (but not know exactly how it will help) is a very demotivating way to learn. ",2020-04-28 18:53:32

What if the number is an odd number? For example, the binary representation of 9 is: 1011. When we shift the bits to the right once, we get 0101 which is 5 rather than 9/2 = 4.5.

When right shifting it you will get 011 (3 in base 10).
Right shifting 6 (110) will give you the same. 

That's because the least significant bit (the first one on the right) is 1 when the number is odd, 0 when even. Right shifting removes this number so an odd number N and the even number N-1 will give the same result when right shifting. ",2020-01-21 13:54:15

Quantum computing is an extremely interesting and popular topic. Even though it is still in its infancy, it promises to change the computing landscape and even usher another stage to our civilizational development. This is all due to an exponential increase in computing power that it will inevitably bring. It will make all of the tasks that previously took months and years to complete easily solvable within days, hours and even minutes. The wide spectrum of its potential applications ranges from medicine to finance. It will solve tasks that were previously unachievable and revolutionize every sphere where it is applied. The potential changes that it will bring being groundbreaking, to say the least. Recent achievements in quantum computing and their practical applications will be described in the paragraphs below.

First of all, it is important to understand the fundamentals of quantum computing in order to see how it differentiates from classical computing and how is it capable of exceeding it. Its basis lies in a completely new approach to computing and to matter itself. It draws on the principals of quantum physics and operates on a completely new worldview of the universe. The quantum bits, unlike classical bits that are either 1 or 0, combine both in themselves. Allowing them to simultaneously exist in multiple states at once. This allows for multiple computations to happen simultaneously and is generally known as superposition. The best example to illustrate it would be the widely-known Schrodinger’s cat, which is in two states at once.

To be sure that your RSA can't be cracked in the next years (not forever) by supercomputers you should use at least 1024 bits per prime, but if you can, 2048 better.

If you want to design purposely a system than can be cracked nor in seconds but also not in hours, it is very hard to determine. Because of the nature of RSA cracking 1 more bit doubles the average time, meaning that de difference between 20 bits and 30 bits is 1000 times longer.
For example, if 10 bits takes a minute, 20 bits will take 16 hours so fine-tuning so that it takes the amount of time you want even if it is not that specific, it is still hard.

The time will depend a lot on how fast is you cpu, what environment you are using and if you are using multiple threads.
My guess is that you won't be able to do more than 20 bit RSA cracking with a normal computer in less than 30 minutes, but again it highly depends.

You should just try it out, but don't set the bits on the upper bound and star lowering them, rather set the number of bits to 10 and increase them until you are satisfied with the time that it takes. ",2020-05-06 17:41:03

But while you're on Linux, you can freely poke in them as Windows isn't there to enforce its rules. Allowing you to mess with the contents of the NTFS drive like that would allow you to ruin a consistency and continuity everything is relying on, easily leading to blue screens of death when a driver or service finds something unexpected. Since it is basic software engineering policy not to trust the user, they simply don't allow you to fuck up.

795,hkxsfz,False,Advice,13,Study techniques for Computer Science/Software Engineering,computerscience," Hi guys,

I need help when it comes to studying Computer Science. I am a Software Engineering student but I am thinking of transferring to CS.

I do well in my internal assessments such as in assignments and practicals. I can understand the content too but when it comes to exams, I do really badly. It's easy to score well in internal assessments because I am tested on the content I learned a week a go and hence I have the content fresh in my memory.

The issue is when it comes to exams. Studying for exams become overwhelming because I need to go back and revise content from week 1 simply because I have forgotten the content. It seems I don't have a study routine I can stick to and I don't know what studying techniques I should use to study CS/SE.

I watched a video from the channel called ""Ali Abdaal"" which was about how his friend writes up a document filled with questions and his friend tries to answer the questions he came up with to test his understanding. His friend was studying medicine. And I thought this was a brilliant idea but I am not too sure if this is a good technique for CS/SE because CS/SE is not all about knowing answers and memorizing. CS/SE students have to apply.

I am not interested in anything like doing the pomodoro technique because I find the content I learn interesting and hence have motivation to learn. I am willing to study. I feel like what I need is a way to study and a way to keep all the content I learn in my head or anything that is helping you guys to score well in your studies.

I would love to hear some advice from CS/SE students who are doing very well with their studies and what you guys do to get those awesome grades. I have been getting crappy marks because of exams and I hate it so much.

Thanks guys for your time. Appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hkxsfz/study_techniques_for_computer_sciencesoftware/,2,"Computer science is like math or physics - you study theory but you also need to solve as many problems as possible (in compsci this involves writing code at some point, if necessary, but you can also just write solutions in pseudo-code to show that you understand how to do it).

Anki can help you a lot to study the theory. For example, you are taking a class in Operating systems - there is some theory involved, use flash cards or Anki to retain that information. The class will also have a practical component (hopefully), where you can solve problems and write code.

If you are a geek, you can set up Emacs to write the Anki cards in it and then ""upload"" them bulk to your running Anki instance. You can use ""snippets"" in Emacs to make writing the cards easier and almost automated. The advantage of this and associated org-mode is that you can mix latex, figures etc. into the cards.

If you are not used to solving problems and have never taken courses where you had to do so (and got tested doing so), you need to up your game and start doing it. Some sciences (like biology or geography) or humanities (like history, languages etc.) do not involve this approach and instead, rely on memorizing things and being tested on that or writing essays. If that's ALL you are used to, you may have issues going forward in your schooling. Cheers, hope this helps. ",2020-07-04 05:02:26

Most of the time, I hit a wall when I am expected to code it even though I understand the physics behind it as most of these papers come without the code.

917,glt8s2,False,Advice,2,What should I have learned by this point in my CS career?,computerscience,"I just finished my second year of my bachelor's in computer science. So far, I've only taken 5 CS related classes (the other ones being math requirements and general Ed's). So far I've taken Intro to CS, where they taught me about the parts of a computer, the history of computers, and an intro to logic circuits, Boolean algebra, binary operations and pseudocode. Then I took Principles of CS I, which was basically a C++ course and the last thing we learned was classes and inheritance. Next, I took Principles II, which was the same as Principles I, except that it was C# this time, and we got into object oriented programming. I also took Object Oriented using Java, which was the same as the previous two but using Java. Finally, I took discrete math, and towards the end of that class, we were studying trees, and in one particular example our professor mentioned something about search algorithms, and that we should've been familiarized with those since the majority of us were taking Principles II at the same time as discrete math. The thing is that we never studied such thing in Principles II, so I don't know if my math teacher was wrong, or if our other professor didn't teach us what he should've been teaching us. He was somewhat of a substitute teacher for the last two semesters since the original CS professor retired, and they didn't have enough time to find a replacement. Is this all that I should know at this point? Or am I falling behind because of my professor?

TLDR: Basically I've only learned some C++, C# and Java programming and discrete math at the end of my second year studying CS.

12,h9w9wa,False,General,8,Productive Summer Plan,computerscience,"Hey guys,

My name is Danyal Imran and I am a computer scientist who's currently pursuing MBA. I have 3+ years of professional experience, and during my professional tenure, a lot of the people I knew were excited on how I approach and solve problems. I've received many awards for my performance, and was a also between an HR battle when I decided to switch my job (because React over Angular any day).

This pandemic has given me an amazing opportunity, and finally I have decided to start my own YouTube channel (Trust me, I am all for quality content that's going to help y'all in the long run). I am quiet dedicated because I love this field, so I expect you to see the following courses in the next 2 months:

**101 - Programming Fundamental**: This course will focus on problem solving and logic building using C programming language (Yes, C language, because it teaches you how to think, and this is the main problem that I see people facing. Many people don't realize that programming is actually solving problems rather than learning the latest hit programming language.. Trust me, programming languages are very similar and its not hard to learn them)

**102 - Object Oriented Programming**: This course will focus on the OOP paradigm on how to properly structure and code your problems. Here the complexity of the problem is going to be quiet big, and you can code actual real life problem but without a GUI (Maybe an intro to Swing for GUI if Java? idk that yet). The course will either use C++, C#, or Java (haven't decided that yet)

**103 - Data Structures**: So far you know how to think about a problem and solve it. Now you're going to think about how to handle data i.e. storage, read, write, sort, etc. You'll amazed to learn what a data structure can do to make a program fun faster. I will also dive into a language's built in data structure so that you know what a language provides and how you'll be saving your time.

**104 - Design & Analysis of Algorithms**: Finally, we reach at a course that talks about writing efficient code, yes efficient i.e. the best possible solution for a problem. If you are good with Algorithms, you can easily ace top 100 tech company coding interviews because this differentiates a good coder from a great coder.

These courses will include (and are not limited to): Theoretic & Practical Lectures, Assignments (Solved & Unsolved), Projects, Links to Coding Websites, Links to Exciting Articles, and many more

These courses are generally for people starting out their journey in Computer Science, or people who have problems in solving tasks (telling computers what and how to do it). Once you complete these 4 courses, you can then plan your career in any field (Mobile, Gaming, Web, etc.), because this is what it takes to be a programmer.

The first course should be out 2 weeks from now.

If I am done with the aforementioned courses, the following courses are in my future plans:

105 - Databases (SQL & NoSQL)

201 - Web Development (Front-end: React, Back-end: Node)

301 - Artificial Intelligence

302 - Data Science

401 - Cloud Computing",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/h9w9wa/productive_summer_plan/,12,That's a lot of planning!

When considering internal vs external drives, does this remain the same?

I’m in the financial industry, we encrypt laptop drives and auto-comb networked storage drives for PII and move it to an encrypted file server. We also deal with encryption at the file level depending on what it is, on those same encrypted drives. Just slows down IO is all. Absolutely fine to encrypt an external, in fact you can buy purpose built encrypted externals and USB.

Edit: pasted the course components on here

 

**Component 01 – Computer Systems**  
This component will introduce students to the internal workings of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the exchange of data and will also look at software development, data types and legal and ethical issues. It will also offer the opportunity for students to analyse and design algorithms, and to study different types of software together with the methodologies that are used to develop them. This component involves advanced mathematics, including the representation and normalisation of floating-point numbers, the simplification of Boolean expressions, the use of two’s complement to represent numbers in binary, and using rules to derive or simplify Boolean expressions.

**Component 02 – Algorithms and Programming**  
This component will incorporate and build on the knowledge and understanding gained in component 01. In addition, you will study:

* What is meant by computational thinking
* The benefits of applying computational thinking to solving a wide variety of problems
* The principles of solving problems by computational methods
* Using algorithms to describe problems
* Analysing a problem by identifying its component parts

This component focuses heavily on the reading and writing of complex algorithms including Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and the A\* algorithm. Again, Mathematics is a feature of this unit, including the use of Big-O notation to assess the complexity, in terms of time and space, of an algorithm.

**Component 03 – Programming Project**  
Students will be expected to analyse, design, develop, test, evaluate and document a program written in C# using the Unity development environment. The underlying approach to the project is to apply the principles of computational thinking to a practical coding problem. Students are expected to apply appropriate principles from an agile development approach to the project development. This project is independent, meaning students will need to debug their program and spend time focused on the development of a complex piece of software.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ggigti/trying_to_get_a_head_start_on_my_alevel_course/,1,"Definitely just dive in.

I consulted with my sister—who's a software engineering major—and she suggested that ""positive"" might not be the best choice, but I definitely want to convey the idea that this message means ""yes"" or ""go"" or something. We came up with ""single affirmative binary value,"" but thought it sounded a little pretentious.

But I can already tell you that distributed is mainly used by the majority of big compagnie (Oracle, Google ect) because it is definitely more efficient and it scales a lot better with huge data.

There are multiple reasons distributed is the viable solution:
- you can distribute the data around strategic location, so if the main server is in USA but one of the yt video is viral in France, it would be a lot better to keep it on a European server.
- having everything on one server forces is not viable when you have million of user, the network on the server side will quickly become a bottleneck. Having multiples server allows to split the connections on different location and not surcharge a the server bandwidth.
- if the task is heavy and can be parallelized you can multiply the processing speed by the number of servers you have (kind of). This can work for huge database, example if you search for all people named ""Bob"". Server 1 could search for Bob on the first half of the data and server 2 on the second half.

This is over simplified and in practice distributed servers is way more complicated and behave way differently for every application, but I hope I was clear enough and that I didn't say anything wrong. ",2020-06-06 09:03:13

916,g37c3c,False,Advice,7,Having Doubts About My Computer Science Degree,computerscience,"Since high school my(19, Second Year) plan was to go to school to double major in Computer Science (CS) and Musical Theatre(MT). Two different fields I know but hear me out.

I first started with just to major in CS since I was intrested in computers; built my first pc at age 13 but wasn't that familiar with software. My family always said things along the line of ""Hey you'll make good money."" or ""You'll get a good job if you stick with it."" Then thorugh a series of events I joined the theatre department in HS and I fell in love with it. Ended up doing my first musical outside the school and from there I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.

I wanted to major in MT in college, parents said that I could so long I got a degree in CS also to back it up or to fall back on. I agreed, devised a plan that I would get my degree, work as a Web Developer scheduling my own time and going out for auditions for productions after graduation. That or going to graduate school for theatre while working web development.

Fast forward to college, my first two semesters were spent i gen-eds, getting pre-reqs done for CS and taking Theatre and Dance courses, (eventually picked up a Dance minor as i grew to love it also).

My abilities in MT grew expenetially while I waited on CS courses, fast forward to last semester and I took my first CS course Introduction to Python and did decently in it; struggled but I understood it. It helped that I had a really good professor to boot.

This semester however, I am taking Introduction to Object Oriented Design with a professor who, while nice, isn't a great teacher at all (Sitting at a 1 on Rate My Profesor). Took her session of the class as I had a mandatory class with MT in a time period with arguably a better proffessor. She instructed us in BlueJ instead of Eclipse as she found it to be easier, but its not the greatest enviornment. In class lectures are slow and would drag on, content itself was difficult to understand, and the assignments feel exsessive.

I could get by before with the information provided in class. Now since COVID-19 and classes being online, the class has become way worse. We'll meet as a class for roughly half-hour and the professor won't go over the subject matter for the week. Instead she goes over assignments that are due for the week and if you have a question she can answer it. Leaving to read the text book for going over the subject matter. I feel like I'm teaching myself here and barely understanding it. I want to ask a question but I feel as if i don't know enough to even know what I'm asking. I'll go through the whole chapter, taking notes on everything covered and still not understand it. When I get stuck on our weekly labs, I end up getting frustrated and going to stack overflow to find the exact same assignments and how they solved it.

I feel liek a fraud. I've lost motivation for the class and the major itself, I want to drop it or maybe change to a minor. I feel if I'm struggling in something that should be basic, then how can I be successful at all down the line? The major has also been taking time away from my Musical Theatre Studies and vice versa. I feel like I'm half-assing both at this point and filled with constant doubt in both areas. My work ethic and enthusium my freshman year was so much higher compared to now. The past week I've even had night terrors about this. Running around my campus in an endless loop because I left my backpack somewhere. Last night, I had one where I decided to go back to HS in order to relearn basic stuff becuase I didn't feel good enough.

I still want to stick to my plan but is it at all realistic? Should I choose what I love doing and soley focus and knowing I'll make it work? Or should I stick with CS the notion that I'll be financially secure even if I'll struggle to find a job that'll take someone like me.

edit: Well, looks like I have alot of thinking to do, thank you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/g37c3c/having_doubts_about_my_computer_science_degree/,7,"I went to acting school, got a BFA in drama. Now I'm getting my masters in CS.

Personally, I love CS because it makes sense to me. I got out of theatre because it doesn't make sense. Not talking about the classroom - there was always catharsis and profound meaning there. But out in the world that's a lot harder to find.

I have tons of friends who couldn't live without their theatre lives, and that's great. But there is a myth that in order to be a ""successful artist"" you have to kill yourself for your art - that's the only thing you can do. In fact, whether or not you like it, you will *have* to do something else to make a living. There just isn't money in art. ...You know, until you're famous. Spoiler alert: you won't be. You have to be ok with that.

So my suggestion: if you love your art, don't give it up. If you enjoy CS, let that be your survival job. If you hate CS, find something else to survive on.

Either love your work or allow your work to enable what you love. Both are valid paths in life. Just be realistic about the world waiting for you with an art degree.

(Sorry I can't help with your struggles in CS classes. But being in art school and surrounded by this do or die ethos was so toxic. Don't get sucked into the myths.) ",2020-04-17 18:14:14

I am looking to implement a multiple producer single consumer (MPSC) circular buffer in c++. I was wandering if I can implement a more generic case of Multiple Producer Multiple Consumer (MPMC) circular buffer that could also be used for specific case of MPSC. Will using a MPMC circular buffer create a large overhead for MPSC case, that can be avoided if I was to instead implement a MPSC circular buffer?

If anyone has any experience with this or knows of some resources that I can use, I would be grateful if you could share some insight. 

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hfx307/multiple_producer_single_consumer_circular_buffer/,2,"This appears to be a synchronization problem. You need to ensure that only one producer writes to the buffer at the same time. Therefore you need to ensure that the function that adds value to the buffer and moves current pointer to the next is atomic (meaning it always either finishes or doesn't start at all and is not interrupted).

My suggestion is to generate references and save them into buffer because copying value might create too much latency and causes a massive backlog.

So that's all about creating a buffer. Now to a single consumer. You're rightfully wondering whether singe consumer is going to be enough to keep the buffer from overflowing and I think we either do not have enough information or it is only possible to learn that by actually trying.

212,gz81p3,False,Discussion,7,Tracking Politician’s Records on Propositions of and Votes for Bills,computerscience,"(Posting for a friend)

Hello all,

 

We are a group of computer science students that can’t protest for different reasons (for instance, I live with someone who is immunocompromised and so can’t risk contracting coronavirus).

 

We have been donating to some organizations, signing petitions, and educating ourselves about systemic racism in the US. However, we want to use our expertise to do more.

 

Here, we present an idea and ask Reddit to help us determine if it’s useful and its potential flaws. We emphasize that we just want to help, so if you know of something we could do that could help more, please let us know.

 

 

**The Idea**

 

We want to find bills and acts that support ending police brutality (and perhaps divide these bills into different categories, such as the 10 categories defined [here](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/solutions#solutionsoverview) ) and display the voting records of house representatives and senators on those bills.

We could make this data open-source and provide visualizations for the data, allowing other websites to use it as they see fit.

 

Hopefully, this could better inform voters about what real action politicians have taken in support of the BLM movement.

 

We could do this in the following steps:

1.         Aggregate voting data for house representatives and senators in a JSON file and post publicly on Github

2.         Have humans look over bills and try to determine if they support one of the 10 causes given in the link above. (This would be subjective, so we would need to be careful; we know some legal experts willing to lend help, though). Create a list of bills and acts for each cause.

3.         Using the JSON data and the lists of bills and acts, create some visualizations or tables that make it easy to see which politicans voted for which bills and to what degree they support ending police brutality.

**Potential Issues**

 

Any data we obtain from Step 2 would have to be treated with extreme caution given: A) the subjectivity of determining whether or not a bill supports a cause and B) that voting for a bill which supports one issue does not imply that the voter cares about that issue (they may have voted for the bill because of another issue, and may feel indifferent about or oppose the issue in question)

In my experience, the way that they taught the classes and concepts were all in different coding languages- every semester we learned a new language, from C to C++ to OCaml to Java and so on. I feel like I was just trying to cram and keep up with classes, which caused me to lack the depth in each language since I was just trying to pass the classes (stacking like 4 CS classes each semester) so I could graduate on time. The lack of depth hits hard when I'm faced with simple tasks like creating a simple program to do \_\_\_ or coding challenges that are open ended.

All the projects that I've done is through my classes- no internship, no side projects- and the projects that I've done have mostly been really small ones with a lot of help and backbone code provided to the students. The projects also lacked application to the real world and were simply stuff that taught us like algorithms and operating system concepts.

DO: Format your code. Make it readable so you can understand it when looking back at it. Some IDE’s can do this for you, but some can’t. 

DO: Use functions. A way to write code once and use it multiple times, every time your program calls that function.

DO: Use a programming language based on its intended paradigm.

DO NOT: Please don’t make your code messy. I regret every piece of messy code I’ve ever made for this simple reason: I can’t look back at it and retrace my steps. I can’t look at it and know what it even does. And that just defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? If the only way to find out what it does is to run it, you’re doing something wrong. 

DO NOT: Name your functions “function1”, “function2” and “function3”. Eventually you’ll have to look for the function that does X, and check every single function for if it does X. It’s a terrible process. Name your functions by what they do. “makeNewPizza”, “convertPizzaToHamburger” and “eatTheHamburger”.

Please help and explain!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fowt4x/constructor_vs_setter/,2,"Setters are a somewhat ""common practice"" but they are ordinary member functions in C++.

Constructors are specialized member functions specified by C++ language standards. For a given object instance, they are guaranteed to run **before any other member function** and they will **run only once**. They get the instance ""ready for business"".

224,gqi2c0,False,Discussion,13,"What are some things you love and hate about different programming languages, and what do you wish some programming languages would incorporate?",computerscience,"Hey guys, I have decided to take on the endeavor of creating a programming language and writing my own compiler (I would refer to this [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools#Second_edition) if you want to as well). I'm really just doing this as a personal project to improve my skills, and really just because I want to see if I can do it.

I would love to hear different opinions about what you think should or should not be incorporated in different programming languages. If someone leaves a comment saying that 'X' is awful, and no language should ever use it, but you think that 'X' is lovely and is quite useful, please, reply to their comment *respectfully* and give your opinion on the subject.

Here are a few things I think I would like to see incorporated in more languages (and maybe I will try to incorporate them in my own language):

* Unary '+' operator. Similar to the unary '-' operator, which just negates a number (like -2). But this operator would efficiently return the absolute value of negative numbers (but no regard to the efficiency of returning the absolute value of already positive numbers). 
* Range of numbers (such as 0..9 would be integers from 0 to 9). One possible application of this could be in switch statements (like case 0..9: for instance). See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-range-switch-case-cc/).
* Identity operator. Essentially the '===' in JavaScript, which compares the value as well as the type. See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality_operators).
* Varargs. Functions with a variable amount of arguments. Such as in Java. See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-arguments-varargs-in-java/).

If you disagree with anything I have listed above, feel free to comment your thoughts about it. Although my list is mostly adding operators and other symbols that have meaning, this discussion is open to any and everything about programming languages! Feel free to discuss syntax, semantics, anything!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gqi2c0/what_are_some_things_you_love_and_hate_about/,10,"I dislike the overload of bracket types, in c++ you use (), {},[] and <> regularly! these could all just be () and no problem for the parser.

I dislike confusing uncertain types, in python integers are VERY complicated and i've never met a python developer who seems to have a good handle on them, also in c++ some integer types are ambiguous (just how large is int or size_t?) i prefer my languages be explicit with types names like vec4f64.

Also i think it's important than the language be semiparsible at 'compile' time to allow for proper code editing tools like autocomplete.

Ultimately i for one am ready to switch to visual programming, as soon as they are fast and capable enough, untill then it's c++ and asm ",2020-05-25 19:57:13

To be fair, the later part of the course got kinda butchered due to online learning and my professor being old and incoherent.

I recently started learning about attribute closure, but i have a question that i have spent days looking for the answer to, but cannot find.

If i have the functional dependencies 

AB->CD and 
C-> EF

When finding the attribute closure of {AB}, would the closure be ABCDEF or just ABCD?

The main difference im confused about is if i can take a single letter that is part of multiple letters, an example is the CD, and then convert just the C into EF, such that 

AB->EFD?

Each player must outwit their opponent and make a path with their coloured tiles, either yellow or blue, to connect the two opposite sides of the 18-squared tile board. The first to create a pathway that reaches the other side is the winner! each player starts with 30 small tiles that are three squares long, one medium tile that is four squares long and one long tile that is five squares in length. To begin the blue player places one tile of their choice anywhere on the board. The yellow player then places a tile anywhere on the board and this continues until one player creates a pathway connecting their opposite sides of the board and is crowned the winner! players can start as many new paths as they want to, a new tile does not have to touch earlier tiles that have been placed. You cannot put a tile on top of your opponent’s tile but you can be clever and block their path. ",2020-07-13 07:31:55

What about your classmates that are aspiring theoreticians? I suspect they enjoy and value learning about these topics, and would moan if every course was industry-oriented. They would be right to, also, because a computer science degree is not a software engineering degree. ",2019-07-16 10:31:28
