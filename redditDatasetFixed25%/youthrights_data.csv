I enjoy expressing my opinions because personally, I like to believe they're well thought out and expressed (all though I might be wrong) yet, often on a daily basis not only myself, but my fellow peers at school who I consider intelligent, are constantly put down and degraded by varying adults. Of course this doesn't apply to everyone, (for example my English teacher is very supportive of his students' opinions and statements) but it does apply to many others, it's as if we're not allowed to have the right to be treated as humans? Feel free to go through it yourself, but last time I checked, the convention of children's rights says specifically that all children have the right to an opinion and for it to be taken seriously, but how often is that respected? I understand that some of the kids actually are the stereotypical mindless children that we're portrayed as, but shouldn't most adults be smart enough not to jump to conclusions and make assumptions towards every kid out there? So to the question I put in the title, how can I help change this mindset? Do I continue to explain this the way I did previously to others? How can I transcribe to the person that myself and others feel this way? I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

2-minute video intro: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804)

Brief summary:

* They're *democracies*. Every kid gets one vote. The kid literally *hire and fire their own teachers.*
* There's *no curriculum*. Just show up everyday and learn whatever you want to learn. Seriously. So long as it's not downright illegal, learn *whatever you want*.  Learn about jellyfish if that's your thing. Learn about space travel.  Teach yourself guitar or something. Or just hang around and talk to  people! It's all up to you! You have *freedom*.
* There are *no grades*.  If you really want to, you can ask someone to judge your work. But  that's not the default. The default is...just...do stuff. No grades. No  tests. We trust you. It's fine.
* Yes,  Sudbury kids get into college just fine! Turns out colleges are super  open-minded about this. Sudbury schools have been running since 1968 and  they've surveyed adult graduates and they're doing *awesome* (on average, at least).

I  REALLY WISH I HAD GONE TO A SUDBURY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. If you  are a teenager reading this post, especially if you're creative and  free-spirited and you love learning but you hate the school system, then congratulations, *I am you from the future*. (Not literally, but, ya know, there's a strong parallel here). And I'm telling you, *don't* stress yourself like crazy trying to get good grades in conventional schools. Take care  of your mental health and *seek freedom*.

You're not crazy. The school is crazy.

\*hugs\* (if you want hugs)

196,98gzsw,False,,0,The Truth About Moving Out Early,YouthRights,"INTRODUCTION

I am here to tell you the truth about moving out early. By ""early,"" I mean at an age before legal adulthood. No, don't ""run away."" Move out. It's not the same thing, and you can move out early if you need to or just very much want to.

SHOULD I?

Only you know that.

You are the world's foremost expert on your own life. Other people may have views, and you may choose to take those views on board, but you are the only person who truly knows the experience of being you and living your life. This is your decision, both inherently and because there's no one better qualified to make it.

WHEN SHOULD I?

If you need to move out, you will want to do so as soon as possible. So when is it possible?

In the practical sense, it's possible when you have a steady income sufficient to take care of your basic needs and a little extra. For most of us, that means a reliable job. In addition to the steady income, you'll need a moving-out fund with enough money to set up your own household in the first place -- for instance, to rent most apartments, you'll need \*two\* months' rent and a damage deposit, so that (for example) an apartment which rents for $800/month may actually cost $1700 to move into. There is plenty of planning and budgeting help available on the Internet, to help you get an idea of how much you'll need.

HOW CAN I?

There are several approaches. First, let's look at this emancipation business.

In a rare example of truthfulness, the process of turning from a ""minor"" into a full citizen is called ""emancipation."" It happens automatically on an arbitrary birthday (the 18th in most U.S. states, but a little higher in a few), but there are other ways to become emancipated. One is emancipation upon marriage. Some states allow this. It's not a good escape plan, though, because you would likely need your parents' permission to marry in the first place.

In more than half the states, there is a legal process through which you can be emancipated by court order. This is difficult, time-consuming, and usually expensive, but it's also inarguable. If that option interests you, here's a web site to start you on the process:

[https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html](https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html)

If early emancipation isn't looking too doable, your options are limited. Consider whether you can wait it out, detaching emotionally, saving up money and acquiring skills until you reach the designated birthday. If you simply cannot tolerate it, you have one other option for moving out without being emancipated.

It is this: just do it.

I sought emancipation at 17. When I went for legal advice, the lawyer advised me not to bother with court proceedings. She pointed out -- correctly, as it turned out -- that no cop with an ounce of sense would waste his time retrieving a ""runaway"" who was living in an apartment, working, attending college, and otherwise living a normal life.

That's exactly what I did. I saved money, packed my personal items, and moved into an apartment with a roommate. My mother thought that I ""couldn't"" move out until my eighteenth birthday, as if my age were somehow physically preventing me, and didn't quite know what to do when it turned out that no mysterious force prevented me from signing leases, packing clothing, and performing all the other tasks of moving. 

In some states, this is even legally protected. In Oregon, for example, people become ""young adults"" at age 15, and this comes with a few rights. One is the right not to be kidnapped by your parents. If young Oregonians are in a safe location and prefer to remain where they are, the police will not drag them back to their parents' house just because the parents want them to. In other states, no court has jurisdiction to order you hauled back by force. You really should talk to a lawyer if possible, but if not, you can research the relevant laws yourself \[ [https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What\_Are\_the\_Laws\_on\_Teenagers\_Leaving\_Home](https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What_Are_the_Laws_on_Teenagers_Leaving_Home) \] .

In a few states, this is \*how\* you become emancipated. For instance, Minnesota has no court order of emancipation, but young people are regarded as emancipated once they begin to function as adults \[ [https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz](https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz) \] . This is a pretty sweet system, because individual Minnesotans can begin living their own lives as soon as they are individually able instead of passively waiting for an arbitrary birthday.

Remember the part where I said that my own moving-out went fairly smoothly, because my mother wasn't sure how to stop me? That's common -- many parents have thought no further than ""you're not allowed,"" and have no backup plan to enforce it -- but it's not universal. Some parents would rather fight than accept, and some have come up with fairly effective methods.

They may physically trap you in their home, for example. This is a terrible shame, because there's really no way to interact with them as family after they've done that. At that point, you must regard them as your captors. If there's a chance your parents might do this, you must keep your moving-out supplies and funds either off-site or on your person, and you mustn't tell them where you'll be living. This stinks, in part because it does start to feel like ""running away"" instead of moving out, but if you're being held prisoner by anyone, any self-respecting person should try to escape.

I heard of a young woman whose parents did this. She then moved out in the earliest morning, to an unknown location, leaving a letter saying that she might contact them after her eighteenth birthday. She did write to them when nineteen years old, but apparently still doesn't feel safe seeing them in person (and I don't blame her, since they used the letter to stir up their ""missing person"" case again). It's a shame that they can't even see each other at Christmas, but the parents wanted a war, and they got one.

I heard of another young woman whose parents forced her to move back in with them by wrecking her life. They showed up at her workplace and caused scenes, repeatedly, until she was fired. When she found another job, they simply did it again. Eventually she was forced to move back in with them because she couldn't keep a job and so couldn't pay her rent. The only other option she saw was homelessness.

She did have other options. If she had understood that her parents were declaring war and that she had to fight back to defend herself, she could have documented their harrassment, and then charged them with harrassment and/or sought a restraining order. She could also have moved to a different city, so that they couldn't harrass her so easily. I don't look down on her for not having the strength and energy to win that war -- nobody wins them all -- but I mention these other options as a way of pointing out that options usually exist.

Pettier harrassment is fairly common. My mother used to call every night to try to push me into eating dinner at my parents' house. Literally. Every. Single. Night. The goal was presumably to harrass me until I gave in, then continue pushing me into living more and more of my life under her roof, until my own apartment sat empty. Instead, I simply stopped answering the phone during the relevant block of time.

Other family members may be enlisted to try to make you feel guilty for hurting or abandoning or whatevering your parents. They are unlikely to listen to reason, so you're probably better off with non-responses like ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" If they won't stop, you may need to minimize contact with your relatives until they've learned to accept the new reality.

In conclusion, you can move out at any age. Often it's even legal, but even when it isn't, it's possible. If it's what's best for you -- and you are the \*only\* person who can know that -- then make your own choice and go for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/98gzsw/the_truth_about_moving_out_early/,14,,2018-08-19 02:19:06

My friend, who is 16, is a high honor roll student with a spotless record of any wrong doings. She's taking college courses and is expected to graduate high school a year earlier than her peers. She has two older brothers, one 19 year old pill-popping drug dealer (well known, popular drug dealer) who lives out on his own. The other brother is a 22 year old heroin addict who also lives out of the parents house, hopping from one friends house to another. Both brothers have a long history of criminal mischief. Her mother works at a well known University and her father is away for work 90% of the time. They are both absolutely, positively insane. My friend is under lock and key CONSTANTLY and suffers psychological abuse on a daily basis, for the past three years. She has no friends because her parents run full background checks on everyone she comes into contact with. She cannot have friends who have ever had a boyfriend, she cannot have friends that will not give up they're cell phone for inspection upon entering the house. She cannot be friends with anybody that is older than her. She is not allowed to go to family reunions because her mother is afraid of ""being embarrassed"" and she isn't allowed outside for anything other than school. Her mother constantly calls her names, calls her fat and puts her down. Her phone is blocked so she can text only her parents. She has a secret cell phone she messages me off of and that's how we communicate. (No iPods, computers allowed). Her father has a history of drinking and blames her for his habits. He also physically abused her. We got Children and Youth involved which proved to be totally useless. They told her parents ahead of time that they would be coming to ""inspect"" so they had days to prepare a story and clean up the house. The agent spoke to the mother first and believed every single lie that came out of her mouth. They didnt even meet the father, who was away for work. Children and Youth then recommended they just see a family counselor, which her mother never did and C&Y didn't follow up on any of it. Recently, her father was picking her up from her baby sitters house (yep, baby sitter for the 16 year old) and told her to hurry up 'or else' and sent a picture of his gun. She talked to guidance counselors at school and brought up the gun situation. The counselor then called children in youth and has left at least three messages. What can my friend do to get authorities involved that will take her seriously? How can she get out of the house to enjoy a normal life? What can be done about her parents?
Side notes: -she called the police on her drug dealer brother once before, the cops went to the parents and told them she did so (she requested to be anonymous) and the parents went and helped him clean up his apartment and no police investigation ensued. -BOTH brothers are treasured by the parents and they do they're best to keep them out of jail. (They have friends at our local police dept) -her mother won't take her to therapy appointments. -my friend has begged the counselor to tell the next children and youth agent to talk to her first before her mother, but who knows what'll happen.
I'm sorry if this is poorly written, and I probably left even more instances out, but I'm at work and will review this post when I get home.

I'm a dad of two little girls. I've always been a strong advocate of treating kids with respect and honor - they are, after all, no less human beings than any adult.

However, there *is* a learning curve here. I'm a firm believer that if most parents would just spend more time with their kids, that alone would sort out most discipline problems. I see this in my own kids. We don't own a television - instead, we read books together. I write stories with them. We play games. We go outside to the park. I spend a lot of time with them outside of work, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom.

At the same time, there are some things that they decide to do that are completely unacceptable. The oldest cannot hit her sister. It is unacceptable to throw toys at us when it's time to eat dinner and they don't like the food being served. It is unacceptable to steal toys from other children.

My wife and I try very hard not to become angry and blow up in these situations. We tell our children to go sit on the bed for a bit and think about what they've done. This also gives us time to cool off. Then we go in and sit down with them, explain to them that what they did was wrong, that it was hurtful, and that they ought not do it.

Sometimes that works.

Sometimes, they decide to start screaming at us.

Sometimes, they tell us they won't do it, again - and then they make it into a habit.

Any number of things can happen.

So sometimes, I have to sit them down again - and talk to them. And sometimes, we have to confiscate things. We have to discipline.

Our children are usually extremely well behaved. But when we do have to discipline them, they definitely think we're being mean. They think it's unfair. They think we're enforcing rules that just don't make sense.

Now, I'm completely willing to hear their side of the argument. I *want them* to tell me why they think I'm wrong, why they think they should be allowed to act as they have.

But ultimately, as the parents, I *do* have to make decisions - not only for their wellbeing, but also for the wellbeing of others. They simply cannot be allowed to harm others or take the possessions of others or things like that.

Am I mean to discipline? Am I mean to sit down and ""force"" them to have a conversation about these things?

I've been chastised by psychologists for my ""mean"" parenting before. Even though I'm quite certain I grant our kids a great deal more freedom than most parents probably do. I also expect them to act responsibly and loving toward others as a result of the freedom that's been granted to them. And I will not hesitate to speak with them about how we ought to act toward our fellow men and women.

Different kids require different parenting techniques, though. I think our approach to parenting is quite modest in terms of the discipline we actually mete out. I know others who have to be a bit heavier with the discipline. Some basically don't have to discipline their kids at all.

If I'm an adult, and I steal or harm another person, that will result in my own discipline. I am uncertain why such rules shouldn't apply (to some extent) within the household. I don't think that makes parents mean. That makes them good parents who are trying to raise decent human beings.

I would like to know what parents *should* be doing more than what people have a problem with them doing. And I'd like to know *specifics*. If they're suggesting that beating your kid is wrong - well, hell, I agree with that 100%. But if they're saying that even modest forms of discipline are ""mean"" - I absolutely disagree.

Anyway. Those are my thoughts. I don't think it's a very helpful article. I'd love to see something like this with real substance, though. It could be very interesting. ",2013-02-08 19:05:37

Translation provided by /u/paninomatic

""
**Lawsuit filed against rabbi for circumcising kids**
**Because of the circumcision of kids a doctor out of Hesse filed a lawsuit against a rabbi out of Hof. It seems to be the first lawsuit because of a religious circumcision in Bavaria.**

The prosecutor of Hof confirmed to the Bavarian broadcasting service that a doctor filed a lawsuit although the chief public prosecutor of Hof says it is still uncertain if it's going to be investigated. The rabbi learned about the lawsuit through the broadcasting service. He perceives it as ""anti-semitism"".

**Man already conducted 3,000 circumcisions**

On his web page the rabbi points out that circumcision is a Jewish ritual. He reports to already have conducted 3,000 circumcisions on kids and adults. He reports to the broadcasting service though, that the last circumcision in Hof has been done more than a year ago.

**Religious circumcision criticized**

According to information of the broadcasting service the doctor from Hesse is part of a group of about 600 medical professionals and lawyers which wrote an open letter to the federal government in July. In this letter they request to make the debate about religious circumcision more objective.

**Mental and physical damage**

The letter quotes: ""The freedom of religion can not be used as an excuse for the application of sexual force against minor males."" It further states that because of the high risks of lasting genital damage and mental and sexual impairments caused through circumcising babies and small children, the public perception has to be sharpened.

330,l6yek,False,,32,What do you guys think of the age of consent?,YouthRights,"I lost my virginity at 14, and when my parents found out, they threatened to put my boyfriend in jail. I still don't regret the decision, as I haven't gotten pregnant since then, and I feel I was mature enough to handle it.

I'm married now (to a different guy), but I'm still only 17, which means that technically my husband can be jailed for possessing nude pictures of me.

What does r/YouthRights think about this issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/l6yek/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_age_of_consent/,10,"I know this is an old thread, but you folks don't seem to have many readers or much activity, so I figure someone's still browsing it.

Are you in the US?  I thought that here in the States, at least, most of the states, you could not be legally married if you were under 18.

That's not to say you can't get married.  I mean, marriage is just a piece of paper, financial obligations, tax breaks and a metal band after all (unless you're of the religious influence I suppose?).  That just means that the state and federal governments would not recognize the marriage until both parties turn 18.  It probably doesn't affect either participant in the relationship, though, since most teens aren't full-time employees with a meaningful tax status.

As far as the age of consent, I lost my virginity before I was 17.  I think I was 15 or maybe 16?  Been a while...  Anyway, the age of consent isn't really something that's there to say ""you're ready for sex at 17.  No younger, no older.""  It's really there to keep pervs from abusing emotionally and mentally immature people.  Our brains develop, in some cases, into our early 20's, so it's fair to assume that the tip of the bell curve in means of emotional and intellectual maturity, someone who is 16 years old is immature and can be taken advantage of.

I don't see a problem with that part.  When people start abusing the system to put otherwise innocent people in jail, then it starts being an issue.  Unfortunately, if you are under 18 your parents can decide to press charges against your will.  That seems incorrect.  If the participants relative to the sexual relations decline the right to press charges, then the case should be tossed out.


A lot of folks have brought up voting as well.  I will say this:  my views turned around in my early twenties.  I mean, my views on basically everything.  Getting out of college and gaining some experience in the real world while making it on my own really taught me some things.  I do believe that teens don't have the real-world experience to sort out their thoughts yet, so maybe voting should remain delayed until you are 18.

In high school it's easy to form opinions on many things, but without actually experiencing those things you can't really have a true idea of what they are.  For example, as you will find out I'm sure, you can have the nicest, shiniest degree in your field along with a perfect 4.0 GPA and as more references than you can count, but it doesn't mean shit to anyone until you have some experience in your field.  

Learning about something does not make one an expert.  Learning about a thing only lends knowledge about its topic.  That knowledge was likely imbued with some sort of bias, since it was taught and not experienced.  Once you experience that thing for yourself, only then can you have a true feeling for what it envelopes and form your own, personal opinions.  

Like I said, my views have changed on EVERYTHING since I was a teenager and those alterations came from experience. ",2011-10-10 11:12:06
