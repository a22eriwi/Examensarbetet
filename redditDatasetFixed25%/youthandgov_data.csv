38,46xa9w,False,,2,Conduction primary research on the youth vote,YouthandGovernment,"Hello guys, My name is Daniel and I am a political science major at the university of central florida. I am currently conducting a research paper about the lack of youth vote in this country. I aim to analyze the literate activity of voting as a youth citizen, discover what motivates us to vote, and what steps can be made to increase our turnout. So with that being said I have gone to reddit to conduct primary research on my peers and see exactly how they feel about the subject. Below I have presented some questions for you guys to answer, along with some basic information about yourself, in order to help me get a better idea as to how our generation (ages 18-29) feels about the subject. Your time is valued and appreciated. 

Basic info (all optional):
Name-
age-
town-
Race-
Education level-
wealth class-

Questions: 

1. Do you plan on voting this presidential election? (why or why not)

2. Do you plan on voting this mid-term election? (why or why not) 

3. do you think voting is important? (why or why not)

4. why do you think we as youth do not vote?

5. do you feel as though the government puts enough emphasis on getting youth to vote?

6. Do you believe the government wants to do anything about this ""problem""

7. What do you think the government could do to get us to vote more?

I hope **[youth will vote](http://www.smartpaperhelp.com/blog/millenials-vote-democrats-vs-republicans)** also. Voting is important because it keeps the government in check by following what the people actually want for their country. Surveys have shown that young people especially do not take as much interest in nor do they have much knowledge about politics, which is a grave error since in 20+ years, they will be the leaders of the nation.
