921,grpawu,False,,73,What are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy?,NeutralPolitics,"Current SS benefits eligibility starts at 62, with greater amounts if you don't take until later. In it's current form, many individuals may be getting the short end of the stick in social security by never reaping benefits or reaping it for much fewer years than average. Conversely, some people may get benefits for 40+ years. These discrepancies can be seen not just individually but also in demographics when broken down by race and gender:

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf - White and hispanic women live about a decade longer than black men

http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412943-Has-Social-Security-Redistributed-to-Whites-from-People-of-Color-.PDF - Money is being distributed from PoC to whites

https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p59.pdf - ""Minorities and Social Security: An Analysis of Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Current Program""

These individual and demographic discrepancies could be mitigated by attributing life expectancy (as in years left to live, not as in expected age of death) as triggers for social security benefits, or taken into consideration along with age for social security eligibility. Here is a table of life expectancy for Americans based on age and sex, for an example of what I mean (much more than age and sex could be taken into consideration): https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

417,bvlsua,False,,99,Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?,NeutralPolitics,"Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](
https://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes?

""Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).""

While the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why

[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.

Additionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.

The ""zero tolerance"" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that ""[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/).

On the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because ""the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held"", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested.

I use evil here instead of naming certain parties to keep this neutral. Evil being the opposite party you don't want to win.

So for example, if Trump is Republican candidate, Hillary is Democratic, it wouldn't serve Hillary's campaign (or liberals) for Bernie to run independent because in the event of a statistical tie, the House would vote for Trump. However, if someone like Bloomberg ran independent, the vote tied, the house would choose Bloomberg or Trump.  It won't help Hillary for a third party candidate who can draw real votes to run in this election.  Best case scenario for Hillary would be to get a crazy-strong VP (normally VP's don't determine campaigns but if they're really strong and well known do drive voters, i.e. Bernie's voters, this could make Hillary's campaign stronger and bring out the vote).

148,8u152w,False,,97,"What happens now with the ""Travel Ban""?",NeutralPolitics,"Today, [SCOTUS ruled 5-4 that the Trump has constitutional authority to implement his ""Travel Ban""](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf).

So my questions are pretty simple: What happens now?

If we read the text of the [current ""Travel Ban""](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/), which was issued in March of 2017, there are several key things I'd like to inquire about.

The first is the statement that such a travel ban will last only 90-days:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Does the 90-day period begin now, or how does that work? Also, is it enforced by law or is the 90-day window an arbitrary number that has no legal bearing?

Lastly, there are several mentions of stipulating factors for this proclamation, specifically surrounding our (The United States) ""review"" of several processes. Examples:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, **while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review**, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

> Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP **pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.** Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Since these statements, to me, imply that this ban will continue as long as our processes are under review, is there anything that legally obligates the government to conduct an actual review of their processes *and finish it*, or could they theoretically conduct a review for four years?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8u152w/what_happens_now_with_the_travel_ban/,787,"Should it not  be moot, since it should have expired 90 days after it was enacted so that ""we can figure out what the hell is going on?""

- Potentially makes the judiciary more efficient by reducing the number of cases

- It's hard to enforce and somewhat inefficient to enforce. Before the bill, judges would make this determination now I guess the judge has to tell the police and provide a basis for their claim. It would be hard for routine law enforcement to recognize what a ""frivolous claim"" is, especially with how pleadings work where changing one word or paragraph in the complaint can substantially change the course of the lawsuit. 

Quick thoughts on [HR 985](https://policy.house.gov/legislative/bills/hr-985-fairness-class-action-litigation-act-2017):

- Seems to tighten the requirements to qualify as a ""class"" for a class action lawsuit. Probably will make it a little harder to develop a ""class"" as a whole

- Happy lawyers for class action lawsuits get paid only after all members have been paid. Opens the door for issues surrounding how payments are structured though.

815,92v2k7,False,,89,What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?,NeutralPolitics,"This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.

[""**European policymakers struggle to achieve two main goals: safeguarding the idea that the euro is irreversible and stable; and protecting their own banks and taxpayer money**.

There is a hostile atmosphere and censorship, in addition with bad and sometimes insulting behavior from the user and moderator team and being aggressive and insulting towards people with not leftist viewpoints, and this definetly harms discussion.

Propaganda that claims to be about evidence, facts, logic, respect or neutrality might be easier to swallow, so I see this subreddit as particularly sinister.

> He has charged that some of his adversaries are guilty of treason, and he was asked Thursday to provide the names of people who should be held accountable for a crime punishable by death.

> “We certainly expect the people that were responsible and that were part of this unprecedented obstruction and corruption at the FBI, those people should certainly be held responsible and be held accountable,” added Sanders. “And the president expects that to take place.”

- Is there currently any evidence that Comey has broken the law?
- Are there any historical examples of an FBI employee being charged for the way/process an investigation was opened?
- How do historical cases of treason charges compare to this situation?

Burqa bans, for the purposes of this question, include the legislation in France banning the wearing of face coverings in public(It's hard to find the text in english, but [this source](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-law-prohibiting-the-wearing-of-clothing-concealing-ones-face-in-public-spaces-found-constitutional/) gives ""The law reviewed by the Constitutional Council provides that 'no one, in a public space, may wear clothing intended to conceal the face.'""), the potential ban in Denmark that is not written yet, but seems to be along the lines of the French one and any other legislation in western countries that has had similar effect(most burqa bans seem to be part of larger public face-covering bans). 

The most stated popular reasonings behind the ban appear to be [social cohesion, or protecting women's rights](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/europe/burqa-burkini-bans/index.html) and [security, or the suppression of radical islam](http://www.newsweek.com/burqa-ban-european-peoples-party-france-582312), though some wearers of the garments say the problems are being made up.

So, before bans were put in place [around 2010-11](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline), was there any reason to believe that the bans would result in greater social cohesion, security, or women's rights?

88,7utdei,False,,768,"Nunes Memo: What is true, what is misleading? What is new, what was previously known? And what are potential consequences for the investigations into Russian election meddling?",NeutralPolitics,"Hi folks,

I'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)

With all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.

I'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.

Regarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?

Regarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?

Regarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.

Regarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.

That's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well.

Following President Trump's [private meeting](https://apnews.com/afd7db4f7c024a678c696da68edd15ce) with Putin in Helsinki, [Senate Democrats expressed concerns](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/19/helsinki-summit-democrats-want-hear-trumps-interpreter/799733002/) about the meeting and requested the interpreter testify before them in a closed session so they could ascertain what, if anything, was agreed to.

Based on this, a few questions arise:

2. Are there ethical complications in doing so?

672,5ojzfs,False,,176,Is drug legalization/decriminalization sound policy?,NeutralPolitics,"California, America's largest state, recently [legalized the recreational use and sale of cannabis](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html), joining seven other states as American public opinion [moves in favor](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/support-for-marijuana-legalization-continues-to-rise/) of full, national legalization. 

The US and much of the rest of the world have historically cooperated via a [series of international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) to outlaw many recreational drugs, including cannabis, LSD, cocaine and so on. Recent trends in cannabis in the United States and [other nations](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/global-marijuana-cannabis-laws/) have thrown this old equilibrium into question. On top of this, some nations like Portugal have [experimented with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/?utm_term=.1d839e2c929c) decriminalizing all recreational drugs, including ""hard drugs"". 

The connection between narcotic prohibition and crime has long been noted, especially with regards to [terrorists in Afghanistan](http://www.opium.org/how-does-opium-fund-terrorism.html) and [cartels in Mexico](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-cartel-guide-2015-12). Additionally, some have pointed out that many currently illegal drugs are [generally less dangerous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) than legal ones like alcohol and tobacco. However, many currently prohibited drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are [highly addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) and have [significant negative health effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts), perhaps justifying prohibition. 

Is decriminalization and legalization of such recreational drugs sound policy? What positive effects does it have, and what are its drawbacks? Should a line be drawn on legalization between ""hard"" and ""soft"" drugs?

663,5hxwfr,False,,295,What are the pros and cons of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's approach to education reform?,NeutralPolitics,"I’ve been hearing a lot about Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, some of it bad and some of it good. [It seems pretty clear that]( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos) she strongly supports “school choice” – in other words, she is a supporter of scholarship tax credits, vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools.
I’ve seen hefty criticism of her approach to public education, and I’ve also seen some praise, as well as some sources that [give a pretty even rundown of both sides of the debate]( http://www.balancedpolitics.org/school_vouchers.htm). [According to what I’ve been able to find] ( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos), the pros of her approach are:

- It will encourage more innovation in schools, helping to move our stagnated public education system forward by creating competition.

- It will give poor families the same opportunity to choose their kids’ education as rich families have.

- Those who attend private schools generally have [higher SAT scores]( http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) than those who attend public schools. However, [others]( http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/comparing-private-public-school-test-scores/) say that once you apply a standardized test such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and adjust it for socioeconomic factors, there is little to no difference between the scores of public and private schools.

- Private schools allow students to attain a greater depth in subjects that interest them.

- Private schools are more effective than public schools at managing their money.

The cons, on the other hand, are:

- Vouchers drain funds from public schools.

- Private schools aren’t monitored as closely as public schools; therefore, there is a risk that some may not provide a fair, balanced, or responsible education.

- Whereas public schools are open to everyone, private schools can discriminate based on a variety of factors. However, I would personally argue that public schools also discriminate in a way, based on income – because public school funding is tied to property values, [lower-income families tend to be stuck with lower-quality schools]( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem).

- Some, such as the [NY Times]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html), cite her track record as an example of what will happen if she implements her policies as Secretary of Education. However, the Times also acknowledges that this doesn’t automatically discount the potential of charter schools, citing their success in New Orleans, where rigorous oversight from local leaders ensures that the schools don’t discriminate.

So I’m curious to know your guys’ take on this. What are the pros and cons of her approach to education, and do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the country?

661,8jonuh,False,,41,"[META] Announcing new, more detailed rules guidance.",NeutralPolitics,"After having some issues recently relating to clarity of the rules, we have decided to make a substantial revamp of our rules wiki and adopt detailed explanations for each rule, giving examples and additional information for almost every aspect of them.

None of these explanations are changes to the rules, but they should hopefully codify how we have come to interpret and enforce them over time, and make it easier for users to understand where we're coming from.

---

#Submission rules

A) **Ask a specific political question.** We do not allow overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, surveys, [requests to explain public opinion or media coverage,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/209fox/meta_the_np_community_cannot_explain_public/) posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.
 
 * NeutralPolitics is principally focused on questions of policy and governance.  Analyzing things like media coverage, public opinion and the like are outside of our wheelhouse.
 * A solicitation of pure opinion is a question which can't be answered with facts people could source.

 * For example ""should healthcare be a legal right?"" is a pure opinion question, whereas ""what have been successful and unsuccessful attempts to legally establish positive rights?"" is a question people can answer with facts about what has been done in the past.

 * Questions about ""why"" people do things often run afoul of rule A.  It's very hard to answer a question about motivations with facts, since it's asking our users to read minds.  It's better to ask things like what the stated reasons for a political action are, or who stands to benefit or be harmed by the action.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.** The post must not be inflammatory, editorialized, leading towards a particular answer, a statement of opinion, or a request to critique your theory.

 * This rule can be tricky to follow, but we've written up some detailed tips [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/)

 * Try to give all sides of a question.  If it's an ongoing issue of debate, link to articles which give multiple perspectives on the question.

 * Do not state things which are highly debated as unequivocally true.  Say (and link) who is asserting their truth and let the source do the arguing in their own name.

 * **Do not answer your own question!** A post which tries to answer the headline question is inherently going to break rule B.

 * Avoid negative framing.* 

  * Instead of asking ""Why don't we do [X policy]?""  ask, What are the pros and cons of [X policy]?""

  * Instead of ""Why doesn't [X politician] do Y?"" ask ""What are the precedents for [an office-holder/candidate] doing Y?""

C) **Outline the issue well.** Give more than just a headline. Provide some background information.

 * This rule is fairly straightforward, but basically it means you should provide enough information so that people understand the context for the question.  News articles or research articles on the subject matter should also be included so there is more background people can read before answering.

D) **Provide sources.** Statements of fact must cite [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Nothing is ""common knowledge."" **Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected.** (Sole exception: if you cannot find specific information after a thorough online search, you may post a request for sources.)

* This rule ensures that submissions are based on factual claims with some outside basis, not just the impressions of the asker.

* If you ""heard"" something, source it.

 * If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it. If you want, you can even modmail us and ask for help with your post. Most of us are news or policy junkies and probably can help you find some good sources.

* Don't attribute a statement to an general group. Name a person who said the thing.

 * Another big issue we get is things like ""people on the right/the left/republicans/democrats/the media"" have been saying X. Often X is an inflammatory/strawman argument.

 * Like things you ""heard about,"" this will not do. NeutralPolitics doesn't do blind quotes. Find an opinion article or something with a named person making that argument. For example:

  * **Bad** ""[X party] has been saying that [Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.

  * **Good** [Person A], a [X party] member of Congress, said ""[Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls."" [link to source]

* We are much stricter with sources for submissions than for comments.  Please see the [source guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) for more information.

* Requests for sources are rarely allowed, and only when a subject is not easily searched on the internet after substantial effort.  We are not ELI5 or another subreddit for casual questions.  If you are considering such a submission, we strongly suggest [sending us a modmail first.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics&subject=Request%20for%20Sources%20Post&message=)

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.** The purpose of this forum is to discuss issues. We do not allow polls, surveys or requests for fact checking.

* This is a close corollary of rule A.  But the gist of it is that we are looking for questions which our users can answer with Reddit comments.

* We are especially strict about this rule when it comes to promoting anything of your own.  We will categorically reject any submission which includes a link to any article or video or other thing which you are the author or creator of.

F) **Title the post accurately.** The title must match the contents.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question cannot be answered with facts — which includes any that are phrased in the future tense (What will/would/could happen?) — then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

* NeutralPolitics is a fact based forum, and questions which ask to predict the future necessarily ask for things which can't be answered with facts.

* Try rephrasing the question to ask what has happened in similar past cases.

* We also prohibit in this category questions whose answer cannot be provided by any user. (e.g. what are the nuclear launch codes; what are the contents of a sealed court case).

* As mentioned with rule A, ""Why"" questions often violate rule G.  They ask our users to speculate about the contents of a person's mind, as opposed to something answerable with facts.

#Comment Rules

1) **Be courteous.** Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

* Our commitment to civil discourse is one of the core principles of NeutralPolitics, and we do not make any exceptions from this rule.

* Any language which a reasonable observer would conclude disparages another user in any way is considered a violation of this rule.  Even if you did not intend that.

* **""But it was true"" is not a defense.**  Accusing another user of something is prohibited, even if you believe that accusation to be true.

* **""They started it"" is not a defense.**  If another user breaks the rules, please report the comment.  Replying with a rule violating comment of your own will just get both of them removed and makes that much more work for the mod team.

2) **Source your facts.** If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

* This rule is the core of our commitment to fact-based discourse.

* We do not allow claims of expertise or anecdotal evidence to substitute for providing sources.

* We do not allow image sources because they are too easy to manipulate and there's no good way to verify they come from where they purport to.

* We do not allow video sources unless accompanied by text sources because they are too hard for us to moderate and it is unreasonable to ask people to watch a video to check what you're claiming is true.

* Phrasing a statement of fact in the form of a question (""Isn't it true that [X]?"") will be treated as a statement that [X] is true, and needs a source.

* Stating it is your opinion that something is true does not absolve the necessity of sourcing that claim.

* For more detail, read our section on [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources)

3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion-based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

* A NeutralPolitics comment should not just be a general a reaction to the subject matter of the post, but should try to advance a substantive point of some sort backed up by evidence.

* Joke and meme comments are prohibited as not further advancing a productive conversation.

* One-liner comments are prohibited because we want to foster detailed and substantive discussion, and it harms that when people don't put effort into what they're saying.

* Off topic replies are prohibited.  We curate the types of questions we allow under rule A for a reason.

* [Pejorative name calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7mn3a5/meta_announcing_a_revised_rule_3_and_a_request/) means any use of a demeaning name to describe a person or group when it's not accompanied by a sourced explanation of why the name is literally accurate.


4) **Address the arguments, not the person.** The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.

* As a part of our commitment to a fact-based discussion, we find that comments which try to go to people's personal motivations or personal conduct are detrimental to our subreddit.

* The subject of discussion on NP is never the conduct or motives of another user, but is always about the substance of what people are saying.  Comments which get personal, even if not directly accusatory or rude, are something which take conversations off topic, and so are banned here.

* The purpose of a discussion is also not to prove another user wrong about something, but rather to inform all readers by using evidence to demonstrate the facts about something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8jonuh/meta_announcing_new_more_detailed_rules_guidance/,379,"Question - why do you allow two month old accounts to mod your sub with full permission?

Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralPolitics on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

However, [Mueller said that the president can be indicted after leaving office](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-donald-trump-can-charged-after-leaving-office/1814190001/). And in detailed questioning, [Mueller agreed that all of the three requirements for obstruction charges were met](https://news.yahoo.com/mueller-edges-closer-to-saying-trump-committed-obstruction-160919062.html). Beyond the Mueller case, the president's  former personal lawyer [is currently in prison for crimes that he says the president directed him to commit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/michael-cohen-gma-interview-trump/2309268002/), and [new evidence supports the president's involvement in those crimes](https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-says-trump-directed-142437206.html). So it seems very likely that a prosecutor could pursue an indictment of the president if not for the DOJ policy, and that policy is valid only as long as the president remains in office. What procedures take effect after that?

In particular,

* How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?
* [Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-secret-service-lifetime-protection-bush/1823961/); can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?
* If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?
* [The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-2020-win-could-run-out-clock-on-obstruction) If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statute of limitations is suspended (""tolled"") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?
* Before he was [pardoned by his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon), did prosecutors make these kinds of plans to indict former president Richard Nixon?
* What influence does the new president have over the possible prosecution of his or her predecessor? As we enter a new election cycle, have any candidates expressed a position on this?

- claims that the NRA uses its influence to ""incite violence,"" ""spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence,"" and ""promotes extremist positions.""

547,7ihkgn,False,,27,Should antitrust law and enforcement focus more on vertical integration?,NeutralPolitics,"Net neutrality is the hot topic of the day but another issue at hand is antitrust. Amazon in particular has come under scrutiny after its [acquisition of Whole Foods Market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/16/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-market-in-deal-valued-at-13-7-billion-2/?utm_term=.81d2c0921199).

(Full disclosure: I work for Amazon but am obviously posting here in a private capacity.)

Historically, antitrust law has focused on horizontal monopolies, i.e., one firm cornering an entire market by crowding out competitors at the same stage of production. Vertical integration, in contrast, focuses more on owning the entirety of your upstream or downstream production chain. This is an oversimplification but is fine for the purpose of a high level conversation.

In the case of Amazon, acquiring Whole Foods gives them control of grocery distribution to supply their Fresh delivery system. To use another example, [look at the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730906-vertical-integration-could-put-brake-americas-unsustainably-soaring-health-care-costs):

>The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers. If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of United’s pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.

Non-specific tidbits on the [argument in favor](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696911-tech-fashion-old-management-idea-back-vogue-vertical-integration-gets-new) of vertical consolidation:

- Better integrated products (i.e., creating an ecosystem in which it is easier to get everything you need in one space);
- Efficiency of doing things in-house;
- Building customer relationships (via integration and the subsequent creation of frictionless consumer experiences)
- Speed and efficiency from owning your entire production process;
- Minimizing risk across uncertain geopolitical space

The trade-off in this is the potential reduction of consumer choice and ""boxing in"" of customer behavior (see: [Vox's analysis](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2017/12/4/16731310/cvs-aetna-merger) of the Aetna/CVS merger for examples). Likewise, we can see privacy concerns, such as tech ecosystems that collect data in one capacity to inform another (e.g., Amazon using Whole Foods to collect customer behavior data to hone their advertisement algorithms).

Moreover, the reason why I mentioned net neutrality is because implicit in that argument is a concern over information limitation and throttling, but we can see examples of this with firms that own downstream production and content. Using Amazon as an example again, we have [historical examples](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0) of the company deprioritizing book search results related to a publishing dispute. Today, Amazon and Google are in a spat that has resulted in the [loss of Youtube functionality](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices) across Amazon devices.

Thus there is significant control over content here, at least in so far as we have a major player in one market able to influence an area where they have a smaller share but nevertheless major influence on access to a good or service. This is a particularly acute concern where that influence is tethered to a medium or platform with a strong correlation to information dissemination, such as vieo.

The additional historical justification for antitrust law has been the argument that it's bad for consumers, typically by limiting their choice to a single firm that has significant price control. The traditional metrics have been market share and pricing.

But how should we evaluate vertical integration if: (1) it doesn't usually increase market share that much (e.g., Amazon still accounts for very little of the grocery market post-Whole Foods acquisition); (2) arguably it creates a better environment for consumers who want fast and frictionless goods/services, and; (3) we have yet to come up with a strong corollary for market share and price controls as the metrics for ""too much""?

Specific questions:

- Should this be policed more explicitly and increased rigor?
- What are the measurements by which we determine vertical integration has exceeded an appropriate threshold?
- Arguably this is more of a concern across data collection and communication areas. Is this less an antitrust concern and more of a communications and data security matter?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7ihkgn/should_antitrust_law_and_enforcement_focus_more/,442,"While vertical mergers may not raise prices for consumers there are political concerns raised by antitrust that should also be considered. Vertical mergers can significantly expand the economic power of a corporation in a given sector. I.e. Aetna acquiring CVS in healthcare, Disney acquiring Marvel in entertainment, and Amazon acquiring Whole Foods in retail. Substantial economic power allows corporations to pursue rent seeking activities like lobbying. 

Thus, political power follows economic power. It seems to me that regardless of consumer prices, whether we deem the consolidation of economic and political power in large corporations a political good is of central concern. One concern I have is that corporations are accountable only to shareholders while the government is accountable to the majority. This is how it ought to be. However, as corporations cross a certain threshold of economic power and rent seeking becomes inevitable the government privileges the interests of corporate shareholders over the majority. This is not how it ought to be. The question: What is that threshold?

however i think the anti-establishment sentiment, or any nationally trending political fad carries only over ""celebrity"" politics. a president has the most individual power a politican can have, voting for a president is the most popular part of the political process, gets most media attention and consequently the most discussion. i infer that people who vote for presidents and not congresspeople do so because they get the idea that since the president has the most power, they don't 'need' to vote for any other position. sort of like a quasi- trickle down politics. so no matter which political movement is trending it is unlikely to see it reflected on a local or state scale since all the focus is on changing the white house. 

from what i gather, bernie's #politicalrevolution can only start to happen after bernie hypothetically gets elected. from his position as president he would be able to consistently reach out to America for political change. as a candidate, only berners will stick to that message. it is unlikely to happen without his presidency and somewhat more likely if he is president, but he would still face the obstacle of people only paying attention to celebrity politics

559,9q6g4b,False,,305,"To what extent is the Trump administration's exclusion of LGBTQ protections from its interpretation of Title IX motivated by a strict and literal interpretation of the law, and has the Trump administrated exhibited a pattern of policies detrimental to LGBTQ people?",NeutralPolitics,"The New York Times published an article titled [""Trump Administration Eyes Defining Transgender Out of Existence""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html) whose first paragraph asserts:

> The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a governmentwide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law.

However, the article later refers to the word ""sex"" instead of ""gender"" as the term that the Trump Administration is interpreting. Gender and sex are two distinct concepts; gender refers to psychological, behavioral, and cultural aspects of one's identity and is determined by brain structure whereas sex describes one's physical traits, such chromosomes, gonads, and genitalia. (https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/)

According to the article, the Trump administration may interpret Title IX in a way that excludes protections for LGBTQ people, breaking the Obama administration's precedent. According to the article, people disagreed with the Obama administration's interpretation of the law:

> For the last year, health and human services has privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

[Title IX does not mention gender (or sexual orientation), only sex.](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm)

- How does the Obama administration's interpretation of Title IX compare with other interpretations of the law, both Title IX and in general?

- Based both on its interpretation of Title IX and its other actions, to what extent is the Trump administration motivated by an earnest stricter or literal interpretation of the law, and has it shown a pattern of policies that harm LGBTQ people?

- What specific judgements has the Trump administration made regarding the definition of gender? Of sex? How are these definitions similar to or different from the medical consensus?

794,6utr1r,False,,29,How does Congress approve funding for specific projects by organizations like the CIA?,NeutralPolitics,"Reposting with a few sources this time,

I am not sure if I am asking in the correct subreddit. I was debating on asking this question here or on /r/AskHistorians. But to me, it seemed more of a political question than a historical one.

In Steve Coll's book, ""Ghost Wars"", there are multiple instances of Congress debating on increasing or cutting the CIA's funding toward the fighting between the Soviets and the mujahedin fighters in Afghanistan in early 70s and 80s. Seemingly all without the public knowing at the time.

My questions are whom in Congress gets to approve this kind of funding? And what measures, if any, does Congress take to prevent the media from discovering these votes?

While I am particularly interested in this specific time period of US history, if someone has a great example from a different time period and/or involving a completely different secret project, I still love to hear about that as long as it addresses my questions about congressional involvement.

With the House of Representatives moving in the direction of impeachment, the subreddit has been inundated with submissions on the details of the scandal, as well as the legal and political processes around it.

The mods are posting this thread to seek advice and feedback from users on how to handle this, as the volume of posts has become difficult, and we have unfortunately had some threads go off the rails.

A few options we have are:

1. **Using ""green"" questions to ask about major new developments.**  That is where the mods will write up a rules-compliant thread on a subject of major interest.  We have done this in the past with similar subjects.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6a9j3d/is_there_evidence_to_suggest_the_firing_of_james/) for example.

2. **Just keep having normal question threads.**

3.  **Create megathreads when major new events happen.** A couple past examples of that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6989bb/ahca_megathread/) and [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9iv4mt/megathread_un_general_assembly/)

180,7q4gmx,False,,218,Is there a significant sentencing disparity between black people and white people in the US that isn't otherwise explained by the difference in crime rates?,NeutralPolitics,"There seems to be a lot of contradictory evidence on this question.  In pursuit of objectivity I'd like to pose it to /r/neutralpolitics.

On the side of ""there is no sentencing disparity"", I found an article [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/4847/6-leftist-myths-about-criminal-justice-system-get-ben-shapiro) that makes the following claims:

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Overprosecute Blacks.** For literally decades, studies have demonstrated that there is statistical parity between crime reports and arrests. Unless witnesses in the black community – predominantly the victims of black crime – are somehow racist against blacks, cops are arresting people who are guilty of crimes.

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Sentence Blacks Disproportionately Longer.**...studies have actually shown a slightly lower chance of prosecution and slightly lower sentences for black convicts...“A 1994 Justice Department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution following a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. Following conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however – an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records.”

I couldn't find a source for ""there is parity between crime reports and crime rates"", but if that is true it seems to lend itself to the conclusion being that the higher arrest rate of blacks is due to their higher crime rate, rather than due to prejudice on the part of police officers.  While a counterargument might be that the crime reports are disproportionately done by white members of majority black communities, or by white police officers, this also doesn't take into account the fact that black members of the community or black police officers may also have a bias against black people in that regard, and that this implicitly assumes from the start that white officers and community members have this bias.

I did find [the source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc94.pdf) for the second claim, but I couldn't validate the ""and outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records"" claim.  I couldn't find much information on this one reading the report, but a number of other sources mention this report so I'm inclined to believe it's true.  However I'd like more information.

On the other side, I have [this slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) which makes a few other claims.

>**Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.**

It gives [this source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/?utm_term=.783daadc09c6).  The counterargument is that black people simply speed more than white people.  I couldn't find evidence for this however, but I'm not sure this is certain evidence of racial bias among police officers.

>**Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than white Americans for the same offense.**

[It uses this source](http://c-6rtwjumjzx7877x24jhtstrnhx78x2ezghx2ehf.g00.slate.com/g00/3_c-6bbb.x78qfyj.htr_/c-6RTWJUMJZX77x24myyux78x3ax2fx2fjhtstrnhx78.zgh.hfx2fknqjx78x2f7568x2f50x2fuik_ufujw_rfwny-wjmfan-wfhnfq-inx78ufwnyd-kjijwfq-hwnrnsfq.uik_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1).  It's quite long, and I'm not sure if it takes into account prior convictions, which is a potential counterargument.  Furthermore it seems to contradict the second piece of evidence on the other side.  This is the big piece of evidence that I'm confused about, and am not sure which side to believe.

Both of these articles are biased in some way, but I think taking these 2 claims from each of them provides a good starting point for the conversation.  Is there a disparity in sentencing, incarceration, policing, arrests, etc between blacks and whites that can't otherwise be explained by the difference in crime rates?

399,8v5u42,False,,275,What are the arguments for and against abolishing the Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency (ICE)?,NeutralPolitics,"[Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) is a U.S. law enforcement agency that was formed in 2002 by combining several border and revenue enforcement agencies under the newly established Department of Homeland Security. Its [mission](https://www.ice.gov/about) is to enforce federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.


Recently, some Democratic candidates have [laid out arguments](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/) for abolishing the agency and a number of others have [gotten behind the idea.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-democrats-ice-analysis-20180624-story,amp.html) Here's a [full explainer.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17116980/ice-abolish-immigration-arrest-deport)

**5:42 PM EST** Welcome to the 2018 /r/NeutralPolitics election night megathread!  I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. 

**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  

**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.

**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)

**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.

**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).

**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.

**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.

**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.

**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).

**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.

**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)

**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.

**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.

**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, 

**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.

**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.

**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)

**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.

**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).

**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.

**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.

**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.

**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)

**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.

**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?

**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.

**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.

**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.

**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)

**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)

**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)

**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)

**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.

**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.

In the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.

What does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?

The Constitution gives the people the tools required to fight established institutions and even stage a revolution without breaking the system. It's designed to be adaptable and enforce what is essentially sportsmanlike conduct in class warfare.

167,548hi7,False,,83,Announcing our Debate Fact-Checking Initiative,NeutralPolitics,"We have been thinking about how best to approach the Presidential debates, and have decided that we are going to post live fact-checking threads for at least the first Presidential debate (after which we'll assess and see how it went).  

In deciding on this, we have looked at our past megathreads, such as for the primary election results, primary debates, convention speeches, and the Brexit vote.

The megathread format we most often used, some introductory questions and then a live tick-tock works great for election nights, but not as well for debates and speeches.  So we're gonna try something new.

The way it will work is as follows:

* **All top level comments will be posted by mods.**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate.  Obviously this will be live so there may be errors.  But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

* **Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.**

All fact checks **must** contain a link to a source stating what the true thing is, and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms what the candidate said.  Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.

* **Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules will still apply.

*Edit for clarification* Since this has come up a couple times: The NP mod team will not be doing the fact checking, but we are rather providing a forum for our users to fact check.

533,c1z103,False,,15,"How has ""Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act"" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?",NeutralPolitics,"Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.

Questions:

1. Were these genuine problems in boxing at the time of the Ali Act's passage?

2. Are these less of a problem now?

3. If so, can this improvement be attributed to the Ali Act? 

4. Has enforcement of the Ali Act been effective?

5. General question: What have we learned about combat sports regulation with the benefit of 19 years of hindsight?

6. Are these a real problem in MMA now?

7. What are some potential downsides of expanding the Ali Act to include MMA?

- Is it sustainable when there's such unbalance between one territory and another —like it's happening now in Catalonia— and what kind of measures should be used to solve this, taking into account that these kind of conflicts have historically escalated into violence and wars, making that an unacceptable way —and one that the catalans aren't going to push.

Actual question/s are at the bottom, after all the context is given.

Sources for claims in title (basically electoral data), plus involved parties political alignment:

1. [AMI](http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/), Association of Municipalities for Independence (link is official webpage), has, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Municipalities_for_Independence), *""the support of 786 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (82,9%). In addition, 39 out of 42 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.""*

2. The lasting ~20% of City Councils are owned by PSC and CSQEP, which are center-left and hard-left leaning parties that are part of state-wide parties ([PSOE-PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia)) and coalitions (CSQEP and [Podemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\(Spanish_political_party\))). Those parties are the actual opposition in [the Spanish Congress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_Congress_of_Deputies_\(12th_Legislature\).svg). PSOE (the main spanish opposition party right now —homologous of Democrats in the US, and Labour in the UK) rejected 155 application during all the legislature, but has backed it once the PP-Ciudadanos Government pushed for it earlier this week; Podemos, the 3th party in seats, rejects it all the way.

3. Between the aforementioned City Councils ruled by PSC or CSQEP, are most of the biggest cities in Catalonia, like Barcelona and the cosmopolitan surroundings, Tarragona, or Lleida, making 3 of 4 the province Capitals. This shows an interesting part of the whole point, imo: the political weight that life in big cities —""modern, cosmopolitan life""— has in these kind of matters that affect the rest of a territory, with lower density.

4. Albeit those ~20% of City Councils aren't part of the Association of Municipalities for Independence, many of them have already [openly rejected](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171021/432245123748/alcaldes-psc-piden-rechazar-155.html) the application of 155 —including the Barcelona one, which mayor is part of CSQEP, the coalition party that rejects it in the Spanish Congress. This doesn't mean they will not abide, but it shows their disconformity.

5. The actual [government in Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XII_legislatura_de_Espa%C3%B1a), elected in 2016 and that pushed for the 155 application this past week, is mainly PP with the support Ciudadanos. Between those 2 parties, they rule one single tiny town in Catalonia (sourced in next point).

5. The only City Council owned by Spain's ruling party (PP) in Catalonia is [Pontons](http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/07/18/la-vida-en-pontons-el-unico-municipio-catalan-donde-gobierna-el_a_23035629/), a 453 citizens municipality, making it an anecdote —still, as a curiosity, that town had a [80% turnout](http://elmon.cat/politica/arrasa-lunic-municipi-governat-pel-pp) in the 1-O 'illegal' referendum.

7. Among the previous point, Ciudadanos, the party that supports PP in Madrid and earns them the Government, hasn't got a single municipality currently —and has only had one single mayor there, in it's brief history.

8. Results of the current events, ~70% Mayors in Catalonia are allegedly [being prosecuted](http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/cataluna/2017/09/08/59b28078e2704e19168b4593.html) for having shown public support and collaboration with organising the 'illegal' 1-O vote.

Further context:

**What is the 155 article of the Spanish Constitution, and why has it been pushed?**

- The 155 article of the Spanish Constitution [was pushed by Spain's Government](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/21/inenglish/1508587023_487115.html) this past weekend, and will have to go through the Senate to be approved. Such article is [a measure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%C3%ADculo_155_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978) to shield the State from disobedience in any autonomous community, when any autonomous government (in this case, the catalan Generalitat of Catalonia) rejects following the requests of the Central Government, which would be backed by the Constitutional law that rules us all.

- The reason for Madrid's central government applying the 155 is the Catalan Government push for an Unillateral Declaration of Independence. The reason the Catalan Government has been able to push for that it's because it has [an absolute majority in seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), as of the last elections in pro-Yes parties. After the 'illegal referendum' as the finishing point of the legislature —complying with the main point of their electoral promises— the Independence of Catalonia was [announced yet immediatelly suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence), after the 1st of October vote. The immediate suspension was to call for a dialogue in terms, for negotiating a better way out —a legal one— than the unillateral, after the Catalan Government considered the [1st of October 'illegal' referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017) success substantial enough to push for independence. That kind of measure has been compared with the [Slovenian way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioni_Agreement) of gaining independence in 1991.

- This suspenden situation lasted about a month, and the Central Government finally pushed for the 155 to prevent anything else from happening. This will take away any political power from the Catalan Government, rendering the Catalan President unable to push for anything, overtaking any offices they consider necessary for the time being, plus the control of catalan autonomous police, and the public media apparently, too. In other words, the 155 is an 'à la carte' article to make the territories follow the Constitutional law.

- Pushing that article will mean that PP, a party with [8.49% of the votes in Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), will rule that territory for a while —only with the backing of Ciudadanos though, a party that has 17.90% of the vote in Catalonia, summing to 26,4% of the votes of the territory with PP. This engorges 1/4th of the people entitlement, while it creates greater distress over the 48% of pro-Yes voters, being the distress present but lesser in the lasting ~25% (pro-legal-referendum parties).

- Albeit the main goal of the PP is, allegedly, to call for new elections in the Catalan Parliament as soon as possible, [polls show](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171022/encuesta-elecciones-cataluna-6371299) that the independentist simple majority is consolidated, showing a quasi-identic scenario. As such, pushing for them isn't solving anything apparently, making the situation stuck and unsustainable long term.

Last but not least, for context on independentism in the contemporary world, mainly Europe:

- [Unillateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence), being Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo, the last ones in Europe the last half of a Century, after wars and violent episodes.

- ~~Non-unilateral~~ [declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence), in modern Europe, include mainly the countries that were former parts of the USSR, like the Baltic Countries and many Balkanian ones.

**edit**: removed ""non-unilateral"", as that was an error of mine adding it for emphasis, and /u/CQME kindly addressed that this was not right.

---

So, for the question/s, I guess they are:

- **Are there any other modern territories where virtually none of the local councils are represented by the main party, or any coalition, that rules the upper instances of the territory, outside of it?**

- **Are such scenarios sustainable only by the rule of law, which is the only thing the Spanish main parties have said they'll follow, ever?**

---

I'm quite illiterate in terms of history and politics, but the closest situations I know of are:

- The Northern Ireland situation, where they're mainly overruled by the UK in many things (part of the peace treaties), albeit Wikipedia shows me that [there're a big deal of local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) ruled by unionist parties in Northern Ireland —as far as I can tell, unionist conservative parties like DUP are part of the Conservatives main party, in the House of Commons, and Labour does too, so there's indeed some balance there.

- In Spain, the other really distinct autonomous community, the Basque Country, has too [3 out of 251](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Popular_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco#Elecciones_municipales_y_forales_2015) city councils. However, as center to right Basque Nationalists aren't currently pushing for independence, they actually have some deals with Spain's hard unionist parties like PP and Ciudadanos. (In Spain, which screams conflict, the main voted party is the 4th and 5th party in Catalonia and Basque Country, gathering ).

- It's worth mentiong that the above 2 territories had a violent apporach by radical groups back in the day, being [ETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_\(separatist_group\)) a terrorist group for Basque independentists, and the [IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), a paramilitary army.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/78engy/the_central_government_of_spain_will_rule/,566,[deleted] ,2017-10-24 09:37:25

Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,[6] UK,[7] and Japan[8][9] suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.

There have been many submissions in the last 24 hours about the [US government shutdown,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html?_r=0) but none of them conformed to [this subreddit's guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), so they got removed.

Here's a post with the best points from each. Please try to keep the discussion civil.

There's a lot of arguing about who is at fault for the shutdown. In the interest of neutrality, I think it's fair to say there's plenty of blame to go around *(edit: there's been some contention on this point, so [here's is a better explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1nio4r/the_us_government_has_shut_down_lets_discuss/ccizswk?context=1) of the reasoning)*, so instead, let's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded. [Who stands to gain and lose](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/23/20663446-obama-cruz-among-those-who-could-benefit-from-shutdown?lite) from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population? And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?

Is it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government? How might they go about that?

Is there a real possibility that the government could [fail to raise the debt ceiling next month,](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/how-a-debt-ceiling-crisis-could-become-a-financial-crisis/) leading to a US default on its debt obligations?

This is a touchy subject, so if you're going to make assertions in the comments below, please be sure to support them with evidence by citing a qualified source.

As a side note, we had [a lively discussion prior to the shutdown too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1muhz0/what_are_the_ramifications_of_a_us_government/)

Axios on why the Senate didn't want the ban lifted:

Many of you have recently noted a drop in the quality of discussion on NeutralPolitics. We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.

## Assume good faith

We are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.
As such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.


## Sweat the details

Each of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.


## Show your work

This community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.


## Engage with the argument, not the person

Things can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.


We will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit. If you have any questions or suggestions, we are as always happy to chat.

Assuming James Comey's statement is truthful and complete, and taking in all known facts and events to date, what are the legal arguments in support or against President Trump regarding obstructing justice? 

There are those who argue that while Trump's behavior amounts to being ""[excessive and bizarre](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448386/james-comey-testimony-donald-trump-actions-are-questionable),"" they do not meet the legal burden of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice is defined under [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and committed by those who “[corruptly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515), or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.”

As [this write up in Lawfare](https://lawfareblog.com/was-firing-james-comey-obstruction-justice) explains (excellent read), there are 3 elements of proof in order to find a crime:

2. the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending
3. the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the 
proceeding was pending.

Continuing Lawfare's post:
> The questions here surround the third element. One must not merely “influent, obstruct, or impede” but also do so corruptly. Under § 1515(b), a corrupt state of mind requires intent: “acting with an improper purpose.

617,bomcl1,False,,212,What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?,NeutralPolitics,"I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html)

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)).

Thanks to everyone who contributed.

Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign pledging to keep manufacturing companies from moving jobs overseas. On Tuesday, air conditioning company [Carrier said it had reached a deal with President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/29/carrier-trump/94638336/) The state of Indiana plans to [give economic incentives to Carrier](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html) as part of the deal to stay.

So, some questions:

* What are the pros and cons of the deal itself?
* What are the wider implications of the deal? 
* Is there evidence to indicate that a President who takes an interest in individual deals like this can have a substantial effect across the economy? 
* Is it unusual for a President to insert himself into individual negotiations like this, and if so, does it set a precedent?
* Can the working class people who Trump targeted in his campaign see a substantial benefit from moves like this?
* What kinds of wider effects do deals like this — tax incentives in exchange for not moving jobs offshore — have on wealth inequality?
* Do companies like Carrier, who are direct beneficiaries of a tax incentive, end up with a competitive advantage over other players in the marketplace, and if so, what are the pros and cons of that?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5fzjhc/presidentelect_trump_has_struck_a_deal_with/,546,"I actually really like the approach that Sen.

For example, black people are actually not victims of white racism. White racism is in fact so rare that many of the 'hate crimes' such as black church vandalism etc were actually perpetuated by blacks and liberals to make their 'cause' look more legit. This much is at least admitted by the media in individual cases. 4 different ones I know off the top of my head.

In fact, the opposite is true. White people are constantly victims of black racism. There is effectively lynchings of white people every day...however the method of execution is not by lynching. Burning white people to death seems to be the preferred method.

There is a pervasive and energetic propaganda campaign against white people in commercials and television and movies. You will notice this quickly if you simply watch TV and decide to be aware of it. Whenever a character is evil or whenever a character is stupid, it's a white guy. Try to tell me a single evil or stupid character from any movie in the past 15 years who wasn't white?

Despite the existence of anti white racist policies in the letter of the law under the umbrella term 'affirmative action', white people are still widely perceived to have institutional privilege and many organizations actually call for white people to pay reperations for slavery...as if white people invented the concept of slavery.

In academia which are mainly controlled by the left...history classes focus on every bad thing white people did...while ignoring or trivializing the contributions white people made. Everyone in school quickly learns about  the worst slave owners and small pox blankets. Most people never learn about William Wilberforce or William murray or the massacre committed by tecumseh.

Thanks to drastically declining birth rates and increasing suicides, the white race is actually in the process of dying off. Feminism has much to do with this because the majority of feminists are white. We are 'projected' to be a minority in the us in about 30 years...the reality is actually probably much sooner. Europe will likewise meet a similar shift especially with people like Marcozy insisting that whites must practice miscegenation for the greater good.

The alt right is really composed of people who have noticed this rather unfair and racist war against white people. Its an attempt to counter ethnic cleansing programs against us. Obviously if you choose to remain oblivious to the reality that is never spoken of then it would appear to be white supremacist...especially because the media has brainwashed people into thinking that anyone who is concerned for the welfare of whites must be white supremacist since 'obviously' we are privileged and 'obviously' we controlled everything.

953,4y5xb9,False,,125,Stop and frisk: is it effective?

The strategy involves stopping and questioning pedestrians, followed by frisking the individual for contraband. The practice was [officially legalized]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_v._Ohio) in the Supreme Court case Terry v Ohio, as long as reasonable suspicion exists. 

The policy has been linked by some to lower crime rates in the city during the period, and some [have accused its decline]( http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-big-fall-stop-and-frisk-criminals-bolder-article-1.2247406) as responsible for rising crime rates. However, some studies have found [little evidence]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152) that stop and frisk by itself has an effect on crime, though on the other hand, other cities [have seen]( http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/17/does-stop-and-frisk-reduce-crime/stop-and-frisk-has-lowered-crime-in-other-cities) similar declines in crime rates after the policy’s adoption.

The legality of the practice has been questioned as well, especially since “probable cause” can be quite difficult to define.

I take away a few things from the articles above:

* There's a growing sense among voters in the west that the winners from globalization are foreigners and the elites, while the losers are the hardworking local populations. 
* The result is that populism is on the rise.
* Left-wing and right-wing populism have the same origins. Considering them separate entities is to misunderstand the root causes.
* The power of these movements has been consistently underestimated by the political classes and the media entities who respond to them. Brexit and the nomination of Donald Trump are the clearest examples, but Spain, Greece, France and Denmark also have had recent cases of the ruling classes scrambling to maintain their hold on power in the face of populist revolts at the ballot box.
* The people, by and large, aren't buying the scary rhetoric of the ruling class about the negative consequences of setting out a populist and/or nationalist agenda.

I'd first like to know if any of those are incorrect conclusions and why.

But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

Let me be clear that I'm not passing judgment on populism here. If that is a necessary and expedient path to fair and equitable treatment of the citizenry, so be it. But [the history doesn't consistently favor that view,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) so I'm wondering if there are proven alternatives.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4q447n/globalism_brexit_and_the_rise_of_populism_is/,515,">But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

My question is why should you seek the continuing reduction of immigration barriers when immigration barriers have already been reduced.

Globalization vs populism is a bit of a false dichotomy, because while there might be those who are anti immigration, there are those who might enjoy benefits of globalization yet want to put some limits on the slippery slope due to partly valid reasons. So one can be for globalization but to a point. If globalization is without any end point or limits, then it is something that a bigger number of people will oppose.

If you keep pushing after already succeeding at reducing immigration barriers, eventually you are going to reach a point of resistance. So maybe it isn't quite fair to see the others as too anti-immigration, perhaps those who are pro globalization are too pro-immigration while the majority support immigration but controlled immigration (and then there are those who are more xenophobic).

So the wise thing could be to simply take in mind the value of not alienating people by pushing for lowering even more immigration barriers for example. So, I disagree that the most valid question is how to succeed at even more and more globalization.

Globalization is not all or nothing, and it can succeed in providing more sustainable and better results even more if we give a care about nation states democracies and even some nativism as important. Else, you are going to see more Trump and far right and more of the ugly side of nationalism. So the answer to the question of how to reduce populism in reaction to globalization is to allow space for some nationalism and for globalization to coexist, else to suffer under the people going for more populism and extreme force of nationalism.

It is also important for some diversity of opinions to exist among the elite or establishment. If they are more or less relatively uniformly pro reducing immigration barriers or pro increasing immigration from muslims, then it makes it more likely for extremists (and extremists in more issues than immigration) to be those willing to tell the public what it wants to hear.

629,ebr0lq,False,,74,What powers are vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial?,NeutralPolitics,"After a president is impeached by the House, the conviction trial takes place with the Senate acting as the jury and the Chief Justice of the United States acting as the judge. As [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) indicates, impeachment is purely a political process and not a legal one. Therefore, the rules and procedures of a traditional trial that most people are most familiar with do not exactly apply in an impeachment trial.

In fact, according to the *[Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials]( https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf)*, in an impeachment trial, the “Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue… all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.” In other words, as the majority party of the Senate, the GOP appears to have the power to set the rules.

Furthermore, the rules also state (bold emphasis by me):

> And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy  of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, **unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate**; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

And thus it seems that the Chief Justice can be overridden in their rulings if a majority of the Senate votes on it.

I have little if no doubt that is why Pompeo [was there](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/photos-mike-pompeo-meeting-with-north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un.html) some months ago.

If it will be a lasting peace? Who can say, but I do think this one will be far more permanent then previous attempts. The North Korean's single chance at having a weapon that served as a deterrent to the US (rather then simply South Korea) is gone. It is hard to bare your teeth to demand everyone come to the table when you have no choice. Kim Jong-Un is no fool, he knows if he doesn't come to some form of peace agreement without the threat of a nuclear weapon this all collapses. 

I doubt there will be much effect from the Trump visit, and I doubt truly we ACTUALLY had an effect other then simply being an intelligence agency that the South Koreans could rely on, but it will look good for the international community and US sources will call this a ""victory"" for Trump, or at least something on his presidential bingo board, no different the Barack Obama on Bin laden ",2018-04-29 14:52:49

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/index) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

Mods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 70% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and or work with them to craft an acceptable post.

Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. In order to help new users acclimate to our standards of discourse, we are refocusing our efforts to maintain moderator presence in the comments, so you'll be expected to reply to some of those as well.  

Other responsibilities include:

* Message an OP asking him to modify his submission.
* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you want to join the team and why you would be a good fit and also include your stance on avocado toast. Do not tell us your political leaning, any application that includes that information will automatically be dropped.

Also, we would like to take this time to answer questions and take feedback from users, so let's talk!

The bill itself can be found online [here](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2383/BILLS-115s2383is.pdf), and is not that long of a read. The gist of the bill is that it is amending the Stored Communications Act to fix problems that the proponents claim are in American internet-related laws. 

[Andrew Woods and Peter Swire writing at Lawfare Blog](https://lawfareblog.com/cloud-act-welcome-legislative-fix-cross-border-data-problems) support the legislation, saying things like 

>Moreover, a number of safeguards are built into the bill. The bill creates a mechanism whereby providers can apply for a motion to quash or modify legal process if the provider reasonably believes the subscriber is not a U.S. person and that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. It also requires a court to conduct a comity analysis in the event of such a motion to quash, which may alleviate foreign government concerns about sovereign interests. It is not clear why this comity provision is in the statute except as a symbolic gesture; courts were already free under the common law to conduct a comity analysis in thinking through whether to issue an order with extraterritorial impact. Its presence in the statute is perhaps a reminder that trust and mutual respect play an important role in these cross-border matters. 

The EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation - [opposes the bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), stating its issues with the law: 

>The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act expands American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to target and access people’s data across international borders in two ways. First, the bill creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.

• Is the bill an invasion of privacy or is it just clarifying outdated legislation?

• What are the implications on currently active cases?

How is this not an issue?   

If the company wants to have information in another country be private, shouldn't they restrict access to that information to employees located in that same other country?  Wouldn't that fix the issue?

----------------------------

It has been [well reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/trump-tariffs-foreign-autos.html) that the President of the United States has broad authority to impose tariffs on products that detract from U.S. national security.

> The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security.

Bolstering his position, President Trump has cited [a report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf) published by the U.S. Department of Commerce that asserts steel imports harm national security in the long run.

However the Commerce Department report addresses Canada directly:

> Our goal is to maximize domestic capabilities combined with supplies from unquestionably reliable third parties. The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]

This seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.

---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada.

Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the ""replace"" part of their ""repeal and replace"" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes ""per-capita block granted""

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/2000639-an-analysis-of-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-proposals.pdf

The Washington Post highlights that this plan would raise around 15.3 Trillion over the next decade and obviously lead to increase of taxes across the board. The average increase would be around $9000 per household, though that mainly comes from the highest earners in America paying the most with the average increase for the middle class would be around 4700.

Comparing it to Hillary's plan that Urban-Brookings reviewed yesterday, her plan raises a lot less overall at 1.1 trillion over the decade, but has less of an effect on the average american overall compared to Bernie's in taxes. The bottom 95% of taxplayers would see little change, while the top 5% would see large increases, though less overall than in Sanders' plan.

Bernie has argued that his tax increases will be offset by what it will pay for, but will voters go for that, especially given how many economists split on his plan.

The reason I came up with this question is because of the strong correlation between unemployment, lesser education, low income and the Brexit vote (as shown in the FT article I posted above). If we assume job dissatisfaction was the core issue of Brexit vote, how come youths voted for remain instead of leave?

I acknowledge that youths are generally liberal, and they benefit a lot from free movement and ability to get educations or meet different people in different places of Europe. Nevertheless, if their job condition is not satisfactory, I still wonder why it almost didn't have any noticeable impact.

Just want to point out I'm only an undergrad interested in this issue so a lot of my presumptions may be wrong, and I'm all happy and open to acknowledge and fix my errors. Thanks in advance.

---**EDIT**---

Thanks for many responses. There one point that I want to make it clear:

* I made a debatable premise that people with difficult economic circumstances voted for Brexit. Indeed it doesn't make any sense at a glance as Brexit will hurt the national economy more. But then again, a lot of people speculate that they didn't vote rationally. Also, statistics from the FT article shows strong correlation between lower income / unemployment and Brexit support. Finally, many of their arguments such as about £350 million to be taken back or immigrants taking their jobs, are in my opinion, manifesting that their Brexit vote were stemming from their economic dissatisfaction *they perceived* as resulted from joining the EU.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4qfmn2/why_did_youths_vote_for_remain_on_brexit/,250,[removed] ,2016-06-29 13:55:32

682,4jxcps,False,,150,"Firms like Uber classify drivers as contractors, rather than as employees. Is this business structure legally legitimate, or merely an attempt to get around employment laws?",NeutralPolitics,"Uber, the massive ridesharing company with a current valuation [greater than that of GM]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/12/04/at-68-billion-valuation-uber-will-be-bigger-than-gm-ford-and-honda/#574856a55858), has grown by adopting a rather unique business model. Whereas a traditional firm hires employees to do its work, Uber claims to be a networking service, connecting customers with independent contractors within its network. Following this model, Uber has [grown massively](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0822-uber-revenue-20150822-story.html) in the last several years.

However, widespread opposition to the Uber business model has grown simultaneously. While some applaud Uber for [lowering prices for consumers]( http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/uber-lowers-fares-in-over-100-cities/) by bypassing the artificial constraint on supply created by [taxi medallions]( https://www.thestreet.com/story/13385263/1/the-one-chart-that-should-worry-uber-and-hurts-the-taxi-medallion-short-selling-thesis.html), others have questioned the source of its success. In particular, [some claim that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) far from improving general economic efficiency and social welfare, Uber has become so successful by effectively shifting the burden of many employment costs from themselves to their “contractors”. In the US, as in many other nations, workers are entitled to [a wide number of workplace rights]( https://www.dol.gov/dol/rights-benefits.htm), including mandated breaks, the right to unionize, provision of healthcare benefits and so on. By avoiding direct legal “employment” of drivers, it is argued, Uber lowers costs to itself by making life more miserable for its drivers. 

Indeed, there has been a growing movement among drivers themselves to be recognized as employees precisely to claim the legal protections that come with classical employment, with the entire company now facing a [massive class-action lawsuit](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-appeals-class-action-ruling-in-worker-misclassification-lawsuit/) on the matter; in California, the legal status of Uber drivers as employees [has already been established]( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-labor-commissioner-rules-uber-driver-employee-not-independent-contractor.html). They key point seems to be the legal definition of “contractor”, which is similar in many states. For example, [one author states that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3):

>Under California law, the principal factor in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is whether the employer “to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.”

Uber drivers argue (successfully, in California) that [the degree to which Uber controls its drivers]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) means they are employees, not contractors. However, there is also some evidence that driver discontent may be an isolated phenomenon: one study [has suggested that](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/For-Hire-Vehicle-Transportation-Study.pdf) drivers significantly prefer contracting with Uber over working for traditional cab companies. 

Interestingly, this reclassification of employees as contractors has become [a larger pattern in the American economy that sociologists have named “Uberization”]( http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/18/rise-uberized-economy-means-business/). Thus, the current legal struggle affects not just Uber drivers, but has significant implications for the future of employment across the nation as a whole. 

To summarize: ***Are Uber employment practices legal or not? Do they truly add to the efficiency of the economy, or are they merely transferals of costs? Are the protests of the drivers legitimate?***

Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort **by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election. As described in this executive summary and the report thatfollows, President Trump’s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign.** The President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditionedtwo official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.

Entirely disregarding the President's stated purpose of investigating Joe Biden and his Son's actions in the Ukraine in an apparent attempt to get attention off him attempting to investigate illegal actions of the Bidens and onto ""the attempt"" to investigate.

All while ignoring the extreme hypocrisy that accusing the president of ""attempting to influence the 2020 election"" is 1] not only implying that anyone in a political position to even ""potentially"" run for president is immune from investigation but 2] Exactly what their self-stated ""Political"" investigation of the president is doing Literally the same thing they are accusing the president of.

711,7yn91o,False,,41,What impacts exist with counting prisoners using the current method in the US census?,NeutralPolitics,"There was [a recent article in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-census-prison-population_us_5a7cb966e4b044b3821b0507) that made me start thinking about this issue. 

The author of the article focuses primarily on the issue of redistricting based on this information. I was curious about other impacts, such as potential resources being diverted from lower income areas because of the way prisoners are being counted. Are there ways that this can affect areas beyond just the redistricting angle? 

The article is referring to the announcement on 14 February that the Census Bureau will continue the trend of counting prisoners at their location of incarceration, what they deem to be their 'usual residence'. [Their webpage](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html) explains the reasoning behind this.

> The Census Act of 1790 established the concept of “usual residence” as the main principle in determining where people should be counted, and this concept has been followed in all subsequent censuses. “Usual residence” has been defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's voting residence or legal residence.

The article cites a [memo (pdf alert) from the Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/PPI_Demos_2016_FRN_comment.pdf) that lays out an argument for not counting prisoners where they are incarcerated. 

The numbers are not yet out for 2017, but with [a prison population at the end of 2016](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6187) of around 1.5 million people, it is worthy of discussion; looking at the arguments for and against counting prisoners where they are imprisoned and the potential impacts either direction can have on communities

Gavin Newsom (D) announced plans to support a bill in the state legislature to cap how much landlords can raise rent prices with the goal of limiting price increases, increasing housing availability, and lowering housing prices. The bill, AB 1482, would limit yearly rent increases to 5% (plus the rate of inflation) for the next decade and grant minor eviction protections to renters. Newsom and his allies in the state legislature argue that the bill will help end price gouging and improve the current state of the California rental market. Conversely, the Californian Assn. of Realtors argues that the rent cap will disinsentivize the construction and production of new rental housing units and exsaserbate the already scarce and pricey rental market.

There are two large ongoing wildfires in California. The Camp Fire has covered more than [156 square miles](https://abc7news.com/maps-a-look-at-the-camp-fire-in-butte-county-and-other-california-fires/4656293/) (404 km^2 ) between Chico and the Plumas National Forest in Northern California and remains only 20% contained. Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire covers 109 square miles (282 km^2 ) in the area around Thousand Oaks and Malibu west of Los Angeles and is 0% contained.

President Trump has stated that the fires are due to [forest mismanagement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-mismanagement-forests-blame-california-fires-181110085539030.html) on California's part, and has threatened to cut off federal funding if that is not remedied.

However, a spokesperson for CA Governor Jerry Brown and the president of California Professional Firefighters have both stated that nearly [60% of California's forests are under federal control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/10/trump-blames-gross-mismanagement-wildfires-leave-trail-death-destruction-california/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.70481f8af284), including a majority of the areas affected by the fires, and that the state has increased its funding for forest services while the federal government has cut back funding for it.

Experts have blamed the unusually intense fires on excessive build-up of flammable material due to [decades of fire suppression](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Trump-on-California-s-Camp-Fire-Forest-13380388.php) as well as ""rising temperatures and longer spells of dry weather.""

1. Could any forest services in the areas affected by the fire be characterized as negligent, inefficient, underfunded, or otherwise poorly executed? If, so by whom?

**What is the AHCA?**

It is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.

**What does it do?**

Lots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)

**What are the recent amendments to it?**

There have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:

* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for ""high risk pools"" for persons with pre-existing conditions.

**What's going on with it now?**

House leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.

**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)

The House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)

**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.


The AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.

**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.

**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.

**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?

- Just like any other parliamentary government, an absolute majority of a party, or a coalition, is not necessary. Instead the ruling party is forced to form temporary coalitions on an issue-by-issue basis. It can go both ways; on the one hand it can make for a very functioning democracy because minorities are involved in legislation, on the other hand it can result in a stalemate.

- If a stalemate is reached, through the process of a ""constructive vote of no-confidence"" the President (not the chancellor) can dissolve the parliament and force a snap election.

It comes down to how likely the ruling party sees its ability to get things done in a minority government, or in the other case whether its cards are better in a snap election. ",2018-01-15 01:28:26

First Past the Post AKA Plurality AKA Single-Choice Voting: http://www.prsa.org.au/pluralit.htm

>A plurality electoral system is one where ballots are normally not valid unless they have been marked by the voter to indicate the candidate or candidates that the voter wishes to have elected, but no more candidates can be indicated in this way than the number of vacancies to be filled, without invalidating the ballot, so the information that voters are allowed to provide about their ranking of the candidates in their order of preference for them is deliberately and unnecessarily limited. Each candidate marked gets equal value from the vote, as voters cannot indicate their preferred priority among the candidates. Each mark is thus a first preference vote, but there is no provision for any later preferences of voters for candidates with more votes than they need - or of the candidates with the fewest votes - to be indicated, for transfer to remaining continuing candidates.

As we have seen this election the polarization of the electorate has become particularly intense as presidential candidates have been using the anger of the electorate to gain support.

967,5wsy55,False,,163,"Is there a health insurance ""coverage gap""? If so, why are some people too poor for ACA/""Obamacare"" and too rich for Medicaid?",NeutralPolitics,"A common criticism against ACA/""Obamacare"" is that there still remains a significant health care coverage gap where people who have no other coverage and can't afford an ACA plan will be fined on their income taxes.

[healthcare.gov outlines the exemption rules as follows:](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/results/2016/details/marketplace-affordability)

> Coverage is considered to be unaffordable if the lowest cost Bronze-level plan available to you through the Marketplace in 2016 is more than 8.13% of your household income.

> The total cost to you must be more than 8.13%, accounting for any premium tax credit you would qualify for if you enrolled in that plan.

> If you qualify for this exemption, it may apply to everybody on your tax return.

This sounds completely reasonable and it would surprise me if there really are many people who will unavoidably incur the penalty.

Is there really a coverage gap? If so, how significant is this problem? What estimates have been published for the number of Americans that are uninsured because they do not have an employer that provides health insurance, cannot afford an ACA plan, do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, and are not merely refusing or neglecting to purchase a plan? Are there many people who have no other coverage and cannot reasonably afford ACA or do most of these people instead just not *want* to pay for coverage?

If the gap does exist and affects many people, why does it exist? Was it purely an oversight in the ACA itself or is it somehow the unforeseen consequence of a mix of factors?

Here's [an example](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/21/news/economy/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-texas/) of an article talking about the coverage gap. The article gives a few anecdotes about people in Texas, a state which refused the Medicaid expansion. The numbers do sound pretty bad in that case.

>In interviews with a dozen diplomats, many of whom declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about anything related to the next U.S. president, some said spending money at Trump’s hotel is an easy, friendly gesture to the new president.

Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that [""...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that [""...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government. By requiring the consent of two different constituencies in the House and the state legislatures in the Senate-- the composition of the Senate was seen as essential to the system of bicameralism, which would require 'the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy'.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii)

Contrast this with the German [Bundesrat](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/organisation-en/organisation-en-node.html). According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up. Each delegation receives votes based on the population of their state; [""Länder (State governments) with more than two million inhabitants shall have four, Länder with more than six million inhabitants five, and Länder with more than seven million inhabitants six votes.""](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Most German states use some variation of proportional representation for their electoral systems, so representatives tend to represent more than [two political parties at once](https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/bilder/EN/artikel/zusammensetzung.jpg?__blob=panorama&v=23).  They're subject to [recall](http://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/english/germanyenglish.html) at any time by the state government, whereas U.S Senators [are not](https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/02/02/can-u-s-senators-be-recalled/).  


Is the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?

How does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?

Those laws are:

* [**AB-450**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB450) which requires in relevant part that California employers not provide information to Federal immigration agents, or allow them access to nonpublic areas, except as required by federal law or when presented with a warrant, subpoena or other court order.

* [**AB-103**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB103) which requires  the Attorney General of California, or his or her designee, to engage in reviews of county, local, or private locked detention facilities in which noncitizens are being housed or detained for purposes of civil immigration proceedings in California.

* [**SB-54**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54) which prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from sharing information with the US government around immigrants in California custody, or transferring them to Federal custody, with some exceptions for certain listed felonies, and for when a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination is presented to California authorities.

666,hr8jce,False,,263,What evidence supports/discourages raising the minimum wage?,NeutralPolitics,"As far as I can tell, there is evidence on both sides of this issue.

On one hand, some people aren't able to live off of minimum wage when working full time: https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/06 (This of course is dependent on location. Switch to, say, Wyoming and it might look different.) In addition, an increased minimum wage would supposedly require very little increase in prices and/or decrease in profit taking (a 10% increase in minimum wage is correlated with a 0.3% increase in CPI, see page 3): https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2017/the-local-aggregate-effects-of-minimum-wage-increases.aspx#:~:text=Abstract,outcomes%20besides%20employment%20and%20wages.&text=minimum-wage%20workers.-,Increases%20in%20minimum%20wages%20also%20lower%20debt%20among%20households%20with,to%20increase%20access%20to%20credit.

353,5q7ssu,False,,175,Does President Trump's international business empire cause conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution?,NeutralPolitics,"-----

**Introduction:**

-----

I am a lawyer with an interest in Constitutional Law, but I practice Family Law and therefore may not have the absolute best grasp of the interpretation of Constitutional Law.

Moreover, the Emoluments Clause is somewhat obscure, not often covered or taught in law school, and not often discussed in my area of law other than theoretically.

I am posting to foster discussion on this topic, learn, and better understand how President Trump's business empire interacts with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution.

-----

**Sources:**

The information I have gathered purporting a violation of the Emoluments Clause is best summed up in [this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gs_121616_emoluments-clause1.pdf) paper.

-----

**Summary:**

-----

I implore you to read both papers in their entirety, but for brevity sake as a brief introduction, or as a refresher after you've read them - here is my understanding of the argument that these papers make.

-----

[Article I, Section 9](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/68/emoluments-clause) of the Constitution provides as follows: “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And **no Person holding any Office** of Profit or Trust under them, **shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”**

-----

Violation?

-----

The Eisen paper argues for a broad interpretation of the clause, stating **""...the Clause unquestionably reaches any situation in which a federal officeholder receives money, items of value, or services from a foreign state.**

The Eisen paper concludes that **While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive—by virtue of his continued interest in the Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities—a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents.** Applied to Mr. Trump’s diverse dealings, **the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed.**  

-----

No Violation?

-----

The Grewal paper argues for a narrower interpretation, stating that **""...Only transactions conducted at other than arm’s length, or transactions involving the provision of services by the President personally, establish potential violations.""**

Under an office-related definition, the sale of goods generally would not give to emoluments, such as where she sold property at an arm’s length price to a foreign government. Under this reading, only goods sold at other than fair market value would trigger an Emoluments analysis.

**Specific Instances of Potential Foul Play:**

-----

*Taken directly from the Eisen paper paper;*

**Discussion Outline:**

-----

I'd like to refrain from discussing the penalties for violating the Emoluments Clause, how important you think the Emoluments Clause is in relation to other issues, or whether or not you think violating the Emoluments Clause matters.

The main points I'd like to discuss have to do with the text and interpretation of the Emoluments Clause as applied to President Trump's international business presence and whether or not it has been or is being violated.

Another interesting point of discussion is how most Presidents have used a ""blind trust"" to circumvent problems regarding the Emoluments Clause - in which you place pre-Presidential personal holdings in a trust and give complete control to an independent third party - and how President Trump's discussion of ""[giving control to his son](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-business-conflicts-plan/)"" may or may not cure the defect or satisfy the blind trust requirements of an independent third party.

Last, I would like to discuss which interpretation of the Emoluments Clause is better to achieve the goal of anti-corruption from foreign powers, and which of the enumerated specific instances you believe either do or no not violate one or both interpretations of the Emoluments Clause. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5q7ssu/does_president_trumps_international_business/,565,"This may sound like a way to sweetened version, but I'd *think* since the clause is in article 1 it only applies to congress.

Is Federal research money widely enough needed at American Colleges and Universities to make nationwide change? What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to stifle Free Speech?,NeutralPolitics,"On Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), [President Trump announced an Executive Order](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-to-sign-executive-order-requiring-colleges-universities-to-support-free-speech-on-campus) that would require Universities and Colleges to support free speech under the penalty of having their federal research money cut:

> “If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people, to speak, free speech,” said Trump. “If they don’t, it will be very costly. That will be signed very soon.”

I have a couple of questions:

1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?

2: The written order has not yet been released, so there's some ambiguity to what ""support free speech"" means, but the President left little ambiguity that he believes there is a free speech problem on America's campuses. 

What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to limit free speech? Is this a new occurrence? Have they stated why they are doing it?

[This article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431012/fixing-illegal-immigration-five-steps) argues for a strictly enforced kind of ""one strike"" policy, whereby anyone found to have entered the country illegally is thereafter ineligible for any legal status.

> Eliminate incentives for those who would come here to live off the rest of us, and make it easier and more rational for those who wish to come here legally to contribute to our economy. No walls, no government databases, no biometric national ID cards. But not a penny in welfare for immigrants.

This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.

There exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military.

>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.

>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.

Pakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016.

However, [Verizon's CEO recently made a statement that Bernie is entirely incorrect](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/senator-sanders-needs-get-his-facts-straight), and a look a [Verizon's latest SEC 10-K filing](http://verizon.api.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EdgarPro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=GQYoeDso-hr2yxm&ID=11203121) seems to agree with the CEO's claim.
