483,fcmb8d,False,Question,125,"""Iceberg"" or no ""Iceberg"", CFR 0.2% or 2%, the real question is whether the hospital system will be able to support the load once COVID-19 becomes widely distributed. What can we look to for this?",COVID19,"There was a good discussion by Dr. Fauci in NEJM which has been posted before, ""Covid-19: Navigating the uncharted"" [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387?query=RP](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2002387?query=RP) which draws upon the idea of a so-called iceberg of mild cases, which will ultimately drive down the fatality rate. Some WHO experts and Chinese experts have disputed this, arguing that the 2% CFR remains supported. I would posit that recent evidence of undetected spread within Washington argues that there is an iceberg, and South Korean data, though still very preliminary, is pointing to a lower CFR (I think it's 0.64% so far).

The thing is, I know that a CFR of around 0.1% might be akin to influenza, but I don't think that R-naught and CFR paint the whole picture socioeconomically; it is important to know what the threshold is above which hospitals will become overwhelmed in numerous major cities, which would really raise this into a humanitarian crisis.

I think it is much harder to estimate what the situation would look like if CFR is somewhere like 0.6%, as there are no good comparisons to what that looks like.

**tl;dr CFR remains debatable, probably somewhere between 0.2% and 2.0%, but what really matters will be whether it's enough to overwhelm the healthcare system broadly.**

**Does anyone have a good English-translated or English-language report of what the situation on the ground in South Korea looks like?** I think this may be an informative model for what to expect in several weeks in the USA and elsewhere in best-case scenarios, as SK is taking very reasonable measures, while doing so with more transparency and less draconian measures than China.

**EDIT: I don't intend to try to calculate CFR. My premise is that the CFR will remain uncertain for some time due to the multiple variables that play into it. I just used those numbers as examples, because regardless of where it falls within that range, recent epidemics/pandemics are not easily comparable to this.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fcmb8d/iceberg_or_no_iceberg_cfr_02_or_2_the_real/,270,"Are those really reasonable bounds?

-Highest fatality rate is for people over 80, at 14.8%

-Among existing conditions, heart disease is highest risk, followed by diabetes, then chronic respiratory disease, then high blood pressure

-Fatality increase with age. There are no deaths of children under 9. Death rate under 39 years is 0.2%. 40-49 years is 0.4%. 50-59 years is 1.3%. 60-69 years is 3.8%. 70-79 years is 8%. 

-Men are more likely to die (2.8%) than women (1.7%)

When people here simply don't believe the threat exists, or at the very least suggest that taking it seriously is 'panicking,' you get threads like this one.  This subreddit is extremely averse to speaking about the virus in anything other than an optimistic light, yet it believes that the sky is falling in our approach to mitigating the deaths.

We are setting back cancer research, as if research wouldn't be affected by the deaths of Principal Investigators of academic labs.  We are hurting everyone's mental health, as if that wouldn't be hurt by people's family members dying.

This sub's adamant refusal to believe that the virus is a grave threat makes you believe that the costs we're paying with social distancing are too high.  And yes, we are paying costs.

It has an interesting Table S1 with proportions of severe/critical by age. The discussion on page 11 show the odds ratios (20-40 as baseline=1): (strangely no info about 10-20, it may be a misprint):

* <=10: 0.33
* 20-40: 1.00
* 40-60: 1.44
* 60-80: 2.76
* >=80: 5.11

Since the mortality has steeper odds ratio, it seems that young people have lowered sever incidence but most importantly have better odds of surviving that. And if I'm not wrong recalculating the absolute values with these odds data, the critical cases are:

* <=10: 0.5%
* 20-40: 1.5%

I was playing games on my computer when I gradually started feeling weak over the span of an hour I'd say. I was starting to lose concentration of what I was doing in the game and at some point, it was like someone had opened the door of a really cold freezer next to me. I started shivering, slowly at first, but enough that I went to my room to put warmer clothes.

At that point, my concentration was affected enough that I did not even want to continue playing the game on the computer. I went to my bed (shivering uncontrollably in my warm clothes) and put on 2 blankets on top of me. That night turned out to be a terrible time. I gradually stopped shivering and instead started sweating. I kept trying to sleep but I was having all sorts of weird thoughts until, the sweating was so bad, that I had to take everything off of me. I was also feeling thirsty, my throat was super dry, but I was also feeling so weak, that I did not want to get out of the bed to go get a glass. The dryness was so bad that I had to kick myself in the ass and try to go get some water.

I remember , trying to get out of the bed was so hard that I literally crawled to the kitchen. Once there, I realized that I had to stand up to get a glass. I was feeling so weak and out of breath from the crawl that I rested on the floor of the kitchen a good 15 minutes before gathering the energy to lift myself on the counter to open the cabinets. I slowly got my glass and then opened the fridge to get a pitcher of cold water that i had in there. It was so hard to lift the pitcher that I almost fainted from shortness of breath. I brought the pitcher to the floor and collapsed next to it, taking another 15-20 minute rest before gathering my energy again to pour the water into my glass.

Drinking the water made me feel somewhat better but I dreaded the energy it would take to go back to my bed. So I slept on the kitchen floor for the remainder of the night. Some dark thoughts went through my mind. I wanted to call an ambulance, but I felt like if I did, nothing they would do could make me feel any better. I convinced myself that if my time had come... so be it. I am 37 year old, with a healthy weight. I run 3 times a week and do long bicycle rides on the weekends. I am no athlete but I consider myself above average fitness. Never have I felt so sick in my life.

Naturally, I got better the next day. Went to see a doctor and he told me that I had a simple cold, without much examination, and that drinking water and having some rest was the only thing to do. That was 3 years ago, is this what having the coronavirus feel like ? I sure hope not because that was the worst experience of my life ! ",2020-03-14 15:33:23

In addition to the hardest-hit regions in Italy, we also show this for the province of Bergamo.
