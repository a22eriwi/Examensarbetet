923,9fc5m7,False,,33,"I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?",careerguidance,"**Backstory:** I started my career about 2 years ago in a junior IT position, and a salary to match. Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over. I thought about ""correcting"" the letter, but I'm sure they will call to verify, and then I'm really screwed (with both companies).

I'm not going to do that again for sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9fc5m7/i_lied_and_it_got_me_in_a_stupid_career_pickle/,61,Personally I would just take a screenshot of the email and Photoshop the number. ,2018-09-12 21:57:16

Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?",careerguidance,"We always hear stuff like ""follow your dreams!"" and the best recipe for successful wealth is ""pick something you love so much an make a career out of it!"".

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job? 

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

There's no shame in getting yourself financially stable. I think the myth of ""if you want it bad enough you'll fight for it!"" While well-meaning, can be dangerously misleading and unrealistic.

879,ej81vz,False,,19,"Do I actually hate my job, or does everybody feel this way?",careerguidance,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile!

I’m an engineer working for a consumer products company. This is my first job out of college, I’ve been here for 2 years.

On paper, I feel like I should love my job. I make great money, have a lot of autonomy to take on and lead many different types of projects, work reasonable hours, and live in a decent mid-sized city. My work is low stress and has a lot of flexibility, my current boss is a little absent but otherwise we get along fine.

This all said, the reality is that I find myself DREADING work every single day. I can’t make myself care about my projects anymore, which is shocking from somebody who has been an ambitious workaholic their entire life. I end up crying in the bathroom an embarrassing amount. I feel like I’m losing my drive by the day.

To try to articulate what I don’t like in my job:
- I love working on teams, closely with people. The culture of my group doesn’t facilitate this, we work very isolated from each other.
- I don’t care about the final products I work on. I always envisioned myself “making a difference in the world”, and it’s hard to see how that’s true in CPG.
- I don’t feel challenged like I did in undergrad, much of my work is paper pushing or hunting down other people to make sure their work is getting done.

However, these are all normal complaints! None of these should be reasons to feel as miserable as I am! Right??! Or maybe they are?

So, Reddit, I’m looking to hear how others feel about their work / felt about their first jobs. I’m starting to look for a new role within the company, but hesitant to start looking for positions externally quite yet because I’m stuck wondering: is the grass just greener on the outside? Is this simply what work feels like for everyone, and I need to suck it up and appreciate what I have?

Since it was the recession, companies were not actively recruiting much on campus.  It kind of seemed like an extension of high school since no one had concrete plans for their careers.  Formal internship programs with companies did not seem to be common back then, it was all unpaid crappy internships.  I was doing premed, graduated, and worked very low paying jobs in my field (biochemistry) while applying to med school.



I eventually ended up in software development at a large tech company after doing cloud/data related work.  I was doing this while getting my MS in CS and after getting sick of waiting 9 months to hear yes/no after a med school interview.


Most of my friends from college have similar stories.  We all aimlessly worked years before breaking into a good career path.

I wanted to learn something tangible, something where I could work with my hands. Electrician, Plumber, etc. and not something which requires a degree or less hands-on work. Something where there's pretty much always SOME kind of demand for that skill (though I know there's no such thing as an industry invulnerable to recession).

I looked into learning to be an electrician in my area, but it seems impossible to learn and be certified just on the nights or weekends - these things require a pretty much full time commitment through shadowing and apprenticeship.

I guess, how do you guys decide what you are going to do in any given day, or in regards to your job.

Is this common?",careerguidance,"I am a remote contractor and was contacted by a headhunter with an opportunity at a local firm. I interviewed, they liked me, and made me a job offer. Offer good, but not good enough - about a $10k income drop plus a 30 minute commute and all the other unknowns that come with a new job.
Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”
What offer?
Turns out they had sent an offer letter that day. So he gives me the verbal, and it is ok, but doesn’t make me giddy, and I say, “thanks, I’ll look it over.”
It’s Friday. Takes them a while to get me a benefit premium breakdown. Insurance costs lower, but numbers don’t add up, I still have a $10k deficit. I like working remotely, in an earlier time zone, in my PJs. So I call the hiring manager and tell him it is a soft no, and he says, “well if you change your mind we have a lot if hiring to do.”
Headhunter emails me saying, “what happened? I specifically told you to contact me if the numbers were off. We have a significant amount of money earmarked for this situation. I guess I’ll never understand.”
So three things struck me:
1) the assumption that it was the money (well, TBH I made the mistake(?) of telling them what I was making, so she knew there was a gap)
2) this “significant amount of money” was never mentioned until after the fact
3) the “I guess I’ll never understand” makes me think this same scenario has played out at least once (and probably several times) before.

56,frbgyf,False,,84,Do others around the age of 30 struggle with career direction?,careerguidance,"I am approaching 30. Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it.

It's not a binary.  You can make $50k and date more.  You can make time for a hobby, for a passion, to diet, to do whatever you want to do.

I’ve concluded that it’s not helping me grow other than being more efficient in auditing and overall my drive is the large amount of work I have, not passion for what I do. Then I reflected on how I feel outside of work and basically I feel unfulfilled and am only happy when I’m on vacation/weekends. This brings me to my question, how does one find a career that gets them fired up and ready to go in the morning? I’m sick of having my motivation stem from ‘needing’ to do something rather than ‘wanting’ to do it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

996,evb9b0,False,,14,Did you eventually realize a lot of people don’t know what their doing when it comes to a career?,careerguidance,"I’ve been kicking myself a lot lately. I left my first post college job after a year and a half, and if I’d only known then what I known now, I never would have left.

A lot of things happened last year and I was constantly comparing myself to my peers I graduated with. Everyone else seemed to find their dream job and things were moving along. Since the job I had wasn’t my “dream” job I was constantly looking for ways to get out of it.

The job I quit to go to was a very bad choice but at that time I thought I needed to do something different. I’m not joking when I say that job was terrible and I quit after a week. I got lucky that another company offered me a role the same week and I started shortly after. I’ve been at my newest job for about 4 months and I’ve still been regretting my decision. This job isn’t as bad as the last but it has its issues (poor management, lack of training, lack of benefits). Instead of having an actual role or career path, I’m just an office admin.

I wish I would have just went back to my old job after I quit my last after a week. I tried job searching again but I wasn’t liking any of the jobs in my area. I briefly considered becoming a teacher and took steps to get a teaching certificate but I realized I would not be a good fit dealing with kids all day. I went on multiple interviews and for jobs I thought I had a good chance with I was passed along with no interview offer. I was tried of the rejection and answering bs interview questions and bureaucracy, I missed my old company.

I sucked up my pride at the beginning of this month and asked my old boss from my first company if I could come back to work. She offered me my old job back and I am
going through the rehire process now. 

I felt embarrassed and besides from my immediate family knows I’m changing jobs  again and going back to my first company.

It was yesterday when I was scrolling through Facebook that I saw two separate people I graduated with posting about starting new jobs that were a complete 180 than what they started out doing. 

The first one was a girl who’d been with the same company almost 3 years if you count her internship experience. She’s now quit and working as a full time substitute teacher. The other was a guy who moved out of state after graduation and seemed to be a successful sales rep who moved back home. Initially he was going through the process to become a teacher but has now accepted a job as a vet tech at an animal hospital. 

It finally made me realize that a lot of people also have trouble deciding on a career, and especially in your early 20s you’ll make a lot of big decisions, regret some, benefit from others, etc. I’m feeling a little less ashamed at starting back at the same company but I know it’s whats best for me at the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/evb9b0/did_you_eventually_realize_a_lot_of_people_dont/,54,"You are not alone.

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice. That said, I’m just concerned about my possible 2 year gap.

I am at a small (<30 people) company. For the sake of this, let's say I'm a ""Financial Analyst II."" I started as a Jr Financial analyst. In the short 2 years, I have gotten several significant pay bumps, got positive praise, etc. I am doing fairly serious work for someone that's 25. Worth noting that from the start, I never planned to spend my whole career here. 

Outside of some minor gripes that could happen anywhere, my company is pretty awesome. My pay package is awesome. The working hours aren't terrible. And it means something that the higher ups have specifically made a focus of ensuring I get taken care of.

At the same time, I just feel totally checked out as of late. I can't really find the motivation to be *truly* interested in my job this point. I don't feel like I'm learning any new tangible skills. I don't really feel like I'm getting any mentorship for what I want to do. None of the people around me are really on the same career 'track' I'd like to be on. Plus, a lot of the processes in my small company just feel very ""Mickey Mouse.""

I'm hesitant to up and leave. Since my job is fairly good, and my particular industry is pretty niche, good opportunities don't come up all the time. I would consider going back for an advanced degree, but it would likely not get me higher pay than I'm getting right now. And the other option is going into a 'professional services' job in consulting or finance (I should be qualified), but I'd be going in fairly entry level, and likely getting paid a bit less for way more stress.

I have a degree in food science and work in food industries in quality assurance. Food is interesting, but this kind of work is not. It's tedious and routine, I need to change shifts from morning to evening and back every couple weeks, which really affects my sleep schedule, the pay isn't all that great either, and to be honest, I don't even like science that much in the first place. At least not tedious work like this. 90% of graduates end up doing this kind of work. I figured, if I better change to something while I'm young now or I'll end up stuck doing this forever.

* I think I would enjoy doing a creative sort of job. Anything that allows me to ""create"" something would satisfy me I think. However, the last two points are far more important to me. If there is no such job that can satisfy all three, then the last two would do fine if possible.

* I hate the idea of being controlled by your job to move to where you find work, so I would like a mobile job that can be done working from home, or anywhere else. I assume, working on something that involves a computer, or at least a job that is fine with you being anywhere as long as you are able to connect with the employer through phone or computer.

* Lastly, a decent pay, or something that can work up to a decent pay. I was lead to believe that creative jobs don't pay well in school, which was what led me into going into the sciences.

Female, in case it matters, which I suspect it does, sadly. I'm fairly ugly. I'm not severely physically deformed or such, but I'm just plain old ugly; huge round droopy nose, sunken in eyes a little too close together, Dwayne's syndrome so one of my eyes doesn't turn outward all the way which leads to a head tilt to compensate, almost no distinction between my chin and my neck, Rosacea means I always look as red as if it'd just run a marathon at all times, gangly and bony. I've worked in programming all of my adult life and generally haven't had to interact with people face to face which helps. On the phone, I have good rapport with end users; fortunately my voice isn't too bad. About a year ago I got transferred to a new office in a new position under a new boss due to some company mergers and such.

I was recently passed up for a promotion in favor of a coworker I trained, whom I was still training at the time of the interview, who has become my supervisor. The two of us were the only ones who applied. She's wholly competent and also has former supervisory experience in another field whereas I have only ever done programming. I'm not displeased with her as a supervisor, nor do I think she is undeserving, even though I'd obviously have preferred the position myself. But I asked what I did wrong in the interview and my boss said it was a fine interview but that I lacked certain soft skills, and lamented it was her fault for never giving me training on expected manners and hygiene.

I shower daily, I use deodorant, I brush twice a day and usually do a mouthwash rinse at lunch so I can't imagine I smell too bad. I wear typical khakis and collared unpatterned shirts, so I'm certain I'm dressed appropriately even if not femininely or stylishly. I've had several performance reviews, none of which have ever had any criticisms whatsoever. Three in a row of just ""keep doing what you're doing."" I've requested and gotten pay raises from past supervisors as I've made contributions and the like.

I interviewed for a promotion (same job, different title = more pay situation) and got it. I've interviewed for this two times prior and hadn't gotten it, and this was the first time my boss was not on the interview panel, but my (new) supervisor was. Last interview for it was a month prior, so no major changes in my qualifications or achievements. A part of me suspected this was not a coincidence that my boss was not on the deciding panel for the first time when I got it, but I get my pay raise, so I'm happy.

Due to COVID-19, we have limited staff in the physical office. I go in twice a week to handle database matters which can't be done remotely due to requiring a direct network connection rather than VPN. My supervisor is also there on one of those days. She had said yesterday that our boss demanded my ID badge photo be changed, because mine was ""unacceptable."" The badge photos are generally taken by a staff member whose entire job is to assure it's an acceptable photo. It's been acceptable this long. It's about two years old, but I've never heard of anyone getting a new picture; there are people in the office who are 60+ who have their ID badge with a photo from when they were hired in their 30s.

The HR processing team is not physically in the office, so my supervisor has to take the photo with her phone. We do that first thing in the morning and get back to work. She comes over a few hours later and says the boss didn't like it, that I must smile ""better."" My mouth is uneven and my teeth are crooked. My entire face is off center. I repeat, I'm not a pretty girl. Trying to force an even smile looks very awkward and more like a cringe than a smile. Sure enough, this one is shot down, too. The boss tells my supervisor I must wear my hair a certain way in the picture (my standard hair style is just straight down flat, nothing special or weird). We have to reshoot three times, each time my supervisor thinking it looks fine, before the boss will accept a picture.

All I can assume is that my boss just doesn't like my face. Are there any other suggestions for me besides ""try to look better"" ?

I'm okay with being ugly, but if I take particular pains to try to look pretty it becomes depressing because it's impossible, or because it would be great effort, money and discomfort just trying to look normal rather than ugly. In an age where everybody has self esteem issues and depression and anxiety, I'm quite mentally hardy, I'm physically fit, I do triathlons as a hobby, I'm successful in a career that requires a certain degree of intelligence, I volunteer at an animal shelter and feel a general sense of connection to my community and purpose and all that; I like myself when I don't have to try too hard to be something I'm not: pretty.

How can I make a realistic plan?",careerguidance,"Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.

Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.

However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to ""make sure we work as a team"". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.

As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.

I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?

I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as ""this is life"", ""most people have to deal with this to get by financially"" and ""you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route"", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.

Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier.

841,egcnqr,False,,44,Should I take a better paying job or be a “team player”?,careerguidance,"Throwaway to keep this off my main.

I (26F) have been working full time for a non-profit for 1.5 years.  

A few details about this job:

-pay is about $1,500 less annually than a living wage for a single adult in my city.  I have to work another (better paying) job part time to make ends meet/have any quality of life.  HOWEVER, we are getting a pay increase

-this position has had an extreme amount of turnover in the past few years. It’s on a small team which was being hired from scratch when I got there, because the previous team all quit within a few months.  More have quit since then

-the managers who have overseen all this turnover have been the same. It’s a small department, but my team works closely with our manager and her boss.  

-These two supervisors have very different management styles.  My direct supervisor (let’s call her Kim) is extremely lax, and likes to leave policies in gray areas.  Overall, I like Kim as a person, but this has been frustrating to work under since Kim’s boss, we’ll call her Kath, has extremely specific expectations of her staff.  Kath also really likes to stick to chain of command, thereby relying entirely on Kim to communicate Kath’s expectations to my team (which Kim doesn’t really like to do).

Anyway, this environment has led to an extreme amount of stress in my life and I decided, after a few months of escalating nonsense, to look for other employment options.  This current position also requires me to do some intense physical work, and my health has been declining rapidly since I started working here.

I’m now pretty far along in the process of interviewing for a much higher paying position at the company I currently work for part time.  The only problem is, Kim just announced that she will be leaving her position, meaning I would leave my teammates (who I care about and don’t want to inconvenience) scrambling to cover for both me and Kim should I leave. 

I’m also planning on moving away from this city, and both of these jobs, in the next year. 

So, should I take this new, better job for a few months, or stick it out at this miserable one so as not to hurt my team?

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries.

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

637,bpblae,False,,50,Quit job and want to change career. What steps should I take?,careerguidance,"Hi all

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear.

171,c6k93y,False,,51,How do you succeed in business as a shy/introverted person?,careerguidance,"So far the biggest thing holding me back in business is being shy. I can typically turn on the charm when I have to, like for a client or for an interview. But I’m more of a quiet reserved person. 

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention. So then I end up thinking of questions I don’t really need to ask just to appease them by asking *something* and they point this out as a negative also.

547,avpim5,False,,29,"Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?",careerguidance,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/avpim5/left_banking_job_on_bad_terms_after_6_years_and/,108,"I hope you don't mind this off topic response.

My off time is mine. Learn to put boundaries or else you will spend 8 months trying to get back on your feet again after you burn out. I survived my burn out and I hope you don't get to experience what I have been through. Never again. 

2) My second lesson is learn to delegate. If you can't do it on your own, bitch about it until they give you someone to help you out or give that task to someone else. It might sound desperate or at times unprofessional, but your health comes first. Never forget that.

Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f3nfcv/how_damaging_is_it_for_me_to_leave_a_new_job_to/,95,QQ: would staying at a job for 2 months look bad at a resume? ,2020-02-14 05:17:06

Shitty or illegal?",careerguidance,"I'm currently working as assistant director and a position opened up for a director spot in another department. In order to apply, I had to tell my direct supervisor (my director) that I was interested in the position. So I did. He told me that he thought that I'd be an awesome fit for that position, that he would recommend me, that he'd fully support me going for that role, and that he wasn't interested in the position for himself. 

I applied for the position before the closing date (along with submitting an updated resume and portfolio), came into the office from paternity leave and interviewed for the position (2 weeks ago), and just submitted an assessment (spent about 35 hours putting it together) for the position today.

My director pulled me aside just before i submitted my assessment to tell me that he wanted to apply for the same position and that he wanted to ""clear the air"" around it and ""may the best man win"".  Along with that he told me that he had pitched a new position above the one that we are applying for and got rejected and that was one of the reasons he was now applying. He also said that he had been given the same assessment task.

A few other things really got me pissed even more:

* The deadline to apply was 3 weeks ago.
* I'm not sure if he had to actually apply and interview before being given the assessment but it sounds like he didn't.

Most managers at large companies are not idiots, they understand some employees are underpaid or can be paid more, it does not really mean I will hold it against you if you stayed, in fact you may get more concessions for loyalty (moving to a group you want, taking on more responsibilities, growth, remote etc). I understand concerns about reprisal, but depending on the industry/state you work in this is actually very dangerous for the company as it leads to expensive and hard to win lawsuits.

578,a4rmzg,False,,80,Just landed a job earning $140k/year. I don't have a college degree. Should I go back to school and finish?,careerguidance,"I have been working in the tech industry for about 10 years and have worked my way up through a few different software engineer positions. I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for.

My mom wants to go back to school - she is 42, she's been a stay at home mom/housewife for over 20 years. No college degree. She's likely divorcing my dad in a few years...and will need to have a career/income/life of her own.

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it.

533,dy5a25,False,,55,"Possible ""Scarlet Letter"" on my profile?",careerguidance,"Hello,

Some quick background - took a job in 10/18 that I immediately knew was a mistake from my first day. Been pretty miserable since with the role and BIG company, and at about the 6-month mark a lot of my applications were getting serious consideration, and since I work in a semi-specialized function that is suddenly in demand it seemed just a matter of time till I got a new gig.

Fast forward to June of this year - I interview with a BIG company from June-Sept, 2-hour personality test, 2 convos with Hiring Manager, talk to VP, fly out to the office, and then don't get the job.Ok - was shocked after multiple conversations with the Hiring Manager but I guess something happened in that final interview.

Then another company comes along. Interview with them from August - October and go through 8 rounds and don't get that gig. This included a Hiring Manager who knew a lot of my contacts well and told me on the phone I came highly regarded, etc, etc. and she wanted me on the team. Call from the recruiter - ""sorry""

Another I just heard back from (which i really wanted and took 8 weeks!) did 7 rounds, interviewed with Hiring Manager twice, including 2nd interview where we were vibing and she was talking about me in the role in present tense and 3 people from the team, including the last one who ""I would be working closely with""

Now none of these have done a background check- but I did get a job in 10/18 so I should be good there (nothing has happened to me legally or otherwise). Google search is pretty standard, but I feel like I would be vetted out earlier if there was something negative I'm not seeing.

Im confused why I am getting so close every time - the HM is loving me, interviews go well, follow-up emails, and then suddenly it's like sorry after months of interviews. Not even getting to the negotiation stage. What am I missing?

**UPDATE**

After asking for feedback ...” as I strive to improve my interview skills, whether that was a piece of experience that was lacking or a misstep I made in the interview process, or perhaps a way I can better present myself in future interviews.”

I received this:

“The hiring team enjoyed meeting with you! The candidate selected had more closely aligned experience to the role.”

Which leaves much to be desired. The role asked for 3 years of experience in the field, I have 7... etc.

Pretty much from right after my start date I was told that I’d be working in autopsy for the foreseeable future and getting training in the investigation division when time allows (time very rarely allows). 

Everybody at my office seems to think there’s nothing weird or wrong about being hired for one job, and then having to do the duties of another. I’m getting paid more than an autopsy assistant would, but the reason I was so excited about this job is that it was a way for me to stop doing autopsies! They’re super interesting, but they’re physically and emotionally exhausting and I’m just tired of it. 

I’ve been applying to other positions, but there aren’t a lot of open death investigator positions around. When I have gotten to interview, the lack (I have done some, but I have to take overtime shifts to do them) of actual investigations I’ve done is a real detriment. 

I’m just exhausted with the situation I’m in and I want to leave. I have applications out for other agencies for similar positions but now I’m worried about the same situation happening... is there really any way to ensure i get to perform the functions for the job title I’m hired for when every job description now has the ‘other duties as assigned’ line thrown in? 

Also if anyone has any helpful ideas of different ways I can take my career, I’d be really grateful for your input.

* Ultrasound / Pharmacy /Blood Technician / Dental Hygienist / Massage Therapist would be great but they all **require 2+years of school** which is too much time/money.
* Something like bartending would be good, but it isn't a legitimate 1 year college program so you cant get a study permit for it

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end.

I’m 23 (will be 24 when I graduate) and I’ve worked at a small local business that curates and sells business casual higher end clothes for 5 years now.

My official job title is “Director of Sales” and I have that title on my company business cards/emails/etc. This is obviously a rather inflated title, however I thought that with my last raise I would get a title that would look better on a job resume in the future. Last spring I was invited by the owners to attended an award ceremony with them because we were voted the best clothing store in the area (even beating places like Nordstrom!).


As for my duties consist of the following: 

-   assist with customers (all sales duties, it’s a small shop)

-   research new brands for the store to begin carrying

-   fully process new shipments (sign for, create, add photos, decide MSRP, etc.) 

-   write up descriptions for individual inventory item / website brand landing pages 

-   add new items to our online store 

-   create displays for in store advertising 

-   and social media advertising  

-   occasionally email customers and suppliers who with inquiries about products or orders

-   on my off days I will work online researching brands, or visiting other local clothing stores to check out their inventory in person- taking notes on brands that could fit well in our store.

I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal.

Upon graduating, she applied to a school close to the city we live in, and did not make it in. This was apparently normal for this school, and a few people she knew that had been accepted told her to get some part-time experience in the field, and apply again the next year. This is exactly what she did and the second go round she got all the way to a second interview and crushed it. Thought for sure she had it this time, but, no. They told her the average gpa in that application year was the highest in history and they strictly stick to the higher pool. They spoke so highly of her, and begged her to apply again the following year. 

Well life happened, and bills need to be paid, so she really needed to land a decent paying job. She applied for a certain rental car company position and got it. Pay is decent, benefits and vacation are killer, but the hours and work atmosphere have taken a beating on her. Truthfully, she has hit the point where she hates her job. She will randomly apply to other jobs, and has received many offers, but the pay/benefits are exceptionally bad in comparison to her current job. She wants out bad enough that a pay hit is ok, but the offers received have been laughably bad. This really kills her motivation to keep pushing, and I truly don’t know what to do to help. I’ve told her to just quit to clear her mind and relax and it’ll happen, but she won’t do it. I constantly search for job openings in hope I can find something good, but she normally shoots down the ones I find. 

I have a good career and have been excelling and it partly makes me feel guilty how it’s worked out for me. I want her to have the feeling of self worth in her job that I know she yearns for, but I don’t know how to give it to her. She’s the love of my life, and I want nothing more than to see her happy. Her current day to day has really beaten her down. I really want to help her, but I can’t seem to find the right angle on it or what exactly I can even do to truly help her. 

I’m seeking guidance on what I can do to help without pushing her too much.  Good career options with her current degree are hard to come by and openings are few and far between. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

How did you go about it?,careerguidance,"So, I’ve always been interested in many things, which made it hard for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I’ve tried both the natural and the social sciences, but eventually went for a BA in English. After all, I loved writing and reading.

After about three years of working, I just realized that writing for a living just isn’t for me. Now, I want to go back to one of my first loves—environment and the natural world. 

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

- I’m currently taking some online courses on the subject to see if I’d really be interested in them, as well as to narrow down my interests. I’m not planning to look for jobs until next year, so I have a lot of time! (Keeping my writing job for now.)
- Once the pandemic dies down, I do plan on volunteering on an environmental advocacy org. It’s a little intimidating because I’ve never done this before, but I do want to have hands-on experience (and network while I’m at it).
- I don’t plan going straight back to school! I really want to have some related experience in the field before I do and be really sure I like the subject. I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
- I know I did say I started to “hate” writing, but I also know that it’s my most marketable skill right now. The positions I’m targeting are definitely writing-related. If this pans out, maybe I’d end up sticking with it, who knows.
- I’m doing content writing right now, which has been really soul-sucking for me. Plus, I’ve also stopped doing creative writing, which was my major and something I thought I’d want to do for the rest of my life. (Hence, the “I hate writing” bit.)

I’ve been at this company for about 2.5 years, but my heart has never been in it. I took the job for the money. I moved from client-side back to consulting.


Though I’ve been looking for a new role elsewhere since I started the job, (and gotten a few offers over this duration), I liked my coworkers and wanted to give it an honest try.  TBH, it wasn’t going so badly. 


Then at the start of 2019, there was a leadership change both at CEO level, and Regional Director (RD) for my geography.  It’s been a massive cultural shift, especially in our region where the new RD was brought in from a competitor with a very different business approach.  It’s a very poor cultural alignment. 


Now there is lots of alienation among the existing leadership cohort as new RD brings in his team from his past company. Of course these new joiners all have a similar cultural approach.  It’s getting pretty toxic all around as several of us know we are being setup to exit the business. 


I’m not immune.  My role is being redefined under this new regime. RD no longer wants me in a region-wide team leadership and oversight role, he just wants me to focus on my city, hands on with projects. It’s great that I won’t have to travel so much, but it feels like a demotion, not the next step to long term success.


HQ (on another continent) loves my work so far and has offered me additional equity in the company. I have great support back there and my overall salary situation is fantastic. As the new RD seems to be pushing me out the door, the award of equity feels like a mind-f**k.


I’m eager to move on, but golden handcuffs are tough to shake off.  I need to do the best I can where I am at until I find another landing spot. 


So what to say in the goal setting?  I’m totally unengaged, disinterested, and resentful. 


I know playing it too candidly isn’t the right thing, even though my line manager is equally disaffected by the organisational transformation that surrounds us. 


Any suggestions on how to do this dance would be appreciated.

Third, what about personal development? Think of your next job, and a skill that you'd need on the job there that you have yet to possess/perfect.

858,bnojli,False,,45,Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,careerguidance,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

351,go32r2,False,,122,Unhappy with my degree | How to move out of copywriting / advertising ?,careerguidance,"I’m about to turn 26 and I’m tired of feeling unmotivated and directionless.

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

He started verbally listing all the things I was doing wrong, the stupidest one being that I always played with my hair while working.

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

I said ""what news?"" and he told me there was a request to disable my computer access because boss was going to fire me. This followed a couple of months of deteriorating conditions on the job, and on this day I had actually gone in early to talk to him about how things were going. [Twilight Zone theme]

I had already received a meeting request that morning from boss for like 10am so I was already thinking in terms of how the next few hours should go. After he went back to hold his 9am daily meeting, I gathered up all my stuff and walked out the front door. A few hours later I got a voicemail from him saying ""You missed a meeting, so I'm going to have to let you go.""

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

579,a2lzzv,False,,89,What in the world can I do with two LibArts degrees besides burn them for warmth?,careerguidance,"tl;dr version: I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I was unprepared and I panicked. I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.

I'll likely just do the presentation begrudgingly. I had a mini presentation that went well today which has given me some better feelings towards it.

However, I don't think people should be pushed to do what they don't want to do and they should create their own goals with their managers, not have things foisted upon them. Allowing people to grow at their own pace within their own bounds is crucial for authentic, healthy development.

Also there's a difference between being encouraged and being carelessly pushed.

Thanks to the nice people who commented!

It pretty much says it in the title.

I have manageable but very present social anxiety and despite this have taken on more and more team and client presentations over the past year. Now my boss is pushing me to do a company-wide presentation as a challenge. I haven't revealed that I have anxiety but I identified that I was proud of my group leadership in my performance review which is why I think I'm getting this 'push'. 

Frankly, I'm too anxious to. Already have lost sleep over the idea. It's too much of a jump too soon. I should add that this presentation has nothing to do with my day to day job and my boss isn't asking this of any other team member.

853,8x4cxi,False,,16,How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,careerguidance,"This is going to be a long read, and I apologize for it.  I've written this over 4 days and have tried to explain my situation as best as I can.  (It still seems to be a book, and I'm sorry about that.)

I graduated from college (BS, Economics) from a well-known mid-atlantic university in 1999. I was young, and I didn’t have a lot of direction. I wound up taking a job in Healthcare as an entry-level pharmacy technician, which was completely unrelated to my major. Initially, I had planned to stay there a year, two tops. By that time, I would figure out what I wanted to do and I’d start my destiny. But that’s not really how life works. I got very comfortable. I knew there was little to no upward mobility, but that was OK. The job was close to my home, my boss was friendly, the work was easy, and the hours were great. The pay wasn’t as high as I’d like, but for a recent college grad, living back at home, the money was just fine to both help my parents with bills and save some cash.

A few years after my hire date, I decided to continue working there while doing something I always wanted to do. I wanted to run my own company. I had/have solid IT skills. I was “that guy” that everyone went to in order to fix computer problems. Family, friends, and even at work I became the unofficial IT guy.  (With that added responsibility did come increased pay.)  I decided to monetize that, and I used my experience and knowledge to start an IT company. I went from 4 clients to over 1,100 (about 82&#37; of those repeats) and wound up running a very successful IT company for over a decade. I was young, I was able to work my 9-5, see clients till 9 or 10PM, work till 4AM in my basement repairing machines, and then get 3 hours of sleep to go back to my day job. I did this for about a decade, working most weekends from ages 24-35. Finally burning out, along with the industry changing, I closed the company when the disparity between income and expenses was getting too close. My wife and I also started our family, and raising kids and working 20 hours a day was not feasible for my own health or for being a parent.

I developed a good source of income from my computer company on-top of the “ok” income from the 9-5. I was able to start two 529’s. My children’s college will essentially be funded even if I never earn another dollar. I was also able to create a decent high five-figure nest egg which I have invested and don’t intent to touch.

19 years later, while I have moved up a little to Senior Lead Pharmacy Technician, the company has gone through several changes in ownership, and is now owned by a big company that you would definitely know.  I'm overpaid in the industry due to the length of time I've been there.  I’ve declined recent promotions because the local leadership is very poor, and the income increase for those positions is widely out of touch with the increase in responsibilities. Those positions would very likely kill me.  Very recently, many of my coworkers have resigned which has in some cases tripled the work the remaining people have to do which has presented not only unsafe situations for patients, but has induced a health-scare for me as a result of being overworked. My blood pressure skyrocketed the other day to unsafe levels, and it was completely work-induced. I don’t want to die at a desk in a job that I have come to hate.  I've come to the awakening that my departure is overdue.

I’m now 43 years old. I’m more or less in the same job I started in when I was 25. The roles have changed, the pay has increased, the responsibilities have increased. I need to find a new job, but I’m completely lost. I haven’t been on an interview in 19 years. I know how to write a resume, and I updated mine about 2 years ago in preparation for a move. I’m very well respected at my job, but they are suspicious as to why I don’t want the promotions. I am their lead performer in terms of branch metrics, as laid out by the company’s expectations. I simply no longer want to work under this atmosphere of the current leadership because it’s impacting my health. I’m at the point where I’m mentally OK with resigning before finding something else, but I know that is not a smart move. It is time for me to put my big guy pants on, and get out into the world and do something better to support my wife and kids.

**Here is my problem**: I don’t know what I can offer someone.  Not to get caught up in the buzzwords, but I’m reliable, dependable, honest, both public and private. I show up to work during snow storms of any amount, and I work really well with coworkers - I'm well respected by my peers, and I have become an ""unofficial leader"" among them.  I am a team player, and I’m not there to see only myself excel. I am good with computers, and I have 20 years of really solid customer service skills that I use to make even the most unhappy customer a happy one. A lot of that comes from working in healthcare; these people are sick and have little to no guidance other than me. More of that skill comes from when I ran my company. It was only me; I did sales, cold calls, marketing, advertising, on-site repairs, workshop repairs, customer service, billing, all of the financials, and when something went wrong, I had to be there to take the hit, accept responsibility and make the situation right for the customer.  I wore all of the hats.

Even with all of the above, I feel like I still don’t know what I can offer someone, and I have no idea what industry would be mutually beneficial based upon my skill set(s).

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know that this is a very general question, but even resources where I could go to find out where I might fit in would be helpful.   For my own health, I have to step out of acute healthcare. My IT skills have waned a little bit, and I’m definitely not up on the newest and greatest. I have no certifications, not even A+ back in the day. I just knew how to talk to people, I could fix things, and keep people happy. I could work the magic, and it worked out for everyone.

I just feel really lost, and it is my own fault. I’m just looking for help.  I'm not opposed to any industry, just not acute healthcare.  My heart (and body) are no longer in it.

330,efwhmo,False,,119,"I'm a manager and I don't know why but working for just profit feels wrong, can you help me out?",careerguidance,"I have tried to conceptualize wtf is wrong with my situation, but I don't really know. I think at the core of it is that as a manager I am consistently told I should be doing what brings the most profit for the business, but yet I feel like sometimes doing what is most profitable is also being a dick to my employees. Exploiting them as much as possible is the most profitable for the company.

I feel like my boss is not a person who seeks to pay people for the work they put in. He seeks to avoid giving raises as long as possible until his hand is forced, which is shitty because its basically him trying to exploit you as much as possible for as cheap of pay as possible EVEN when he recognizes value.

So my problem is two fold:

1. My perspective makes me feel like my boss relatively takes advantage of labor surplus to exploit workers for pay. We are being paid way less than him yet take on nearly just as much stress for our work. He takes trips to europe constantly.

2. The system of competing companies encourages us to under pay everyone in order to have the most future investment. Future value at the cost of current people and their happiness in their lives. How is that fair to the people of today?

I'm being pressured to ask for a higher quality of work from my employees when I already think they are underpaid and that they won't get raises even if they do more. How can I sit there and tell them to do more when they already seem underpaid to me? Hell minimum wage buys so little. The thing is, capitalism seems to be a big game of who can skeet their workers hardest. On the one hand, my current owner of the company I manage for makes too much and does too little. Frankly it is not good for a company to overpay anyone because long term profits go down from a lack of investment. How is it that every company can underpay all of their employees and that be whats best? 

Like these kinds of things don't even make sense to me in a moral sense. How can it be moral for us all to be underpaid? I'm just so confused when I think about business. How is it that my employees lives blow and yet I am still being asked to ask more of them?? Someone please explain that too me. I sit in my room trying to conceptualize it all and it feels like every time I think about it I'm just getting lost. Like I cant even sort it all out because none of it makes any sense. Why is our society this way?? If my workers are being underpaid in my opinion, yet globally others are willing to do the work for less, than I need to be getting more out of them. Yet they are already miserable. I am asking them to be more miserable. It is miserable.

How is it that my boss can take home a big fat stack of cash and that be fair? I just don't get it. How can bezos be paid 100000 per hour and it be fair? His work could not POSSIBLY be THAT stressful. Talent is being made happy and yet we are claiming that by paying talent it is intrinsically worth it to us. It's worth it to overpay Bezos because we get our value back? How could that be possible?

I can't even freaking figure out if my employees are overpaid or underpaid because they are miserable and life sucks on minimum wage in the US, yet people across the globe are willing to do their job for drastically less because they have never known better. It just makes no sense. How can my employees be broke nearly 24/7 and yet I need to be asking them to do more work than what they are doing?

I want to help people. I don't want to live a happier life than anyone else, but I don't know how to evaluate what is fair I guess. I have noticed how if you give people an inch they take a mile. They always accept handouts because many are not in it to be fair, they are in it for themselves. They don't give back when someone is too generous. But in order for me to not be too generous, I need to be putting a dollar amount on their work and idk how in my workplace because I dont think the work is worth it for the pay, but apparently it is? It's just I get confused. I'm trying to get fight some sort of unfairness I seem to perceive in the world and the people who have so little but I can't pinpoint what the unfairness is exactly.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/axwty0/i_cry_in_the_office_bathroom_everydqy_what_can_i/,87,"Hey man, first things first, I'm sorry you're going through this kind of anguish. Your coworkers are basically exiling you out of the group. And something triggered this change in group behavior. You need to figure out what it was.

Nobody would like being forced into social isolation. However if it gets to the point where it's making you cry everyday and you dread work, that's a red flag against yourself. Did a similar situation ever happen to you during your childhood, like in school or something? And was your reaction the same as now ? You might be a person that is high in agreeableness, maybe you're a very sensitive person.

And that's not a nice thing to be in the average workplace. Like at all. 

The workplace can be very socially intense, there's always an underlying atmosphere of friction and competitiveness. You really don't want to give off the impression that you're too nice and agreeable, too harmless, too emotional, not having the courage to confront people. Or else people will just step over you. I suspect that's what's going on here.

Maybe that girl you mentioned is a polar opposite of you personality-wise. And as a consequence she maybe hates you and has no respect for you and somehow communicated that sentiment to the group and the other co-workers resonated with it. Why would they lie to you over tea or lunch ? Maybe they think you're too soft, maybe they're talking behind your back about how lame you are and how you're probably crying in the bathroom every day. This is just my suspicion, but you tell whether that can be true or not.

Bottom line is that you need to stand up for yourself, and not accept that people lie to your face about not going to tea while you know they are doing so behind your back (make sure you're 100% sure though!). Not accept that they just ignore you by saying they're too busy, which is a total BS excuse btw, don't accept that. If you do, it's over, you're invisible, you don't matter, you're annoying, why bother inviting you? You gotta have some presence, don't be non-confrontational, show that you're not a pushover.

Whatever you do, don't just run runaway to another working environment. Your coworkers will get the last laugh and if you get to a new workplace then it might be the same thing all over again. Or worse.

Whatever you do, wipe away your tears. You allowed yourself to let other people's behavior towards you hurt you. Address the vulnerability and reclaim your emotional stability. Being socially ostracized hurts but maybe you are a part of the problem. Of course the behavior of your coworkers is straight up ""middle-school clique"" childish but hey some people are just immature / just as insecure as you and they will follow the group like sheeps.

Hope some of this helps, I used to be very shy, sensitive, agreeable, but now I'm not a pushover anymore and I don't accept shit from anyone. I encourage you to hold yourself to a fair standard ",2019-03-06 09:08:56

* *Step away from the computer.* Take some time to rejuvenate by doing something you enjoy, whether it's baking, gardening, playing music...take a break.
* *Network.* I know it doesn't always sound like the most fun, but networking gives you an excuse to dress up and get out of the house. There's an added bonus potential of meeting someone who could connect you with your next job opportunity.
* *Celebrate all of your successes.* If you landed an interview but didn't ultimately get the job, that still means your materials were awesome enough to get you an interview. Likewise, if you set a goal to send out 10 applications per week, and you reach your goal, celebrate! Remembering to take pride in the small victories can help keep you moving. 
* *Post positive reminders.* Use phone notes, sticky notes, a whiteboard \- whatever method will grab your attention \- and inundate yourself with positive messages. Try posting inspirational quotes, short\-term goals, or pictures of loved ones to keep you motivated.

I have had a crazy few years. I studied Psychology at University after being really passionate about it during A-Levels.

I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated.

I've been feeling a lack of motivation at work for months now. I'm not too sure of the reason, but I think I know part of it. Which is, my skill level is way higher than most of my teammates. I always help them, but it's not my job to be educating them about everything, this is stuff they should've learned from their experience. Instead, I find myself constantly having to help people with their tasks, on a near daily basis. This is draining me. I feel like maybe this gap in the skill set is playing a major role in my lack of motivation, since if I'm being honest, I constantly feel like I'm being dragged down. My own progression at work has been really slow for a while.

I really don't know what I should do. Is it simply time to leave the job? Should I just tell my boss that the team needs some professional training? But then again, I don't want my team to think I think they suck. I don't think they do, I just honestly think that their skill level should be higher considering the amount of experience they have. I personally have about the same amount of experience as they do, so I can't find an explanation for the skill gap. Another possibility I'm dreading is that this could be a sign of depression. Could that also be a possibility or does it sound just absurd?

682,c3hcfz,False,,30,How do you approach applying for new positions after getting fired?,careerguidance,"Crossposting this to several subs so I can reach the widest audience possible. Reddit, I need some advice.

&#x200B;

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a ""don't give a shit"" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 ""maybe you should just show up to work on time"" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

&#x200B;

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that ""don't give a shit"" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c3hcfz/how_do_you_approach_applying_for_new_positions/,89,"You don't need to tell them that you were fired for excessive tardiness, because this wasn't the REAL reason you were fired. Look at it this way:

In your words, you were in a ""don't give a shit"" attitude, so you *wanted* to leave. Your tardiness was just a surface manifestation of something deeper—*not being valued by the company.* So instead of up and quitting, you essentially got them to fire you by showing up late. I'm sure you're not the type of person who is incapable of showing up on time. After all, you were in a senior level position.

So, the true reason you and the company parted ways was a difference in what you valued. Sure, on paper they fired you, but the true reason was that you and the company had different values.

Now when it comes to discussing this with potential employers, it's important to present it in an amicable way. Something like you ""outgrew the position"" or are just looking to be challenged further. Personally, if someone had ""drama"" at their last position I'm very suspect as they're bound to repeat history. If you need to use a reference from your last job, it's important you communicate why you left as well, so they understand.

That being said, it's important that you analyze what happened in your last position so it doesn't happen again. I would ask yourself ""How was I complicit in creating the conditions at my last job that I said I didn't want?"" I'm sure the company had some fault as they weren't paying you enough, but it's important to see what part *you* played in not getting payed enough, or not being valued. ",2019-06-21 22:18:20

110,hpbm4b,False,"Cleveland, OH",110,Is it morally wrong to choose a career that doesn't work to solve the world's most severe problems?,careerguidance,"I'm 22 and just graduated college. Naturally, I'm focusing on establishing a career. I've always been interested in the concept of work. Ever since the end of high school, I've thought a lot about why people work and how to have a fulfilling career. This is easily the aspect of my life which I seem to value most, although this value comes from a sense of duty/social obligation rather than my own interest. So there's this question that's been bugging me for awhile.

As I explore different career paths people are pursuing, I can't help but notice that so many of them seem to be kind of... worthless. I make this statement with a lot of skepticism because I don't want to be judgmental with so little information. It's just that I notice so many problems happening in the world: hunger, disease, mental illness, violent crime, oppression, war, poor education, accidents, etc. However, few of these issues are directly effecting me. I live a comfortable life of abundance, security, and all the pleasures one could ask for. Some of this is a result of my own doing, as I enjoy rewards I have earned, but far more of it is just a result of circumstance. I was born in the USA, I'm intelligent, I'm able-bodied, I have a close family, I had access to relatively good education, to name a few of my blessings. But I earned none of this. I don't feel guilty for winning the lottery of circumstance, but I do feel guilty for not helping those who didn't. So here's my question: **is it morally wrong to pursue a career that primarily serves or benefits those on the higher end of the quality of life scale instead of dedicating one's life to solve the world's more severe problems?**

I realize that it's difficult to measure the value produced by, say, a film studio. What if someone is inspired by a movie and decides to travel to a third world country and build a school? But still, it seems that a film studio is just a bunch of people spending time, money, and energy playing with cameras and lights, like a game, when there's people in the world who don't have food. How about another example, a marketing firm that works with fashion brands to sell more expensive sunglasses? I mean seriously? You're working day in and day out to push pieces of plastic people wear on their face so they're a little more comfortable seeing outside? While people are dying of infections diseases because they don't have sanitation infrastructure? Or how about a business accountant? Crunching numbers to make sure you're getting the best tax return so that you can pay your dividends to shareholders so they can buy a new set of golf clubs to hit balls around on huge grass fields where homeless people would be kicked out for sleeping because they have nowhere else to go? I know my perspective is limited and ill informed, but there is truth to the basic concept: people spend resources solving comparatively minor problems when there are very serious issues affecting others in the world.

**What do you think about this? Is it morally wrong to not try to solve the world's biggest problems, if you have the ability to do so? If so, how might we change this about the world? How do we motivate people to create value where is more needed?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hpbm4b/is_it_morally_wrong_to_choose_a_career_that/,276,"You’re 22 - there’s a lot of world and a lot of opportunity out there. Now is your chance to do something you’re passionate about, something exciting.  That may mean helping others, or it may mean another path.  

First you need to keep your lights on, food on your table, and to not be a burden yourself, on the public dole.  If you pursued a marginal value degree, think about what you might need to do to monetize it. Consider risk, and manage it - don’t run from it or run towards it.  Be smart. 

The greatest benefit to others will be when you have the time, resources and energy to put towards things that matter to you personally.  The bleeding heart, eating cat food and earning minimum wage, bless them for doing so, might not be the right path for everyone.  

And capitalism and creating “value” of different types isn’t the evil that the leftists would try to indoctrinate you into thinking. I agree with the sentiment of movie production or fashion.  But people, even the socialists who want to own more of people’s’ labor for supposed betterment, like that stuff. Entertainment, storytelling, fashion, these aren’t modern things - they’re ages old. They’re human nature. The fact that there’s so much money in that vs other greater challenges is indeed sad, but it’s humanity’s making, and it’s not going to change.  Best you can do is vote with your wallet and route your resources when you have them, elsewhere.

However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason.

ps: by ""architect"" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term ""architect"". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them ""architect"" or ""engineer"" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say ""he is the licensed architect"". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

765,binfaf,False,,21,"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?",careerguidance,"I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience. The ""dead wood"", by comparison, seem to know they are on to a good thing and try not to rock the boat.

I unlocked it and on the screen was an email between my boss, his manager and the HR rep about how my time there is limited and originally they were going to let me go last week but the new hire was on vacation. The language in the email was pretty insulting tbh as I have a medical condition that involves a compromised immune system, so I get sick about once per month for a day or two, and they were calling me a 'pussy' and a 'punk' for calling in sick so frequently. Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me? Personally I hate this job so it might be a blessing in disguise but it's hard to find a decent paying job out here with my job experience (or lack thereof).

I have about $100k in student loans that I am already aggressively paying down, but getting to a net worth of $0 is going to take about 3 years. 

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay. 

**I want to work but there doesn't seem to be any worthwhile work to be done.** I am a bored, soulless desk sitter waiting for 6.

158,hrptg7,False,Portugal (Europe),37,I have made a huge mistake and switched to a new company mid-pandemic. I hate it. What should I do?,careerguidance,"A few months ago I was contacted by a head hunter for a job with a much higher salary in a very prominente company, better benefits and lots of flexibility.  
At this point, I was employed for 2,5 years in a fairly good company, which had its problems, but I could deal with them. They didn't pay very well, though, but I had lots of flexibility, a great team and super interesting projects.  
At the same time I was contacted by this head hunter, I was going through the selection process to my dream job and I had made it until the last phase where it was just me or another person.    
So, I had 2 very good opportunities on the table: my dream job and the other job which was better. I decided it was safe to quit.  
As you may imagine, I was not selected for my dream job. So I was left with a very good job offer, which was ok for me. I took it and here I am, 2 months later.  
My mistake was that I was so convinced I was going to get the dream job that I didn't pay attention to the signs in my interactions with my current employer that this was bad, nor did I dedicate any effort to get to know a bit more of the company.   
This new company is absolutely the worst. They literally lied in the interviews about the company’s working culture, their stance about flexibility and even about some aspects of my contract.  
I got in the company in the middle of a HUGE crisis where I immediately took a ton of responsibility and I felt it would not be correct for my colleagues if I quit during my experience period and leave them with all of this by themselves. 2 of them are really great, one of them actually quit last week. The company has a huge turnover, as you can imagine.  
I am finding out more and more horrific things about this company every day. My boss is a hypocrite, liar, has no empathy, treats women poorly, and everything revolves around him and how brilliant he is. Overall a sick narcissist. Last year alone, 2 people had burnouts and 1 had a stroke after working 4 days without sleeping.  
I worked 2 national holidays and 1 full weekend, plus a million extra hours for an event, which I would not do in a normal situation, but everything was very badly managed and if I didn’t, nothing would work. The day after the event I was told we could take one day off (which is not enough either way), so I took it, but apparently it just meant that instead of arriving at 9:30 I could arrive at 10:00. And this is not even a joke or me exaggerating.  
I’m not going to rant anymore, but many other very horrible things have happened and I honestly don’t know what to do. There should be an economic crisis coming up and I’m not sure I can just quit without anything lined-up. I don’t want to be unemployed when it hits. I have applied to 3 jobs so far that I’m waiting for an answer. 1 of them with people I know and who really appreciate my job, another one for a position that I’m 100% qualified, and another one that actually I will not take at all even if I’m selected because it is not very interesting. In addition, I have a volunteer project writing articles in my area for a think tank and I would like to take a programming bootcamp.  
I was absolutely naïve and I didn’t even make an effort to try to research about them, I know this is my fault. I never thought this was ever a possible scenario. But I just feel that coming here every day is doing a number on my mental health. I absolutely HATE being here and I’m actually scared that they can screw up my career if I stay longer. I’ve heard stories.  
Should I just quit? Should I suck it up and train my resilience skills?

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *""Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?""*

I have been working in a hospital for 5 years in an allied health career. I’m extremely organized and self-sufficient. When there are workflow changes, or new software additions I always learn quickly and coworkers come to me for help. I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration?

595,ctakj5,False,,41,Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.,careerguidance,"About a year ago, I left a terrible job. I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* ""HIGH turnover.""
* ""Terrible work culture.""
* ""Unrealistic expectations.""
* ""Stifling company culture adds to low morale."" 
* ""Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work.""
* ""Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded.""
*  ""You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees.""

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months?

I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

&#x200B;

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

999,cd1qan,False,,44,"Help! Any advice for me? Nearly 40, looking to start over.",careerguidance,"Hello, reddit.  I'm here looking for as many people's opinions as I can get, and hopefully even some specific advice as to what I should do with my life.  I'll be 39 years old next month (seems like I was 25 yesterday), and it's time for me to make a big change.  My problem is, I have never had many interests that were a driving force or a passion in terms of career, and I have never had any particular skillset that is advanced enough to consider unique or particularly desirable to employers.  

A summarized description of my work history up to this point is as follows:

I started working at a very young age, and have always been a valued employee at any job I've ever had.  At around 21 years old I started working off the books running a coffee truck route in New York (where I currently reside).  I made a large amount of money doing that, but I was young, foolish, and of the mindset that the money train would never stop, so I spent wildly. Eventually, the business began to deteriorate due to many factors outside of my control, but it basically began a decline into obsolescence due to an industry wide refusal to change and adapt with the times.  I continued this job for 13 years.  That's 13 years of working completely off the books, without benefits or any form of retirement investments, as well as several years at the end which were rough enough financially to wipe out anything I had in savings at the time.  During those last years I did decide to go to college however, and I pursued a bachelors in psychology.  I naively took loans out every semester, and never graduated.  In fact I dropped out with just one course left to complete my degree program.  My current job, which I've had since the end of my stint as a coffee truck driver, is in the marine transportation industry.  I got the job, with no background in the field, via the recommendation of a friend.  The job pays very well for someone without a degree (over 100k), and I've managed to learn quite a bit in the 4 years I've been here.  My problem is, I don't like it, and I feel it's not going to last.  Not going to last for several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that the company may actually fold within the coming year due to an astoundingly bad couple of years marred with incidents and loss of business.  I should also mention that my time here doesn't really qualify me for work in the same field with different companies, because it's very specific to this particular company.  In addition, the pay for comparable jobs at similar companies pay about half of what I'm making now.   I'm trying to come up with a ""what next"" plan and I'm really struggling.


I feel I'm a very competent person, and I don't feel limited by my ability to learn any new job/skill.  But I'm almost 40.  I need a job that pays well, and that I'm interested in enough to want to stay for good.  I would also ideally like to find a job which allows me the flexibility to travel (I've held jobs for my entire life that have been extremely inflexible in terms of taking days off), but I understand that I can't make that priority number one.  I should mention that although I am swimming in student debt, I would consider going back to school (for no longer than 2 years), if the resulting potential job paid well enough for me to live comfortably and pay off my debt.  As I've said, my interests are varied and I do feel confident that I could learn most anything, but if it means anything at all I've always been incredibly fascinated by insects, traveling, plants and animals. I am also open to moving almost anywhere, including out of the country if that's what it takes.

Go see a financial advisor, or debt consolidator. You need to stop the leak before you drown. 

I suspect one of the reasons you're trying to find a new career is you're probably so unhappy and stressed out by your financial situation that you think some perfect job is going to come fix everything, but that's simply not the case.

I've worked in the film industry (couldn't stand it because my personality doesn't fit the ego and status driven culture), a small business in trading (I liked the autonomy but had no passion for selling merchandise), teaching (love working with children and I'm great at it but it gets exhausting), government (struggled with the bureaucracy but enjoyed the easy pace), animation production (being a small cog in a giant system made me depressed).  

I'm smart and hard-working so I generally succeed in whatever I do.  But I find that I always get tired of a job after a year or two and move on to something different.  I recently quit my animation job and thought that I wanted to pursue stand-up comedy professionally.  I do have a knack for it: performing, writing and comedy.  But after a few months of performing as an amateur, I now think this is something I'd like to pursue as a hobby and not an occupation.  

I recently took a Jackson Vocational Interest Survey and my top 3 interests are 1. social science, 2. professional advising and 3. performing arts.  

I'm now thinking that I'd like to work for a non-profit that helps youths.  I've always found it fulfilling to help youths to develop themselves and achieve their goals (mainly because this is what I wish I had when I was younger.) I'm hoping that if I pursue this line of work for income and pursue stand-up as a hobby that I'll be fulfilled spiritually, financially and creatively.  But I'm scared that even this I'll get tired of after a year or two and end up where I am now.

Are there other people like me?  Is my problem that I just haven't found a line of work that works for me - the assumption being that there is a ""right fit"" for everyone?

905,cv9hmx,False,,25,How do you turn down a promotion?,careerguidance,"For background, I have a masters in counseling, am a published author of 4 research studies in professional journals, I have more than 15 years of experience in mental health, most of which are as a therapist. Several times throughout my career, I was on the path to licensure and invariably, my job responsibilities would change (eg: management) and the offer to support it would be forgotten (and unnecessary for the new responsibilities). 

Recently, my position of a year as a therapist became team leader and came again with the promise of having someone at my workplace (who was qualified) supervise me so that I accumulate the hours for licensure. Again, it fell through and I’m not willing or interested in licensure. In my field, it means little in terms of money and a significant amount of additional work. I’ve tried to get out of this field for years but have resigned myself to sitting right where I am, with flexibility, freedom and time to work on side jobs (eg: freelance writing). I Meade $39k a year and was already told that with licensure, they would increase that $500. No thanks.

Sorry this is long. Anyway, my supervisor is now dangling another carrot, telling me that they intend to make me a manager in the near future. I guess if I were at the beginning of my career it might be enticing but I can’t think of anything I’d rather do less. I’m a great worker, fantastic documentarian, supportive and encouraging of my staff and willing to work above and beyond 40 hours every week (I’m salaried, so it’s irrelevant). Bottom line is I don’t want the position, at all. I also don’t want to lose the position I have, so I don’t want to insult the offer. I’m as busy as I want to be and they already get a bargain in the quality of my work. We get health insurance and no vision or dental or retirement. They haven’t in 30+ years and have no intention to do so, so we have to purchase/invest on our own. 

How do I turn down a management position without insulting the organization? I’d love to tell them the true reasons why I don’t want it but I won’t.

776,a06016,False,,44,"I’m a 29 yo flight attendant. If you were in my shoes, would you tough it out and keep flying until you can retire or start over? What else would you transition into?",careerguidance,"Growing up I was a typical straight A student/cheerleader/overachiever who never really put much thought into what I wanted to be when I grew up. I did what everyone else was doing and went to college where I gained a bachelors of science with a 3.5 gpa. I initially thought I wanted to go to pharmacy school but changed my mind after finishing the prerequisites & working a couple years as a full time pharmacy technician. At that age I wasn’t motivated by money (I am now) and felt like I would be bored to death performing quality control on medications everyday. Soooo it was a NO for me. Instead of quitting altogether, 3 years in, I made the decision to at least finish what I’d started and spend my 4th year putting my credits towards a biology degree. (Full disclosure, Low scores on the PCAT exam & HIGH stress levels trying to study and balance life played a role in this choice...) Fast forward to today, I cannot see myself going back to school to do anything else in the healthcare industry. Just watching shows like greys anatomy or botched and the thought of more student loans make me VERY nauseous. 


Prior to college and since graduating, I’ve had various roles in hospitality/customer service: cooking, hosting, catering, serving, bottle service/bartending, etc and have been lucky enough to keep a position as a flight attendant for the past 6 years. 
In the beginning, it was GREAT! I traveled the world and never really saw it as “work” but for the past almost 3 years, that’s changed drastically & I’ve had a daily internal struggle over what else I can do with my life. The actual job itself is EASY but the lack of sleep = constant jet lag, living out of a suitcase, time alone/away from loved ones, and just having to be personable all the time is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m depressed and I know it’s because of my current lifestyle. I used to just enjoy my time alone at home on days off but I’ve become such an introvert that I barely want to leave the house/hotel rooms or talk to anyone now at all unless I HAVE to. Im never rude to passengers and have a perfect attendance record, but when I work with so many bubbly personalities and see people who genuinely want to go above and beyond inflight, it just confirms even more that this role isn’t for me anymore. I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and care more about consistency, stability, & work/life balance or just bored with life in general and need to stick with something that will stimulate my mind. I wish I had some sort of passion I could be pursuing in my down time, but I don’t. I thought about teaching and became a substitute for a year but couldn’t see it as a long term career either. I’m afraid I have already become complacent like many of my colleagues who’ve been flying an average of 20-40 years yet have the same complaints I do. With everything being seniority based, they say things get better with time but I’m not convinced. Also I barely use my flight benefits so they aren’t a factor keeping me “stuck” 


I STAY on indeed & the career section of so many companies & apply for jobs constantly but I’m also constantly rejected for positions I’m qualified to do (flight attendant supervisor, recruiter, instructor, anything hotel related etc) and I don’t have the experience or education required for anything outside this field paying a decent salary ($60k +). My degree is pretty much useless other than the fact that it shows I’m “smart” but clearly not smart enough to figure out a better life path. Anyone I’ve ever confided in has said “you’ll figure it out eventually” but like I said, it’s been years and I still haven’t found my calling. I’m grateful for the paycheck/benefits and understand that many ppl do not ENJOY their jobs but my job has become my entire life and I’m no longer enjoying much of it at all.

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever.

My complaint is that the machines I run have anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours to complete one part; usually it's about one hour. I work a 10 hour shift.

Then they CALL me - to tell me I was rejected, as if one rejection wasn’t enough. The HR person said the feedback was really good, but they just went with someone else. And that I’d be considered for other jobs there. So, I said thanks for letting me know and moved on.

Is this normal? Or does it mean nothing? I know normally I just get email rejections, so the standard “your resume will be kept on file” means nothing. But it felt weird for her to tell me that on the phone, if it was just a formality.

Now, there are some problems that surfaced (that I wasn't aware of during my time there). Sometimes I feel like the only reason they're talking to me is just so they can rub my mistakes in my face or something (emphasis on feel, I don't think that they are the kind of people to do something like that intentionally).

I got a new job and I am excited. But talking to this old coworker is making me feel anxious and scared and making me feel all the things I used to feel back then, like hating myself and feeling like I am not able to do anything right.

I just want to know if anyone else felt like that they were a bad employee but became a good one in a new company.

409,cvd7f1,False,,36,I recently quit my job in an attempt to reinvent myself but all job offers are related to the industry I left (logistics) which I honestly grew to despise . How can I finally leave it behind?!,careerguidance,"I recently (last day was 2 weeks ago) quit my very well paying Logistics Coordinator job. I have a couple of months of rent saved up , will be starting school next week (video editing and production) at a local community college (very low cost) and already have a part time job lined up at a local restaurant.

However, as happy as I am to be pursuing something I’ve always wanted to do and chase after my dreams. The “logical” side of my brain which chooses the money is going nuts. Mind you, there is no way I will go back to Logistics, I’ve grown to hate the job and the repetitiveness of it. I worked at one of the best logistics companies in the world with great benefits an awesome team and good pay. None of this was enough as I simply no longer had any interest in it. I was basically dragging myself out of bed every morning and had become anxiety ridden and depressed feeling as if I was just slowly rotting in my cubicle.

I am actually excited for the restaurant job even though it will only pay a fraction of my old job because its something different . But I know I want to make more money than I did before. Not to mention, I will need a steady income to buy equipment and build my media company as I grow my skills.

Again, lots of people have asked why I didnt stay at my old job amd went to school at the same time. With 55+ hours of work a week and my hate towards the job it was just not possible. I wanted out . So going back to that is simply not an option . If rather struggle with part times until I find something else than go back to it.

With that said. I am 31 now and have been working since age 17. Ive been a delivery driver, warehouse supervisor, got a BA in Psychology, have some experience in sales and worked as a logistics coordinator for the last 7 years.

Nonetheless, right now I dont have kids a mortgage or any debt. But my savings aren’t huge either just enough to get by for about 4-5 months plus whatever I make on the part time.

Ive looked into e-commerce and drop-shipping since I have extensive experience with imports from Asia and Europe due to my work in logistics. However, that industry really seems like a gamble and I dont have money to spare/throw away in hopes of getting lucky.

I do speak spanish fluently and have no trouble befriended and talking to people so there’s that as well.

Also if you have a BS i would not say going back to a 4 year or masters is the best thing because masters are pretty expensive.  I went to a committee college for 2 years and that worked out well although it was too easy given my education (if i could have gotten it done in 1 semester I would have).

If it were me though, knowing what I know now, i'd get back into your field with an actual exit plan, instead of just quitting and hoping something strikes you.  You need funds and indicating that you only have 4-5 months of emergency funds, given no kids or mortgage, means you didn't save nearly enough for a career transition.  It took me about 3 years to go back to my old salary, which was only 40k, and it took 5 years to get above that.

474,eq8dfj,False,,54,Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?,careerguidance," 

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be ""the occasional day of 8 hour screen time,"" but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.   


Any advice is appreciated.

So, when people talk about things like “show company loyalty” or “align with your peers” or “trust your boss”, I just can’t take any of it seriously anymore. You can follow “the rules” in the workplace and still get screwed over. You can build rapport and still get sabotaged. You can do everything right on paper, and still get treated as nothing more than replaceable cog.

What the question is trying to ask is, say you have two jobs, A and B. And let's say they both pay the same, let's say $60K just for argument's sake. If you have two offers, you'll take the job that seems to have the best work, obviously.

But let's say B pays $65K. Do you automatically take B? Or do you take A if the work is clearly better? What if it's $70K? $80K? $100K?

The 'correct' answer - and by 'correct' I mean actually correct and not just 'interview correct' - is that you prefer the better job \_unless\_ the pay for that job is clearly not market, i.e., you're being taken advantage of. Now, it's incredibly unlikely that a job will both have good work and be making a substantially below market offer. So it's a pretty artificial question.

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

Anyways, the book is available for free on Amazon Kindle through June 8th, so be sure to get your copy before the price goes up.
