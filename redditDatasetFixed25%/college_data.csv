She always uses the classroom's markers which are pretty shitty, so she ends up throwing at least one out every class. 

Some classes ago I joked with her saying she needed her own markers, she had a good laugh and said she agreed with me. She still didn't get markers. 

My mom is also a Prof and she has a lot of markers still inside their boxes, and I was thinking of offering her one of those.

236,gxp2fs,False,,118,Is there any point for me to try to continue college with a 0.80 GPA? Is there even any possibility?,college,"To put it simply, my college career is completely screwed up. Over the last four years, I’ve taken four semesters of college (2 semesters in physical classes and a 2 semesters of online classes). Somehow, for no good reason other than lack of interest/drive to do the work, I’ve managed to fail nearly every single class I have attempted. At it’s lowest, my gpa was a 0.39. I took 3 classes online last summer in which I managed to achieve 2 Bs and an F. That brought my GPA up to 0.80 and I haven’t given it another run since. 

This is a very different picture than my academic profile in high school: 3.8 GPA, highest SAT score, National Merit Scholar, etc. Needless to say, I lost any and all scholarships I had.

I wish I had a better reason for why I’ve done so horribly in college. My father died shortly after I graduated high school, so I used that as an excuse in the mandatory meetings I had to have with advisors due to being on academic probation. But while that was definitely a very sad experience, I can’t honestly say I felt any depression or sadness that was impacting my desire to do school work.

The only real reason is that I have been spending my time working on other things, but I know this isn’t a solid justification as I know plenty of people who have excelled in college while working on other business and/or creative ventures on the side.

Now, as I watch all the people from my high school class graduating and getting their degrees, I can’t help but wonder if I should give another pass at this or throw in the towel. I haven’t officially thought of myself as a “college dropout” yet, but I also don’t have any concrete plans of returning.

Currently, I’m running a small video production company, learning a few instruments and DAW software in hopes of finding success (and skill lol) as a musician, and studying/practicing screenwriting with aspirations to write for (and one day create/executive produce) television shows. 

While I like to think I’m confident that I can realize my dreams without college, there are times where I can’t help but wonder if I need to give it another shot, just in case. I also feel like I’ve been socially cut off from people in my age group these last few years and worry that it’s negatively impacting my ability to make social connections that could be beneficial in my fields of interest. I’m an introvert so it can be difficult for me to actively place myself in social situations at times. College seems like a bit of an easier way to accomplish this. 

But then I think about how much of a waste of money and potentially time it could be and go back to square one.

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, I guess I just felt like ranting but also would be interested to hear other people’s perspective on if it is even worth trying to go back with my GPA where it is. If you actually read all of this I appreciate you!!

TL;DR: College GPA after 4 semesters is a 0.8. Is it even worth trying anymore?


Edit: WOW, this in-my-feelings rant got way more attention than I expected! I appreciate all of the responses, advice, words of inspiration, and reality checks. 

To everyone who suggested I pick up a trade - luckily I’ve managed to make a decently lucrative gig out of the video production thing so far. Had a full time job as video production specialist (ironically for a school district) for a couple of years that I recently quit in favor of doing my production company full time, so I’ve been fortunate enough to at least have that for the time being as an income source while I work on my other passions. 

If I went back to college now, it would likely be the same story. I will focus these next few years on trying on putting my time, money, and energy into the things I’m truly committed to and reassess college a few years down the line.

471,dengsv,False,,64,Failing my classes and confused about my major/future,college,"I am currently a second year student at a California community college. I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.

So this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don’t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. 

I don’t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that’s my parents’ money. I’m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won’t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don’t think I can do. Any advice will help, I’m extremely stressed right now.

Edit* let me add that i know its a very stressful situation. I was in three semesters that i failed and dropped classes till i dropped out. I kept trying and trying but it didnt work out. I know all about the stress youre going through. Be honest with yourself because you will know whether youre giving 100% effort or not. If youre not giving 100% then its hard to justify it.

587,9nwzjg,False,,35,Professor is accusing me of cheating off another student I've never spoken to. Wtf do I do? Online class.,college,"

EDIT: 
The other student took my discussion board post and used it for their essay. I used my own post for the essay, just added fluff to it. This is why it got flagged as word for word. Hopefully he changes my grade, since I can't control what another student takes from discussion boards that are visible for all. 




----OP-----


I checked my grade on an essay yesterday, it was a 0 and had a comment from the professor ""did you cheat off of x or did x cheat off of you?"" I didn't recognize the name, so I replied asking what they meant, I only used one source for my work and it was the text book given, and I quoted every source. 

Then I looked through the students names and realized x is another student in the online class with me, I've never even replied to one of their comments on a discussion board. 

I emailed the professor again explaining that I don't know the student, and would like to see their work to compare. 

Professor replied with my essay and highlighted a part that was ""almost word for word"" from the other students. And said ""this is not a coincidence""

This guy obviously is not going to believe me, but I know the truth. The other student knows the truth. What can I do to get this figured out? I can't fail this class. I don't want to be accused of something I did not do, especially when it's plagiarism. 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9nwzjg/professor_is_accusing_me_of_cheating_off_another/,440,"Your best bet is to try to prove that it's your work, not the other students. Helping him to see that you posted this onto what I assume is a class discussion board before any of these essays were turned in will likely help your case.

In either case, the professor *should* have given you both zeroes if he/she was unable to determine who plagiarized. That's the fairest approach to this if they can't pin down who copied the other's work. It's basically in the school of ""either you copied person X or you helped person X cheat"", both of which could be considered violations of academic integrity.

Hope the prof. hears your argument and is willing to give you your points.  ",2018-10-13 20:29:51

The email only gave me their first name and their phone number, so I can't look them up on Facebook. When I was living in a dorm I lived with a good female friend of mine, so having 3 complete strangers be my roommate is a little scary. Luckily I got my top choice of room and floor preference, and I have my own bathroom. We also each have deadbolts on our bedrooms doors in addition to the front door of the apartment.

If I call and ask to be switched to a new apartment with different roommates, it's likely I won't get the room or floor I want, which is really important to me. Because of this I think I want to stick it out and stay with these roommates, because at least I'll have a nice room to myself.

Absolutely not a scam, and a legitament business. The major difference between Vector and something like Vemma is that with Vector you sell the product and get commission. Vemma you get paid for advertising and recruitment. With vector, you directly sell Cutco Cutlery to the customer instead of having them in the store. 

Let's clear up some misconceptions:

1. You do not pay for your set anymore.  That practice stopped about 6ish years ago. When you paid for your set it was yours. Now the knives are yours and you can buy them from your manager if you'd like, return the set when you're done, or have your manager get charged for them

2. You make money via sales OR per demo. You make 15-18 per demo or commission,  whichever is more at the end of the week.

3. It's a great product with a great warrenty. That being said it is difficult to sell them, mainly because of sticker shock. Shits expensive, yo.

4. You don't get paid for training, but since you're an independent contractor so they don't have to. It's shitty but it's only a day or two but can be done online in a few hours (dont recomend). They do feed you during training which was cool

5. When you get through tier 1 and 2 of your recs, thats when it gets really hard. Tier 1 is friends/family. Tier 2 are their friends/family

I learned a lot about sales at Vector, but it's definetly not for everyone. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them. I worked there from March 13-July 13. I stopped because i wasn't making enough money. But because I didn't make money doesn't mean it's a scam. It's sales, sometimes you make money, sometimes you dont.

Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn’t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I’m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it’s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren’t my cup of tea and I’m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. 

I was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I’m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I’m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it’s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I’m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. 
	
I guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?

Edit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo

So I have done research, I’m okay with the average annual income and I know that it’ll be tough to start out with but it’s that way for almost everyone so I’m expecting it. I’ve been looking into internships, however as far as I’ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I’m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. 

I’m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they’d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that’s a sort of double hit. 

Overall, I’m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.

Edit2: I don’t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. 

As someone mentioned, a degree isn’t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like “you’d actually make money in stem” is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won’t be easy either way, and I’m not in school to have fun, I’m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I’m already feeling burn out and miserable I don’t want to waste all that time and money.

I’m a pre med student and I very unexpectedly got pregnant. i use protection with my boyfriend but i guess the condom must’ve ripped. i grew up in a very pro life household and it’s stuck in my head that it’s morally wrong to get an abortion. i’m fine with other people taking that route and i was going to do it myself but i just can not do it. it hurts me so much. 
i’m about a month along and i’ve decided to let nature take its course and if it’ll be a miscarriage then that’s the way it’s supposed to be. 

i will be a sophomore when the baby is due. my family and my boyfriend’s family is very supportive and will help out. my grandma wants to move close to us just to be able to help us out so we can still continue with school. i’m planning to take a semester off or do online classes when the baby is due. do you guys think that having a kid will affect my chances of getting into medical school? will they see me any differently? thank you so much for the help. this has been a very rough couple of days for me.

EDIT: i appreciate all the support! it definitely has made more comfortable. i luckily went through a rough childhood to build up my maturity. my mom had cancer and i was the only one able to take care of her, had to skip a lot of high school and i still graduated with a 3.5 GPA all honors and AP classes. overall i missed 70 days sophomore year, almost 50 days junior year and  about 40 senior year. i genuinely believe i have the work ethic but i’m still nervous because i completely understand the responsibility. i’m very lucky to have two families and boyfriend that are willing to help with anything i need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f5u8b0/im_pregnant/,1289,Pog ,2020-02-18 16:21:20
759,c99ogt,False,,116,my parents don’t support my major,college,"it’s not official yet but i want to change my major to psychology. as of right now i’m a biology major and i hate it- it’s nothing but science courses and biological electives. it’s also more geared for pre-med students, which isn’t me. 

i’m passionate about psychology, i’m better at it, i enjoy the writing as i read a lot and pride myself in having good writing skills. im pre-physicians assistant regardless of what my major is, so isn’t that all the more reason to major in something i actually enjoy? also, if for some reason i change my mind about the PA track (which i’m considering), i would be interested in getting my masters in something psych related. my parents hate this idea because it means more schooling and more money to spend but i’m going to be stuck with student loan debt regardless, so why not go ahead and get my masters? 

also, my parents don’t understand no matter how many times i tell them that i can major in anything i want and still be pre-PA. i’ve had to explain this so many times to them and it’s like they get amnesia or something, and i have to tell them again. a few months ago when i decided i wanted to change my major and explained to them that i would still aim for PA school, they were supportive. 

and finally, i think my parents want me to major in something like biology because they care about how i look to other people. this is actually the reason i’m writing this post- we were talking to a neighbor and i told them my situation, and once i went back inside my mom blew up in my face telling me i’m wasting my time majoring in psych and that i’ll be working a dead-end job i don’t like. i had to explain to her that i’m still PA and like i said before, she doesn’t understand what the fuck i mean when i tell her i can major in just about anything and still go to PA school. also my neighbor was asking me questions about school and my dad started answering questions for me. it makes me so mad because i can tell they have some plan for me that they don’t want. i’ve ranted to my advisor about this more than once and she tells me every time to do what i want. what do i do in this situation? also how do i deal with my parents?

edit: 1) i am aware that what i said about debt is stupid and that i do not want more debt than less debt. 2) i am aware that a psychology BA is one of the most useless degrees i can get, which is why if i go through with psych i would go to grad school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c99ogt/my_parents_dont_support_my_major/,322,"Disclaimer.

Last semester I spoke to him 3 times about his hygiene and how he smells. The first and second time I made sure to be very polite and not to hurt his feelings. He said he’d “take care of it” and just bought candles and febreez. The problem is his shower and laundry habits, which are essentially nonexistent. 

The third time I spoke to him I was really pissed off with him. I told him it was atrocious and I made him do his laundry, change his sheets, and shower. It was better for a week or two. 

Everyday I wake up and leave to brush my teeth. When I get back, there’s this overwhelming smell of a mix between feet, Asshole, and BO. I am sick of it. He’s lucky I don’t have a girlfriend anymore or else I would be a lot less patient.

I bummed around for a while, struggling to find jobs during the recession, and then I decided to enlist. No regrets! Now I'm set up with the post-9/11 GI bill, and ready to pursue a Bachelor's in education. I'm registered for the fall semester and classes are only a few weeks away from starting. I'm first generation for my family, and ridiculously exited. But anxious. 

I honestly just don't really know what to expect. I graduated high school 11 years ago, but got crap grades because I often neglected homework. I never had to study for tests as a teen, I'd always been a good tester and cruised right through. My military job was very technical, and I had to learn to actually study in order to perform well. I've heard that college is more study-heavy than homework-heavy, I've heard from some that's it's harder than HS and from others that it's easier. I've been told that you're sort of teaching yourself. 

Can anyone maybe describe how an average lecture goes? Amounts of homework? What the heck is assigned reading about? I know they won't hold my hand, but can I approach a professor if I'm having trouble understanding something? Should I bring my laptop, or a tablet, and why? WHY ARE BOOKS SO EXPENSIVE?!

598,cf8s7p,False,,148,I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,college,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,435,[deleted] ,2019-07-19 15:16:06

You're probably a couple weeks into the semester and you may be falling into the early semester trap. You find yourself in a period of time thinking ""Wow, I have no homework this weekend"" or ""Once I turn this in on Wednesday I'm free."" 

It's an illusion. In reality, you have more work to do; it's just not due until later.

Spend your free days getting started on that work. Even if just for a few hours. Don't have any more days of non-productivity. And by working, I mean really working. Not just staring at a textbook to kill an hour or going to class like you should already be doing, but actually spending Friday making headway on an assignment that's not due until next Wednesday, or getting caught up in a class where you know you're behind.

I give this advice for 3 reasons. 

\#1, A lot of college students (including myself for many years) miss points on assignments because they underestimate how much time it will take to complete. That's the dumbest reason ever to lose points. You're just hurting yourself for no reason.

\#2, Most students' schedules have a natural ebb and flow: crazy amounts of stress before deadlines, and free time elsewhere. It's not balanced nor healthy. It's the reason some students can't take the pressure when it really builds up. Delegate your work more evenly and you'll still have the ability to take time off and relax, just with less stress hanging over your head.

\#3, It builds discipline. You have to teach yourself to work even when you don't want to. That's the difference between discipline and motivation. Motivation is nice, but it won't last you all year long. Discipline will.

My Study Tips as a 4.0 Senior in College

Hey guys so I wanted to make a post that I hope will help some of you with how to maximize studying efficiency and increase your chance at getting straight A’s in med school pre reqs and college in general.

Study tip 1: Prioritize Classes, each class and individual professor has a level of difficulty and importance to your overall college career. Prioritize classes with high importance (pre reqs and major requirements) over other less important classes. Additionally, prioritize classes that appear more difficult over those that are less difficult.

Study tip 2: Balance your schedule with 1-3 difficult classes and 1-2 moderate to easy classes. This will help you not get too overwhelmed.

Study tip 3: For clases which are heavy on memorization, space out studying the two weeks before a test one hour each day. As the exam approaches, study for longer stretches of time the week before, reviewing sections of material. The three days before an exam do a Meta Review of all material, three consecutive days. This will maximize information retention and give you both the nitty gritty details and the overall picture. As you do the meta review try and explain concepts to yourself in your head. 
Note: I only use this study technique for very difficult or important classes as it is somewhat labor intensive and takes up a bit of time. 

Study tip 4: Go to class, oftentimes a profesor will point out things they want you to pay close attention to or that they think is important, remember you are not only taking X course, you are taking X course with your specific professor.... simply knowing the material is not enough, you must also know what your professor wants of you.

Study tip 5: Use rate my professor.
When possible use rate my profesor to find professors that have positive reviews. Sometimes bad professors are unavoidable, but don’t make your life any harder than it is by getting someone who doesn’t know how to teach to their strengths.

Study tip 6: Form a study group and take turns attempting to teach each other sections of the material. Teaching a subject is the best way to learn it, I have used this technique to great effect with my fellow study partners. I also found this very helpful for concept heavy classes such as organic chemistry and parts of Biochemistry.

Study tip 7: Be proactive, do not wait until the last minute to turn in an assignment, turn it in days or weeks before if possible. Last minute deadlines can cause unnecessary stress and can be annoying if something else comes up. Do yourself a favor and don’t procrastinate.

Study tip 8: Utilize your time efficiently. If you find that you spend a lot of time on your phone or watching TV at a certain time of the day, utilize this time to instead go over some material or get some EC’s, Research, etc. done. This will give you more time to be productive during the day. Additionally, try and give the appropriate amount of time during the week to classes you find difficult and less time to those you find easy or do well in. Do not spend too much time on classes that you don’t need to.

Study tip 9: OVER-PREPARE for the first test. You don’t know how hard a class really is until you are tested on the material. Over study for the first test so that you do well in it. After this point you should have a slight grasp on your abilities and can make a judgement as to how much time is appropriate to get the grade you want on the next test. 

Study tip 10: Go to office hours, these times are invaluable as you can get one on one instruction with either your TAs or Professors. Not only is this good for getting them to know you and perhaps writing good recommendation letters, but it can also give you a leg up in knowing what material they’ll likely test you on or what they want you to focus on. Remember, like I said, you are not only taking X class you are taking X class with a specific professor. The professor is a huge component in the success you may have in a class. Knowing your professor and what they expect from you is an invaluable piece of information.

Study tip 11: For math and physics classes do NOT simply read slides. This will not help. You MUST do practice problems in order to get familiar with the material. There is no other way to learn math other than practice.

Study tip 12: If you do not understand a concept ask for help from your professor or try and find the answer utilizing resources such as your textbook, online databases, or YouTube/Reddit.

Study tip 13: The night before a big exam, go over the information in your head. I don’t know how this works for me but it just does, somehow I manage to capture very specific information while doing this. It might not work for everyone but go ahead and give it a shot and see if it works.

Study tip 14: Study in the library, there will be less distractions and you will feel more productive.

Study tip 15: DO NOT do all nighters, they are the byproduct of under preparation . There is never a reason to do one.

Study tip 16: Look at homework as a learning opportunity not simply an assignment. I can’t even count the times that homework questions have appeared in an altered form within my exams. 

Study tip 17: don’t be afraid of utilizing free tutoring services from your institution.

Study tip 18: Finally, as a last piece of advice, don’t place so much validation or importance on a three digit number. Yes it is important, but ones mental and physical health comes first. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, give your head a break. You are not defined by a three digit number. Do the best you can and you’ll go far.

Why are you here? Why didn’t you write any papers? What would better motivate you?


Edit: was not expecting this large of a response!

All I want to say is, thanks. I understand college is hard. It was for me at times. Very much so. I’ve been through the mental health ringer, health events, family crises, and had it derail school. I failed classes, hit academic probation, but eventually bounced back and am now a professor. 

It’s not perfect, but I do encourage you to reach out to your profs when things go south. Some are more receptive than others. I generally accommodate these things. The counseling/mental health centers and academic advisers can sometimes be helpful advocates too. The earlier you reach out the better. 

Also, if you have ideas, let me know what we can do better. I hate knowing students are flying under the radar with this, when I’m more than willing to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eal8ly/not_judging_i_just_need_to_know_why_would_someone/,1423,. ,2019-12-14 15:47:54

College just doesn't feel like ""school"" anymore, but more a means to get a degree and then get a job from it. Yes, I love my major and I am very excited to get a career in it, but I also feel like most of what I am learning will end up being useless for whatever job I end up in. My internship this summer has shown me that's the case as of right now.

I don't go to college anymore to learn and understand things, because so much more emphasis is put on short-term understanding for a grade rather than long-term understanding and application for a career. Its just frustrating and disheartening in a way. There are definitely parts of attending university that I find really rewarding and great like social circles and the ability to pursue whatever you want in life, but at its core it should be about education, and it doesn't feel like it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cerv84/does_anyone_else_feel_like_college_is_a_means_to/,1399,"No, although I feel like this perspective is becoming more common and I believe its partway responsible for an increase in anxiety and depression amongst college students. 

>long-term understanding and application for a career.

This is what I'm talking about. College, specifically non-technical/professional/vocational college, have NEVER been abut long-term understanding and career application. Because there is no such thing as long-term understanding in careers unless you are in research! Business and the nature of jobs change to rapidly and randomly that you can't learn long term stuff in a single class. Long term learnings come from your ability to look between all the different classes you take and draw connections between them to create a system of relationships and learning that you can successfully navigate in the future to solve new unique problems.

All y'all need to do with orientation is:

1. Grin and bear it. I know it's stupid. There are a bunch of people in charge who have no idea what a good time looks like. Many of them are parents with kids 7 years younger than you, and they seem to think what their 11 year old finds fun is a good idea for you. Sound like what you experienced today? They do all this to make the main purpose (unsuccessfully) more palatable:

2. Get what you need out of it. Walk around with your group and get acquainted with where you will be spending the next few years of your life. Ask questions when you can if you have them (and you should). Ask how long it takes to get from your first class to your second class on the other side of campus. Ask about what you need to know about parking your first few weeks (it will be terrible). Get familiar with how the rooms feel. Are they cold? Bring a hoodie your first day. Are they burning up? Still bring a hoodie, they may crank the AC. Ask the hours at the gym. If they don't mention a campus app, ask about it. 

3. Everyone was there today for #2. You are as likely to make awesome friends during orientation as you are in the line at a  Starbucks you visited once. It's possible, but unlikely. People are too focused on #2 and being forced to do #1. Time for interactions will come soon. ",2019-07-26 01:30:51

 I'm 22 and about start uni (again). I've been struggling lately with feeling as though I'm ""a step behind."" I'll graduate by the time I'm 24-25. Given the time of year it is, I've been seeing so many pictures of people graduating who are my age or just slightly older and it's been getting to me. I've had some very cool life experiences during the past few years so I don't regret not taking the more traditional path but it makes me self-conscious sometimes to see all my friends graduating while I'm just starting school back up. So, what age did you guys graduate at (undergrad)? Anybody in a similar situation? 

Also, how many people who either are around my age (or when you were in your early 20s) know/knew what it is you wanted to do with your life? Some people seem to know exactly what it is they want to do, and sometimes talking with those kinds of people makes me feel like I have should have already figured that out by now.

\*extra time on exams

\*a note-taker

\*recordings of lectures

\*reduced weight on public speaking assignments (because of the stutter)

&#x200B;

I have a professor who has completely refused to accommodate this. No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because ""your notes should be your own"". No recordings of lectures because ""I don't want to be put on Youtube"". No reduced weight on public speaking because ""your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack"". 

&#x200B;

So, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter.

* Can you drop the class? - No it's too late
* Will the grade be curved? - Not according to the syllabus
* Its just a C! get over it - I can't accept anything lower than a B or it will tank my gpa
* How would getting a D help? - If I get a D I will be allowed to retake the class for a better grade
* Just accept the C. - I need a specific gpa for my graduate program which I can achieve if I retake this class and get a B

Upon viewing the apartment, they informed me about it and made a whole fuss about downplaying it, telling me ""ooh its only a little bit and at night, to sleep better"". I don't smoke weed, tobacco or anything else, don't drink or do drugs, but I agreed to this because they generally seemed nice and, as a foreign student, I didn't have many other options. I also get my own room so I figured I'd always have some smoke-free space behind the door if I needed.

One and a half months after moving in, I can say that, even if I don't really know what is considered ""a little bit"" among smokers, it's pretty much frustrating to me; they don't mind doing it in the shared space, during any part of the day if they feel like it, or if they have some friends over (of which I am almost never informed in advance). They also light up these aromatic sticks and do not seem to think that these strong smells could be a bad thing for anyone in the vicinity. They almost never smoke in their room, and if they did, it wouldn't make much difference since it's not technically separated by a proper wall (it's like a big balcony over common area). Usually I think of myself as having a weak sense of smell, but this shit is messing with my work badly.

735,c9lyml,False,,21,The school I was set to transfer to this fall canceled my offer of admission,college,"As mentioned in the title, I was finally going to transfer to a four year this fall after spending 3 years at a CC in California. If you guys aren't familiar with how CC to four year transfer works, you need to have completed a minimum of 60 IGETC units to be able to transfer.

Spring 2019 was supposed to be my last semester, however something really bad happened to me during the last two weeks of classes. I was sent to the ER with really bad pains in my feet and hands, turns out I was diagnosed with a highly contagious disease and prevented me from going anywhere. Because of this I reached out to all my professors right away to make arrangements on what I could do in regards to me being unable to set foot on campus to take my finals. Luckily I was was able to work something out with 2 out of 3 of my professors and passed both of those. However, my bio professor never got back to me, even after countless emails and phone calls to his office. Long story short: he gave me an F and I was scared shitless so I reached out to my new college ASAP.

&#x200B;

I informed them about the whole situation and asked what I needed to do so that my admission offer would stay in tact. The told me to contact them right away with unofficial transcripts and a letter of explanation. I explained the whole situation with the medical problem and unresponsive professor. Even after all that they said because of the missing credits from the bio class, they have to cancel my offer of admission. Ever since then I've honestly been really down and can feel my depression coming back despite my efforts of staying positive.

&#x200B;

So I reached out to the dean of natural sciences at my CC and basically snitched on my professor for not responding to students and for giving me an inaccurate grade because of my medical situation. An administrative assistant got back to me and informed me that because of the 4th of July they won't get back to me until Monday but she told me that she informed the dean right away to get a hold of this professor to see if they could change the status of the class to incomplete or get a grade change for me.

&#x200B;

Now my question is, has this happened to anyone before? If so what happened in your situation? If I got a grade change and contacted the university, could they reinstate my offer of admission? Because I honestly don't want to wait another year and reapply to universities all over again. As a first-gen, my family is all really psyched for me to be finally going to a university and so am I. But if I don't end up going to university this fall, I'll have to wait a whole year and I really don't want to waste anymore time. Please offer my any advice, because I'm deadass terrified.

&#x200B;

Edit: Professor never responded, dean & department sided with him. I am now waiting a whole year to be able to transfer, thanks to this stupid professor.

Edit: He didn't respond or seem to care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ekfbwy/should_i_tell_my_professor_im_homeless/,829,"In general, you do not want to tell people you're homeless just to elicit sympathy.

If you have specific needs, then you might want to discuss it with your professor. For example, let's say your professor normally assigns homework Tuesday evening and expects it done Wednesday morning. You could go to them and explain that your only access to computers is during daylight hours at the library, so the schedule doesn't work for you - for example, if you could get the homework early, you'd be willing to turn it early.

However, 'homelessness' isn't really a disability he can accommodate. While homelessness does cause stress, it doesn't inherently interfere with your studies. Indeed, a fair number of homeless people specifically go back to school because it's something useful they can do to reconnect into society while still being homeless.

Also, you mentioned using your savings. If you're homeless, you should also certainly qualify for Pell Grants and subsidized loans. While this can impose certain requirements on the rate at which you take classes, you should maximize your use of these sources before you raid your other funds. ",2020-01-05 16:41:08

I have classes I like and I feel like I'm doing my work and I'm not stressed academically. I also have a good friend group at school. However, I just feel like I lost a piece of myself since coming to college?

I was very passionate about certain things before college, but my passion has almost completely went away. I don't have a problem motivating myself to do my work and I finish them on time, but when I don't feel passionate? I just do the work to do it and I don't feel like I'm getting at better or anything. I also struggle getting the drive and energy to do hobbies. I either just lie in bed or chill with friends when I'm not doing hw, which isn't bad, but I feel like I should also be taking care of my hobbies since it was something I cared so much about before. Not sure if that makes sense, but its been on my mind a lot.

Edit: I didn't expect this to get this many comments and I appreciate what was said. I think despite my great friend group I feel like I'm not ready to spill these emotions about my lack of sense of self to them. And it would feel weird talking to friends from high school, despite still being very close, because they are so far away and doing such different things. I only have my boyfriend who I went to high school with and a close RA on campus to talk to about these problems I feel. I think being over a 1000 miles away from home magnified this disconnect I feel with my home and life before college. My hobbies are also related to the arts which I feel like are taken less seriously.

76,fh6l6f,False,,92,Some tips for online classes,college,"I saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

504,fo82p4,False,,53,Fake Honor Society Scams PSA and how to get REVENGE,college," Hello everyone, welcome to my Ted Talk. Today I want to educate you on fake scholarship/honor society scams and how we can get back at them for preying on college students. I have been getting letters from honor societies praising me with very generic statements that could apply to nearly every college student. (“This is a rare honor! Only 10% of first and second-year students nationwide have been invited to participate.”) Lies. If they have your information, you will get an invitation. These societies list their “exclusive resources”, like eligibility for more than $1 MILLION in college scholarships, expanding your network, growing leadership skills, making a difference in the world (?) and SO MUCH MORE! All of these “exclusive opportunities” can be found for free by clicking around the internet for a few minutes or accessing free resources from your school or joining student organizations. And of course, they offer the ability to put their society on your resume for future employers or grad school admissions to see. I can’t vouch for them for how these look on a resume, but if I was the one reviewing it, I wouldn’t take it to be a positive thing. 

These scams are meant to manipulate college students into paying their membership fees (usually upwards of $90). If they send out 50 letters to students for $50 and just one of them sends the membership fee back in the enclosed envelope, they are making an easy $40 profit off of an already struggling college student. It’s so morally corrupt, and I hope you agree with me when I say that we should fight back.

If you feel confident enough, pack whatever papers you can fit back inside the envelope and leave it out for your mail carrier to take. This will force them to pay the extra fee for the extra weight you added. Remove any evidence of your identity from the envelope or the papers you stick back into it. Some letters have “personalized codes” for their websites to log into, make sure you don’t send those back. There isn’t much they could do to get back at you, but don’t let them know who you are anyway. Do not tape the business reply card onto a bigger package, brick, etc. or they will be treated as nonmailable and will not be sent. Make sure everything you add can fit into the provided reply mail envelope to ensure they will pay the cost of the extra weight. I typically can fit up to 5 ounces in a small reply envelope and up to 9 ounces in a long envelope. Even if you don’t stick 5 ounces in there, if you simply send them back the materials they sent you, they will be paying twice as much for your denial of their invitation. If 10 out of the 50 people they send a letter to do this, they will be making much less profit and will find it less worthwhile to scam college students out of their money. 

More information on that:

I hope this helped you, and if it did, consider sending a fat envelope back to the next fake scammer honor society that sends a letter to you. If you have anything to add to this or experiences you can share, feel free to contribute in the comments. 

TLDR; If you get a letter in the mail from an honor society, look up their name to see if they are a scam before sending back any registration fee.

Unless if you are working, try not to schedule your classes all on the same days, especially your first year. The reason being is you're gonna wanna skip, and when you do skip you'll find yourself skipping ALL the courses. Scheduling two courses a day gives you an even flow for college with breaks in between. 
2. Understand how your classes work and how YOU work. Some classes mark participation points and can take a heavy toll on your grade. Other classes don't count participation but offer a lot of material. Use these to your advantage and make sure when you skip classes you know the repercussions. 
3. You're gonna be tempted to eat at the dining hall everyday and drink all the soda from the soda fountain, but pace yourself. Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza. GET A MINI FRIDGE. PUT SOME SALADS IN IT. BUY FUCKING WATER. 
4. Toilet paper is a necessity you won't think about until you run out of it. In the even that you do run out and don't have cash to spare most dorms have a public bathroom in their lobby and usually are accessible at all times. It's a pain in the ass but a good contingency plan 
5. If you're doing horrible in your classes: communicate with your professors early on. Don't just drop the class or continue to flunk. Usually professors understand that some students are going to have a hard time pacing themselves and are willing to work with you if you reach out to them early on. 
6. If you are in the middle of the semester and you feel like you're going to fail a class, speak with you academic adviser and see if you can take it pass/fail. Usually you need a legitimate reason for this (disability, sickness, financial troubles), but showing your academic adviser that you're serious about your goals will make them more willing to help you
7. Remember not everyone has the stereotypical college experience as you see in movies and TV, and that not every college experience is the same. Personally I had to take breaks in between semesters, transfer my courses to a different university, change majors a few times, take part time courses, take summer courses, work part time and go to school full time, and work full time and go to school full time. College should be taken at your own pace based on YOUR needs. If you can't afford it, its okay to take a break and work to save up the money. If you realize you aren't in the right path, its OK to change majors.

I’m going to a private school in the south that’s largely composed of rich white people, so the culture here is obviously a certain way. I’m not blaming anyone for there being a lack of diversity on campus but I grew up in a decent sized city close to the small town where my college is located and was raised in public school around people from many different backgrounds. I went to an elementary school next door to an apartment complex for first-generation immigrants, so all my life I’ve been around people of different colors, religions, and financial backgrounds. Here it feels like everyone’s a clone of each other. And I can’t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus. I do volunteer work for an organization that largely serves underprivileged kids and families who tend to live in ethnic or largely African-American neighborhoods so I’ll have a chance to be in that atmosphere at times, but I just feel uncomfortable and swarmed by people who are exactly alike here.

402,bd128e,False,,136,Does anyone else feel like some students make college a lot harder than it really is?,college,"*So before I go further into this post, college can be super challenging and different schools/majors require a different workload.  I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*

In high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.

Edit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.

If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

I immediately emailed my professor asking why I received this grade, a week later he responded that I never handed in the final!

It was a written take home final, I drove all the way to school and turned it in personally to him in his office on the due date, per his instructions. I bet if they checked the cameras they’d see me walking to his office, as I remember the day and time I was there. 

I emailed him back saying I was there and handed it to him personally. And followed up with an attachment of my exam. Honestly this is why all professors should utilize online submission 🙄

226,gft0ne,False,,261,13 minute finals,college,"Hey all. I seriously need feedback on this. For 2 of my classes with the same professor, our finals worth 40% of our grade will be online. 13 minutes, that's it. You don't get to see every single problem in one go - you can only see them as you take the exam (so you do question 1, then question 2, etc). So if you trip up on #1, you can't spend more time thinking. IDK how anyone can even \*think\* per question. There's 10 questions. They're multiple choice, true/false but half the questions are paragraphs long based on the midterm of the same format. (Not exaggerating, I saved the exam when I got my instant grade, and the ""10 questions"" were more than 3 pages single-spaced.) Prof. said finals is same thing so I'm going to be presumptuous and say we'll have paragraphs long questions on the 13-minute finals as well.

Is this even rational? When I took the midterm, I was 2 minutes in when my internet was \*\*\*\*\*\*\* up and then I lost 4 minutes to the exam. BAM, I failed the exam because I couldn't even get to question 5. How was I supposed to think through any of the questions when I have 4 minutes to do a bunch of other questions? The midterm average among 80 students was a 30/100. The professor \*graciously\* said our midterm can be worth nothing and our finals worth 40%, depending on how well we do. (Originally each was worth 20%.) Well, the finals is the same format, and I'm annoyed. I am more scared about my internet disconnecting than me not knowing the answer. I literally don't even want to start the exam because my internet hasn't been stable for the past 60 days, just like every other American. I can't even sit through a 50-minute Zoom without disconnecting every minute. What's up with this professor? I've raised this issue with her before, she either misinterpreted me or was a d\*\*\* and said, ""I can't just accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else."" I'm baffled because I'm positive out of her 160 students total (in both classes), there's at least 50 of us going through hell.

Please let me know what you think - I'm seconds away from raising this to higher ups but I want some rationalization of why a final worth 40% with 10 questions only allows 13 minutes. If we could see all the questions at once, I would say it's a little bit ""better"" b/c we can do what we know and think about the hard ones last. But that's not the case. I don't even know how any of this is feasible when this reddit post absolutely undermines other factors of my life tht are f\*\*\*\*\* up such as having to be home 24/7 with an abusive family. This is ridiculous. Someone enlighten me. Let me know if you're confused on why I am complaining b/c I am thoroughly annoyed with my school and don't know how to write, talk, w/e. This is the 1,000,001th time I've complained in the last 60 days.

edit 5/19: thank you for everyone's comments! Wanted to say that I scored above the curve for both finals, so I should still be getting my A's at the end of all this. No - the 13 minutes never got changed. The finals did become 20% rather than 40% though. President, 2 deans, 4 chairs - nothing was done.

602,f3txef,False,Global,95,Academic Dishonesty - Somewhat a cultural thing?,college,"This is inspired by a post from like 9 hours ago, in which some people voiced the opinion, that studying with the same test bank (which includes the answers) that the professor gets all their quiz and exam questions from, would be considered cheating/academic dishonesty.

I am very careful when it comes to plagiarism, checking everything a thousand times to make sure I cited everything correctly and didn't for some dumb reason forget a footnote somewhere. So, I would generally consider myself (academically) an honest person.


However, I've used exams from a prior year to help me study for upcoming exams (they're available through student unions), some of those were almost identical to those I had to take - which in two cases I had actually been given a heads up for by older students.

I had an oral exam and right after leaving the examination I jotted down all the questions I could remember having been asked and forwarded those to my friends who have to take the same exam (and to another girl who asked me to).

I had to take a test later than everyone else in class because of a stay abroad and a friend of mine send me an approximate overview of the questions in the test. Those were the same questions I got, two months later. I had, before going abroad, even offered my professor to take the test before I would leave and he responded that he'd rather have one person in class knowing all the questions beforehand than having everyone else know.

So, apparently in my country or at least at my university it seems pretty standard to profit off of other students sharing their knowledge and professors being too lazy to change up the questions. Even professors obviously know about it. It's not considered academically dishonest here.

Is it different for you in whatever country you're going to university? Would any/all of my examples be considered academically dishonest?

She never goes to class and doesn’t have a car or job so she is in the room 24/7 almost. She is not paying the school any money because FAFSA denied her since she failed last semester and is failing this one. It makes me so upset she is here. I am a nursing student and I work up to 35 hours a week as a nurse’s assistant. I have lots of late nights and early mornings and sometimes I do not sleep for over 24 hours because I work two part time jobs. My sleep is so important to me. She is constantly going in and out of the room from 10pm - 4 am. She has had multiple boys over in the room without warning me and I feel very uncomfortable because they come in at 2 am when I’m asleep and I get woken up by them. I often sleep in a nightshirt and I can’t even get up to go to the bathroom because I don’t want the guy to see my in my nightshirt, maybe I am just bashful I don’t know. She sleeps with the TV very loud on after I asked her to turn it down and I physically went over and turned it down because she’s not even watching it I thought she was asleep. She often leaves the door unlocked and does not take her keys and asks me to leave it unlocked.

Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how “gracious” he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general.

If not shut down, they will do it to another prof and the whole atmosphere at the college becomes negative and students think complaining and pressuring get results they want. It can cross over into outright bullying and harassment of profs very quickly. The prof should not need to put up with such pressure from students. It’s fair and wise for the prof to expose the baselessness of the whining. You are not coddled in college.

277,dmke0r,False,,69,Am I crazy for thinking my roommate's behavior is unacceptable?,college,"*Please read the whole story if you can, but if not there is a TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you*


I go to a small Liberal Arts College in the US, and I was born and raised in the US. My roommate is an international student from literally the opposite side of the globe, and this is his first time in the US. We've been in school for just over 2 months now, and some things he does has started to get on my nerves. I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. 

For example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. 

That entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. 

However, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. 

Storytime (Whoever comments ""Storytime"" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly ""silent"", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like ""gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!"" or ""That's right you little s***head.""
After asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. 

Yesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said ""Ok"" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him ""Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?"" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said ""Ok"" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to ""turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate"" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. 

I slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom.

I've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight.

**TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a. Am I crazy for thinking his behavior is unacceptable?**

Edit: 2 of you said the magic word at the same time, and since I'm too tired to find out who did first you both get gold. Thank you for reading!

Edit 2: 25 minute nap and rip inbox. Thank you very much for all the comments, it means a lot and I read each of them. I have decided to purchase some triple-flange silicone earplugs and a sleep mask, and will have a talk with roommate when he gets back tonight and tell him that after 11:30p on school-nights or unless agreed upon, lights are out in the room and any games will be played outside. If he doesn't agree, or fails to adhere, I'll go to the RA and post an update asking for more advice. Once again, thank you for all the replies it means the world to me.

Edit 3: About to talk to him as I fell asleep at 7p yesterday when he was out. I’ll make a new post tomorrow I reckon with the results.

My recommendation is sit down and have a proper chat with him about atleast using headphones as it disturbs you at night.

446,agycej,False,,34,Should I go to class an hour+ late,college,"So, as the title said I'm running about an hour and a half late for class. I commute 80 minutes and my alarm clock didn't go off this morning (apparently my new phone being on mute also muted the alarm).

This is my first class of senior year methodology. Should I go in halfway through the 3-hour class? 

So far I'm thinking: 
I already emailed the teacher as soon as I woke up.Hopefully if I get there before/if the class gets a break I'll talk to the teacher then.




Edit: Thank you for the input everyone!! I stood awkwardly around the half-open door (trying to gauge if I there was a seat in the back I could slip into before entering). The teacher saw me and decided to let everyone out on 5-minute break. I went in and talked to her and she was super nice about it. I don't know if I'll get attendance credit but the information from the first day was worth going late.

695,6xhwtg,False,,629,PSA: The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opens October 1! Post all FAFSA questions here!,college,"The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opened on October 1, 2017. If you plan to attend college during the 2018-2019 school year, you should submit a FAFSA if you are [eligible](https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm) to do so.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If mom/dad has already created an FSA ID (for older siblings), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, 2016 tax information, any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.gov/)!
If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Post your questions about the FAFSA only on this thread, so as to avoid clogging the sub with posts. I work in financial aid and I will be happy to help.

**Please reference [last year's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/54mjwp/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20172018_school_year_opens/) before posting-- your question may have been addressed there.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6xhwtg/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20182019_school_year_opens/,360,Wish I could get it again but now I make too much so I have to pay for half of my things out of pocket. 😒 ,2017-09-01 22:17:45
