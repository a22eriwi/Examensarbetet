I accepted a job with the city on May 13th over the phone, and then was told that HR would be contacting me shortly afterwards.

Person told me that I should receive correspondence from HR by the end of next week.

End of next week rolls around today, and still no e-mail from HR. I left the manager a voicemail, but I'm not expecting to hear back until next week because of the Memorial day weekend.

I am kind of a paranoid person, and am already thinking that the offer was probably withdrawn, however I understand that public service jobs probably go through an extensive process.

297,bl1o99,False,Discipline,7,Toxic work environment situation. Is it my fault?,jobs,"I started my current job 2 years ago. From the beginning I noticed some cattiness amongst a few of my coworkers  and so had decided to take a stance of keeping a professional distance between myself and my coworkers so as to not get involved. I leave everything that is personal at the door in the morning. I do my job the best I can, collect my paycheck and go home. I make sure to smile and greet people and be cordial but otherwise keep to myself. 

In the early stages, I was able to be an unproblematic fly-on-the-wall, minding my own business, while those around me did their catty rants about each other. One coworker, let's call her ""Coworker A"", seemed particularly hostile to another coworker behind her back, referring to her as ""that bitch"" in a rant for going to management about an issue she had with Coworker A. I ignored it and got on with being respectful to both coworkers without picking sides.

One day, I had to go to Coworker A for some work materials that she dispenses to myself and my immediate team. Coworker A, asked about materials she had previously dispensed to me, and I said that was for [""that bitch""]. She became hostile and said ""it's not my fault you stupidly gave [materials to ""that bitch""], I don't have any more!""

I asked ""why is that stupid?"" 

She quickly backtracked, and said ""I never called you stupid!"" and went on a mini-rant about her suspicion that I will to go to management about her now (like [""that bitch""]) and "" you wear glasses and can't see"" (presumably the discord between coworker A and ""that bitch"".  I saw it, I just ignored it.)

After this incident I went to the manager after work for advice on how to deal with an unnamed coworker who seemed particularly hostile. Without naming Coworker A, they seemed to know exactly who I was talking about. They seemed sympathetic. They said they had several complaints about her but every time they confronted her about it, Coworker A denied it. They suggested I use my cell phone to record her next time, and call a meeting with management armed with that evidence. 

Over time coworker A's hostility toward me grew into mild bullying. She would tell me to perform my job differently from how I am used to performing it. I would politely decline and give reasons,  she would get upset and say ""everybody else does it [the way she told me to], you always have to be different"" etc. 

It escalated until one day she was ranting about me being ""stupid"" for not following her instructions on how to do my job. Mind you, she is not my superior, I don't report to her. The managers have no issue with how I do my job, and had Coworker A gone through the appropriate channels to express displeasure about the way I did my job, I'm certain the managers would have told her I was doing my job the correct way. But it wasnt about how I did my job, Coworker A  wanted to exert power over me and wanted to punish me for not being submissive enough. On this occasion, I was able to pull out my cell phone as she ranted about me in the other room and record her calling me stupid and making derogatory remarks about the somewhat prestigious high school I attended. She referred to me as ""weird"" etc. 

I did as the managers suggested and called a meeting. They asked me to describe the circumstances around the recording I made, asked me to write a report and I did. The managers agreed that the way I was doing my job was the appropriate way. I played them the recording and they heard clearly the verbal abuse from coworker A. Other coworkers were interviewed and the manager mentioned to me that at least one (not [""that bitch""]) corroborated that Coworker A is difficult to work with.

Shortly afterward, I was told that she was asked to apologise and she refused.

Thereafter. Nothing. Coworker A has since been a lot less overtly hostile toward me but she just ignores me and there is constant tension since I have to go to her for materials etc.  Months later, I asked the manager what was the outcome of my report and I was told that because I stopped short of sending the managers the actual recording, relinquishing control over its propagation, there was no proof they could take to the president and board of management to have disciplinary action taken against coworker A. So it's as if there is no evidence at all and nothing can be done, even though the managers heard it with their own ears. I was also told that the fact that Coworker A has a rapport with the president was also a factor.

I am left confused about what I could've done differently in this situation. Coworker A and [""that bitch""] now have seemingly repaired their work relationship since then and are cordial with each other,  while I am now Coworker A's number 1 enemy. Having an ""enemy"" at work is something I find slightly awkward and I wonder if there was something I should have done differently. I feel as though my biggest mistake was taking management's advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bl1o99/toxic_work_environment_situation_is_it_my_fault/,10,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this.  It appears to me you handled it the best you can for the most part.  What I would do differently is stop going to the manager from here on out.  You've stated your case, you've shown evidence, they've done nothing about it.  

Document everything.  Every word she says and every meeting thus far; every refusal to give you the equipment you need to do your job, etc.  It is very hard and it will feel like you're reliving it but it is so important to do this.  The reason for this is so that if this place decides they want you out and you can't find another job quickly, you have proof of what happened.  You can consider filing for unemployment, or suing if you find out you have legal grounds (unfortunately bullying still isn't illegal but if the harassment gets especially nasty or there is other evidence of legally-protected harassment/hostility such as racism, sexism, etc. you might end up having a case). 

If you end up out of a job or decide to leave, consider hiring a professional reference-checking company to see what they say about you (something I should've done) and have that conversation about what they plan on telling future employers about you so that you can be on the same page when job-hunting if you list the job in your history.  

In the meantime, when she tells you how to do your job, go ahead and tell her politely but firmly that you know how to do it.  Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).  She's not your boss.  Doing this with a toxic person just feeds the fire and oftentimes that's all they're really looking for is attention.  That said, it's a good idea to remember how dangerous people who have been honing their socially predatory skills since grade school can be.  Keep your distance, remain polite, do your job but definitely keep your distance.  I can't stress that enough.  Take the time to separate yourself from this stress outside of work and take care of yourself; sleep well, eat well and get enough exercise.  

Also if you're on Facebook there is a group called Workplace Dignity (they also have a blog) with people dealing with these issues in their lives.  

There are other pages on Facebook and also elsewhere online against workplace bullying such as the Workplace Violence Prevention Institute, Healthy Workplace Bill advocates in many states (I used to follow Massachusetts for example which posted many very informative articles and insight into workplace bullying).

Assuming a recruiting firm, remember how these people get paid.  The hiring company pays them a very large fee if they successfully find a candidate that they hire.  Some recruiters do a lot of fishing for candidates when they don't actually have many roles available, to expand their network and so that they have lots of candidates ready to go when a role does arise, that they can pick and choose from.

That said it's a good idea to maintain relationships with them.  They may or may not have good openings right now.  They are often eager to talk to you if you have some experience in the fields they focus on, so it's a little different than normal interviews, and it doesn't necessarily reflect their likelihood of finding you a job.

1853,eoqysb,False,Recruiters,3,Information needed on recruiting services and how they can help a recent graduate land a job!,jobs,"I just graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Finance in December and I have been applying to Financial Analyst positions posted on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. I have no experience in Finance other than my academic projects.

Sure!  It's a common misconception to think that recruiters and temp roles are restricted to secretarial type work.  You should not pay them any money to work for them or through their service. Typically, the employer pays the temp agency $X per hour of your work and they pay you a smaller $x per hour.  The temp agency makes money on the margin between what the employer pays them and the lesser amount they pay you.  

These are often project and overflow positions where the big name company doesn't want the expense of on and off boarding lots of people quickly and the liability of legal action resulting from early terminations, worker's comp, etc.  If you have no experience, it would definitely be worth your time and, as you say, investment in your future self, to take a financial analyst position through a temp agency.  Maybe there's a company that is has a seasonal business and needs an extra hand for three or six months.

469,ex3vl2,False,Qualifications,3,"Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?",jobs,"Hello Reddit,

I have a question regarding work experience as I’m currently job hunting. 

I’ve been fired from my last job as a assistant fashion designer as of December 2019. I’ve had this job since mid October so roughly 2 months.

I was also also working part time in evenings during this time but only as a seamstress.

As an assistant fashion designer, I did tech packs for the company that included fabric type, trim info, colour way, etc. We then send my tech pack to one of our suppliers in China with a sample. 

The sample and the actual product that I designed in the tech pack comes back and we make revisions. This means I have to update the measurement spec sheet. This goes along with doing a fitting where someone wears the product I’ve made and then we make adjustments and send it back to China where hopefully all the mistakes were corrected. 

So everything I’ve mentioned here is the basis of being an assistant fashion designer or technical designer in the fashion industry.

Since job hunting, a lot of companies are looking for a year experience or more in terms of technical design.

Since I only had a technical job for 2 months, and I’ve been fired, I was wondering where else could I put that experience in my resume?

The only experience that I have that are slightly similarly related to that was my seamstress jobs or my job as a student entrepreneur where I made my own clothing, or my time in college where I learned these things. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what is the best case I can make for myself that I do have some experience as a assistant fashion designer/technical designer without mentioning that my last job that I was fired?

The reality is that Employee Selection is a critical part of organizational development, so it doesn't make sense for a company to not have the wherewithal to handle it, or believe they will always do it badly. It's like avid marathon runners outsourcing their shoe-tying to somebody else, because they don't have the time to do it themselves or believe they wouldn't tie a knot well. If they want to run, this is one of the basic things they need to do.

The problem is that companies didn't equip themselves with an HR that contained knowledgeable professionals who were trained to do hiring. Selection is totally a part of HR's wheelhouse, but most of the field is still comprised of old guards who got the position by being nice and know how to handle a payroll spreadsheet; and they gatekeep professionals from entering through arbitrary networking tactics. Companies could've easily onboarded someone with an HRM or related degrees, maybe certified, but definitely have expertise in organizational development; but they are stymied by the current HR Manager/Generalists who believe they won't be able to do the job effectively because reasons.

At the very least, the company doesn't have executive leadership that are well-versed enough about this. So they have no idea any of this is happening. Then, the only conclusion is to outsource their recruitment and selection efforts to third-party vendors like Staffing Agencies and Recruitment Firms, believing they are getting a 1:1 replacement with a talent acquisition professional. Like many comments have mentioned, these companies are ironically bleeding money because these firms aren't using sound methodologies to hire effectively, and they're sacrificing an already limited budget or competitive compensation because these agencies need to take their cut from somewhere.

174,cwuhyf,False,Rejections,7,Previous manager won't give my girlfriend a reference - advice needed,jobs,"I am writing this on behalf of my partner - she's having the work issues but I am running out of ideas on how to advise her.

This is might be a long one so apologies for length.  Plus, I should add, this is everything I have been told from my girlfriend's perspective, so happy for people to play devil's advocate.

My girlfriend started a new job at the start of the year, as maternity cover, at a university.  Prior to that, she'd been at the same company for 6 years (interrupted by a year maternity leave), during which she was promoted several times.  And prior to that, she has been a longstanding employee at several other jobs.  I would say she is a model employee.

She left at the end of 2018, for a new challenge, and soon started the new job.  She was trained up in the role by the lady for which she was covering.  The role was, in basic terms, preparing for an event happening about 4 months from her start date.But after that lady went on her own maternity leave, my gf soon learned a few things about the role:

* No-one, other than the lady now on maternity leave, seemed to know what was expected of the role, in terms of procedures or outcome.
* The role was unique to that university - very few, if any, other universities have a similar role.  It's incorporated into different departments at other universities, so using another university as a gauge as to what was expected wasn't an option.
* My gf wouldn't have a manager for a couple of months, so she was pretty much left to figure things out, unguided, and instigate programmes and procedures for which she had basic training.  Which naturally led to errors.

So my girlfriend, for the first couple of months, felt undersupported and undertrained.

She then got a new manager after a couple of months.  This manager was promoted from within the university, from another department.  As much as I know about her, I would say she is a yes person.  Tells the bosses what they want to hear to cover her own back.  A jobsworth.

Things got difficult with the manager really quickly.  Errors started popping up in the run up to the event.  the manager would expect my GF just to perform tasks for which my GF had no training.  When my GF asked her new manager for extra support, or if she could come in on weekends or work late, to prepare for this event, every request was met with a 'no' with various different reasons.

3 months passed in the job and my GF had her mandatory probationary period review.  And in that review the manager tore her apart.  Basically said my gf was underperforming drastically and if the manager didnt see any improvement, she'd seek to terminate her employment within 3 weeks.

The list of complaints (which I saw) were insanely detailed and epically long.  Like the manager had been detailing every error as they happened to cover her own back, rather than try and solve the issues as they arose with my gf.

My GF asked for a meeting with HR, in which she gave her own version of events (no support, refusal to requests).  Naturally, as you would expect, the manager disputed this.  Which left my gf felt like she was facing a path of being let go in 3 weeks.  If she was unsupported in the run up to this meeting, why would she be supported in the next 3 weeks, in an effort to save her job?

So she resigned - she had my full backing to do it.  She wasn't happy.  Why stay in a job if you aren't happy?

&#x200B;

That was about 2 months ago.  My GF has since been looking for work.  She has had a couple of promising interviews.  One company was very interested.  Practically offered her the job.

They asked for her references, to which she gave several.  But then the hammer blow - 'we'd also like a reference from your previous manager'

I think you can guess what happened next - my girlfriend, reluctantly, contacted the manager to ask for a reference and the manager refused.

And the job offer was rescinded.

So my question is:  is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?  How can she broach this with future employers?  It's frustrating to think that this one terrible experience might hamper her work opportunities.

Or should she considered short term contracts so she then has more recent managers to call on for references?

Cheers for any advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cwuhyf/previous_manager_wont_give_my_girlfriend_a/,1,">So my question is: is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?

2306,cv9c9a,False,Training,32,"Am I not trained well, or just not fit for the job?",jobs,"I apologize for the blocked text, I'm on mobile 
I recently graduated college and started working my first ""real"" job at a house plant nursery/greenhouse in the western US, been working there a few months now. I have had many internships in such jobs before and love growing plants, but this new job has me more stressed than I have ever been in my life. I come home depressed and paranoid that I did something wrong while at work and will get chewed out for it the next day. Basically my job is to watch about 30-50 greenhouses with new very delicate propagation plants. If any of these houses do not get mist during the day, within 15 minutes they can be damaged or die. Many things can happen, irrigation booms can crash or blow fuses, they could be programmed incorrectly, electricity can surge or drop out for just a little bit which can stop the booms, so we have to constantly be driving around in the farm truck and checking them. I feel like I was undertrained and just thrown into this position but like I said it's my first ""real"" job in the industry so I'm not sure. My boss spent a total of about half a day showing me around and trying to teach me to program booms (there are 3 different software systems to learn) and the rest of what I've learned has been from my coworkers, who were expected to answer all my questions and teach me things while also trying to do their job and watch their own 50 greenhouses. As a result, I felt very much like a nuscance with all my questions especially in the beginning, and made quite a few mistakes because I didn't know any better. On top of that we work in shifts with partners and mine gets very annoyed with me if I make any mistakes at all. As a result I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my coworkers and am constantly afraid of messing up. The other day we had an electrical problem and some of our plants were damaged, and later I heard him talking badly about me to our other coworkers. Also, whenever my boss sees I have made a mistake he automatically assumes it is because I'm being lazy or not checking my plants and irrigation enough. Now that the growing year is winding down and daylength is shortening our schedule has changed and I am scheduled to watch the entire farm by myself every other day, 10 hour shifts. I was in no way trained to take care of the other parts of the farm, it is completely foreign to me and I feel like I have been just thrown in to sink or swim. I was given a check list and talked to for 10 minutes about what I should do to care for the other part of the farm, but only because I asked. If I hadn't asked I would have gotten nothing. I would have felt much more comfortable shadowing someone else do it for a bit.... What should I do? This job has me so burnt out with worry it's not funny.

2071,avj53g,False,Layoffs,8,Used dealership fired me over an accident that they want me to pay for.,jobs,"Okay, I am sorry in advance but this is going to be a long story. I figured if anywhere, this would be the best place to post this story. I have been thinking of posting this story since December but never got around to it. And with this story, I am not even including the following situations:

\-Straight up sexual harassment

\-sexism

\-drugs on premises 

\-finding a LOADED GUN in a car while photographing the inside 

So I took this job at a used car dealership as their photography assistant or “Webmaster” as they called it. At first, it sounded like an easy gig, having cars pulled into the booth for me and take some shots and on to the next one right? Wrong. So once I got hired, my boss has informed me that I needed to find, drive and park each of the cars into the booth myself and the only job the main photographer had was to find the cars for me and park them in front of my booth. Which this guy never did. He just goofed off while I did all the work and he got praised for it instead of me. They had never mentioned in the interview or anywhere that they needed me to know how to drive manual/stick shift cars. So when I told him that I didn't know how to drive stick, he told me not to worry and that he would get my co-worker to teach me. Well, that never happened. He just kept putting it off and telling me “oh, you won't actually have to do that. Just call me and i'll come to park it for you”. This was BS. I had to call this guy at least 10 times a day to ask him to move a car for me. And when I did, he made fun of me and complained that I didn't know how to drive stick. I only ever got trained by our mechanics that I became close friends with. And that was only two times that I ever actually drove a stick car. Very badly might I add. Fast forward to one day when I am photographing a Scion FR-S( a very nice sports car for those who don't know what that is). Once I got into the car to start it so that I could turn the tires for a side angle, this car jumps forward and hits the refrigerator that is directly in front of me. Now I had my foot on the brakes and the emergency brakes were on as well so I don't know why it did that.  Luckily no one was hurt but I was very shaken from it. After all of my co-workers came to see if I was okay, they checked it out and moved it to behind the building. The front left bumper was messed up and needed to be replaced, so when I was sat down by my co-worker, not even my boss about the details. I was confused when he said that they would make a contract and have my sign it and have 100-200 dollars deducted from my check each week and all bonuses we got each month as well once the car was fixed and they got the price for all of the damage. I was still shaken up so I just nodded along. After I got home and told my mom of the whole thing, she looked at me furiously and told me that they can't charge me for an accident that happened on the site because that's what insurance is for. I was unaware of this and looked it up and she was right. It is illegal for them to charge their employees for any damage done from an accident on the site. I even went so far as to call a lawyer to make sure this was true. Now, this ends up going quiet for about a month, until one meeting we had. There are meetings every Monday and Friday mornings before we start work, and the owner of the company asks me and my co-worker how many cars I am photographing a day and such. Then he proceeds to say jokingly “ well, maybe you can attend the driving school we have so that you don't crash any more cars.” or something like that. My mind’s a bit fuzzy on what he said so I am sorry for that. I was furious and just gave a fake smile as maybe 2 or 3 people faked laughed at it. I felt so embarrassed about it. Now I make fun of myself a lot and joke with people all the time. But when my boss just says something like that to me, that is not cool. So skipping to the next week. The car finally comes back from the shop and is put in the front lot to be sold already. Now here's the kicker... they never submitted the claims to Carfax so that they can update it and let the customer know that there was damage done to the car at one point. I know that for some cases, they don't have to (correct me if I'm wrong) but I knew that they should have for this case. So that day, my boss wanted to talk to me about how we were moving buildings and stuff like that. Then when he was done, i brought up the accident I told him that I do not believe that I had to pay damage on the car because it was not my fault and that there was no reason why insurance couldn't just pay for it. He then looks at me and proceeds to turn the blame on me that I got into the car and starting it, therefore it's my fault and that said “ wouldn't you feel guilty leaving a place knowing you did damage and didn't pay for it” Wtf?? I said no because it wasn't my fault and that I was never properly trained. He then says he will make up the contract and sent me away to continue working. I just left the room to stop myself from having a panic attack. He then called me back an hour later showing me the paper and demanding I sign it. Now I have the full recording of this conversation because I was on the phone with my mom who recorded the conversation. He then told my mom not to worry about it and that we had everything figured out. And then he again sends me away to go work and “not to worry about it” and so I did. 4 HOURS LATER, he calls me into an office and tells me that I am being fired because “it's just not working out”I just say okay and walk out of there and out of the building as fast as I can. I left after saying goodbye to my co-workers that I am friends with.

Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally ""unpaid internships"" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both ""unpaid"" and ""internship""**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young & inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is ""paying for itself"" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

&#x200B;

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

&#x200B;

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.   
I appreciate any advice or insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b4m8ym/unsure_about_unpaid_internship_at_unlaunched/,2,Tons of red flags there. If he's not offering to pay you now he never will. The guy clearly has plenty of money but just wants free labor.  ,2019-03-23 18:10:46

So I recently got my first job in the tech industry as technical support agent  and at first I was excited thinking this would be a good stepping stone in software development.

237,ei2pth,False,Discipline,14,Will I get fired (or someone from my team)?,jobs,"Some very weird changes are happening to the team, and I'd like some advice as to whether I should be concerned. It's long but will try to keep it as succinct.

1. We are a very small team with a lot of work. We have a middle manager, one big boss, and two junior analysts (one of which is me). I am one year above the junior-most analyst.
2. The junior-most analyst and I had a tense relationship for a year. The junior-most and I started at the same time, so they consistently perceived us as peers and yet consistently received worse assignments than I did. The middle manager and big boss didn't assign the junior-most analyst any work, leaving it up to me to manage them, but the junior-most struggled to take my directions and advice believing that I should not boss them around. The end result often was me being frustrated, and/or doing the work myself. The middle manager is well aware of this problem but refused to engage. The big boss is also aware of the junior-most underperforming (though not the management issue), based on various comments he makes in team meetings.
3. All this while, my relationship with the big boss was really on the upswing. He would call me to thank me for my hard work separately, compliment me on job well done (""I knew it would be just fine since you're handling it""), check in after business trips. He also seemed to become more open and honest with me, about his thoughts and opinions, took me aside to give me individual feedback. The middle manager too would call me to check in on a large project that was going haywire, thank me for job well done.
4. Long story short, the junior-most person launched an informal complaint against me and the middle manager for ""mistreatment"". There's no allegation of protected class discrimination, but the gist of the complaint appears to be that they've been told that they were a bad employee, that because of this they were getting bad work, that their relationship with the big boss deteriorated after a project gone wrong, and that they were told (by me) that there was a ""retaliation"". The management side overseeing HR complaints came to give me a talk on this, at which point I explained I never said any such thing, and the only occasions I can think of where that analyst may have made that conclusion are in the context of advice. If anything, I tried to wrangle some ""good work"" for the analyst but that effort failed because I left for vacation and no one gave the analyst anything. The management side overseeing HR noted ""hm, interesting"" but still encouraged that I may want to consider switching teams \[Edit: to add that there was the ""most complaint"" against me\]. The management side asked what was going on with the middle manager too, at which point I explained that the situation in the team is very toxic for a variety of reasons.
5. The junior-most person later told me about this complaint they filed but also told me, after this follow up, the HR asked her about me at which point they said ""things are better"" with me. The junior-most person confided that they complained about the middle manager too for their mistreatment/yelling/etc. and that they told the HR that the mistreatment did not stop as to the middle manager.
6. Around the same time, the big boss began holding team meetings including the junior-most analyst (used to never be a thing, because junior-most was consistently excluded), where he would make that analyst read out loud instructions for hours, while both the middle management and I were just there listening. The big boss began to be way more explicit about expectations and instructions, in ways he never was before. He also began to split up projects in the most inconvenient and artificial way possible to include the junior-most analyst (only to have the substance filled out by me, or redone by me at a later time). The big boss has also been making passive aggressive comments toward everyone -- especially pointed at the junior-most, insinuating that they were useless, and taking away their existing work and giving them a ""more important and urgent"" project.
7. At the same time, the big boss began to act very formal toward everyone and I sense a little big of anger toward everyone including me. This change is not very dramatic for the other two, but the most dramatic for me, as he used to be pretty casual and friendly toward me. He is formal even in exchanges that are one-on-one with me. He would avoid eye contact with me or engaging me in friendly chat in team lunches, unlike before.
8. The middle manager and I still have the same work, although the team is much slower now, and I'm not hearing from the big boss as much as I used to. The junior-most has no work. The big boss is unusually silent, although perhaps it's because of the holiday season.
9. The middle manager told me that no one had followed up with them regarding HR complaint.

It is clear to me that the big boss has been told. My concern is whether (1) I will be written up/asked to leave, (2) I will be kicked off the team. Why is the big boss acting so distant and holding all kinds of team meetings + breaking up work in such artificial ways? Is the company trying to retain the junior-most? Any thought would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ei2pth/will_i_get_fired_or_someone_from_my_team/,2,"Middle manager: clearly the route of the problem. Hopefully more likely to be fired or reassigned than anyone else.

Big boss: heard about the complaint and is being over the top and exaggerated in responding to it. They seem to be shifting things toward the most junior analyst, possibly to protect the middle manager over her. This is the one you seem to trust that you maybe should be wary of. But I don't think you're in danger of being fired by him.

Junior analyst: was and is being mistreated. It's unclear if she gave you a more honest version of the HR complaint or if HR did, but if you've otherwise had a decent relationship with her (and haven't been dismissive of her like some of your posts kind of imply, but it's unclear), it seems like HR either misunderstood who the problem was because of unclear hierarchy or they also want it to not be the fault of this middle manager. It's also quite possible she vented about each little thing and maybe HR latched on. 

If you've heard nothing else from HR, I wouldn't worry about your job, but I would look into switching teams, away from big boss if possible. ",2019-12-31 13:14:38

This. Is. Wrong.  

So many comments are giving the OPs a false sense of hope/security by assuring them that performance that lead to them getting fired (for example) won't turn up in a reference check.  Far better advice would be to help them frame a response that will help them address the situation with potential employers before it comes up.

Don't just take my word for it; here's some reference articles (by a HR Professional and an Employment lawyer) that will - hopefully - put paid to this idea that it's illegal for past employers to give a bad reference. They also give suggestions for how to try and manage bad references while job hunting. I've added one from a manager on ensuring your references are in order.

1387,2oo8jq,False,[advice],36,Brief reflections on interviewing 50 candidates for a 100k/year sales job,jobs,"* Ten minutes early is the ideal arrival timeframe. When you arrive 20-30 minutes prematurely you're actually throwing off my day. Be it cutting my lunch short, or preventing me from using allotted time to handle other tasks. I suppose I could leave you up front until our actual interview time, but I don't want to be a dick.


* I disqualified an otherwise decent applicant because his nails were femininely long for a male. I've got to draw a LOT of conclusions from preciously little information, and this was one of them.

* If I ask what your current income is, don't avoid the question or speak in general terms. An applicant yesterday avoided the question up front, and then my partner asked it again more specifically, and he still avoided it. If you want to work for me, I need to know what you're coming from.


* If I can detect that you're lying about your previous income, and frequently I can, I will assume you inflated it by roughly 10%.

* Appear as though you want the job, even if you don't. You can always decline my offer. But I will not make an offer to somebody who isn't showing some degree of zeal. A fantastic applicant from four weeks ago just called back to ask about the job (which has been filled). I would have brought him on to phase two if he had just acted more interested up front!

* I get a handle on your zeal two ways: The questions you ask me about the job, and the way you close the interview. I absolutely love when somebody wraps up by saying ""Do you have any concerns about me that I haven't addressed?"" and ""What is the next step?"".


* The guy who just walked out remembered the receptionist's name and said goodbye. It's the little things...


* Be prepared to talk about what you do at home and hobbies. Some applicants have given weak or evasive answers that make me feel they're probably boring people.


* Turned down a guy who works in my tiny niche industry because his tie was loose and the top button wasn't done. I was on the edge, but he seemed a little unmotivated to me and that button made the difference. Again, drawing a lot of conclusions from limited evidence.


* Have solid, concise, honest answers for why you left a previous job. If you talk too much, I'll find similarities between my job and the job you left, and I will hit you with difficult questions.


* My first question is always the same: *You've told me about where you work today, and how successful you are in that position, why on earth would you want to leave?*

It's a job that pays very little but gets me some income versus none, meanwhile I found a job that pays double of what I'm being paid hourly here and went through 4-weeks of consisting of numerous interviews down to the last one where HR and my hiring manager said I'm *in great standing* and they would update me after my background check passes (HR says this was the last step. I went in for many separate on-site interviews with everyone from manager, HR, team members, and even the CEO.

I received an e-mail from my hiring manager saying that everyone I interviewed with loved me and believe I will excel in this position for their company, ***however*** **due to upcoming holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmastime  Company X is putting a hold on hiring.** They went on to say that the position will be open again in 2020 and would love to reach out to me if I'm still interested.

Is this a common practice for many companies, or is this another way to say ""Sorry, we don't want you but will keep your resume on file"". Additional detail from the company is that they told me employees get the entire week off at the end of December, could that be an additional factor? (Funny the HR guy joked with me saying that they are pretty in need of this position filled and if I get it I could benefit from the holiday time off soon)

Do companies usually start hiring at the start of the new calendar year, Jan 2020?

Lastly, this is something that I know you guys probably can't answer (and I e-mailed my manager to confirm an hour after getting the e-mail, no reply yet), but would they re-start the hiring process with a new batch of candidates and sprinkle me in?

1050,gmol34,False,Covid-19,2,Anxiety/depression and returning to work after COVID lay-off,jobs,"Need advice on dealing with my mental health and my job

Here is a little background on my situation. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, have been on meds since. Throughout this time, I’ve always had a full time job, although in the last 2 years, switched around a few times to different companies (all in the retail sector).

Before covid, I was having a really hard time at my workplace. It was a very toxic environment and I was looking for new opportunities, working with a psychotherapist to manage my anxiety and issues, and making a little bit of progress. 

Then covid arrived, and I was temporarily laid off for the past 8 weeks. I applied for gov assistance (I live in Canada and it’s very helpful!). Within the first few weeks, I immediately noticed I was the happiest i had been in months, and working with my psychotherapist, attributed this to not being in the toxic work environment everyday. 

Fast forward to Friday of last week when I got the heads up that I’ll be going back to work this week. I have had the worst, most depressed, anxious weekend. I’ve had two panic attacks, crying/sobbing fits and my mind has been in another place, I can barely enjoy or think about anything else. 

There’s two main concerns of mine: one of course is going back to work during covid, nervous about the precautions and changes we need to make, my health and safety etc. But the other is going back into the environment that made me so miserable just a few months ago. I had issues prior to covid, but I feel as though the will be masked into just being “covid anxiety”. 

I can’t quit my job- 1. I need the financial support and 2. I do not want my mental health to result in me losing my job. I have been looking into short term disability leave, but again, I feel like they will assume I just have covid anxiety and it will be a fight to “prove” I had issues before this. 

If you guys have advice on how I should go about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Having crippling anxiety is the worst thing, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I am supposed to return tomorrow (Wednesday) so any suggestions will be really helpful! 

Also thanks for reading this long post :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gmol34/anxietydepression_and_returning_to_work_after/,6,"I have been in a very similar situation.

It sounds like your psychotherapist acknowledges the effect your toxic work environment has on you and so would likely agree to do this. ",2020-05-19 13:30:16

I was never short before until Saturday. I also think it waa because I gave the Teller next to me 20's that she needed and she didn't give me the right amount back. I had the Control Teller count my drawer and my two other managers. Everything else proofed out correctly, so that's why I assume it could be when I helped out the Teller next to me. Mind you she has worked there for a long time, so I was being a little trusting. I did that for her while I was with a customer, so I could've also gotten confused.

I know it is a rookie mistake and I feel so dumb. There is no excuse for it, but they didn't say much to me after everything. They showed me how to fix the variance on the computer and sighed away. I felt worse, because they didn't say ""It's okay."" Or ""Shit happens."" Which of course I don't expect from them, but they kinda just acted aggravated with me.

Anyways... Going straight to the point, I’ll be pretty much homeless in a matter of months if I can’t find a job that pays at least 30k a year. Doing all my budgeting, this would be the bare minimum I could get to “survive”. It would obviously depend on city/state since 30k in SF is absolutely nothing, but kinda doable in Seattle. (I currently reside in Florida btw). Does anybody have an idea of what sorts of jobs can I find that allow me to basically live by myself? Right now I’m just trying to go through all my options. I’m good with my hands and I’m confident I could put them to very good use with the proper training... Just don’t know where to look or where to start.

1100,g36ps1,False,Covid-19,4,Is Covid-19 pandemic affecting the length of prehire screenings or am I being impatient/paranoid?,jobs,"Hi all,

Background: I received and accepted a written job offer on Monday.  Soon thereafter instructions for drug screening and consent forms for a background check were sent to my inbox through an automated HR system.  The HR rep never gave me a timeline on how long this step would take and she also hasn't given me an expected start date.  I completed the drug test on Monday and I'm still waiting to hear back if everything checked out OK.  The testing center said 1-2 business days and therein lies my concern.

My questions to the sub: Is anyone else experiencing delays in background checks or is a week fairly normal?  The drug screening was done through Lab Corp and several friends have suggested they're likely inundated with coronavirus tests, which I can believe.  My other question is when is it appropriate to follow-up with HR if I haven't heard anything to make sure all my ducks are in a row?  My thought would be this Friday afternoon or Monday, but I also don't want to come across as impatient.  Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g36ps1/is_covid19_pandemic_affecting_the_length_of/,4,"Yes. Thankfully since I've been contracting with them they are bypassing the drug screen and are going to take whatever background check they can get.

They did say, however, that when things start to open the background check could come back with something and I'll be fired if there's something on there. Thankfully, I'm clean, so shouldn't be a problem.

This was a special circumstance though. Most other positions are in hold. I'm guessing most other companies are trying to pivot and deal as needed. And public companies are probably even harder hit. ",2020-04-17 17:42:38
2245,71brlh,False,Startups,5,Moving from start-up CTO to large company,jobs,"
I've worked for mostly early stage start-ups in leadership roles and have held had some very fancy sounding titles, including CTO.  Since these were start-ups I'd wear many hats and be responsible for things such as:

-designing and writing software 

-building and deploying virtual servers

-hiring and leading a small team of developers

-reinstalling printer drivers and resetting people's passwords at 2am when they can't get into their e-mail

-helping CEO develop the business plan.  


I'm now interested in leaving the start-up world due to fatigue with the inherent risks and getting a job at a bigger company.  The problem is that CTO is a VERY different role at a large company like google or IBM.  I'm not qualified to hold a job with this title at a large company, nor is it even the career path I'm interesting in heading toward.  I'd like to be hands-on designing and writing software.


I'm worried that applying for those jobs with CTO in my resume could make HR departments immediately toss out the resume fearing that this is a stop-gap job while I look for another C level position.  I also worry it would color me as having more of a business oriented background and career goals when really I have solid software engineering experience and matching degrees.


Does anyone have advice for how best to handle this situation?  Would it make sense to put a different and more descriptive job title on my resume?  Or maybe qualify it as ""Start-up CTO""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/71brlh/moving_from_startup_cto_to_large_company/,2,If you're applying through a system I'd just change the job title to something more appropriate to the level you're looking for.

I have a new boss as of a year ago, and he can't get business to save his life. My savings are being dug into. I'm under $2K in my personal savings, though I do have a windfall in a separate account of about $30K, so I'm not desperate, but I also do NOT want to rely on that money.

Life specific details out of the way, that brings me to the point of this thread. Can any medical coders tell me how you feel about the job? Specifically:

1. Is it a low/medium stress environment?
2. Is it good for someone that has a history with (but is also getting over) social anxiety?
3. How much schooling is typically required?

600,hcluem,False,Unemployment,23,Will I receive unemployment if I get fired for telling my boss I won't do part of my job anymore?,jobs,"Little (ok a lot after reading through it) backstory: I accepted a position with a company in Ohio after I graduated college with a BS in Design Engineering Technology. I was led to believe that I would be working with customers to design CNC machines that fit their requirements. In actuality I was hired to be a travelling service mechanic. Every review for 3 years I told my boss I wanted an engineering job, and he always told me I needed to learn the how's and why's before I could design them. Meanwhile I realized that was all bullshit because my company hired fresh graduates to do those jobs anyways.  
  
Two years ago my boss was promoted and my new boss started cracking whips. Made my life a living hell and has me on the road 50-60% of the year while other techs get to stay home quite often, and most of it is no-notice. I started looking for new jobs but we're in a very rural location with little engineering jobs available. I applied on my company's website for an open detailer position, but HR said the company needs me more where I am. So I started branching out back to Michigan where I grew up and all my family lives. It's now been over 5 years with just one phone interview. I was just recently told by a family friend hiring manager that it would be tough finding me a job 5 years out of college with no engineering experience.  
  
So here I am seeing my only way to move up at my current company is to tell my boss I won't travel anymore starting January 1st. My question is if I give him this ultimatum and I'm fired for it, would I still be eligible for unemployment?

A recruiter actually found me on LinkedIn and said I would be perfect for the job and they would be silly not to hire me. I send in my resume and score an interview! The company asked before we interviewed if I would take a personality assessment. I know some large companies do this to get a sense of the person before they commit to hiring. I do the assessment, still good for the interview. I had probably one of the smoothest interviews ever! I was so confident this was going to work out. The interviewer was thrilled with my experience and excited for me to join the team. I even sent a follow-up thank you email.

A couple days go by and I finally hear from my recruiter: It was a no! I was stunned! My recruiter said the person who interviewed me loved me, she fought for me to be accepted. But, apparently, the owner of the company is basing hires on these personality tests, and I just didn't fit the mold!?

I have had some time to think and reflect: it's like it wasn't me, but, it was me? Idk, I am still confused.. If. Company was basing hiring on those tests- why conduct interviews of those who don't ""make the cut""?

2481,3nllcb,False,Experience,145,How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years,jobs,"This is a personal story.  Some details have changed or kept vague to protect my identity since I work for a ""high profile"" position now.

---

First, my humblebrag: I make over $100k per year working about 20-25 hours per week for a multinational corporation in the Midwest US.  I'm officially a ""business analyst.""  In reality, I look at Outlook and Excel for 10 hours per week and B.S. the rest.

Three years ago, I worked 40 hours a week on my feet doing retail customer service B.S. at a local grocery chain.  I made $10 per hour.  I have a liberal arts degree.

Here's what helped me make the transition (in order of importance).

**1\. Learn new skills on my own time**.  When I decided that I had enough of retail, I went to the library and picked up books on different office skills.  Excel, accounting, finance, project management, basic programming, and business leadership.  For me, these were the topics that stuck.  I came home every damn night and read and practiced everything.  I continued to do this even after my first office job.

**2\. Be a job hopper**.  I found job hopping opened many more opportunities.  Yes, some people will thumb their nose at your resume, but it's necessary to advance.  I've had 5 jobs in the past 3 years (not counting the retail one).  Contract positions were great because it taught a lot.

**3\. Keep in contact with old coworkers (aka networking)**. This didn't help me get my first job, but it did help me land my current gig.

**4\. Find the path of least resistance.**  Opportunities just came up organically that I was not interested in.  I would normally not be interested in programming, but a software development position came up in my company and my boss asked me if I was interested.  No, I wasn't, but I studied my ass off and took it anyway since it was a move up.  I'm not a developer now, but I have used a lot of those skills in my current job to get some street cred with the IT/tech department.

**5\. Be willing to stay late for a big project.**  My father gave me advice once that said: be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.  This advice is old hat.  Here's my version.  Stay late for a big project ONCE, then come in late and leave early afterwards.  Once you get the reputation of the one who got that big project done, you never have to worry about being on time to work again.  You get a lot of cred with leadership who don't give a crap about what time you came in today.

**6\. Keep a good relationship with a GOOD third-party recruiter.**  Third party recruiters are a dime a dozen.  And there are some shady ones out there.  But if you find a good one, they are really valuable.  Found 2 jobs through one.

Here's been my career path:

First job: admin assistant (aka secretary) for around $25k/yr

Second job: financial analyst - looked at spreadsheets for around $40k/yr

Third job: junior software developer - built some stupid internal websites around $50k/yr (only job where I moved within the same company)

Fourth job: project manager - a much better paying admin assistant around $80k/yr

Fifth job: business analyst for around $110k/yr",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3nllcb/how_i_broke_out_of_retail_got_a_6_figure_salary/,254,"The problem with a post like this is that you are setting someone up to get caught, denied a job or at the worst, fired after they got the job from lying. People fib on their resume and embellish all of the time, but every now and then you will be asked of your proficiency with skills you listed. I interviewed at a sports media company last year over the phone and the interviewer wanted to bring me in to test my CSS skills as I had listed it on my resume. Did I use CSS in my everyday? Yes, but not to the extent they wanted me to do so. Luckily I didn't have to do any hand coding, just observation and telling him what I saw. It didn't cost me the job as HR ultimately canceled the position, but I came away with a very important lesson.

I asked them for a reason and they said “lack of it,” and they refused to provide further details, stating that they were “unaware” of the specific issues since HR is a “different department.” The paperwork says I was supposed to receive an “exit package,” but I have only received my paycheck, to which the pay ends the day i was terminated. My health insurance was cut off the day after (fair), but they took out money for the pretax subway card which I did not receive.

I have had friends who believe that there were discriminatory concerns, as I am the youngest female in that particular department, and had staff comment on my appearance, moreso than other staff members when wearing the same attire. I personally believe that there is no discrimination, and perhaps they didn’t feel I was mature enough for the job. However, I didn’t get any warnings of my performance with my supervisor, so I did feel a bit blindsided. 

I just want a neutral POV of what might have been the concerns they saw, and how can I avoid them in the future. But also to know if this is a fairly standard type of termination when fit is the issue. Looking back, I’m not too upset about the job loss, as the commute was 3+ hours and extremely unreliable.

253,ce5hna,False,Discipline,48,I'm a depressed $30 a day worker that needs advice.,jobs,"This is gonna be a long one so if youre not interested in hearing a Millenial whine and ask dumb questions please move on. 

I'm 23 years old, i work a minimum wage job for 30ish dollars a day. I'm miserable. Ive been blaming the system but I realize that will just end with me hanging from the ceiling fan sooner than later.

First things first, I like hard work. When im at work I work. No talking, no chit chatting, just me and my work. Im the fastest production line worker in the company right now. But my boss sees my quietness as a bad thing, and I have been passed up for raises twice because of it. And my coworkers dislike me, or rather ""are made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by my attitude"".

I'm antisocial and anxious, speaking to my coworkers about anything but the task at hand drains me and irritates me. Is it so wrong to devote my shift entirely to my work? Will it really get me nowhere if I can't communicate mindless dribble to my coworkers? This is my main issue, this is what has actually led to me losing jobs in the past.

Second, I want an 8 hour shift. I dont want to work 16 hour days with a trade. I know people see this as whiney and entitled, but I have a family I like to spend time with every day. They make me happy and are the only reason i havent offed myself already. Is it so wrong to show up when your shift starts and leave when it ends? Will i really get nowhere if i dont dedicate my entire day to my job? Is that really what it takes? Is being the best damn worker in the business for exactly 8 hours a day not enough to be successful?

Last, I am bipolar. I get sick a lot. Sometimes i cant even force myself to stand up. And sometimes I call in because if i dont i will be less than useless at work and i know the only thing keeping me employed is how fast I can turn over products and i know if i show up and screw everything up im as good as fired. My boss knows of my condition and ""tolerates"" it. But usually i get snide remarks and unhelpful ""advice"" on how to be less worthless. Calling in hurts the company, i know. But even with medicine it's the only choice I have sometimes. It makes my coworkers hate me even more and hurts my chances of ever moving to full time again. Entitled again, I know. But if anyone has advice in this area, please let me know.

Im lost. I cant get my mind around these things and I'm so close to giving up. If staying at work for 10-16 hours a day is required, and so is being a social butterfly, to be a successful part of society than I think I'm just not cut out for it.

So I got contacted last week by a job recruiter with a position at a MAJOR company with a job that looks like it was written for my skillset and experience. Even the recruiter mentioned this and told me at the time that he has high hopes that I'd get the position and that he'd most likely have an answer by Friday. He even said he loved my personality and thought I'd fit right into the company. 

Friday comes along and I hadn't heard anything from him so I sent an email to follow up. Problem is, I found out on Monday that my website/email hosting site has been having authentication issues where all emails lack a certificate and they get filtered as spam by most email clients, so my email didn't go through. 

So today I called to follow up and got the recruiting agency's front desk and asked to speak to the recruiter. He seemed pretty annoyed that I had called, confirmed that he didn't get my email, said that he had already submitted my resume and application and was still waiting to hear back, but kept acting annoyed as if I had broken some kind of protocol by calling him.

Here's a few questions I had about the process:

* Is this a reason for him to pull my resume and portfolio from this position?
* Is my potential job jeopardized because of this interaction?
* If so, then is there anything I can do to remedy this situation?

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm ""an expert"" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

My manager had come up to me ran by me a couple of questions he has asked me If I I was in school and whether or not I had another job. My answer was no. He offered to give me forty hours, something that a lot of people would be grateful for. He had asked me If I wanted to do the coffee position at my job. I use to work at Mcdonalds and making drinks use to be fun so I thought that this would be a nice opportunity for me. I had agreed to take the position but that I only wanted to work 30 hours, that way I could move up or down in hours depending on how I felt while working the new position. He was upfront and told me that I would only have my trainer for one day and that I would be all on my own from there. I saw that he had put me on the weekend and the trainer said that it gets really crazy with coffee and Im scared for the weekend because I know the servers are going to be frustrated with me because its going to be super busy and I will be slowing everything down for them.

It was my first day working the restaurant side of my job today. Usually I stick to banquets. Throughout the day I had been following my trainer around and one person that I know from banquet said ""cmon guy"" in response to me not knowing the table numbers and not knowing where to drop off the coffee and It was this comment that made me feel awful. I just cried. This is because I am not able to take criticism. I wasnt sure if I just needed to sit on the idea of telling my boss that this isnt the position for me for a day and get outside advice. The thing is that the coffee guy only makes cappuccinos and espressos but I still struggle with working the machine. Theres a certain part that we have to take out and then put a new one in and I can never get to put the regular coffee in. Not understanding simple concepts is something not new and I believe that my anxiety has something to do with it.

My manager had asked me how was the first day and he was on already on his way out of the restaurant and I just didnt really know how to tell him how I felt because I was very scared. I would have felt guilty telling him that I was uncomfortable and that I didnt think the position was right for me. I was going through some scenarios in my head but none of them I thought would be perfect. I had to prepared to answer what do you need? Can you give it another day? What is stressing you out?

I just told him that it was okay, I was just thrown out by the numbering system that we have so we know whose tables are whose. He had brought up something about needing a map, I think it was a joke but its important interactions like these where my anxiety just freezes me up and I dont hear what the other person is telling me.

353,a5gnzx,False,Discipline,14,"Called in Sick, Told to come in Anyway",jobs,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place to do this. I've been working at my job for 2 years now, and in the beginning I got sick a lot and would call in whenever I was. I still was a very hard worker, and many of my managers praised my hard work, and even some of the higher ups complimented my work as well. I also would come in on days off or work for hours after my scheduled shift.

So recently, just got a new manager. She worked at the store before, but was never in charge of me. Initially, we didnt like each other, but once she saw how hardworking I was, she began to like me, and same with me, for requested days off were usually approved. I've been working with her for 3 months, and during these three months I haven't called in sick once. I've also worked give overtime hours, and she has written me several times thanking me for how hard I've been working (I work at Safeway so I stock things basically and face)

One of my other managers who oversees the schedule and such, doesnt like me (which most people in the store do like me and even were shocked at some of the things hes done) There was a time he yelled at me during my first year when I needed time off after finding out my Grandma had stage 4 cancer. The past 4 days Ive been feeling very sick. I didnt want to call in because I really wanted the money for Christmas presents for my boyfriend and family, so I worked those days, not taking a lunch either on any of those days to make sure the job was finished. Today though, I felt dizzy and couldn't even get out of bed for a few hours. I've been having a very bad headache, sore throat, runny nose and cough with a heavy feeling in my chest. I'm not sure if its bronchitis or another sinus infection, just a really bad one, but I just knew if I went to work today i could potentially pass out. So, I let my manager know, she didnt say anything. Then I called the store to let them know. My schedule manager answered and instantly was annoyed and I felt terrified because I knew he might yell at me again. I told him I felt awful and was wondering I could use my sick hours for today (whenever I called out previously I never used sick hours, but this time I really didnt want to take a hit to my paycheck) he began saying ""this is the worst possible day to do this, she has to count EVERYTHING.  You can't call in you have to come in. You've been calling in a lot again."" I tried to fight back tears because I was not expecting him to tell me I couldn't, is that even possible? And I wanted to say I hadn't been calling in, in fact it had been over 3 months of solid working even overtime. But I just said okay. Hung up the phone and cried. My boyfriend told me I needed to be more firm, stand up for myself and learn to say no, but then offered to call.  I told him no, that would make things worse.

My mom also was upset, and told me he can't do that. I told her I already agreed to come in. Now I'm concerned not only will I potentially pass out from being dizzy, but also that I could get others sick.

I'm also now on the bad side of my schedule manager (let's just call him J) again, who yelled at me on the phone. I've even come to work before with a face mask on when I was very sick, just so I didnt get yelled at by him for calling in. I have a very weak immune system, have had doctors notes almost 90 percent of the time I've been sick, and they even see me coughing and having to blow my nose. 

What should I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a5gnzx/called_in_sick_told_to_come_in_anyway/,3,"> What should I do? 

You should get another job. Any manager that thinks they have the right to yell, scream at, or berate a worker for not coming in when they're obviously sick is not worth sticking under. They care more about you doing inventory than they care about the fact that you're spreading your potentially contagious disease(s) to unsuspecting customers? They'll have fewer customers next week if half of the people who touched the items you stocked get sick. Also, learn to hold your ground and not be a doormat. If you can't come in, then you can't come in. Point blank. That goes for working on days you're sick, days you're scheduled to be off but they call you anyway, etc. They can ask you to come in or to cover someone, but you don't have to oblige. I understand that it's holiday season and you want to earn the money to buy gifts for your loved ones, but I'm sure they'll appreciate that you're healthy and happy more than they'll appreciate a material item that you put yourself in the hospital for. Take care of yourself. ",2018-12-12 09:30:14

2200,82h3z6,False,Startups,8,Should I join a startup as intern or stay at my current corporate job while finishing school?,jobs,"Hello reddit,
Need some help regarding my career situation. Some background info:
22M in Canada, in university for Business Degree, has one more year left (8 courses)
Current job: Part time contractor at one of the biggest oil and gas company in Calgary, Canada, making about 50k CAD a year, doing it while in school, I used to intern here and that's why I have this nice gig. I have a lot of coop experiences at big oil companies. Love my coworkers, and my boss, he is the most caring and chill manager I've had so far. I pretty much can stay part time until I graduate and very confident that I will receive a full time offer from this company (already verbally confirmed from my boss) making about 80k CAD right after graduating. The work itself isn't too exciting (IT Application support) but its not demanding at all, I prob only work half of the time and chill for the rest. 
Potentially I have an offer from a startup in San Francisco coming up for this summer, 4-8 months term. They just raised their series A and prob doing their series B this year. I believe in their mission and business model. I will be helping out with their business team doing project management and operation roles. The pay isn't great, like 15 US a hour. They are looking to double their headcount this year and I do think I have a good chance to stay full time after internship. I always wanted to work at a startup because I believe I can learn a lot there vs at a big company since they will be growing really fast. And I love SF as a city, so much more things to do than Calgary. 
My problem: SF is a really expensive city to live in vs where I am now, I am looking at double the cost of living. And 50% pay cut vs what I make now. So every month I am there I will need to put in my own saving while working at that startup. And if I were to leave my corporate job now I doubt I will be able to get it back after. Also there is a chance of full time at the startup which means I wont finish my undergrad degree (1 year left). Talked to my family and friends about it, all of my friends support me to go but my family not so much. They think I should finish school and my job is really good so I should stay at this oil company. But my argument is that if the startup fail I can always come back to school and finish up (you can take 10 years max to finish your degree), and the learning experience/opportunity I will have at that startup is very valuable, I see it as my ticket into the tech industry.

I just wanted to stop by to vent and share my experience.  I have been on the job hunt for about 10 months; 4 months unemployed and VERY actively interviewing, testing, and (as the title implies) getting rejected. 


I just finished the process of interviewing for a position supporting the Superintendent and Board of Trustees of a small, public school district.  Long story short, it was down to me and one other candidate.  I ""knocked [the first interview] way out of the park"" and met with the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent on Monday.  I just got a phone call from the Superintendent himself and I was told the following: 


* You didn't get the job, but I'm calling because you did very, very well in the process.

* You have incredible potential and your references/qualifications speak to that.


* There's nothing else you could've done; I don't want you to think that you could've done x, y, z or done anything differently. 


* You're at a great point in your career; there was nothing else you could've done. 


* It was a matter of circumstance. 


* We have some openings in the Spring and we really want you to keep us in mind.  We will probably be reaching out to you before you reach out to us. 


I've been in similar positions (i.e. getting to the last round and getting beaten out) probably about a dozen times in the past couple of months and I'm so **very** tired of hearing ""you have incredible potential *BUT* we went with another candidate.""  


I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just an outlet to express my exasperation with this process.  But here I am.  I really have done everything I can to prepare myself for each interview; I just (stupidly) let myself get really invested in the idea of this particular position.  Has anyone else felt this way?  What do you think of what he said to me; was it bullsh*t or was it genuine (no one knows for sure, I know..)?  How do I muster the strength to move forward?  I'm so tired of constant rejection and (fake?) validation at the same time.  I can't help but feel defeated each time this happens.  I'm overall a more bitter, jaded person because of this experience.  


I guess it's just two steps forward, one step back.  As cliche as that sounds.

983,bnmxo6,False,Education,14,"""Don't Tell Them You Are in School""",jobs,"After many years with only two years of college under my belt, I decided to return to University to finish obtaining a bachelor's degree. 

I am pretty miserable at my present job and have a potential opportunity to move to a job that offers benefits that I do not have, but it comes with a pay cut. As much as I don't care for the idea of going backwards, I thought I could still make it work, as I would have the opportunity for quick advancement. 

An acquaintance of mine scheduled my interview for next week, saying he'd rather do it on his day off instead of Monday. I commented in passing that worked for me, as I have Summer classes starting on Monday. He seemed surprised that I was in school and told me that I shouldn't mention that in any of my interviews, as his company wanted people that they felt would be devoted to the job. I told him it was a little late for that, as I had mentioned it on my application. 

Frankly, I feel disheartened. And although I will still go to the interview, it gives me pause as to whether I want to bother working for the company (should I be offered a position), as I am not willing to give up on my education now. Most of my classes are online, as I work 40+ hours a week now with crazy hours; but there will come a time when I may need to take a few classes on campus. My present job is at least supportive of my endeavor, even if I am not happy.

I thought a pursuit of education would be considered an admirable quality, if anything. It's been over a decade since I have been on a job hunt.

I made it through a three interview process and due to my experience was offered a Store Manager in Training position. The training time is a small pay cut, but because of the extra hours I will be putting in, I will actually make more than I am now...and even more once I am given a store.

I was very honest about my pursuit of education, as it is very important to me. I switched my major in January to a Bachelor of General Studies with a concentration in Public Health. During my interview with the Regional Manager and his District Manager, both were intrigued when I said I picked something that would apply to my real world experience. I made sure to mention classes, such as OSHA training. I also mentioned that I was simply looking to look better on paper and wasn't necessarily looking for any major career changes. 

I am in my forties and a looking towards the future. Whatever I can do make myself look better and grow is a plus. Where I am at right now, I am the top of the food chain, and if something should happen to the Owner, I am out of a job. This new job offers a lot of benefits that I do not have and an immense room for growth. I have been primary to my job and schooling in my free time...but I will need some time for a few classes on campus and intend on working them in on my off days. Even now, I have too much responsibility to do otherwise. I do worry because I will need to put in at least five extra hours a week. There will also be 5 mandatory lunch hours a week.

196,dbwjut,False,Rejections,2,"Did I make a mistake in communicating with this prospective employer who seemed interested in me, or was I just unlucky?",jobs,"Hi all, first-time poster here.

I graduated in May with a degree in Music Technology and Composition, and began applying to jobs about a month ago after a busy summer. I came across a posting from a UK-based company for a freelance audio producer position in New York, which is right up my alley in-terms of technical knowledge and work experience. It may be worthwhile to note that while the position is in audio/podcast production, the majority of the company's business is \*not\* in that field.

About two weeks after applying, an employee (I'm not sure of their position) — let's call them Jim for the purposes of this post — contacted me by email with the following message:

>Hello u/iam_hexxed \- thanks for getting in contact, we're getting ready to move forward with this role, I wanted to check what your current availability was. We are potentially looking for someone to work with us in early October.   
>  
>Also could you confirm your day rate: thank you  
>  
>jim lastname

While I do have an existing day rate, I knew that a) it would be well under market for the area and b) that this job was a step up, and that I should ask for more than my current rate. After reaching out to some mentors in my field, as well as the r/audioengineering sub (see post \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how\_do\_you\_set\_your\_day\_rates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how_do_you_set_your_day_rates/))), several people I asked said that a key piece of information I needed to know was whether I would be paid via a 1099 as a contractor or as an employee before I could give them a rate. This made sense to me because, while the position had ""freelance"" in the title, it also listed several benefits that would only be given to employees (IRA contributions, etc.), so I didn't feel that I could infer the answer. Mentors and members of the audio engineers' sub also encouraged me to ask whether I would at any point be using my own equipment, which merits a higher rate for maintenance etc. So, early that same evening, I replied:

>Mr. Lastname,  
>  
>It's great to hear from you!  
>  
>I'm shortly relocating to New York from \[nearby city\], and with that slated my calendar is wide open — early October definitely works. As far as the rate goes, that depends upon whether or not I would be considered an independent contractor on a 1099. Can you clarify that? In addition, please let me know whether or how often I would be expected to use my own equipment?   
>  
>Thanks very much,  
>  
>u/iam_hexxd

The next day, which was a Wednesday, around 12 noon:

>u/iam_hexxd \- to be honest, I dont know the answers to your questions, I'm afraid but i'd be happy to set you up on a call with one of the producers here so he can explain it in more detail. ​  
>  
>in the meantime I'll look into how you will be paid.   
>  
>would you be free for a call at 3pm Uk time which I think is your 10am

You'll notice that this message arrived in my inbox \*after\* the suggested call time based on the timestamp, so this wasn't possible. Still, I felt excited because they seemed interested in me. I replied about an hour after receiving the message:

>Hi Jim,That's no problem at all! I appreciate your honesty on that. Unfortunately, it looks like for some reason this message didn't reach my inbox until well after 10 am EST. I'm traveling tomorrow, so do you think we could arrange a call for some time on Friday?Many thanks,u/iam_hexxd

I received no reply until today, which was six days later:

>Hi u/iam_hexxd,  
>  
>We’re just writing to you to let you know we’ve reviewed your application for the ... position and unfortunately, it has not been successful this time.  
>  
>We really appreciate you taking the time to apply and please be assured your application was reviewed and given full consideration.  
>  
>Thanks for your interest in \[company name\].  
>  
>Kind regards,  
>  
>jim lastname

My question is, did I make some mistake in the process of communicating with this employer that might have upset them and caused them to pick a different candidate? Perhaps I'm naïve, but it seems as though they were interested with a back and forth happening, and then they suddenly went silent, five days went by and I got passed over. I'm pretty bummed because it feels like in following the advice of mentors (one of them said to me ""you should definitely ask if it's a 1099 before giving a rate""), I lost out on a good job opportunity which has been hard to come by so far.

TL;DR: not sure if something in my emails (see above) with a prospective employer for a freelance audio production job caused them to change their mind about my candidacy.

Note: I have changed some details to protect my privacy and the company's, but they have been changed to accurately reflect the situation (i.e. where the employer did not capitalize their name, I did not, and I removed my current town for privacy reasons)

It has been a family owned company for 80 years (since the 1940s). Unfortunately, the owners have had health problems (stroke and mental problems). We are a profitable company that supplies a niche apparel product. We are still gaining new customers, creating new designs, and etc. We have several patents. We own two manufacturing plants in Central America. I work in the stateside distribution center (located here for 30 years).

Today we had a meeting with this information provided. The company have four potential buyers. They are optimistic about them. They have been trying to sell for years but the owners were only interested in investors not a large competitor buying. All four companies interested are smaller than ours. Two are in the same apparel as ours. One sells a product that is a direct competitor. Some have distribution centers, some have manufacturing plants but in Asia.

Management seemed positive but management is also older and closer to retirement. They are also less expendable. They said a lot of stuff (they have always presented the company as a whole, this will help the company grow, the companies interested are ""good people"", etc) but it is hard to tell if it is just corporate speak or not. They are in the ""due diligence"" part of the sell.

I have a Bachelor's but it is in Special Education. The town I am living in is **very** small and in the Midwest. I bought a house last year and am going to be paying that off for the next 20 years. I am a naturally pessimistic person so this is stressing me out.

This cafe opened in July, and I have been working there since August. It's my first job. Typically I don't work out front serving food and what not. Since we were short two people today and it was busy, my manager had me serving food today. I have not been trained or prepared to do this. He just threw me out there.

I think I did pretty well even though I was nervous and I had to ask my coworkers lots of questions on how to do things.

However, there was one thing in particular that I messed up on and I am beating myself up over it.

This week at work we are selling tacos and nachos. As I was serving a few people, some of them asked if they could have like their salsa and stuff on the side. As I was putting their food in the containers, I like put the salsa outside the container to itself. Like you have the tacos and stuff in the container with plastic wrap, and I put like the salsa outside the plastic wrap to itself. I now realize that was not the best way to do it.

I didn't know until a coworker mentioned it that we have plastic cups for side stuff to be placed in. I was upset with myself that I ruined a few customers servings. Also for one lady, I accidentally put salsa on her food container and it was dripping on the side. I felt bad about that. I directed her where our napkins are.

I didn't know though. I didn't know that we had those plastic cups. Had I known that, I would've put their side stuff in them. The way I was doing it was kind of sloppy.

Doing things like this is how you lose customers. I would hate to be the reason why customers don't come back.

The question coming up might be broad, but I could not find any satisfactory answer in an existing post so far (because you know, specifics), so I thought I'd ask around for enlightenment.

Long story short, I am now in my mid-30's, decided to quit my job in one of the Big 4 tech companies after 12 years, and while I'm not yet at the point where I want to go back to an office job straight away, I'd love to hear your opinion and  experiences on the topic.

\- Dropped out of uni before the end of my BSC in computer science and industrial programming (yeah great move I know)

\- Jumped immediately into a Tech support / Customer service rep role for the next 3 years.

\- Spent the next 8 years in 2 different management positions (In B2B support), still in the Tech support/Customer service area, with job responsibilities heavy on Coaching/Leadership and Admin/Reporting, with months-long missions in Recruitment and Operations.

\- 5 Months in a UX/UI analyst role afterwards. I maintained a decent IT background throughout the management career (particularly on Network technologies, Mobile Device management and programming), which probably helped landing this job.

\- Native French speaker, pretty much native-level English fluency at this point too. I understand Italian/Spanish/Dutch fairly well, fluency in either of these 3 would be a matter of months practicing.

\- Interest in and good understanding of Finance/Stock market.

And this is where I am.

My worry at this point is that customer care/tech support careers seem to be a good path to ... another customer care job, which is and industry i'd preferably steer clear of. Most of my network left our company for another Customer care department, and I'm just not sure what roles this job prepared me for outside of it exactly. While leadership is an important skill in itself in my opinion, I am not too sure about the job market for a management position outside of my field of expertise. Also, the fact that I did not graduate can be an issue, as some companies/countries/roles will enforce strict degree requirements, while for others work experience can make up for it.

So in a nutshell my question is: What's your experience with your career after call center / call center management careers, or any thoughts/recommendations you would have based on my profile. 

Finally, I'm willing to relocate outside of Europe (the last 2 gigs were in Ireland/Netherlands), with a preference for HK/Singapore or if stars align for it find a location independent job.

TIA :)

1254,dka9h1,False,Onboarding,1,Recently started a job in a newly-created role. I've been getting minimal guidance or training and I'm not sure what to do.,jobs,"Context: as in the title, I've recently started a new job in a role that was newly created within an established, ~100 person software company. Basically, the plan was to hire someone full time to do a particular job that one team (team A) had a rotation for, and wanted to stop doing since it's out of the scope of their own roles. The people in team A work mostly remotely, and it's them who are my ""customers"" (and who I work with the most so far). However, I'm organizationally a member of a different team (team B) whose manager I report to. It's a weird structure and I got a sense of the weirdness during the interview process when the hiring manager (the manager of team A) revealed I would be reporting to someone else.

While it makes sense for me to be a part of team B given the set of tools and technologies I'm working with, since joining I've had almost no official training with either of the teams. My current training has consisted of shadowing members of team A as they do the job I've been hired to do, though this is proving difficult as they are all remote and keep doing parts of the job without me. I've also had very little official contact with either of the managers. At other companies I've worked for, I'm used to having weekly one-on-one check-ins with my managers (and sometimes daily check ins during onboarding), and after four weeks on the job, I haven't had a single one. Manager of team B (my manager) has assigned me some projects, which is fine, but they're all relatively advanced and have little to do with the job I was actually hired for (I also haven't been getting much help on them). As time goes on I do want to spend more time on these kinds of projects, but for now I first want to establish myself in the job I was hired to do. 

Truth be told, I'm starting to get worried. I'm still not sure how I should be spending my time, how long training should take, and how to get the training I need. I'm also relatively isolated since my primary customers are remote. It's clear to me now that little thought was given to this role's day to day, and there was (and is) little coordination between the leaders of the two teams regarding this role. I'm imagining it was basically team A saying ""there's this job we don't like and we want someone else on team B to do it for us"", and team B saying ""sure, we'd be glad to have another person"". I'm also totally unclear on how I'm going to be evaluated. Will I be reviewed by team A or B? What should my goals be? When should I expect to be ramped? How should I learn what I need to know? Who do I need to please?

I've been trying my best to manage in this unorganized situation, but as of right now it does not seem sustainable and I need clarity from my manager. Unfortunately he's definitely hands off, and while not a bad guy, mentoring does not appear to be a strongpoint of his. What do you recommend I do in this situation to get the guidance and clarity that I need?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dka9h1/recently_started_a_job_in_a_newlycreated_role_ive/,1,"First prioritize your projects, then write down a list of questions for each.  I assume you know how to do some of what you’re being asked or they wouldn’t have hired you.  Go to the person who assigned a given project and let them know you’re of course still learning the workflow but wanted to walk them through what you think the steps should be.  If Team A member jumps ahead and does something without you, ask them how they did it, say hey I would really love to take this part off your hands can you show me your process or here’s what I think your process was, does this work.  There are two types of people in your situation, those who quit because they dont know what to do and think there’s no training and those who figure out how to fill the holes, figure out how to slowly help each member of team A or  team B.  A lot of times companies have a group of employees that says they are really struggling to get something done and so they hire someone to do it, you, so if they won’t show you how to do it, try a few things, show them a few things, show your manager a few things, don’t ask or wait, just do.  The brilliance of a job like yours that isn’t standardized is you could make it what you want and then be the person everyone wants to go to and that person climbs quickly.

But I want to leave on good terms.",jobs,"I have always wanted to do Masters from Germany. I was working at my home country, it was a new job and I started to hate it because of the toxic environment. So when I got my student visa I gave a two weeks notice and left the job. The main reason was not the masters, it was the toxicity. My manager was pain in the ass. Anyways, I received an email from the university that they'll conduct the classes online because of corona, this happened just a day before I was supposed to fly. They also said that they classes have been postponed. 
This hit me pretty hard. It's seemed as though all my dreams had been put on pause for an indefinite period of time. Since my graduation (Bachelor's) I have had a job. I didn't know how to cope with this ""free time"". So I applied for a few jobs. I was also unsure if I want to pursue master's online, because it won't be the same as on-campus. And I applied for jobs that suited my skillsets, aligned with my career goals. I applied mostly at small companies, and only at one multi-national which is also the among the biggest corp in my home country. 

I had been a while, since this happened, and I had to decide whether or not to take online classes, so I availed the option and started my classes. It's been 2.5 months that I've been studying.
So the most unexpected thing happened. I got an interview call from that big company, and I got so excited, I went for the interview. It went well, then the final interview, and finally I landed the job! I couldn't believe it. I landed it so easily. Now they want me to join them, and this just seemed very foolish of me to pass the opportunity like that. I took my time to think about it and accepted the offer. But I'm still not sure, I haven't signed the contract yet. I've only accepted it verbally. 

I had my exams in July, but they've been postponed, the university says they next semester will probably be online as well. But it's not confirmed as of yet and they'll see how things evolve. Which makes sense. 

All of this uncertainty, made me accept the offer. But it really stresses me out when I think about leaving the job in a few months. ""What if the university calls on campus for exams?"" ""What if the next semester is on-campus?"" I know leaving a company in a few months does not leave a good impression and ruins the employee's reputation. 

I don't know what to do. Though writing this post has cleared my mind to some extend like I don't think joining was a stupid decision. But I want to tell my manager so that when I leave it doesn't come as a shock to him. But since it's a big company idk how soon a ""new"" ""entry-level"" employee should give out that information because that could really work out against me. But again, I don't want to drop a truth bomb, and just come up to them one day with the news that I'm leaving. 

I'm really enjoying studying. And I DO NOT want to put my masters on hold for this job. Legally, I can do both as long as I'm staying in my home country. 

In the interview, they didn't ask me anything regarding my future plans, expected duration of anything like that. They don't even know I'm doing master's.

I was thinking was casually dropping little info so they at least know about my master's. Instead of having a one-to-one serious meeting. 

This whole thing has been extremely stressful. I don't like disappointing people. And I want to leave as soon the classes start on campus. Masters is my first priority.

But, i want to market my skills and use them for gain. 


Basically, i want to become kind of a freelance editor, like, someone send me their videos or footage online and i'll edit it together for them. Like, a wedding video or something. Kind of like that.


I'd rather work from home, if possible, (rather then like, an office or something). Because i am somewhat disabled, i have knee problems and limited mobility so i can't really get around very well, i just think it'd be better.


So, my question is, how do i go about doing this? I don't have much ""formal"" training with this, i didn't go to college or anything, but i did learn a lot about editing in high school broadcasting class.


I honestly think i could make a career off this, i love editing videos,

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9xgar/you_should_stop_participating_in_indeeds_online/,509,The assessments are not great.

two weeks ago i was hired on as a shipper at a local warehouse, there are a number of them around so they sent me off to get trained in another building a city or two over.

i figured it was a bad day but it went on like this for 2 weeks with my trainer steadily growing more and more angry with me but not telling me anything, I had no idea what i was doing to make them upset so in the end i basically just shut down and waited to be told what to do, I did have a moment or two of extreme frustration bordering on anger because I had no idea what i was doing and ever question was answered with something like ""that's just what we do""

the building i was training at no longer wants me to show up for the last two days of training, so im going to the building im supposed to be working in, the problem is word of my negativity and attitude have spread so my reputation is already sullied in my actual work environment.

I got hired two weeks ago as a manager in my new company (one position lower than the general manager). There is one employee in particular (I'll call her RD) who is very harsh and has an attitude problem towards me specifically. Turns out, RD interviewed for my position but didn't get it, and I did. The problem now is that she is VERY obviously bitter towards me for it and she is openly that way in front of other employees and even my boss. 

The problem is that when the previous manager was preparing to leave, she taught RD a lot of her responsibilities. Now RD has taken over and won't let me touch anything or really do anything that is part of my responsibilities. When I answer the phone she will talk in my other ear about how to answer a question I've been asked like I have no idea what I'm doing. When a client comes in to talk to me, she INTERRUPTS me while I am talking to them to answer herself. It's very rude and is obviously awkward for me and the client. 

I've talked with my boss (who I'll call GM) about it and long story short, he told me that it is going to be an uphill battle for me because she is still bitter about the position. He told me that if I feel the need to talk to her, to talk to her. GM told me that he will try to let us figure it out between ourselves, but if it becomes a real issue he will step in. He also made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk about it or need advice I can ask. 

GM also made it clear that RD has had issues with the manager before me, GM himself, and even other office staff. He even told me that I'm ""going to make her mad no matter what. That's just how RD is"".  He also said that he doesn't trust her at all with anything personal and that if she walked out tomorrow, we would be okay because her job is just an unnecessary extension of my own. 

RD even admitted to me that she is ""a control freak and has to do things herself"" and that she had a ""tough childhood and that's why she is the way she is"" neither of which are excuses to treat anyone, let alone your boss, the way she treats me. 

I had the opportunity to talk with the girl who had my position before me and she made it very clear that my boss wanted ME for the position and that I need to establish my position with RD quickly. My latest experience with her happened today when I told her that she doesn't need to worry about what I'm doing because I can manage on my own (this is my second week on the job), to which she never made eye contact and responded with ""well I just need things done right"" gave me a slight look, and turned around and walked away. Which leads me to my main question that I really need advice for...

I have never been a manager before, and I'm even amazed that I got this job because I had zero experience in this particular field when I applied. So how the heck am I supposed to handle this situation? I have accepted that I will not be her friend, which I am 100% okay with because she is not a kind person, but how do I go about this in a professional manner? I need her to understand that even though I am newer than her (she only started 3 months ago) I am still her boss and she needs to respect that. And how do I reclaim my responsibilities that she jumped on to take over? 

TLDR; Started a management position and an employee that also applied for the job is bitter that I got it over her.

My advice is to accept you won’t know everything and just do what you can. Don’t let people walk on you - speaking from experience the industry is full of bullies who prey on the weak.
If you want to avoid another toxic workplace, you may want to explore opportunities with larger consultancies with well established systems and HR protocol where It’s less likely a sociopathic manager will get away with bullying and harassment.

So I just finished my 2nd year as a civil engineer, and haven't gotten a coop work term yet. I applied to about 80 jobs but only got 5 interviews, and no offers. Getting no offers really sucks. It seems like my confidence lowers everytime after an interview. One interview that hit my confidence was an interview with the city of Edmonton. They were looking for 2 students and interviewed 3 people (including me), and I still didnt get the job. It really sucks.


I've been going to my university job office for resume/interview help, but still had no luck. Even before going for help, I realize the biggest weakness I have compared to other students is my lack of work experience (ie. I have no work experience at all). I thought that grades were everything and dint focus on getting any experience. And it's a mistake in my part, and probably should have tried to look for jobs during highschool, but no point in regretting in the past. 


With my lack of work experience, I have been volunteering and joined an engineering club to compensate for the lack of experience. With those, I gained amazing memories, but it still doesnt feel the same as getting a work term. 


I feel like a part of not getting interviews is my interviewing skills. I generally don't have very good experience with talking to people, but I felt that most of my interviews felt really good (only 1 interview felt unprepared). But I guess that wasn't the case since I'm still looking for jobs. 


Since the first work term started today, they waived my first work term since they saw I was actually applying to jobs/put some effort into looking for jobs. However, if I don't get a job in my next work term, I'll be dropped out of coop. Furthermore, the experience I hear from my friends about their first day, makes me really depressed since I cant partake in the same experience.  Also since about 90-95% of civil students got a job makes me even more depressed about it.


Being dropped out would kill me inside. I worked so hard during my first year since I needed a higher GPA to apply for coop, but I feel like that was just a waste if I end up being dropped out. In addition, if I don't get a job for my coop, what are the chances that I get a job after I graduate? Thoughts like this scare me. 


At this point, I kinda accepted the fact that I'll be dropped out of coop, but the future terrifies me. I basically don't see a future in what I do right now

Hope all is well with you in this uncertain times.

**Context:**

I received an e-mail on last Friday (8 May) by a recruiter from the retail fashion division of a big company in my country.

They have several business areas, and I applied to opportunities in the food retail division (supply chain and logistics), and by that contact, the recruiter from the other fashion division said in the email that wanted to call me soon, to know my interests and motivations, if it made sense.

As soon as I read the email (end of the day in friday 2hours later), I sent a response thanking for the contact and showing availability to talk about that, and if preferable for them, i was available to arrange a given time to expect a call!

I didnt receive till now a response from the recruiter and at this point I don't know what to do. I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.

**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...

I would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.

If I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?

I'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.

Of course now it doesn't matter since my friends who were once saddled in debt now have MAs, some PhD and have established a career path.  

There is one route which they back, that's me completing a PGCE to obtain Qualified Teacher Status so I can be a state school teacher. Everything else is just ""but the debt Xemnas"" and I...frankly don't have a very strong sense of self to oppose them. If they treat me as if I can't handle the loan then, maybe I can't :/

2381,7qu3b2,False,Training,129,Is the Skills Gap a Myth?,jobs,"A recent SHRM article, written by a professor in the field, argues that [“The Skills Gap is a Myth”](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/1217/pages/the-skills-gap-is-a-myth.aspx).


His arguments confronts the claims that U.S. businesses are having a tough time finding and hiring qualified people because of factors like universities inadequately training recent graduates for the workforce.  He responded that such claims are exaggerated because employers, that used to provide training to new employees (especially in entry-level positions), have been cutting training budgets and are expecting new candidates to come in already trained for the tasks specific to their roles.  This was especially common during the recession when there was a surplus of seasoned employees competing for entry-level jobs.


 As a result, these entry-level positions, that used to serve as starting points in a career for recent graduates, now require multiple years of experience.


The author argues that universities training students for specific job roles is incredibly inefficient because of the rapidly changing demands for different skills in the job market:
>One problem with trying to get our educational institutions to produce the students employers want is that there is no guarantee that anyone will hire them when they graduate. Telling young people to major in, say, petroleum engineering, which was among the hottest jobs this decade, turned out to be bad advice when demand fell off. It’s also incredibly inefficient to try to learn work-based skills in a classroom setting.

656,fc7l6i,False,Unemployment,9,"(23m) Communication graduate, four years unemployed.",jobs,"Get all the jokes out of the way early, I know my degree means fluff.

Now to specifics. I'm in my fourth year of no full-time work. Over the years I have honed my applications, resume and interview tactics to a fine art - the problem is, everything comes up green except the actual job. It started with a marketing position at the head office of the company I currently work for (casual). After taking me under their wing, the state manager pretty much guaranteed me the job (""apply for this and you'll get it""), and then right through the interview process was ""your resume is outstanding"".

I didn't get the job.

So I didn't give up. I kept applying through tonnes of rejections, until I conveniently found another job at my current company. Again made it right through to second place, being told everything was perfect, even when I asked for feedback.

I didn't get the job.

I then found a startup company, who loved me. They even said they went out of their way for a second interview because I was exactly the candidate they were looking for. They excitedly told me they'd be in touch until I received a phone call in a regretful tone from the hiring manager.

I didn't get the job.

I turned to free internships and free labour as a means of getting my foot in the door. The companies used my ideas I pitched to them and gave other individuals the actual internship (this one especially stung as my ideas were splashed all over their websites).

Today I just scored a second interview with a new job, and was praised for my ""entrepreneur attitude"". The problem is I'm worried history is just going to repeat itself a fourth time. I get it, that's the job life, but four years unemployed is not normal for even my unluckiest of friends.

**The Problem**

I feel like it's a literal impossibility to me to get a full time job now. Over the past four months I've submitted easily 80+ applications and tonnes of internship enquiries. Either they are ignored, rejected or lead nowhere. I can't even find opportunities to gain experience as they're either targeted at uni students or any mentioned as any demographic but me (white, straight male which has disqualified me from several internship opportunities).

I can't afford to go back and study as I can't even pay off my current uni degree loans. Worst of all my casual job has started removing shifts so I may as well be unemployed now. What do I do? Where do I look and how do I keep up hope?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fc7l6i/23m_communication_graduate_four_years_unemployed/,13,"First of all: I'm sorry to read that you've had such bad luck on the job hunt. I know that is really disheartening, because I went through the same thing 5 years ago. I didn't really know how the game worked, back then. But I do now.

So the good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve your chances!

You mentioned that you've applied to 80+ opportunities. This tells me that you're using some standardized process for your applications. You're basically submitting the same resume and a slightly altered cover letter in each, right?

Thing is: if you submit standardized job applications, you're likely to get standardized rejection emails.

As any good communicator knows, you need to tailor your message to your audience.

So the trick is **pick way fewer opportunities** and go all in on those.

So go find a company you would really love to work for and do your research. What do they do, exactly, and how could you, bringing your skills, add value to this company?

I'm sure you can think of something, since you mentioned that you pitched ideas to the companies and that they even ended up using them! I'm sure that really stings. But the harsh reality here is that your ideas were good, but the company just didn't trust you to execute on them.

And that's a problem.

Because, as any startup investor will tell you: ideas are cheap. In the end, it's all about the execution. An investor will sooner invest in a great team with a mediocre idea, than in a questionable team with a great idea.

So you need to make sure the company believes you can execute.

Solution:

**Turn a 'we should' into an 'I did'****.**

For example, instead of saying that the company could improve its copy on the landing page to tailor it more to audience XYZ (cheap idea), go ahead and actually rewrite that copy and submit it with your application!

Another example: instead of saying that the company could improve its marketing by increasing its presence on social media, go ahead and actually create a week's worth of social media content for them!

Not only will this allow you to show off your skills, but it will prove that you can do the job before you even have it!

There is no better signal you can give a potential employer.

Finally: **show genuine excitement** for the job in your application.

A standard cover letter is a terrible medium to express excitement. It's frankly plain dull, impersonal and boring.

Remember that you're marketing yourself!

Would you ever choose a ""dear sir/madam"" letter to market anything else?

Probably not.

Making a video cover letter (like with [crash.co](https://crash.co)) will really help you to express your genuine enthusiasm, as well as your communication skills and willingness to go the extra mile.

1786,gfztdd,False,Recruiters,0,What is working for Hermes actually like?,jobs,"Hi guys,

I live in West Wales and am 20 years of age. I am fully aware that business insurance will be a LOT higher for me until I reach 21 years of age but that's why I'm preparing now as that's in around 4 months time. I am really passionate about driving and am looking to hopefully do something in delivery, but need to be earning a sustainable amount of money. I applied for Hermes once and got a call asking for further details but I never got back to them after doing the sums, it was truly awful. I don't know if it's like this everywhere but based on what I've heard, this is what I can approximate.

Income:

50p per parcel (assume 100 parcels per day, 12 parcels an hour approx means 5 minutes between deliveries, seems about right). That's £50 in income, or a gross rate of £6.25/hr.

Outgoings:

Assume the cost of running a car is 35p a mile. With business insurance, that is roughly what it would be I'd imagine. Where I live, as things are pretty far away from each other (quite rural). I would assume that over 8 hours of driving I'd cover around 150 miles a day, which would mean an average speed of 19mph which seems about right given my experience of driving where I live.

So, 150 miles at 30p per mile, is £45

Total income for 8 hours work = (£50-45) = £5 or... 63p per hour.

I have heard of Hermes SE+, which supposedly you trade in some of your per package income for a stable pay rate. Does that sound any better or does anyone have experience with it? If the income is so bad as I have calculated, why am I still getting deliveries via a hermes courier?

For all candidates I scan their resume and look at their LinkedIN profile.  Assuming I see enough of interest I take the following actions.

For internal candidates, I email their boss to confirm they are available for release as well as ask for general feedback on their performance.  Assuming I don't know the candidate I also check with any people I know in their department or shared contacts on LinkedIN.

For external candidates, if we share a contact on LinkedIN I call them.  I do refrain if the shared contact is at the same company as the candidate.

For all the candidates that pass this initial screen I send a short email.  It has the position title in the header and reads.

>Hi xxxx,
 
>I am the hiring manage for this position and would like to schedule an initial half hour phone interview with you.  Please share 4-5 30 minute time blocks that meet your schedule.

Tip #1, even if you have carpet bombed your applications don't respond hey thats great can you send me the job description.  You have the title, and the company I work for.  I expect you to be able to put 2+2 together to know which job I'm wanting to talk to you about.

However since I am having trouble filling this role due to its niche nature I gave the benefit of the doubt.  I sent a meeting invite with a time and date that matched the selection provided and worked for me.  I also included the description in the meeting invite.

Tip #2, don't respond to the meeting invite with thanks, when do you want to meet.  The time and date are in the header.  Most email systems, especially gmail, not only recognize the time and date they provide a nice little button that allows you to accept or decline.

I've had two interactions with this candidate and in both cases they have either demonstrated ineptness or laziness.  Those are not good qualities and frankly I don't have the time or bandwidth to micromanage.

So, I have 4 employees right now. Had 5, but one left already due to the employees having near-daily arguments.

I leave them alone for one minute and they start fighting. I don’t have the ability to constantly watch them, or anyone else I would trust to do so. 

We already had a two-hour long discussion on it, which helped for one day. Great waste of time when we’re already weeks behind schedule.

- I cant drive/never learned how, so I have issues with reliable transportation in that area or able to have the ability to snatch a job that requires driving
- I have month to over a year gaps in job consistency and even when I did have a job, I’d have to quit due to unreliable transportation/sudden city to city moving and also would get fired for lack of performance under high stress(so unstable with lasting jobs)

-Job areas ive applied for(retail, fast food, cafes, restaurants, shoe/book/clothing stores/shops, grocery stores, pharmaceutical based, hair places;think sallys, at malls, movies, post offices, etc)
- I live in a college area and not out in the city so most jobs are taken by either those in college or those who have a lot of stable job experiences 
- Ive sent out emails, called places back(to be told they aren’t hiring even when their stores have a hiring now poster up), re-applied to jobs(well over 30), applied both with and without resumes, etc and all of them keep telling me they found better matches or aren’t hiring


I really do need some sort of good advice here because I’ve been unemployed for a year and need just general help since I’m at a loss with knowing what I can do",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eyrkok/what_can_i_do_about_my_current_situation/,1,"Let me preface this advice by saying that it is my sincere belief that people born after 1990 just really don't understand how powerful the internet is because you've had it your entire lives and just completely take it for granted.

Those of us over the age of 40 grew up in the Industrial Age and as such, we have modeled our Socio-Economic-Political Structure based on the Industrial Age.  Go out, get a job, punch a clock, work in a factory or company, etc etc is all ingrained in our society.  

However, we are now in the information age.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the Industrial Age is still with us and many people, like yourself, are guided by that inertia.

Don't be.

Learn how to make money using the internet.  Notice I said ""learn"".  Every day as a society we spend billions of hours on the internet doing ""Stuff"".  What you need to do is you need to find a way to provide a service for people that use the internet.  What exactly? I have no effing idea.  All I know is that the internet is a giant sandbox with billions of kids playing every day.  There is an infinite market that you have access to.    


What can you do?  Learn how to code, learn how to do Graphic Design, Learn how to do Video Editing,  Learn Social Media, learn about Bitcoin, become an expert at some ""part"" of the internet and then provide some sort of service for people who use the internet.

Maybe you help old people and/or Mom and Pop businesses develop social media profiles, maybe you figure out how to become a virtual assistant and offer your services to affluent types, maybe you build a website selling widgets, maybe you figure out ""something"" that people on the internet can use and you code an app for it....

Here is my advice.  

Watch at least 3 seasons of Shark Tank (doesn't matter which 3 seasons, just pick three), read some books on Entrepreneurship and starting your own business.  go through youtube and watch a few hundred hours worth of those annoying ""Here is how I make money using the internet"" scam videos that want you to buy their bullshit courses.  Do the above for 6 months like a machine and ""something"" inside your brain will click on how to make money on the internet.

You will start by working like a dog and making peanuts, in fact, your internet hourly  wage will probably start off around 5 cents an hour, that is, you work for 20 hours trying to get clients, sell widgets, etc and out of that 20 hours someone pays you $10 for a widget.  You work the next 20 hours and make $25 which comes out to 12.5 cents an hour.  You work the next 20 hours and make $50, then the next and make $100, then the next and make $150, then the next and make $400....   By the end of the year, you've figured some stuff out and now are making more than minumum wage on the internet.  By the end of the next year, you have learned even more and are now making $20/hr... by the end of the next year you are making $100/hr....

You have to learn to hunt and gather for yourself.  We are in the information age, stop trying to live by the old rules and paradigm of the Industrial age.  Educate yourself with the internet.  Yes, it will be tough, yes, it will take a lot of hard work, yes you will have to actually study and read and write shit down and learn how to code and use programs from scratch...  but long term, this is your best path.  It is not easy, it will take you a couple of years, but man, longterm it will be worth it.

Another thing that can help is to partner with someone who is in a similar boat as you are in.  You guys decide to form H&F Online Consultants.  H&F stands for Hustle and Flow.  I don't mean hustle in the bad sense, I mean hustle in the Entrepreneurial sense.  You guys help each other learn, motivate each other, spend every day looking at the internet thinking ""how can we scrape some cheddar off of the mountain of cheese in front of us...""  

You grind everyday with the mentality that you are gonna make money doing ""something"".  You are going to find a need, a niche, an edge that you can exploit.  

that is my advice.  We are in the information age.  The era of working for others hoping they dole out a salary for you is yesterday's model.  Sure, it will work for most but it is no longer ideal.  There is a sea of money out there on the internet right now, you only need a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction to thrive.  Figure out how to get that fraction, learn to carve your own niche.

My name is Phil and I have been a retail worker for a big company for the last 6 months. I am paid the minimum amount and working full time. I never really asked any questions because I am not very experienced with working yet (I am 19). People tell me I am good at my job, one of the best where I work and I'm glad. 

However, my new colleague told me that I am severly underpaid for the amount of work I do in the store. Basically I do most of the stuff myself and my other coworkers don't take the job seriously, using their phones while supposed to be working. My manager is always looking for new people to replace them, but very few people want to work there and my coworkers are using this at their advantage. I think am someone who is very loyal, which is why I didn't look for something else all that time. 

I am starting to slowly hate my job here because I do a lot alone. I hate the fact that other coworkers are paid way more than I am while doing almost nothing. I work 40 hours a week at 12$ an hour. 

With Black Friday and the Holidays coming up, I would feel bad quitting and I don't think it would be good for any future job, but showing up every morning and doing the job that wasn't done while I was gone is excruciating.

Do you guys have any advice? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9zes6t/im_feel_like_im_underpaid_and_the_only_one_who/,182,"Loyalty to large companies is ill placed.

Loyalty is earned my friend. If a company or small business treats you well, Pays you what you are worth and makes an effort to make their employees lives even a little bit better then you can place your loyalty not in the company but in those around you. If your boss is a great guy, Gives you all the opportunity he can provide, Understands day to day problems that sometimes require absence from work and so on. Then you can place your loyalty in him.

&#x200B;

Companies are not built for employees happiness. They are built to exploit people for profit. This model has worked well over time but at the cost of quality of life.

Being so young I would give this advice I give every youngster. Speaking from experience. I hate my work life and am actively trying to replace it. I just wish i realised all these things sooner.

* If you working harder than what you are being paid for. You are losing money.
* If you feel like you are being exploited then you probably are.
* Working harder than those around you won't do you many favours in the long run.
* Work requiring low skill or just an able body is never rewarded well.
* Loyalty placed in companies is misplaced
* If there is little room to move up the chain, Don't exert more energy than needed.
* You will always hate your job after a while and dread coming into work.
* Use your free time wisely, Don't waste your youth working 40 hour weeks for little reward
* Retail is a horrible industry
* Ask for a pay rise when you want it. Don't be a pushover, More money does not come without asking.
* Working diligently to make someone else more money that they pay you is an exercise in futility and should be limited.
* Look at starting a business.
* Picking a career immediately puts a hard cap on your potential earnings. You will only ever be paid so much.
* Business has a no real cap on potential earnings.
* Depending on your personality type you may find structured organisations relentless and disheartening.
* Anyone who tells you they enjoy their job and isn't a marine biologist or doing some other cool shit is lying to you and themselves.
* There are better jobs out there. None of witch will fulfil you, most of them are horrible grinds design to squeeze the life out of you.
* Don't take your boss to seriously.

Advice from an IT manager. But I am also a fucking retard. You will encounter people like me often.

I have interviewed kids for service desk and dev ops roles, I can see they are eager and keen, It breaks my heart when after hiring one they become a drone right in front of my eyes.

Start a business mate, Don't end up like the rest of us.

If someone says they like their mediocre job. They are lying and want you to experience the same pain they are.

Did I forget to mention, the higher you are paid the worse life gets and the less time you have? This is the rule for employment, There are exceptions but you are not likely to be one of them. Higher pay does not mean better quality of life. I know from experience. Being on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week is not worth the money.

It's been the best job of my life so far, however it was anounced in April this year that the UK side of the business hasn't been profitable in a long time, and the company needed to make 350 redundancies in total this year. and they also had to make 150 redundancies last year.

&#x200B;

I work in the IT department doing 2nd line tech support. We were told by our boss after the original anouncement that these redundancies wouldn't affect us as we were needed so much, so I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing. last week it was anounced that the 1st line team (4 people in total) is being made redundant and their job is being moved to one of our offices in Poland, and now I can't help but feel like the 2nd line team (3 people in total) is next.

&#x200B;

I'm hesitant to just leave. I've had a lot of family issues recently (my dad was diagnosed with Brain cancer last November 2018 and died in February 2019) and my boss as the time was incredible to me. He gave me so much time to take my dad to appointments and sort out what I needed to sort out at home, and also gave me so much time to recover after he passed. He was always calling me outside of work to see if I was okay and if there was anything i needed and just being a generally great guy, so I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I feel like I owe him a huge debt. since then though, he was promoted in January/February 2019 and I've had 2 different managers since then, so everything seems all over the place and I don't know exactly what to do.

&#x200B;

My main question though.. should I ride it out for the redundancy pay and get a new job afterwards, or should i start looking now and abandon ship? I've never been in a position where I'll be made redundant before, so I'm not sure what happens in that situation. I believe I get 1 months salary for every year of service, so it wouldn't be a lot in redundancy pay. I've never had issues getting employment though. I was a contractor for a long time, and the longest I've ever been out of work was 4 weeks.

Of course if your guest blog posts match up if the interests of the companies you're applying for, that's even better. 

I think what really stands out is to make sure your writing samples are technically sound and you at least have a good vocabulary.

The other thing is that out of an 8 hour day, I'm only paid for 4 of those hours. The pay is okay enough to make up for it, but I'd be paid based on performance; which apparently means I could make anywhere from $600 to $1200 a week, which seems strange.

The last thing is just how unconventional the company seems; in the interview, I was told I would be making six-figures if I stuck around for a year or two (huh??) and the company has apparently grown from 1 to 20 offices in two years of existence.

Now, I admit that some of those things you mentioned would annoy me also, but I certainly wouldn't use those criteria to assess potential candidates. So maybe you can clear up a few things here:

1. I see that you'll look at Facebook profiles as well.

This sounds like a form of impression management, the dangers of which I am sure you are familiar with. Perhaps you can further explain how these trivial physical behaviors can account for variances in job performance/satisfaction/needs of the organization?

3. If the purpose of the job fair is to connect potential applicants with the organization, and for the organization to show a presence for applicants to consider, why is there such a strict list of criteria on whether or not they are *allowed* to further explore the company with us? From the way it was written, it sounds like we all have a checklist to mark off when someone comes to talk to us; and if they don't meet enough of our criteria, they can't work at the company.

For an *entry* level position, you aren't really gonna be the main photographer/editor anyway.

Same goes for things like customer service or marketing. All these entry level jobs are asking for one year of experience, would it be okay to just apply? Some of the other jobs I'm looking at is stuff like social media manager and they just want you to post on IG, YouTube, Facebook etc. I'm a millennial, that's easy, I post on social media all the time. But would that count as marketing experience? Like I know what they're asking for (Post a photo to Instagram and say ""Look at this product, buy it because of X Y and Z!"" or upload a YouTube video of a product).

I've been yelled at and threatened.  I've only been given a few assignments since starting.  Got the job through a friend after taking some classes and obtaining certificates.

Boss calls me into the office for a review.  Very much a ""no beating around the bush"" sorta guy.  Tells me I need to grow a backbone.  To be honest, he's right.  I am awful at dealing with confrontation.  You wouldn't guess it by looking at me, but when people start becoming aggressive with me, I tend to lose focus which exposes my lack of experience.  I've been in the customer service industry for so long that my automatic response is to calm the situation by trying to appease the aggressor in any way possible.

First of all, I definitely understand the struggle as I did not find it easy either and like you, I volunteered at several places and I stuggled securing interviews.

Now, there are few things you might be doing wrong. 


1. NHS vs Private
Searching through Indeed tells me you've mainly looked for private jobs, but most clinics want to hire someone with at least 2 years of experience. This might sound like the easier option but I'd suggest mostly focusing on securing and NHS post first to gain some experience and quality 
training.


2. UP THAT SUPPORTING STATEMENT!! 
This is the one element I found made all the difference for me - this is what secures you an interview. A lot of people don't want to feel like bragging and they might overlook things that would sell you to the interviewer because you've assumed they are normal (Such as managing your independent ward etc). They often are not. You did amazingly well on your last placement? Let them know! You had a really niche research done at uni? Let them know why you chose it - it tells them you're passionate about the profession!
Don't be shy in using words like ""outstanding"" and ""excellent"" in relation to the quality of your work. If you don't convince them you're the best possible asset to them, then someone else will. Recruiters will also think ""if they are so insecure about their skills, then why would we be""?
Also, ask a friend to look at it, even if they aren't PT. After my boyfriend (studying 3d animation) helped me tighten my SS , I got asked for 5 interviews of the 7 jobs I applied for.


3. Have patience. 
It's easy to get discouraged after you don't hear back. Persist and work on your application.

Good luck! ",2019-01-22 20:28:08

\*How can I ensure that I can get a stable job when I graduate? Should I get a master's degree after I graduate? or I should serve for government jobs to repay for my scholarship (like DOST).

\*What course should I take if I want to pursue to be a Wildlife Biologist or Animal Rehabilitator? Should I take BS Bio or BS Forestry? or should I take other courses?

\*What school really does focuses on these aspects? Should I take a famous and well-known school?

\*How many years can it take to have a stable career? What is the estimated income of these jobs?

\*They said that if I study this track, I might end up being a teacher because my ideal career is not having a major impact on our country. Am I really going to be a teacher?

\*Lastly, should I take other courses first and find a temporary job to earn money to study these courses?

Here's are some input. 

Fore most, a bachelor in biology, biochem, or chemistry isnt really enough to get the good salary because your competion are those with master and doctor degree. U will most likely need to pursue a master or doctor if u want a good salary. Also a good salary vary...

As for school, it only matter if u looking foward toward a concentration or career. What do i mean by this? Most of the classes of biology are the same regardless where u go, however some schools offer concentrations other university may not. For example, in california; the univeristy in the bay have marine biology as a concentration while those in the central valley dont. Some university offer wild life biology as a concentration and some dont. Some university focus more on medicine sides of biology. Biology is so broad especially at an undergrad level.

When pursing your undergrad, talk to your professors especially the one who focus in your concentration. Get to know them and ask them how u can help on their researchs. For example, when i was taking my pre req for biology, i joined a field biology club and talk to the professor. He offer me a part time position to help with data entry regard to species phenotypes. This experience allow to understand how field biology was different than lab work.

The science u will need to know are physics, chemistry, and biology. The program will teach u and discipline u so dont worry about it for now.

If u go toward biology or any science major, i really really recommend getting a master or doctor afterward.But for me, i got what i needed and took my analaytical skills to run a business because that where my passion align.

I truly recommend majoring in biology, it's an amazing journey and u will learn so much about the natural world. If u have more question feel free to dm me. there's alot more but i cant cover it in one go. ",2020-04-03 16:20:04

259,93frua,False,Discipline,380,A good employee is a no-show and won't answer her phone. What should I do?,jobs,"I'm a manager of a  small business, a store. We are a little short staffed. Last night, I was called in on my only day off (I hate that, sorry.)  because one of my employees was a no-show. We have a process where if there's no call/no show they get written up and potentially fired. It's a few steps. ( still, we're an At will State and it's in the policy so if corporate decides to, yikes.)

I'm worried. She's one of my best employees. She always is on time, does a good job. I recently gave her a raise and she was excited about that. I worked on Sunday and she switched shifts with me. She said ""Hey, I'll see you tomorrow!"" But then, didn't show up. It's really uncharacteristic. My employee who was working the morning shift texted her, called her and informed me her line had been disconnected. So I tried calling and texting; also disconnected. I emailed her, no response. She has a few longer shifts on Sat/Sun and I'm nervous about it. She hasn't reached out to me at all.

What if something bad happened? How do I approach this? I've had employees skip out but it was usually just because they were being irresponsible, as I said. I just don't want to overstep my boundaries as boss but I'm worried she's hurt or something. What do you think?

Edit: Okay, I called non-emergency and requested a welfare check on her. I hope she's okay and that this is all for nothing. I'll update if anything comes of it.

Edit: I should probably mention she recently broke up with her boyfriend and she told me he was mad about it so that's another factor.

UPDATE: I got home from work. The police haven’t called me back. There’s a staff member at the shop, I told him to stay vigilant. He’s aware of the situation and is just as worried. I looked her up on Facebook and found her profile. It hasn’t been active for months but I still sent a message. Turns out, she lives in a shady part of town. Nothing to report from driving by. It’s like she’s just a ghost. I’m preparing to deal with the possibility that I won’t hear from her again. I have no idea how I’m going to deal with covering her shifts cause I’m on almost 8 days straight of working. Stressed. Some of you have suggested maybe she just skipped town. Seems unlikely but if her boyfriend situation was really bad... who knows? I’m wondering if the police checked on her and it was fine and they just didn’t tell me? Either way, I’m going to reach out to them and try to get an update tomorrow. If she turns up Friday to her shift I’ll be floored and relieved. If she did this just because she “felt like it” I’m going to be disappointed. I doubt it though, she cares.  Thank you for the support guys, I appreciate it. And your kind words. Either way I’m probably going to be hiring.

\---

**FINAL UPDATE:** She got back to me this morning on Facebook and quit over text. She waited until Friday to contact me. Why? Because I called for a Welfare check.  She didn't give me a reason why she skipped work, cut all contact and ghosted me and our staff. But she was mad I sent the cops to do a Welfare check. The police must have done a check and it was fine so they didn't bother calling me back. 

 I woke up to this from her*:*

I'm not sure how this is logical, but I guess I don't know her private life. I don't think you can get evicted for a welfare check. Unless she's doing something illegal?  I politely explained that I was worried about her because it was completely out of character for her to be irresponsible. Also, the break up. She was silent for five days. She's was a valuable asset for our store and I'd just given her a raise?  I doubt I'll get a response. I'm a little upset that she doesn't understand why suddenly disappearing would alarm me, the staff. I'm floored. She was with us for three months. Regardless, I hope she does okay out there and I'm happy she is safe and well. At least this didn't end with someone dying, right? I'm disappointed but relieved.

Sure I could easily get hired at Macy’s doing the same thing but I don’t care if someone buys a new shirt or not, for Best Buy I don’t care if anyone buys another TV just because a new model came out that is 4% better than the one they bought last year.

So I'm basically just before entering university and have no clue what I want to do...

I asked myself sometimes what I want to do for a living and well, the answer is always the same, nothing. 

I considered various careers; law, veterinary, economics, translation... But I just can't imagine doing any. All of them sound interesting but I just quickly lose interest in things. That's the reason for my regular grades too. I often find something we learn at school interesting, but after half an hour or less I lose interest, that line crossed, I start procrastinating and just can't focus.

Anyway, despite those impediments, there are some things I do like. I have a flair for language (not sure if I used the right idiom, I just learn languages pretty fast). I currently speak 3 languages fluently (English, Spanish, and German.) I understand some French but dropped it (May continue later) and I'd like to pick up 2 new ones (2 out of Japanese, Chinese, and Russian). I am furthermore studying a bit of Greek and Latin (In order to improve my general culture besides having a genuine interest in those cultures). Other than languages I am a bit curious about economics and entrepreneurship.

So I used to procrastinate the urge of finding a job I want to do for a living with the thought that I'd have no problem finding a job being polylingual, that thought got enhanced by some people in my environment. But as there are only 2 months left to decide what career to start I pushed myself to research a bit and write this post. 

Now straight to the point, does someone know a job I could like? or am I a hopeless case and should straight-up work on my mentality?

I also hyperlink where I think the HR employee would copy/paste into Google. The fields usually are the name (link it to their LinkedIn), companies (to their websites), and awards (their websites). I also hide the hyperlink (the underlined blue) so to not ruin the design.

Due to class this semester I was only working 8 hours a week. It wasn’t until March 23rd that I was told not to come in due to the lack of work. Understandable. At the end of it, I personally wanted to quit and move on to a graphic design position at an advertising agency. I never wanted to go down like this on these terms (uncontrollable situation, I know).

I filed for unemployment recently due to my busy schedule and have been getting money that way. I texted one of my coworkers who is one of the higher-ups I guess you could say and engages in what is called a manager’s meeting. Thursday I had asked when there is an expected due date for return. He said the following:


“We have no date in mind.  There just is not enough work. I would try to find something else.”

With that being said, I said thank you for the update. I haven’t given it much thought up until now. I plan on talking to my other coworker to see if I can get some other insight but it’s late so it’ll be pushed till some time tomorrow possibly. She is still working as a digital press operator except she is full time/has kids/etc. So I can understand why she still has her job but I don’t technically.

Hey guys! So ever since I graduated college, I've wanted to move to a state that has plenty of nature, cooler climate, and outdoor activities. I am big into hiking, climbing and all that jazz. Living out here in Houston, I feel like I get none of that. So for the past 4 years, I have been working really hard in my current company (i work in finance). I have pretty much mastered SQL and a bunch of other analytic tools that seem to make me standout in my field. I took a stab at applying to a few companies out of state and it seems to be working. I have been getting interviews and even got to 3rd round with one company before turning it down due to salary (salary not being on par with the cost of living in that city). So that got me thinking, would this be a good time to relocate? I am pretty comfortable in my current role and I love my co-workers. I make a decent amount and I am living comfortably. However, I don't see myself long term in this company and I have lived in Houston most of my life. I am kind of tired of driving down same street I grew up on and honestly, I just want change. But in current climate, I still haven't found a company I really want to work for, in a state I want. It's probably due to COVID forcing companies to freeze hiring. Even then, would it be smart to relocate for a new company right now? There are talks of a second wave of Covid hitting in fall and with 2020 being already rocky; I am afraid that I might get furloughed once I relocate. So there is already an underlying risk on top of all the stuff that comes with a new company/relocation. What would be your opinion on this?

The job itself isn't overwhelmingly difficult, nor is it very fulfilling. Although it provides me with great financial security, other factors have been building up that have made me resent the job (I'm sure I'm among many in saying this).


The paving company idea came up with a life long friend who is a heavy machine operator and technician, who also shares the passion for wanting to build something of their own. My CPA background to this point is being viewed as a means to an end, and can give us the business/finance/tax benefit of pricing/costing/financing the business and assets we acquire.


Basically what I'm looking for is some starting points to acquire the hands on ability to pave and gain as much knowledge on the field that I can prior to starting the business. My initial considerations are as follows, along with some other important points to note:


1) Ideally structure my departure from work at end of Summer/18 and in a way so that I can receive unemployment


2) Take heavy machine operators course throughout the Winter/18


3) Work in the industry for a local paving company throughout the 2019 season to try and obtain as much hands on knowledge as I can


4) Come up with business model and acquire appropriate assets in offseason Winter 2019. Basic business to start will be paving/sealing/patching driveways, which would limit our initial capital outlay when compared to more commercial paving equipment/staffing requirements


5) From what I have read so far, the general machinery will consist of a single axel dump truck, 1-2 ton rolling machine, small paving machine (or could we get away with shovels/brooms to start), a hauling trailer and other miscellaneous tools i.e. tamper etc.


6) I have accessible capital of about $130,000. My life long friend also has sufficient capital to finance machinery/other start up costs


I know this is very rough, and obviously so much more consideration has to go into this plan. But at the end of the day, I want to do something outside for a living, I am prepared for gruelling work, and I want to build something for myself. I would appreciate any other advice with respect to the career path in general or how to best prepare/educate myself before starting the business.

Sounds like your friend already has the hands on knowledge, or he is at least the one who should gain the additional hands on skills. Your skill sets should be used to make the business run with a long-term profit. 

Start small and keep your job - or maybe find an accounting job that is part-time/flexible. Remember, depending on where you are operating the business, paving can only be completed in a specific temperature range. So, months that are too cold = no paycheck. 

Also, maybe look out for a small paving company with the proper equipment and trained employees that you can buy. Seek one that you can add value too, like advertising, better financing, and by seeking higher margin jobs. 

Lastly, not to be pessimistic, but we have been in a bull market for nearly a decade... the first thing to go in a recession is home building - where a lot of paving is done.  ",2018-06-15 01:41:28
210,h7poht,False,Discipline,2,Life With Company After PIP,jobs,"Note: I also posted this in AskHR but would love to hear other perspectives as well if anyone has gone through something similar. 

I'm located in Maryland; however, my company operates out of Washington DC. Some context but a general question at the bottom.

In late January of this year, I was placed on a 90-day PIP related to project timeliness and communication. At the time, I had been extremely sick for several weeks and had requested time off, which had been denied. I missed a deadline and a few days later was placed on the PIP. At the time, I was convinced it was a cover-their-butt, I'm getting fired move and started looking for new work - although I'd never had a performance issue or negative appraisal in the past, my supervisor and I don't work well together (she's an extreme micromanager and I've tried talking to her about how I perform better when I have some flexibility in process, but this hasn't changed anything except me just needing to adapt. I'm also her only employee, so I have almost no autonomy in my work, which isn't the norm for my position in other departments).

But after 90 days (late April), I ended up passing my PIP and was formally removed from it, with the feedback that I excelled at the goals set and to continue the good work. This was a huge relief - since COVID hit, I hadn't had any luck finding other opportunities.

In late May, our company advertised they were looking to fill about 10 positions from internal applicants for a new department - some would be a promotion, others would be lateral transfers. I've worked well with the hiring manager on other projects in the past and my skills matched really well to what they were looking for, so I applied. The interview with her went well and I was brought in for another meeting about it this week. I was incredibly excited - I love my company but there's no room for growth in my department (my supervisor keeps pushing back her retirement), and I want to be able to stay and grow under a new supervisor so badly.

However, I was told that I wouldn't be transferred or promoted at the meeting. Our HR rep was there, which I thought was strange. The hiring manager asked if I wanted feedback on why I wasn't selected, and I told her yes - that's when the HR rep stated that due to my performance in my current role, it's unlikely that I would be approved any transfers for ""some time,"" and that internal promotions would be ""very unlikely at any point.""

I feel devastated. I understand their hesitancy - on paper, there's no context around what happened earlier this year. But the tone seemed to be that I would never have opportunities internally because of this. I'm curious what bearing successfully completed PIPs have on internal hiring decisions in general, and if I should resume my external job search? Thank you for your time and thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7poht/life_with_company_after_pip/,4,"In Ask HR, someone asked about the circumstances surrounding the illness. I'm more interested in the long-term impacts of the PIP at my current company, but if the info is relevant, here was my response:

I was scheduled to co-present at an international conference. Since mid-month, I'd had what I thought was a really bad cold at the time (I tested negative for the flu so my doctor attributed it to being a cold) and I told my supervisor that I wasn't sure if if was a good idea for me to travel. She told me I needed to ""deal with it"" and that not attending wasn't an option.

The deadline I missed was related to a non-exigent writing project that she assigned me the last day I was there. I fully intended on completing it between sessions, but ended up sleeping longer than expected while laying down to rest. The next day I told her I needed some additional time since I had little energy due to the cold, and she got extremely upset. A few days later the PIP was created.

I'll also add - my condition worsened while I was there, which I told her about as well, but she discouraged me from seeing a doctor and asked me to self-medicate since I needed to be present at each session of the 5-day event (she said something about not letting a cold be an excuse).

It wasn't until mid-March that I realized that I may have had covid-19, but at this point there's no reliable way to test that. ",2020-06-12 17:59:02

Situation:
I work as an engineer in a small development department, up until recently my manager has placed me in a leadership position with talk of increased responsibilities.  I have been running customer teleconferences, driving the largest and most complex project open and have rewritten and redesigned a vast majority of our internal documentation, and trained most of the other employees all within my own drive.

Recently an internal  position for a sub manager was opened.  I applied and didnt get it, which is fine.  Instead  the position was split into two positions, and all of my higher level responsibilities were given to one of the sub managers, including the project I have been driving for two years.  Both hires were from our own small department and had the same title I do. 

My manager has done nothing to create a transition period, given me any feedback of my efforts up to this point, or any reassurance that this isnt a titleless demotion. I just showed up to work and all my usual responsibilities were no longer mine. 

I'm pretty crestfallen.  Leading up to this event has felt like a steady push out of any responsibilities I try for.  I have had meeting requests get denied only to be invited by another employee to the same meeting at the call of my manager, ideas vehemently rejected only to be later dictated out by my manager as his own.  He has a favorite employee with substantially less experience than me that he spends every day talking to about everything in the department.  Even while I was running projects he would never check up on them or talk to me about them.  

TLDR:  
An internal restructure leaves me feeling shafted. How do I interpret these events? Am I just jealous? Am I being a baby about this? Or am I just a victim of shitty management.

I'm at a low point right now.

I have been a very fun-loving and life-affirmative person, but lately the job market does not make it easier to find motivation for cover letters.

I tailor every letter to the position, I research about the company and their values, I adress that and I double check it's the right person etc I am writing to. I went to a training for writing letters and she said I write really nicely (German is my native language). But after rejections and no answers (that is the most annoying part) I have zero confidence and motivation to write another cover letter for an institution that does not care how much effort I put into every application and doesn't even consider me as an applicannt. What should I do? Should I write heartless, standardized cover letters? 

I am applying for jobs that suit my profile (e.g. done internships in that area or wrote a thesis in that field etc), it matches my skills etc. So I don't get what their problem is?

I work for a fast food restaurant and our hours are all managed through an app we are invited to when hired.  The owners have a few stores so they have a big group message feature they supply updates in.  This includes things like new menu items, workplace policies, and in this case responses to the pandemic.

On March 23 we recurved what looked like a copy pasted message from one of the higher ups in the fast food chain. It stated starting on As of that day (3/23) employees will be receiving a 25% pay increase until further notice.  The owner of the store I worked at then sent a follow up message stating it would go into affect 2 days later (3/25) due to when I payroll reset.  

I noticed at first that nothing was changing, but just figured it was taking an extra cycle to come into affect.  I was paid again this morning and once again it didn’t seem to reflect this update.  I went into the app we use and added up the hours for the previous two weeks, the last pay period, and with tax the amount matched the amount I was paid.  That is, without the 25% “hazard pay”. It’s been over a month so I know that it should have come into affect by now.

I’m one of the newer employees, started just over two months ago, and one of the younger ones as well (18).  

I would think the issue isn’t only affecting me, but none have my coworkers have brought anything up or said anything either.

How can I take more ownership of my performance?,jobs,"I started a new job in a corporate office about 4 months ago and have been working in my field for 5-10 years (i.e., not a newbie). My first month here was spent training, and, afterward, the person who trained me has been on a sabbatical for the last 3 months (and will continue to be so for another 2 months), so I've basically been on my own since that time.

My team's work is pretty siloed, and each of us work on our own projects without much overlap. In other words, my teammates aren't very familiar with the technical details of what I work on, although there is some overlap with some of our more general job tasks that everybody on the team is responsible for. My boss says that if I have questions on my projects, they would be the most knowledgeable person to go to. 

Onto my problems. I am basically making mistakes in my work, and, so far, I've always been the last person to complete their work amongst my team, sometimes going a few hours over the deadlines. When I started this job, my boss said they are looking for someone who can work independently. I feel like I can work by myself, but it just takes a very long time for me to find the answers when I look independently. I can go to my boss and ask questions to make things go faster, but I feel like lots of my questions would be very basic things that would make my boss ask, ""The information's right there. Why are you asking me what to do?"" I can work independently, but it just takes me a long time to find the relevant information I need. I also don't want to keep bothering my boss with every, little question I have, and I feel like I have a lot.

I'm also naturally a slow learner and need some hand-holding with new tasks (whereas hand-holding seems to be frowned upon these days). There are still a lot of things I don't know about my projects, lots of what I feel are basic things, like how they work in general. I feel like this is because my trainer didn't have time to train me on everything before they left, and my boss often tells me to just look at previous examples to try and recreate what they did. This leaves lots of gaps in my understanding about my projects since, while I can recreate the work, I don't really understand what I'm doing.


I feel like my boss is now starting to lose confidence in me. They continue to accompany to meetings about my projects and has started leaving me reminders about my job tasks on my calendar. (When I started, my boss told me they don't want to be have to remind or keep track of his team's detailed tasks and wants them to take ownership of their own projects.)

My team had most recently completed our most critical time of the year, and I made my boss stay late at night since I was the last person to finish my work, whereas all my teammates had completed their tasks and left for the day hours before I finished my work. I was finally able to complete my projects a few hours after our deadline, whereas the rest of my team was able to meet theirs.

My work quality was also not good since I was rushing to complete my work, and, sure enough, the next day, another team pointed out errors in my work, ones that I've made before. Once I have a chance to review my work in more detail, I expect to find more errors. My boss did not seem upset at me when the other team pointed out my mistakes, but I think they were starting to get a little irritated.

2258,5m12y4,False,Startups,3,Pressured to sign contract extension (no benefits) instead of promised new contract. Need advice/opinion,jobs,"Hi,


this is a throwaway account due to the fact that my colleagues are heavily using reddit as well.


First of all: I hope this is the right space for this topic and additionally, I currently work in Sweden (originally, I'm from another country). So nevertheless, I still hope for some advice (probably not legal advice due to different laws and so on).


Short intro: I am working for a start-up as an Android developer and I just turned 27. This is not my first job and when I started, I was offered an one-year-contract. It's been a really rough but successful year not only for the company but also for myself. During a feedback meeting a couple of weeks ago (which was also regarding further steps for a new contract) I was overwhelmed by the positivity. My supervisor said that he asked several people in the start-up and continued that 'everybody is really happy to work with' me and 'feeling really confident about' me, and so on, you get the point. Bunch of positive stuff. Nothing negative. When we talked about further steps he said that he promised to give me 'without a doubt' a permanent contract and a raise. (This was actually already mentioned 2 months before that meeting).


(Fyi, in our start-up everybody knows about the salaries of the others and I figured out that I am the lowest payed employee in the engineering part... the next person above me receives around 20,000 USD/year more than me). Of course I should be happy that I have a job and so on. But actually, I don't really earn a lot. I still live in a shared flat and try to save money wherever I can. I actually live like back in university.


Back to the topic: Days after the feedback meeting, my supervisor informed me that plans have changed, also due to the finance department and HR: 
- contract extension for another year 
- same salary 
- no benefits, no bonus, nada, nothing. (Well, apparently it's easier to fire me I figured out while I was reading the info regarding the contract extension.)


I was actually quite shocked and still am. My supervisor then promised me, after I received the contract extension, that I will receive a permanent contract and a raise in a couple of months. Probably by the end of May.


I had a bunch of sleepless nights during the past couple of weeks. I love working for this start-up, I really like my colleagues (there is not a single one I dislike and I am being completely honest here) and I see potential in our product. But right now I don't know what to think. I actually planned this year to move out of the shared flat and find a nice place with my girlfriend, but this won't be possible under such conditions. Also it is quite hard to find a decent place to live at if you don't have a permanent working contract. (90% of the landlords in this area will always take people with a permanent work contract - makes of course sense).


I gave everything during the last year for this start-up. So much stress, unpayed overtime, unpayed work time during weekends, 'work hard & don't party' and also put my health at risk at one point. I feel disappointed in the start-up and partially in my supervisor, because he promised things that he obviously can't keep. And now I feel unsure about accepting the contract extension and wait for a couple of months until I get the, again promised, permanent contract with the raise.
By the way, my contract ends by the end of February, until then I have time to sign the contract extension.


Does anyone of you had similar experience? And if so, how did you handle it or in general, how would you move forward in such a situation?


Thanks so much in advance.


(I hope nobody gets me wrong here, I am really happy to have a steady income. I just have the feeling that my work is not being appreciated, even though there has only been positive feedback).


TL;DR: Supervisor promised 'awesome' contract several times, just made another promise that I will get that 'awesome' contract in a couple of months, instead I get another contract without a raise for a year, feeling 'utilized', not quite sure how to continue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5m12y4/pressured_to_sign_contract_extension_no_benefits/,1,"Well, you have to decide. 

You can call their bluff and say you'll only work for X and be willing to walk away. If they say they are going to give you a raise/new benefit in a couple of months then make them put that in writing.

687,f012z7,False,Unemployment,3,Current job said they will fire me if I don’t improve.,jobs,"Okay, this situation is a little complicated.

TLDR: I’m about to get fired but it seems like a pretty amicable situation and my manger even promised a good review. I could likely collect unemployment. I have interviews lined up and need time off for that but there is no way I could get time approved. Can I just call in sick or will this hurt chances of unemployment / strain the remaining relationship I have with my current job?

————

My current job said they will terminate my employment if I do not improve by February 20th. I am trying my hardest because I always try not to burn bridges, but honestly this is kind of a blessing. I genuinely hate this job, and have already been searching elsewhere for new employment. 

Even if I do improve to their standards by the 20th, they then would want me to come in office which is simply not feasible as I live too far away (I work from home currently). So no matter what this current job is pretty much out the window. I would just leave on my own, but I can’t afford to lose my job without unemployment or another job lined up.

That being said, I have secured quite a few interviews for next week - unfortunately, the interviews are during when I’m supposed to be working my current job. My current job offers no PTO at all and any approved unpaid time off must be scheduled several **months** in advance. 

My main question is: **If I have to take 2 “sick days” in a row for these interviews, will my chances of unemployment be hurt?** I’m not sure what do. I obviously want to attend the interviews no matter what since losing this job is pretty much inevitable and I need to prepare, but I also don’t want to screw up my ability to collect unemployment if the interviews don’t work out. I know if people are obnoxiously late all the time or call in sick too often it can sometimes be considered termination for cause. I have 100% attendance besides this. Is 2 days enough of a cause? The speed of my performance is the reason they are wanting to let me go, but it was nothing that would make me seem completely negligent, just “not a good fit” for the role. I finish at about 80-85% of the speed they’re expecting from me. I don’t think my performance issues count as a cause by themselves. The can fire me for any reason as this is an at-will state, I’m just talking about “causes” in terms of unemployment. 

I’m also scared of going the route of telling my boss that I have interviews lined up and need time off for that. Getting fired is pretty much a guarantee so that isn’t the concern, it’s just that her and I still have a decent connection separate from my performance and she did previously agree to write a good review and a letter of recommendation for any future endeavors. I would hate to burn that too by just bailing, could even hurt my ability to get the jobs I’m interviewing for lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️

I love my workplace but I think they don’t realize my full potential because they know me more as the quiet deaf girl.  

Thing is, I owned my own graphic design business for five years and was really successful in my market.  Managed to get on the first page of google organic search results for my keywords.  I got burnt out with that and sold it after I met my husband.  We’re separated now.  In that ten years I had SSDI approved because of the deafness.  In that ten years I’ve also had a few other diagnosis and was pretty sick, had brain surgery, blah blah.  In any case, I was lucky the place hired me because I needed the work and I can handle the physical aspect for the most part.  They could only give me part time because the day bartender needs to be able to answer the phone.  I can do that now, with specialized equipment.  They’re willing to purchase it.  I don’t really want to work full time there because it’s really boring during the day, pay is tip share and fluctuates so much it’s hard to budget.

In January I reduced my hours for an opportunity to work at home again,  but it didn’t work out.  Boss ghosted me and I haven’t been paid for my work in April, so I’m back at bar with as many hours as they will give me.

Prior to my design business, I worked as an AlohaPOS software (table service and quick service restaurant software) support manager and project manager for five years.  I did pretty much everything including hardware repair, staging, training, installation, network wiring, remote and on site support.  I also trained on the same software for a large corporate rollout.  I set up a company wide oracle CRM which improved our customer service and response/resolution times.

I’ve been looking for Aloha jobs specifically on Indeed and LinkedIn.  Problem is it’s been ten years since I’ve worked with it.  I am also self taught with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, illustrator, Bridge.  

I don’t have a degree, but have about 6 semesters of college credits.  Ideally I’d like a full time job but my resume is really specific.  I’m not sure the best way to go about wording it and I don’t want to sell myself as a general project manager when my projects were purely Aloha based.  

The rest of my experience is in the Restaurant industry as fine dining server, Bartender.  It was the first thing I turned back to when I needed work.  I was lucky they had a place for me considering I couldn’t hear a damn thing.  Now that I can, I’m more confident, etc.

I’ve tried working with Vocational rehab but have gotten no where with them.  I think they’re understaffed so my counselor is serving a very large deaf community in the coastal Virginia area.

1388,1t44tn,False,[advice],6,"Quit job with no backup plan, landed job in less than 3 months - Here's what worked for me",jobs,"(throwaway because there might be identifying stuff on my other account)

I'm a writer in my mid-20s who got involved with a content mill. I've only been out of college for a couple years and this was my first grown-up job. It turned out to be a really toxic environment.

I burnt out in less than a year. I made a big decision to take a leap of faith and quit with nothing lined up, because I knew I didn't have the time or energy at that job to look for new work. I had about 6 months of money saved.

That was only 2.5 months ago. I just got a new professional, full-time job in my field that I actually wanted, with a salary and benefits I'm THRILLED about. 

I know part of the equation is luck, but I wanted to share some thoughts on what I think helped the process be (relatively) quick and easy. Hopefully it will help some of you.

- I DIDN'T apply to every job listing I saw in my field. **Over 2.5 months, I applied to maybe 30 jobs at the most, probably fewer**. Most people go for quantity of applications, but I focused on finding listings that I *really* thought fit my skills and experience and that I had a good chance at. 

- **Every single cover letter I sent was customized**. I started from scratch with each one. Previously, I had used a cover letter that was a form letter, more or less, just inserting the company's name and the position title where appropriate. This method is one reason I didn't send a lot of applications: each one took me a fair amount of time to put together. I would write them with the job description at my side so that I could hit the different points in the ad.

- I do have a relatively strong resume (internship experience, freelancing experience, brief stint in marketing aka the content mill), but **I emphasized qualities that you don't necessarily get from jobs or education**. I focused on the fact that I am a reliable and organized person with strong communication skills, and this was what seemed to resonate with most of the people that called me back, not that fact that I worked at such-and-such place.

- Cover letters had very little to do with my resume. The only references to my resume were contextual - more like, ""I happened to be here when I showed this quality off especially well.""

- In the case of the job I got, **I wrote the reasons I wanted to work at the particular job** (it's an area of interest, I admire [specific thing they do], etc.). Manager seemed impressed and brought it up at the interview.

- **I woke up at 8 every day, but I didn't always work an 8-hour day**. Some days I did job search stuff all day, but others I didn't because there just weren't enough positions I found that I wanted to apply to.  On those days, I worked on freelancing or sending emails to people I'd be interested in working with someday. I went to coffee with mentors, visited friends, worked on getting my life back (I had been really depressed working at the other job). Sometimes I watched puppy videos, because sometimes you just need to veg.

- During the interview at my new job especially, I made a point of making eye contact, smiling and being relaxed. I laughed. I made a couple jokes. I wanted to be at my most personable and make a connection.

- **When addressing why I quit a job after less than a year with no backup** I didn't give any real details. You don't have to, and I clearly blew one interview earlier in this stint of unemployment by letting myself talk too much (it was a PR job and I accidentally, in my rambling, said something about wanting to get away from marketing. The fields are similar. Whoops). I said I wanted to move on to pursue new opportunities, such as something in [area of media this job is in].

- I made sure to give all my references a heads-up, and to choose them carefully. After I was hired, the director told me she was ""floored"" by the references I received. **Make connections with people who will really go to bat for you, and then stay in touch with those people**. I'm sending them all ""thank you"" cards.

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. **If I hadn't stayed in touch and on good terms with my references, I might not have this job. I really felt like the references clinched it for me**. Get coffee with your old professors. Have lunch with your boss. Message your former classmates on Facebook who are in your field and check up on them. People will help you if you reach out.

----

I know this was long, and some of it might seem a bit obvious, but it wasn't all obvious to me the first times I applied for jobs. I was really scared that quitting my other job would doom me to a very lengthy job search, but I ended up feeling completely refreshed and finding a job I actually want to do. I also believe that in my mental state while working at the content mill, I wouldn't have given a very strong interview or had time to write more tailored cover letters.

I hope everyone's job search goes well and that maybe this post will help someone just a little.

For the record, I know quitting a job with no fallback plan is not for everyone and isn't technically a wise decision, but it ended up being the best thing for me in my case.

Basically, we built a front end in excel that is coloured up in company colours, and all the buttons on the GUI are hyperlinked to locations in a file directory. Within each linked file are 3-4 resources. 

1. the training module (i.e. excel sheet with data, explanation on what methodology is used to process that data, and calculation checks)

2. a tutorial video (I used OBS studio - it's free and seems to work well)

3. a notepad file that you add your initials to to check off that you've done it and also checked for errors (essentially acting as like a wiki of sorts)

4. any other relevant content

So, we've built this index, and now we're filling it up with content.

We're also going to record presentations from industry leaders and stuff like that to help pass on knowledge from company and industry veterans.

The idea is we're trying to make records of stuff that is known, and knowledge that has taken years to accumulate, then put it in an easily accessible structure, complete with full walkthroughs on how to actually *do* it.

So, we have, for example, field studies, tests, which generate data, so our breakdown (so far) is something like this:

* geotechnical -> subdirectory: analytics/field work/calculations
  


*geochemical -> lab testing/static/kinetic/field testing

*hydrogeology -> field tests/data handling/GW modelling

Etc. so each sub-directory has a new list, and you just keep drilling down until you find what you're looking for.

Hope that helps - eventually we'll replace the excel/VBA GUI with an actual app. ",2019-02-05 16:49:47

1013,ha4hjc,False,Covid-19,3,Turning down interviews in the time of Covid-19.,jobs,"I lost my previous position because of Covid-19. I'm 1.5 weeks into my job search and I have three interviews thus far out of 36 applications. 

After an HR interview, I determined it's a bad fit. The work isn't interesting, I'd be forced to be at the office for weird hours to try to sync with the Pacific Time Zone despite being in Eastern, and I'd be in an office for no reason since I would not be interacting with anyone there (I asked).

I'm scared to turn it down because well....Covid-19 is making UX jobs harder to get and I'm scared for the second wave making things worse. I plan on working wherever my next role is for two years, which would mean that the recession is likely over, I have enough experience for most UX jobs (4 years plus a master's is enough to get most senior roles), and I could go anywhere I want. 

I am fully aware I might have to suffer for two years, particularly in a location I don't want to be in or a job with boring work. 

My finances are fine; I am moving back with parents and unemployment covers my monthly bills. I am not drawing unemployment yet and the mandate that you have to take the first job offered does not begin until July 31st unless a new bill is passed.

Would I be stupid to turn down interviews based on HR interviews during this time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ha4hjc/turning_down_interviews_in_the_time_of_covid19/,1,"I would suggest taking the interview.  This will give you practice in a ""live"" setting.  Plus this will help get in the grove of answer the common interview questions that you are likely to receive.  Congrats, you made it past round 1.  

Check out my post on common questions during various stages:   [My Experience From Job Hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/) 

A couple of other thoughts that I had:

* You can always take the job, and keep looking for a new place while employed (getting paid and health insurance benefits)
* I know absolutely nothing about UX jobs, but you said they are getting harder to get.  Why pass on an opportunity that has been presented to you?  
* Is it just the hours that is making you not want the job, not interacting with anyone in the office or is it something else?
   * If its just the hours, again not knowing your personal situation, I would not view this as an obstacle.
   * Is it not interacting with anyone in the office:
      * do you want to be in a office talking / working with others?
      * Is it the commute?
      * Is it concerns about the corona virus?
* Is it pay / salary?
   * again, tricky one with high unemployment.  You can always take it, and keep looking for a new gig.  You can explain that you are looking for a new place since it is a shorter commute, better benefits, etc...
* Did you pick up on a possible toxic work environment? Unrealistic workload / time deadlines, etc?
   * This is the trickiest one.  I always advise people to avoid a toxic work environment as it will demotivate you, which then typically leads to the quality of your work slipping.  Not to mention the anguish this can cause mentally on you at work and at home.
      * Just during the time we are in with unemployment around 20%, this makes it harder to just give a blanked statement of pass on this job since its toxic.

I would take the interview.  I would personally during this time, accept the job since you can always keep looking.  You can always explain an extremely short duration at a job by saying:

* Once I got into the position, I realized that the opportunity was not going to be a good fit for me.  The daily responsibilities and hours were different from what I was told that I would be doing during my interview.  The working environment and culture were completely different than what was presented to me during the interview.  I would like to leave it at that to be polite.
   * remember, don't bad mouth a past employer to a future employer.  This response will typically cease all inquiries from HR recruiters since they do not want to push you into bad mouthing an employee or getting into a potential grey area.
   * be prepared though after this response to talk about the hours and culture that you would work best in or are looking to work in

Again, I don't know your personal situation, but I would point out that the Federal Unemployment of $600 ends at the end of July unless it gets extended. ",2020-06-16 13:57:01

PowerPoint slides that they told me the are confidential and that I shouldn’t share them with anyone. I just started at the company, and I’m in an entry level position. 

A few weeks ago, things were very hectic at work and we got a last minute call from the CEO to change the meeting rooms for a planned meeting they would would be presenting at, using the PowerPoint slides they sent me.

The VP of a department at our organisation asked if I could send him the slides to add to the deck, which he (the VP) would also be presenting from his laptop (so I had to send the slides to him).

2486,4anux5,False,Experience,6,How I prepared for my first phone interview,jobs,"Last week I had my first ever phone interview. Luckily, it was a scheduled interview, so I had a couple of days to get prepared and ask my friends about their experience. 


My former classmate, let's call her Julie, had her first phone interview about a month ago, it went well, she got to the next round which was the office interview, but didn't get the job due to lack of experience. (By the way, don't you just love this ""no job - no experience - no job"" vicious cycle?)


Julie told me she was prepared, read about the company, thought the possible questions through, so she was pretty much relaxed when the phone rang.


Now we know that the call went well, but **Julie made some mistakes**:


1) During the interview she was lying on a couch in her pajamas, that's why her voice was too relaxed and later during the office interview the employer said she didn't sound ""really motivated to get the job"".


2) She didn't turn off the Facebook notifications on her phone so during the talk she was distracted by the message sounds a couple times. Also someone tried to call her on Skype.


3) The other thing Julie regretted was that she didn't have all the needed documents handy. When the employer asked if she had any questions about the company, she remembered she had some, but had put aside her notebook and forgot what it was.


So **Julie helped me realize this**:

1) I better wear something formal and sit straight so that my voice sounds interested and serious, not demotivated.

2) I should eliminate all the distractions

3) My resume, my notes and company info should be somewhere near when I get the call.


Another friend of mine Mike said he got a call from a company when he was walking home. The interviewer asked if he was available to talk at that moment and he said 'yes'. Mike later regretted it because half way through the interview he got nervous and couldn't answer the questions properly. So his advice to me was **never agree to have an unscheduled phone interview**. Apologize, say that you're busy and schedule for later. That way you'll get an opportunity to prepare.


I had a couple other friends give me some tips. I've collected all of it here, in an [article](http://www.essaytigers.com/blog/getting-ready-your-first-phone-interview).

Background: I'm 24. I had ***11*** internships. I have an MA and I'm at my first fulltime job. Internships suck, companies are taking advantage of people, etc etc. But we (Gen Y) need to reflect a little on ourselves. This is the kind of thing that bothers me: One girl recently told *[The Week](http://theweek.com/article/index/242065/america-is-raising-a-generation-of-interns)*,  “You either do what you like to do for free or you have an entry-level job for $25,000 where you answer the phone and are someone's assistant.” This kind of attitude is a problem. Internships largely do not lead to a job. According to *[this study](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx),* 

> 63.1 percent of paid interns received at least one job offer. In comparison, only 37 percent of unpaid interns got an offer; that’s not much better than results for those with no internship—35.2 percent received at least one job offer.

As young people, we've been raised on the idea that if we try hard enough, we can do anything. We're tumbling into an internship spiral, and we can't afford it. 

Now our parents would say that we should just create our own businesses. And once again, that's a misunderstanding of our generation. Part of the reason why we go through so many internships is because *we desperately want to be accepted into existing institutions.* We're *scared to death* of entrepreneurship.  But here's the thing: Unless you want to get underpaid for a job you're overqualified for (there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm assuming that you're taking an internship in the hope of getting something better), or want another internship, that is your option.

An internship with the local government until just a week ago, and an internship with a private company that started this Monday. I've applied to hundreds of jobs in my city in Southern California.  Due to my wife's career, I've only been able to apply for jobs here. My internship hosts in the local government wanted to hire me but were unable to. I've gone to networking events, taken extra classes, and cold called several companies in addition to applications. Can anyone please offer advice?

2271,glsc2u,False,Training,13,Am I going to make it in the real world? I keep getting told I'm too slow wherever I go. I got fired from my last job.,jobs,"I'm currently almost 24 years old, and in my senior year of college. I am studying to become a Forensic Biologist. However, it seems that I am slower than the average person during both work and school. I get extended time on tests, because of my Asperger syndrome, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Without it, I'd fail college.

I got my first job when I was 16 washing dishes (2012). On my first day, I felt excruciating back pain. The pain was so intense, that it slowed me down tremendously, and it caused me to get agitated. Because my Autism was more debilitating back then, I wasn't able to properly communicate exactly how much pain I was in. I got a call from my boss telling me not to come back again. I did not attempt to convince him otherwise.

At my second job at Mcdonald's (early 2014-2016), I was initially too slow. When I got assigned breakfast duties for the first time, I initially got sent home twice for being too slow (they told me it was because of high labor). I suspected there was something wrong, and talked to the managers. I eventually did pick up the pace, and I worked there for 2 years. I had to quit, because my mental health got out of control.

At my second job, as a busser a nursing home (2017-2019), I almost got fired, because I got worked up very easily. This is because I was paranoid from my near-firing at Mcdonald's. Two months later, I decided that I wasn't going to care about my work speed. I ended up becoming a very valuable employee. I worked there for 18 months. I left, because I graduated Community College.

I got a job at KFC last summer, but I quit after only 25 days. It was horrifically understaffed, and I was insecure about my speed again. The manager was also a toxic person who didn't know how to run a business. The other employees were also very unprofessional.

Last December, I got a job as a cashier at Speedway. During the summer I had been put on Immediate Release Seroquel to help me sleep. However, all it did was make groggy during the day. I warned my boss on the first day that if I was too tired, I could get off the medicine. I was fired after two days, because my grogginess made me take too long to complete the computer assessments. When she made the decision to fire me, I had not yet interacted with a single customer. She also gave me no hint whatsoever that there was anything wrong with my performance.

This semester, I got reprimanded for taking too long to complete a lab in Organic Chemistry.

QA - Software Quality Assurance

So I am an IT person with 2.5 years of IT support work experience. I pursued a career shift to QA because I wanted that ever since before graduating from college. After six months of being jobless and countless interviews, I finally landed on a junior QA role. I was so happy about landing this job...

...until the training session began.

Basically, the purpose and goal of the training is to learn about three company-specific tools, and the endgame was to develop a working system using these tools. I was motivated at first, until the trainer began to inform us that if we fail the training, they'll have to ""let us go"" (it wasn't his intent to scare us in the first place though).

When I heard that, my motivation...became fear. So I had to learn them all by a bit of ""force."" (I was able to learn the use of these tools properly though)

Our training session only has two weeks overall, I am currently at the last week of my training, and we are now developing the system on our own hands. Most programming languages used in these tools aren't thoroughly discussed, and we had to use Google to even begin studying for it. In the first place, developing a system from scratch wasn't my forte, so I experienced so many difficulties coming from here and there, to the point that I am beginning to feel shy asking questions to my teammates.

Not to mention, the training session is still in the process of being improved. There were many VAGUE requirements and data dictionaries. We had to figure out the rest, according to our trainer. The two-week pressure was too much, and we had to resort to overtime just to finish one module from another (this OT is not paid and is not approved as an offset). Heck, we even had to sacrifice our weekends just for this.

The final day of my training will be next week, and I am already anticipating the results. I am particularly slow in developing a system, and I felt like I will fail the training.

Fast forward if I fail the training: I was thinking that I will need to put that company in my resume because they had my government numbers for taxation purposes (in our country, almost all companies required our government numbers). I cannot lie in my resume because it will just make situations worse when applying for other companies. 

So I was thinking: Am I complaining too much? I tried my very best, but everything becomes overwhelming for me. I would feel ashamed of myself if I only lasted in a company for less than a month and got fired because I failed in training.

Again, I would appreciate any advice, suggestion, or insight. I will try my best to respond to your post.

""you're supposed to follow him and help"" ""This is the easiest way to piss me off, by standing around not doing nothing."" Then about 15 minutes later we started stocking the eggs and the supervisor walked up and told me to take my lunch break early but the way he said was, to me like he was relieving my more experienced co-worker of me helping/learning how to stock eggs. So I thought the standing around situation was a little uncalled for so I came back from break early to talk to HR about the situation because I thought that was a little harsh for someone on their first day. I didn't do these mistakes by choice.

TL:DR first day of work, went to HR because I felt like supervisor was being too harsh.

Once the supervisor finds out about this, it won't be any surprise that they are suddenly going to be critical of your every single move.

First-generation college student here, and I'm lost as heck.

I started college off as a Computer Science major at UC Irvine; I applied to the major since I've always been mathematically inclined and had messed with Code Academy but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, nor had I ever taken any CS classes. It kicked my a— my 1st year of college, and I had never felt worse: I only passed the first introductory course and failed the next class. I coasted until my Junior year by taking GE classes and not focusing on any upper divs.

Fast forward, my counselor decided it was best for me to switch into Sociology if I still wanted to graduate with a different major on time. Me being me, I followed her advice since I figured she would know more than me.

Now as a senior in college, the sociology classes that I am taking are okay—they're interesting—but I don't know what type of job I could get out of college? I haven't considered graduate school for Sociology because I'm not too fond of the major.

As I stated, I love math, but after coming to college, I feel like I am not as smart as I thought I was in high school. I was thinking about switching into Business Economics since I've taken a good amount of Econ courses which I enjoyed, and I've passed all of the math classes required for the major already.

Given that, I would have to stay a 5th year in college to get my BA degree in Business Economics. Is it worth staying if my 5th year is covered by FAFSA? Could I get a business job with a Sociology degree?

So I recently accepted a new job at a major hospital. Very excited. The job itself is business casual and you can also wear scrubs (Seems like it's something they're testing new). My interview I even dressed business casual. (grey top with a black cardigan, black slacks, black flats)

So I just re-read my orientation instructions for TOMORROW and it's says the dress is business professional. So I'm kind of freaking out.

Both my mom and my boyfriend are saying it shouldn't be a big deal to wear a solid colored blouse with slacks and shoes. And the term ""business professional"" for women is different then what it says on the internet. But when I look up on the internet, it says basically a suit for a woman or a dress, which neither I own. I have black slacks and the shoes. I just need a suitable suit jacket and  white top.

So it also says that scrubs are acceptable but I want to make a good impression and feel I shouldn't go this route because:

1792,fqgkz1,False,Recruiters,7,I want to renegotiate my hourly pay with a recruiter a month into my new job,jobs,"I have been actively looking for a job a month ago. I was presented with a couple of offers, but I had an interview that I enjoyed that was set up via a recruiting agency.

After my interview, I was talking to my recruiter for 1-2 weeks trying to speed up the process. I got other offers and I told him about them and hoped that he would speed the process up for me to make it easier for me to make a decision. One of the offers was for $36/hr but it required me to relocate, which I preferred not to do at the moment (I did not tell him that I would have to relocate but told him about the pay)

He said that his job pays 36$ as well and that I should just wait a couple of more days.

I then received another offer, for $38, and told him about it. However, I told him that I am still interested in his position because once again, I enjoyed the interview and could see myself as a good fit.

The recruiter ghosted me for a week. Stopped answering phone calls, texts. I had given up.

Eventually, he picked up the phone after a week. He told me someone else had filled that position. I contacted the company that I would work for through the recruiting agency DIRECTLY and the people there told me that they would have been excited to work with me, but they were told that I had already accepted another job offer. 

Two days later. on a Friday, the recruiter called me and told me that I could still get the job if I wanted to. I had other offers on the table but told him that I could still be interested. I told him that I'm willing to entertain a potential offer.

The recruiter told me there was a catch - I would have to accept it that Friday night and show up to work on Monday - which was actually an insane condition. However, I needed a job and needed it fast. I said ""Okay, I'll work with you""

The offer came in at $31. I told him that I was expecting him to keep his word and offer me the $36, but he used the typical recruiter excuse ""It came in lower than I expected"". I know they are getting a huge chunk of what the company is paying for me.

Anyways, I'm a month in and have done an excellent job so far. However, I'm still wanted by other companies - and here's a thing that I saw as a red flag: Even though there is an ongoing pandemic, the company refused to let me work from home even though my job is technical and can be performed remotely. 

I feel like I have nothing to lose and I also feel like I'm terribly underpaid for the tasks that I'm doing.

Can I give my recruiter an ultimatum of keeping his original promise and renegotiating my pay or else I'd be moving on to other prospects?

I would have nothing to lose if I went to a new job. However, the recruiting agency would lose money by losing me, so I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

I want to ask for the original $36 that I was promised. Or else.

A few weeks ago I was laid off due to the current pandemic and have decided to use my free time for things that are more productive. I was thinking of maybe starting towards my CompTIA certifications, beginning with the Core 3 of A+, Network+ and Security+. 

Would not mind getting into PenTesting later on down the road, but my question is, if I were to put the time to study for the A+ test first (and then work my way up), would the certification increase my chances of getting better pay?

376,b2egvj,False,Discipline,2,Call center / service desk employees -- how leveraged do you feel is 'over-leveraged'?,jobs,"I work at a large corporation that provides great benefits and decent pay (for my locale anyhow).

Originally, I was hired on to work on their internal IT helpdesk.  While it was still crappy call-center-esque phone and email support, I still enjoyed the work because I got to talk to a lot of people, troubleshoot issues, and had a lot of autonomy to work on solutions to problems.

Over the past couple of years, though, the department has really gone down hill and has started implementing some really miserable policies (strictly scheduled lunches and breaks, metrics, 60 second wrap-up time, etc).  But we also started taking on many new external contracts -- and many of these contracts each have their very own SOP.  Some clients, besides having their own SOP, have multiple projects under them, and each project may even be handled different.  They are also all *white label*, and many of them are angry assholes (unlike internal employees).

An example would be that one client requires that we open a ticket in one ticketing system, while another requires us to use another ticketing system, except we close that ticket and then send an email.  Another might require us to some combination of steps, while yet another has two completely different SOPs depending on the time of day.  In fact, multiple clients have their own operating hours, and none of them are standardized.  There is no training, either -- we just get an email from management going, ""Hey!  New THING is going live today!  Here's a KB article!""

I spend more time digging for KB articles in three different knowledgebase systems to check for proper 'procedure' than I do fixing an issue -- even when I already know what the problem is and how to technically fix it.  I am not even exaggerating here -- my average call handling time has gone from 2 minutes to over 14 minutes.  I literally spend 10+ minutes just figuring out how to route and document the call because I'm not allowed to do that post-call.

&#x200B;

I feel like we're getting over-leveraged, and I'm tempted to approach management about it and try to think of some solutions to suggest.  But I'm also wondering if I'm just being lazy or am not coping well with change -- is this normal in a call center environment?

I work in three different ticketing systems and have so many clients that I actually can't name them all -- I think it's around 25-30, many of which have between 2-6 sub-projects -- and I manage 15 different email boxes.  I can't always depend on ""whispers"", because many callers will dial into a generic IVR and mash '0' immediately and then just expect me to know who they are and what it is they are talking about.  We're also the ""roll over"" for other service desks.

&#x200B;

**The point:**  *So -- sanity check -- is this all really over-the-top or am I just getting too old for this shit?  Should I suggest trying to dedicate agents to different projects?*

1991,elhq90,False,Layoffs,6,Lost my first full-time office job yesterday and want some help,jobs,"Thankfully it was through no fault of my own (I hope?), they just couldn't afford to have me. The company was a startup in a way and while I knew that startups are notorious for not being able to continue the way they anticipate and that the position could be unstable, I didn't think it was going to be that soon. It's a bit of a bummer because I loved everything about this work and the people around me. I told everyone how much I loved everything about the company.

After being told this news, I went home and felt sorry for myself (only a few tears were shed!) and had dinner with my family as a consolation. But today I've filed for unemployment, made an outline of things to do while I have so much time on my hands (which includes a lot of time for applying for jobs) because I can't stand not having structure, and will be working on updating my resume.

Since I haven't been unemployed for the past 7 years, I'm almost at a loss of what to do. I'm a bit discouraged because I graduated from college 2 years ago with a BA in Social Science and stayed working at the daycare program while I've been searching for work up until September 2019. Before the daycare, I worked in retail for 4 years, the last year being a supervisor. Now I have a 2-month position for my only office job in marketing, a career that I want to pursue after having no direction to work towards. Just a few questions:

&#x200B;

1. How do I list the 2-month job on my resume? Should I even list it because it was such a short term position? If I do list it, how can I talk about it when it was a short amount of time?
2. Is there anything I should know about being unemployed? I know I need to keep busy, so I'm making sure that I'm continuing to take the online courses for marketing as I have been for the past several months so I can show that I serious about this, and the fact that I didn't go to school for this industry. And exercise for stress relief.
3. Should I just get another job as soon as I can, no matter what it is? I'm not talking about going back to part-time work, but another entry-level office job? I'm aware that I have bills/loans to pay, so that does add weight. I live at home now though.
4. I will also have no health insurance. I turn 26 next week. Happy birthday to me? What do I do about that?
5. If you don't have any answers to those questions, I'd still love to hear about anyone's past/current experience in any similar position!

Edited for formatting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/elhq90/lost_my_first_fulltime_office_job_yesterday_and/,3,"I would definitely put the position in your CV with no time-frame. I would explain what I did and how I did and I would explain to any prospective recruiters/employers that you were happy there and they were happy with you, however as it was a start-up they had to make some budget-cuts/layoffs. Be honest about it. Be enthusiastic about working in the field and if you are then you will definitely be hired. 

I wouldn't worry too much about courses, any popular high-demand ones I would take if I could but the normal online ones are normally no value. 

I wouldn't hurry. Think about your direction in life and what you want to accomplish for the next 10 years. Do you see yourself in retail or marketing? Do you see yourself in a different field. It is always easy to change a job, however building up is hard. You normally need years of experience for high-level positions so if you liked marketing and you want to do marketing in the future then you should try and get into marketing or a similar sounding role - PR for example. I know it will be though for a few weeks/months but stick it out and apply for any marketing jobs. It might be even worth getting a below market value with 1-2k per year but staying there for 1-2 years so you can build experience.

About the health insurance - are you in the US? If so then I can't help as I'm UK based. Ask maybe a friend or a relative that has experienced unemployment at some point. Surely you're not the only one ever to be layed off. 

5. I got layed off a position during my 8th month there. It was a bit sad but it was absolute hell to work for them. They killed my joy in work and it was a blessing in disguise. I now work for a letting agency (property sector), which is what I wanted to work as for a long time but was not really qualified to do so yet.

I am currently working on my AA degree right now, but have no concrete idea on my job opportunities after getting each of these degrees. I know I may be jumping the gun, but I am just curious on how useful these degrees will be. That being said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask you guys a few questions.

1. I heard it's hard to get a job with a Biotechnology degree, especially if you don't live in the right place. I live in Florida, how good are my chances of landing a job and how much should I expect to make?
2. With a BS in Biotech, what type of jobs would I have available to me? (Research, academia, etc.)
3. Considering I don't change my mind later on, what value would a Master's in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology have when it comes to me getting a job? Would it be at all useful compared to other grad degrees I could go for? (Bioengineering, bioinformatics, etc.)
4. Would I be limiting myself with this potential Masters since it is ***Animal*** Molecular and Cellular Biology or am I just overthinking it?
5. After getting these degrees, would job hunting be a lot easier for me or would it be just as much a struggle as with other bio-degrees?
6. What can I do to help better my chances of getting a job whenever I get either of these degrees?

I was really excited about working for a startup. It would be lots of work and it was a major leap after struggling to find a full time job. I’ve been there 7 months or so and over time I was seeing things I didn’t like but thought I’d tough it out.

Now, things are getting bad it feels like. We were just purchased by another company. The CEO and his wife, whom he works with, met with us individually. Not one big meeting, but meeting with employees alone. It was weird but tried not to think too much of it. Yet everything has slowed down. To the point that there is nothing to do. And the CEO does not like seeing his employees not working. He already has an attitude, is quicker to criticize than reward. Priorities shift on his whim. He once said to me “if I find that thing, I’m gonna be pissed. I’ll fucking kill you”. I tried not to read too much into it, but it was shocking. But he talks to everybody that way.

We also have not seen the people who bought us. They have not spoken too any of the employees or anything. Yet we know we will be moving locations. But we don’t know where.

That’s just some of the stuff. It always seemed like there were all these pieces, yet none of them were moving in the same direction. Now it just seems like we are in a sort of limbo and not being told anything. Especially since I just learned from a coworker our last two paychecks were paid out of the CEO’s pocket. Too anyone who has worked or owned a start up, is this sort of thing normal after a buy out? Is there always a strange period of silence or not knowing what’s going to happen?

1420,1fe21s,False,[advice],6,I got hired! Plus- my tips on filling out a memorable (min. wage job/retail) application!,jobs,"I was underemployed, working part-time retail at a clothing store at the mall.  I've been looking for a second job for months, and finally got hired!  I am now also a cake decorator at a local grocery store.  I had work experience working in a bakery but no cake decorating experience but applied anyway even though they were asking specifically for ""experienced cake decorators.""  I'm very excited!  Today I finished day two of training.

It's rough looking for minimum wage jobs.  It takes a lot of time.  It's a pain in the ass!  

**Here are some tips I have and things I've done that have helped me get (retail) jobs:**

* Keep applying!  Don't bank on one job.  Put in as many applications as you can.  

* Make a professional looking resume, and staple it on top of your application.  You can even make a cover letter, too if you'd like, but I never did.  (In some cases, I guess a cover letter might be over-kill for this type of job, but I don't know.)

**When you're ready to turn in your application:**

* Go to the store in person dressed very professionally.

* Smile and be nice to everyone you see.  Try to be confident.

* Ask for the manager.

* Shake his/her hand and introduce yourself.  Give him/her your resume + application.  ""Hello; how are you.  I'm so-and-so, I'm a student here/new in town.  I'm applying for the [whatever] position.""  Smile your face off (but not in a [scary way](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mag4auYoHa1qcja3b.jpg)).  
EDIT: If you're not applying for a specific position but are willing to do whatever job they give you, that can be a strength.  (Some people thinks it's a weakness because it makes you seem direction-less, but it's only a weakness if you let it be.  Realize that if you're open to any position, it can help the company out.  I mentioned that I'm willing to work in different departments, so if a cashier calls out, they can call me in to cover for them, which will help your employer out a lot.)  


**On the application:**

* Write as neatly as possible.  Seriously, take your time.  I have good hand-writing, but I really slow myself down on the applications to make sure everything's clearly legible and spelled correctly.  Use white-out if necessary.

* Of course, fill it out as completely as possible.  

* Sometimes the applications will have optional questions like ""What other skills or technical training do you have that could be relevant to this job?""  DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE CHEESY!  I don't have technical training, but on my application, I wrote ""Teamwork!""  It's cheesy, sure, but it's also true- in my past jobs I've had to work on teams, and I'm good at it.  You could also write hard-working, fast learner, determined, ambitious, or something along those lines.  If you fill out more info than necessary on the application, it shows that you really do want the job and are willing to put time and thought into your app.

* Also, on some apps, there will be a space with a question like ""Why do you want this job?"" or ""Why do you think you'd be good for this position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?"" or something like that.  Tell them!  They want to know that you want the job for more reasons than just ""I need money.""  If you like the products they sell or the atmosphere of the store, tell them that's a reason.  If you could be passionate about the position, tell them!  On my cake decorator application, I knew I was lacking the experience they wanted so in this section, I wrote a short paragraph something along the lines of: ""I loved my time working at [competitor] in the Bakery.  I liked the work, and it's given me relevant experience.  I wasn't a cake decorator; however, I had some experience baking/icing cupcakes/writing on cakes/blahblah, and I really want to be a cake decorator.  I may need some training, but I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  I'm reliable, and always show up on time.  Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.""  <- I think that answer is what got me the job.  When I came in for my interview, it wasn't really an interview.  We chatted casually for a bit, talked about what I'd done before in the bakery, and then she showed me the area, introduced me around, had me ice a cake, and then gave me my uniform!!  

* Be genuine.  Don't take my advice and say you're great at teamwork if you go into the interview and can't back up that claim with a story about how you once had to be a team player in some work scenario.  Just be honest, be yourself, and be willing to try new things.  

Well, I think that's about it.  I hope some of these tips help any of you looking for retail jobs.  These are tips I've acquired within the past two-to-three years of looking for work and working.  :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fe21s/i_got_hired_plus_my_tips_on_filling_out_a/,11,"To add another point to this excellent list: when you get to the ""personality"" questions, answer it so that it makes you look *good* (lie even if you have to).

For example, the question may ask: ""everyone knows someone who has stole something"".  Answer may range from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree.""  In this scenario, you might be inclined to answer somewhere in the middle: ""Agree.""  But that's the **wrong** answer!  For the sake of scoring an interview, you are an honest person who only associate with honest folks!

I'm pretty sure answering these kind of questions honestly resulted my application being sorted automatically by computer into the ""no"" pile many times.  While it may seem like I am encouraging lying, I am a strong believer that these kind of questions shouldn't even be asked on applications if the employers aren't expecting honest answers.

2151,bx3bbv,False,Startups,8,Given 2 Equally Awful Options at My Company,jobs,"**Edit**: I do have equity in this company. Forgot to include that.

To put it in perspective, I've been working with this company before it became an official LLC. I worked for free for almost 3 years to make this happen because I was passionate about the we were doing and I wanted to see this company succeed. I still do, but after what I was informed I'm actually shook right now.

I was originally brought on as remote full-time and eventually I'd have to move to their HQ (where the majority of the workers were.) Fair enough, I didn't get paid even close to what I should be making at the start but we were an early company and I believed in the vision, so I understood that my fiancee (girlfriend at the time) and I would have to move there eventually. My thought process was if I got a salary adjustment, my fiancee and I would discuss it more in depth and finally decide when the time would be right (which would primarily be with the salary adjustment since I live in a very expensive area currently, and saving up has almost been impossible.)

So the months go on and here I am at about 9 months as a full-time employee. I get informed last night that I have two options:

**1.)** Move there with a slight salary increase (a super small percentage of an even lower than entry-level salary given 6 years in my field), 12 months of guaranteed employment, and they'd give me a small amount for travel (less than $1,000.)

**2.)** Become a contractor and lose all my benefits (and eventually be pushed out when they found someone more local to them.)

I am absolutely devastated right now. The incentive for moving is not there, and even made worse that I have to pay an absurd amount for a lease break among other financial commitments coming up (we literally just signed for a wedding venue *yesterday*.) Since I couldn't save up a lot I would clearly be going into the red for this move, and as much as my fiancee is well-off financially and can help afford things, I can't place her into this financial burden with me. On top of this, she would have to find a new job there and disconnect from all of her friends and social activities she does. I feel ashamed

On the other hand, going contractor literally feels like I'm losing my job but in a ""nice corporate way."" I would have to get on my fiancee's health insurance through eloping early because I have a reoccurring medical condition and I *have* to have decent insurance for, less I pay an absurd out-of-pocket every year. Then finding a job around where I live would be insanely difficult because the market for my career here is abysmal. I worked too hard for this...

I'm at a loss. I talk to my CEO today in a few hours to hear more about it, but after busting my ass for almost 5 years working 60-80 hour weeks... I don't know. 

I have nothing to ask of anyone, so I suppose this is just a warning to people: a company doesn't give a fuck about you if it means saving them money.

I started work as a cashier three days ago. I was shown a thirty minute video for training then put straight on to the registers. We would have customers pick up online orders. We retrieve the items for them and hand them to the customers.

Well, there’s a receipt attached to the items ordered online. I didn’t think much of it. On my third day, I was scolded by my manager for almost letting a woman leave with the attached receipt. He told me to never let them leave with the receipt, and that by not having a manager scan the accompanying receipt, the customer never pays for it as the system only has the customer pay once it knows that they have left the store.

So I basically let hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise out of the store, without the customer paying. I was honest with my manager about it and let him know that this needs to be made clear to all of the new store associates.

Our senior project manager was largely MIA throughout the holidays and then announced he would not be returning for at least 3 mos if at all. This meant that outstanding projects were not being completed and could not be collected on so no income was coming in. After 10 days they let the three of us go.

341,bua96k,False,Discipline,3,"NEET, about to turn 28. Degree, but no real work experience or skills.",jobs,"This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 27-year-old guy, two months away from turning 28. I've been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. Truth be told, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

Are there any entry level jobs that are just looking for four-year degrees in any subject? Right now my big priority is to at least start working and then figure out what I want to do from that point on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bua96k/neet_about_to_turn_28_degree_but_no_real_work/,1,you should focus on an entry lvl job you want thats within reach bc i sense you lack direction in life. anything that interests you that sort ,2019-05-29 04:30:13

Mind you, what you're feeling is of course completely normal in this situation, and it's always going to be awkward if you're applying for a role where you work with the interviewers if it doesn't work out.

In terms of feedback, think of a few key moments in the interview you might want to get feedback on. Were there any particular questions you struggled with? What did the interviewers think of your responses to certain questions. Did you miss any opportunities to talk about X, for example? What did you answer well? Make a note of which responses were a hit or a miss. A lot of interview questions are the same so you'll probably end up answering a lot of the same stuff in your next interview.

I think it's also fair for you to ask what it was that put the other person ahead of you. Sometimes there's a legit reason, like maybe they have a bit more experience so would be easier to train, for example. It will be interesting to see what they say here. ",2020-05-30 03:52:41

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.

After that, begin your sales approaches to anybody in your network. You start part time and work yourself into a full time job.

Meaning, when you make more money teaching than you do in your current job, quit and go full time.  

Things to remember:  depending on where you live, you may collect state sales taxes, will need to file federal and state income taxes quarterly, will have to file for permits in your city, county, to work from home until you move out (check your hoa or lease to see if you can do this).  After you get your first check, you’ll need a corporate checking account (bring your papers with you when you do).  And you will need a way to take credit cards.

Lastly, a website with an your name @ websitename . Com email address is much more professional than some gmail email account.  So find a short, easy to remember name and register it.  Pay the $$$ for email capability.

In total, you’ll need about $5k or so to do this.

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was ""his favorite book"".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few ""standard"" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them ""I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y & Z.""

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that ""something would come through"" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.

1801,fb5elk,False,Recruiters,4,Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?,jobs,"Hi, hope I used the right flair. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So first off, I'm not very familiar with working with recruitment agencies so I'm not sure what the usual etiquette is. Omitting some details for confidentiality. **TLDR at the bottom**

&nbsp;

I had my resume and details uploaded to a job board for a while, and a few days ago, Agency A reached out to me and said I seemed to be a good fit for a job, X, at a large company. Note that I didn't apply for the position before Agency A reached out to me. Now this company is... definitely known nationwide, and they're very prominent in their field. 

&nbsp;

I was able to talk with Agency A a few days ago, about the position and other details. For where things are now, Agency A has forwarded my information to the hiring manager of the company, and are waiting to hear back. The next step, if the hiring manager approves, is an onsite interview. Overall Agency A seems to be larger and has been around longer, has more reviews, but seem to be based in a different state.

&nbsp;

But today around the afternoon, I got a call by Agency B... for a slightly different position, but at the same exact company and same location - **However**, at the time I applied, their listing didn't say the name of the company - they just said the location of the position. I applied to the position via Agency B *before* I first talked with Agency A on Wednesday. Agency B is smaller and newer, but unlike Agency A they're local to the general area they recruit for. 

&nbsp;

In my call with Agency B, **that's** when they told me ""The position's at (large company)"". I could've gleaned that from context clues in their listing but wasn't 100% sure. But TBH, I wasn't expecting to hear back from Agency B because I applied through them before and never heard back.

&nbsp;

I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping. The two positions are in the same department I think but not exactly the same, so I'm imagining that the recruiters would be talking with the same hiring manager, which after googling is not a good idea and the hiring manager would likely get confused about who is actually representing me. But since the company is so large, I'm wondering if that would make any difference vs. if it were a smaller company where the hiring manager for sure would be the same?

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure how to proceed with things... do I tell both agencies? Do I stick with one agency and drop the other? AhhHHh. I just don't want to accidentally end up burning bridges with anyone.

&nbsp;

**TLDR**:

-Agency A got to me first for the position at a large company by finding my resume through a job board

-I applied to Agency B *before* I talked with Agency A

-I wasn't aware at the time which company Agency B was recruiting for until they called me

-I got a call back from Agency B *after* I already talked with Agency A and got things rolling

-Agency A and Agency B are recruiting for the same exact company

-The positions are slightly different but chances are very high they're in the same department with the same hiring manager

-... What should I do now?

\- Your boss is busy worrying about their own work. 

\- Make your boss's life easier.

\- If you don't understand what is being asked of you, ask for clarification.

\- If you have an issue with someone, talk to that person first.  Don't complain to others. 

\- Every day, write down a list of the most important things you need to do - it may be 2 or three things.   At the end of the day, review the list.   If you're not sure what should be on the list, review with your manager. 

\- Never talk disrespectfully about your manager to anyone at work. People talk to each other. 

\- Never put in writing something you don't want others to read. 

\- Learn, learn learn.  Take every training opportunity to learn more about your job, company, industry. That is how to get ahead.

\- Be present.  You're paid to be there, do that. It's half the battle.

765,blec3k,False,Unemployment,33,unemployed 3 years after college (frustrations),jobs,"I graduated in December of 2015 with a B.S. in Architecture, and the job search just hasn't been in my favor since. In the mean time, I've been constantly volunteering my time with free labor places, and have been tirelessly trying to learn more marketable skills to put on my resume and have been searching and searching for any sort of job. Everybody I know, my colleagues and friends and now my partner, all have these fancy high-class good-paying jobs, and making good names and careers out of themselves, it seems, and I'm still living with my parents frantic, nervous, and unable to get a job STILL. I'm at my wits end right now, and I'm starting year four of unemployment and I honestly don't know what else to do right now except to just sit here and keep applying. 

I've been out of any sort of workforce for so long, I have no clue how to even break into the job market after a period of unemployment like this. I am clueless. Is there a chance to recover from a three-year gap of unemployment after graduating college? I'm not sure how much my volunteering counts, and I'm not a student anymore to qualify for these internships, but I'm actually taking some classes at a community college right now, and absolutely hate it, but I don't have much else to do right now.

Another problem is that I'm a little lost in terms of career, too, so I'm looking for anything and everything right now. I might be looking in the wrong places since all these jobs listed are for assistants, clerks, technicians... It seems there is not a fit for me anywhere, but perhaps living in a smaller city isn't working in my favor. When I do get the occasional interview, I can't help but to tense up and be really nervous. Interviews are simply not my strongest point.

Being out of the job market for so long, I have no idea where to get help (if I need it), or where to turn to. Submitting resumes to staffing services doesn't even help even though others I know have had success with those agencies. I spend my days staring at the computer hoping something will happen, and nothing really has. Creating and designing and trying to get more portfolio pieces (and doing art stuff I like to do) seems like a bit of wasted time because it doesn't seem to be productive to me in terms of job searching. I don't know what else I can do, and I don't want to settle for just a cashier job, honestly... part of me thinks that's the most I will ever do, and the other half of me thinks I deserve a good job, but I don't feel very deserving after these long years of sitting around unemployed (I know I have a shit attitude, but therapy is expensive and I don't want to do that to my budget again).

Besides the occasional temp job I have had, I've never held any sort of real and long-term job before... I've always been under the impression that I've needed some fancy office job or some sort of professional job that I've never been able to get, and that makes me frustrated because I don't want to waste my existing artistic skills, and want to design and not be holed up inside a cubicle all day... I think. I probably have a really distorted view because I lack such experience, and it's really embarrassing because I'll be thirty in a few years...

**APOLOGIES.** This has turned into a rant, but I've been having such trouble and this has really been getting to my head more and more and more and it makes me want to hide from the world and maybe give up after I spend my days job searching and crying all the time. It's really hard to keep your head up when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Advice is welcome, but I'll re-iterate a few of my questions:

How does one break into the job market after a large gap of unemployment?

How do you keep your spirits (and your self-esteem and confidence) up when all your efforts seem to not work?

What are some interviewing tips for someone with bad social anxiety/how do you get over the nervousness??

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat. 

&#x200B;

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy. 

&#x200B;

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.

I'm considering studying at a Canadian institution like BCIT in order to have better access to the local labor market (making contacts, BCIT job board, etc ). 

I would like to know if paying the price of a certificate (some 7500 CAD) from an institution like that is worth it from a job search standpoint, or if I'm just better off looking for a job in the traditional way (applying directly to companies, Zip recruiter, Linkedin, etc).

For example, here in Mexico, having access to the job boards and contacts (both faculty and students) of elite universities is a game changer when it comes to gettting a high paying job, while public job boards are basically useless and have awful job offers.

On the other hand, in Spain (where I went to university) I found university job boards to be a waste of time with usually poor job postings, and few contacts to be made (most of faculty are bureaucrats without private sector experience). In Spain you're better off applying directly to companies or using public job boards.

The career field you want to enter is called ""student affairs."" In addition to admissions, it comprises all student services: housing, counseling, conduct, Greek life, and so on.

Virtually all jobs in student affairs are master's-required. If you want to have a chance, you will need to get a specific student affairs master's degree. Unfortunately, your food science master's degree will not help you one bit in this field.

Luckily, most master's programs in student affairs will accept students from any background - as long as you can articulate on your application that you are passionate about helping college students, you'll be golden. People who work in higher ed come from all kinds of backgrounds. It's an extemely diverse field, and prides itself on being so diverse.

A few warnings: it's a very competitive field. You'll probably spend a few years while in grad school overworked and underpaid as an ""intern"" (even though your responsibilities and hours will be comparable to a professional), and then still might to struggle to get a job after all the effort. 

In addition, I hope you aren't attached to where you live, because it will be expected that you do a national job search after graduating. If you are selective about which colleges you apply to for full-time work, you will just be holding yourself back. Take whatever you can get, anywhere in the country. Some people end up working at the same college where they got their master's, or in the same area, or at the college in the next town over - but many people do not - so be open to traveling. Furthermore, promotions are rare, so once you have learned all you need to from a job, be ready to move across the country yet again to take on a higher-level position.

If that kind of workload, and those warnings, don't bother you, then absolutely go for it.

And if you want to know more, go to your current school's career services office and make an appointment. I can almost guarantee you that every career counselor went through a student affairs master's program, and they can tell you what the career field is like.

One last thing: the student affairs field is made up of so many people that you'll really have to come to your own conclusions. I'm trying to be a realist here, but some people will say it's only positive and fun, some will say you don't actually need a master's, and some people are extremely toxic. Everyone who works in student affairs has a different perspective about it. 

Sorry not sorry for the long answer. Consider yourself informed.

Sincerely,
Someone who had worked in student affairs for 6 years, in 3 states, at 4 colleges. ",2020-03-23 19:18:35

Recently he got sick again. With no vacation time left and no sick time left either, I put in, with my boss' in-writing blessing' 40 hours but told him I would have to take some vacation time initially to cover my ass. 

We had a meeting discussing his future and decided on a modified schedule until he gets back on his feet. I told him about what I was going to do as my hands are tied and it isn't my money...He seemed fine with it as he left.

He later threw it back in my face via email that I am exacerbating the situation, making life stressful and hellish for him and now he says he'll go on disability and doesn't know if/when he'll be back.

From a quick phone conversation with my boss regarding this, I also found out he'd been making comments about me to my superiors. Nothing egregious, but enough that they had to take notice and were monitoring the situation. Of course this whole situation skews them towards my side, thankfully.

First time poster, but I thought I’d ask around a couple subreddits to get the a wider perspective of a major life decision I’ve been heming and hawing about for half a decade: Is a Masters degree going to help me find a job? 

 So here’s  my perspective. I graduated in 2013 with a BS in Biology and since then I’ve been working as a lab tech and worked my way up to a team lead position (basically pays the same and have the same work, but I also cover some of the more basic coordinating stuff and sometimes attend as a department rep when my boss is out). A couple years ago I wanted a new job and I COULD NOT GET INTERVIEWS. I applied, and applied, and applied but I just wasn’t getting calls. I’m not sure if my resume was awful or just didn’t meet the job experience expectations.  So, I figure if I can’t update my resume if I can’t get a new job maybe I should get more education. I got a couple of certifications through work (six sigma and excel certifications) and I worked for about a year studying for the GRE, taking it, and applying for a Non-thesis Biology graduate program. I can take classes for a couple years and then I’ll have a Masters in Biology. Great plan right?

Well, now I’m not so sure. What if I go through all this time and money, and I still can’t find a better job? Or now I’m a grossly overqualified lab tech who’s applying for jobs that pay $15 an hour but I’m expecting more since I have a Masters, but I lack industry experience for the typical jobs someone with a Masters applies for? My SO asked what job I’d want after school, and I said I wanted the same job just more money (but I don’t think they’ll pay a lab tech more to press buttons a machine just because I went to school for s couple more years) Is a Masters even necessary once you get to a certain point of job experience (Does someone with a MS and 1-2 of experience trump someone with 10+ years with a BS) My graduate school advisor was unhelpful bless her heart. She said that typically students who are non thesis MS either become teachers or go on to medical school, so she couldn’t tell me placement stats for my situation post-school.  My HR department couldn’t advise me either (“It’s a case by case basis. If someone doesn’t have a degree but has more applicable laboratory experience than another candidate, we have made exceptions since this is a hands on field”). 

I don’t want to go into debt if I can’t be guaranteed a better job position than what I currently have. Is a MS worth it? Has it been worth if for you?

We also live in the age of basically the Bachelors degree being akin to a high school diploma, so anything above that is nice to differentiate yourself.

Hey guys, 

I’m graduating this spring with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences. I have 4 years sales experience at Nordstrom as a top seller, along healthcare experience as a primary care intern. I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard. Although I would describe myself as outgoing and a people-person, I definitely have a calm demeanor. I don’t have a super hyper personality all the time, but I can’t change that. I feel very discouraged and like I’m not cut out for a career in medical sales because of this. I know this was my very first interview, but Im finding myself questioning my abilities.

I’ve been made redundant from my job this week, along with 4 colleagues, including my boss, after being there for only 7 months.

My other option is I take a redundancy payout of a month’s pay, and go back to contract work until I find something else permanent. 

I’d been finding it a toxic environment for a while (no development opportunities, lack of training and support from my boss, no objectives, high staff turnover, really cliquey), so I’m wondering if I just see it as an opportunity to leave instead of settling for an unrelated position that could make me even less happy, and focus on finding something else that allows me to thrive and use my knowledge? My worry is not finding something quickly, sometimes it’s better to jobhunt whilst in a job - and paying my rent!

Unfortunately in February of this year, I had a bad fall and had to get back surgery which was supposed to be routine and about a week of bedrest, but it ended up failing and my recovery time got extended for about a year. I went from being an active rock climber and dancer while employed at a decent job, to needing a cane and not being able to walk around the neighborhood. Obviously I haven't returned to work since and my savings is draining fast from medical bills and gas to drive to appointments.

Now I can walk decently well, can't lift anything but I feel more comfortable managing without a cane and my recovery process is still ongoing.

I am only planning to be there for a week but if her condition is serious, I will extend it to help her out.

I know I have a lot of things working against me like the physical limitations and having to be gone during two major holidays for my grandmother (Christmas and New Years). One friend said I can find a job now and tell the employers later so I have a secure job by January, but others have said I should wait until I get back from Japan and spend more time in physical therapy. I think I should wait, I have gone to a few interviews but they all rejected me due to my injury, so maybe focus on my grandmother and myself before rushing into it. The financial situation is really stressing me out and I applied for temporary disability with no luck so far, I made some money doing crafting projects but they're not good enough quality to open an Etsy shop for (also supplies are expensive).

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

So I guess I want advice on what might be the right move here, just stick with it? Try to swallow all my doubts and endure?

There are a few options that you could do here and different perspectives you can use.  
  
A) Your other employees have a different mindset than you and you come from a different background. You come from the business world and they’ve come from cs and big companies. Different viewpoints help a company as a whole and you being young to this job (because you’re an intern), you’re not expected to know everything, just a higher general understanding. Maybe on your free time try to learn SQL or other useful skills that could help not only this job, but potential future ones.  
  
B) Talk to your boss and see why he offered you a job to provide some like so you can improve your self doubt. Maybe try mental health consulting if you think you need it (I am just going off of the imposter syndrome you explained).  
  
C) Ask for help from a coworker or two to help train you more? Since you don’t want to move back, view this as some money is better than no money. Think of what tasks you do on a daily basis that you could do better and practice them.  
  
Motivational bit: If you’ve been lucky enough to be selected by them twice, once for interview and once for a job offer, they clearly see something in you that you don’t. You clearly want to stay there and I believe that you can beat this challenge that’s in front of you no problem.

I will be starting at company A next week. Lo and behold, I received an interview from company B, which I applied for during my job hunting period.  After interview and checking my references and background company B called me earlier this week and said they approved my position and verbally asked if I would accept. This is my dream government position and so I accepted and my start date is in mid September. Because it is government, it took them a while to go through my background check before they can approve me. I am still waiting for my offer letter, and the manager said to wait until next week. 

My dilemma is that I have not received an official offer letter from company B and so I feel like it’s not official yet and nothing is set in stone. However, given by how the manager communicated very thoroughly through every step of the application process and actually set a start date for me, I am pretty sure it’s official they are just waiting for their HR just as much as I am.

327,bz3xih,False,Discipline,2,I hate my job and don't know what to do,jobs,"(Please note this is my first post in reddit ever, so if I put this in the wrong place please tell me! Thank you!)

Alright straight to the point, I HATE my job.  As a college student, I thought I'd lucked out getting a retail job for this company (a world wide and pretty expensive cosmetics company).  The job was nothing special, just your basic helping people find their stuff, cashiering, stocking, and the likes.  Or at least I thought it was.  

So everything was going really well, I even got a ""promotion"" and was able to take on more responsibility, which I enjoyed.  I was constantly asking what I could do to improve, what I needed to work on, or if my manager needed any help with anything.  Everything was fine until I had to request time off in order to complete my last semester at college before I could move onto a University.  Trying to finish off classes is normally hard enough, but during this time my parents were always fighting and seriously considering getting a divorce.  Add on top of that the fact I can only go to college if I keep my grades up, as I rely only on scholarships.  You could say I was just a *little* stressed out at the time.  Scheduling for this place has always been bad.  The manager would make it one week in advance, your never allowed to switch shifts with someone else, and in order to get time off you have to request it a month in advance.  So anyways, I told my acting manager (he's actually the assistant, but because the stores real manager broke her leg and couldn't work for a long time, we as the staff filled out a survey which got him temporarily promoted) about everything that was going on with school.  It should be noted that while I didn't love the manager (I actually thought he was and still is super child-ish.  He refuses to take any criticism, is rude, and is super 'car sales man' like to the costumers), the two of us had a pretty good relationship.  At this point, we'd only really only had a one on one when I expressed how much I hated the new sales tactic we were using (basically continuously bothering costumers in every section of the store, even if they asked us to go away).  

So I tell him the issues with needing more time for school and he assures me he will do everything he can.  Next schedule comes out and guess what?  I'm scheduled for MORE hours!  I was pissed, we had another meeting where he tried to tell me ""I did do everything I could, this is less hours, I don't know what you want me to do.  Besides, you only go to school four days a week, you should have plenty of time to work here.""  I had to explain to this man how even though I go to school four days a week, the work load required for my classes was that of a full time job.  So even though it seemed like I had all the time in the world, in reality I was spending hours upon hours a day trying to figure out homework and getting tutored.  Eventually, my manager said he understood and agreed to let me give up one of my shifts.  I was still pissed, but I eventually was able to graduate so my availability became free again.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  So, our real manager finally got cleared to come back to the store, and within about two weeks of being back she pulls me into a meeting with the supervisor I'd been working with thanks to my promotion.  They tell me I'm basically de-promoted because of my availability and because the old manager (now the assistant manager or AM) and my supervisor thought it was taking away my commitment on the sales floor.  She also told me the amount of time I had taken off because I was sick or for family emergencies was unacceptable and if I missed another shift I'd be fired.  I was in shock.  That promotion was everything to me, and to make matters worse my supervisor in that position told me they were still ""so thankful for all the work I did and the new organizational systems I had created.  In fact, there so great will still be using them.""  I'm sure they meant well by saying this, but all I could here was ""thanks for fixing everything, but you're useless now so bye!""  On top of that, I even checked with both my supervisor and AM if my availability would affect my promotion, and they both assured me as soon as my hours became open again I could go right back too it.  I ended up having to be sent home that day because I had a break down.  

At this point I just don't know what to do.  I am so upset about the fact they took away my position (I was able to work behind the scenes more and was insured longer hours).  Honestly, what makes everything so much worse was that I never heard anything but positivity in that position.  They never told me I was doing anything wrong, and never gave me things to improve on.  At this point, I know I worst case scenario I will need this job until the summer ends.  Its only a couple of month but with how much I hate this place it might as well be a century.

Our district manager was supposed to train me, but for whatever reason he didn’t. So instead our general manager did, with the rationale being that the GM used to be a DM. Kinda weird but whatever.

Sales still suck, and the quarter is almost over.

So today my district manager came in and told me our sales are bad, and he gave me a chart to track my sales. He says he wants me to improve my sales by basically 10% in the next six weeks. He asked me what I think is keeping the team from higher sales, and we brainstormed some things to help raise sales.

He didn’t say what would happen if I don’t.

I don't know what you sell, but I can give you some tips for selling anything. 

Basically the first thing you want to do is identify what level of investment your customer/client is making in purchasing goods and/or services from you.

Basically, there are a zillion combinations of product/service, but you can boil almost anything down to a fundamental relationship that is this: all sales fall somewhere along the line connecting two extremes, the extremes are:

1. Low price point, service means nothing since the item is likely consumable and you'll never have to see the retailers ugly mug again

2. Extremely high pricepoint, where you're purchasing a high end product that is irrevocably paired with strenuous, rigorous service - and, by buying this product or service you are tied into a relationship with the seller. (Examples might be hiring a specialized consultant to build a model of a highly complex system, or hiring a lawyer, or purchasing a fleet of Boeing 747's) - in all these cases, you're going to be locked into a relationship for some period of time, sometimes your whole life.

The point here, is that as the seller you need to be cognoscente of the investment the consumer must make in the purchase of your product. If you are selling paper - are you *just* selling paper, or are you selling the service agreement in which you will provide them with paper for a period of time?

If you are selling something relatively inexpensive, your focus should not be on YOU, the focus should be on the product, and economy. If you are selling something more expensive, then you must start to sell yourself as a reliable provider, as well as the product.

In a project management course I took recently, there is a ""goal"" of becoming a ""trusted advisor"". This means that you speak to your client with truth - not sales; but truth. Meaning, that you aren't acting solely to benefit your pocket, or your company's revenue, but you are speaking to them with their best interests at heart. And by doing this, you gain significant good will. Sometimes this comes cheaply, and sometimes it comes at significant expense.

Here are two examples: A client approaches me and asks me to compare and contrast the model we built and the model they had from a couple years ago. I realise immediately that their previous model was built in a very robust way, and contains several tertiary level calculations that I know my junior engineers could not possibly  do. I tell my client that the previous work is at a standard that surpasses the work I have just provided him. He agrees, but then instead of getting mad, he asks what I can do to remediate the situation. I say we can use the client's previous model as a basis for improvement and we adopt some specific modules to the higher standard. We cover the work under training, since I know my junior engineers will learn something valuable. The client is extremely happy and as a result we are awarded with more work.

Example 2: I submit a proposal for some work and the client is considering two different software types to accomplish the job. We are specialised in only one of them. We realise quickly that the training time on the othr software would make our bid uncompetitive. I tell the client that we are not in a position to make a bid on the work because of this issue. They appreciate our position and award the project to someone else. Here, we've been honest up front and the client appreciated our forthcoming attitude and honesty. We lost $150k worth of work, but we gained credibility.

In either case, it's the cost of doing business, but by gaining good will and credibility we're putting ourselves continually in a better position.

The TL;DR here, is that you can find ways to be honest with the client, be honest about everything and it'll pay off. a 10% increase in sales will not be difficult with a bit of time spent getting to know your clients, or knowing what to focus on.

Ohya, and I wouldn't be worried about getting the axe. Don't stress that - that's just paying interest on a debt you haven't incurred. ",2019-03-12 02:43:37

1221,dl8w6x,False,Onboarding,6,Unsure if I should stay at this job?,jobs,"I have been with my current company for around 19 months. For the first 18 months (also my first job after graduate school), I worked in a challenging environment that gradually became more toxic, as time passed, due to low pay, issues not being resolved from administrators, numerous staff quitting due to burnout and never-ending staff shortages, ethical concerns, etc. I requested to transfer to a different department 2 months ago into a slightly different role (for slightly higher pay) and more growth opportunities. I knew other people who had left my former department to transfer to my current department, and they had positive experiences when changing, and I hoped I would have the same.

I have been at my new job for 3 weeks, and given the 3 varied roles within my position, I have one ""main"" supervisor, but also 3 ""additional"" supervisors for each of my roles. I thought this would be a ""good"" thing to have different insight and mentorship; however, it has frequently resulted in miscommunication among the 4 supervisors when advising me for what to do for the varied roles within my positions, as well as figuring out who is responsible to ""train"" me for different roles. I am frequently told how to complete a task from one of these supervisors, but then having my ""main"" supervisor become frustrated with the differences in information being shared with me. I only see my ""main"" supervisor 1-2 time(s) a week, so on the days I do not see her, I have to e-mail her, and hope I am given a response that way. There are also times that my supervisors have not communicated necessary training information to me because they believe that another supervisor has already told me the necessary information and/or due to assuming I transferred within the company, I should already know the information (which is not possible due to differences in the departments). When I interviewed for this new position, the directors were aware of my limited experience related to some aspects of this new job, but felt confident that I could learn on the job and with experience, which I hoped also. The department has never hired someone into so many different positions like what they made my position to be, and say they are learning, as they go, with how to best supervise me, but it's feeling very frustrated.

I feel that all of these different supervisors are now realizing the impacts of the miscommunication during my training process, and have been asking me how ""training"" has been going, and are not very happy with the results. They are expecting me to independently complete my job responsibilities starting within the next 2 weeks. They have been having me shadow one of my supervisors 2-3 days a week to watch how they complete their specified job responsibilities, which has definitely been insightful to watch; however, with all of the time spent observing, they have given me very minimal on the job training related to my workload for one of these components, which is very different than my supervisor's.

Today, one of the supervisors spoke with me privately (and mentioned she would be speaking with my other supervisors to see how everything has been going, etc) to ask how training has been going, etc, to which she questioned me if I felt ""ready"" to independently complete some other aspects of my job due to my limited experience with some areas of the position, and also mentioned that if she had interviewed me, she would have highlighted other pertinent information related to the job to have a better depiction of the job, etc. I felt that she also implied that she does not feel I am the best fit for this position, as I said I was interested in taking this position to gain more experience in different areas, but told me that was not the purpose of this position, and that I needed to view myself as more of an ""expert"" to succeed in the position. However, with only 3 weeks at this new job, and most of my time spent in ""training"" by watching other people do their job, and not being given direct support with my own workload, I am definitely feeling overwhelmed and not confident in my abilities, and feel like the department now regrets hiring me, although I know I did not misrepresent my credentials, etc. It seems like this new department is almost just like my previous department, disappointingly, with a toxic and unsupportive environment again. Another supervisor also mentioned to me that she was not used to having new hires to the department with such limited experience either, which again is making me question why I was hired.

Additionally, I am scheduled to work at 2 different locations, but do not have adequate resources to complete my job, as at one of my locations, I temporarily have no office, desk, or computer to use due to building renovations for a few weeks, and at my other location, I have no desk to store any pertinent files, and have to borrow one of my supervisor's filing cabinet to file important documents.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do with this situation?

I think doing things right away will actually be a benefit in the long run as the longer you are at the job the more responsibilities will pile up.... and it becomes a bigger risk to procrastinate... also I’ve learned the hard way that procrastination leads to anxiety... so you’d be right back where you started. So me the question is about priority. If you ask a “when would you like this done” ... every person will respond saying ASAP because they don’t have any concept of what you are working on at that very moment. I’d strategically ask your question about deadline in a way that also asks which is the real priority... so saying “I will get this done. I’m currently working on XYZ and have X hours more to finish it. I expect I can get this to you by X time. Does that work for you?” 
This will remind them what you are working on AND gives them the opportunity to say “yes that time frame works” or “no I need you to do this first”. Either way you get the real answer you need and not the generic go to answer of “asap”. It also manages up which is a great way to communicate your efforts without blatantly saying “I did This, This, and This, today”. 

Then with time you’ll get a real sense of what is actually pressing and what’s not, but always a good idea to manage up regardless. :) hope that helps!  ",2018-08-13 13:23:07
1864,c9u7hu,False,Recruiters,36,I hate writing cover letters!!!,jobs,"Ugh. I know this post will sound defeatist but.. I hate writing cover letters. Who doesn't? I imagine more interesting and accomplished people than me probably won't bat an eye when asked to submit a cover letter.

I'm an engineer with \~2 measly years of experience, wanting to get into more project managerial/consulting roles, and when I'm writing these cover letters I sound so generic and DRY.

Like, yep, I see your company does XYZ things. I wouldn't say I'm passionate about what your company does, but I know I could do a good job in the said role. But I'm supposed to ""sound"" passionate about this industry. And I just can't artificially create that passion, so I'm gonna write a basic line indicating that I care. Oh, and this is what I've done in my current role. You know, so you can see that I'm at least, somewhat competent.

Honestly, I wish I was in the creative sector so I could write more ornate letters. I feel like when I'm writing CLs for more analyst positions, I struggle with choosing a dry vs. not dry tone. So I choose dry. I could spend 2-3 more hours researching issues in this industry and writing a college-like essay of how I find this specific issue in this industry interesting. But I don't have the time. Job searching is a numbers game, remember?

Maybe this is a unique problem. All I know is that I just want a job in this specific role because it seems cool and I like having varied work. That's it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c9u7hu/i_hate_writing_cover_letters/,38,"Take heart, tender rose petal.  We don't accept cover letters anymore.  Nobody ever read them anyway.

It depends on the industry of course, but cover letters are on their way out. ",2019-07-06 14:32:47
124,dx0eei,False,Rejections,5,Getting rejected for my first job,jobs,"So i found a job opening for a copy shop near me on some job site, they pay well and they dont require work experience. This was amazing for me because i filled everything they wanted, im 19 and a student with no work experience, they are also open to employing students. I've sent my CV(which isnt very indepth by the way because there isnt much to write about) 5 days ago and i still havent heard of them. The deadline on the site ends in 3 days, should i go to the actual store and ask around or should i keep searching? I've been searching for weeks and this is one of the few jobs that seem decent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dx0eei/getting_rejected_for_my_first_job/,0,After a week or so it’s okay to call and ask for an update. ,2019-11-16 01:42:42
214,gl50do,False,Discipline,6,Help for measurable PIP objectives for ‘subjective’ performance?,jobs,"Advice and examples for drafting up a PIP for ‘hard to measure’ objectives? 

Eg -, autonomy, accountability, decision making and problem solving?


I really want to help this person to perform and nothing I am doing is working so far. They seem to not understand the basic elements of their role, and can’t do things without a lot of micro management and hand holding. This is hindering their own progress and despite coaching I can’t get them out of this mindset. HR have asked for a PIP and I haven’t done one before. HR agreed it’s tricky because it’s not the output of their role, it’s about their performance level required enact the role . 


They are completing the outputs asked so I can’t base it on that. It’s just that output is low because of their behavior. E,g  primarily it’s the amount of documentation and hand holding that’s showing they are not performing at a level required. (Need ‘how to ‘ documents for basic tasks, are asking me to make decisions for them consistently despite various coaching, and also behaving in a negative manner when interacting with others or receiving feedback)


However I don’t know how to phrase that in a PIP?

How can you show/ give the opportunity for them to improve on what seems to be intangible outcomes?

Ideas for actions they can take and ways to measure improvement? 

Any examples desperately needed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gl50do/help_for_measurable_pip_objectives_for_subjective/,5,"It sounds like you need to clarify expectations for the role, and this person's place within the team/organization. Only then can you actually measure their performance.

A PIP without measurable objectives may make the employee feel that it's being done in bad faith, as a means to fire the employee. If you really want to make this person improve I'd really think about whether you've actually been coaching them, or if they interpreted the micromanagement to mean they're not allowed to act independently. An honest conversation, and listening, may help you to determine this. This kind of PIP will just serve as a signal the employee needs to look for another job, which may be the desired outcome if they're not a good fit for this role.

The vast majority of people who are fired from their jobs are completely blindsided by it, this article could be helpful https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/karlynborysenko/2018/11/29/how-employees-experience-being-fired-and-what-you-can-learn-from-it/amp/ ",2020-05-16 23:46:16
