330,7xv99i,False,,1,Moving too fast in my own life?,AdviceForTeens,"I'm a [19/f], currently a sophomore in college. For as long as i can remember, I've always wanted to skip this chunk of my life and get to a place where I can settle down and begin my life. People tell me all the time about missing out on the ""college experience"" and I just don't know if I'm really missing out on anything. I've gone through my phase of partying every weekend and drinking more than I ever imagined I would. That made me satisfied for a period of time, but now I'm back in a place that I wish I could just drop everything and move on. I hate this place of being at a stand-still, doing nothing but going to school and working a part-time job that leaves me feeling bored every day. I have so many ambitions and things I want to do with my life, and I wish I could enjoy things as they were now, but my mind is constantly stuck in the future. It doesn't bother me much, thinking ahead, but I feel that it holds me back from enjoying the moment.

I don't know what I can do to change my mind, I've thought this way for so much of my life. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and be excited about what I have to do, and I want to know how to make the best of the present.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/7xv99i/moving_too_fast_in_my_own_life/,3,"I get what ya mean about being in a standstill. Honestly I feel that besides drinking in excess (which is fun) college is also for meeting lots of new people and learning new skills. It doesn’t have to be school related either learn an instrument or language. If you feel bored try to do something you’d never have done before and see how you like it, college is a time to learn.

345,fclpgo,False,,2,I have two Options but I need help please help,AdviceForTeens,"So I’m in this pen pal program there’s two days of it, 30 kids from my school and 30 from other school. The first day past, as I was paired with a girl who is amazing and genuine(I’m a junior and she’s a senior). She had to follow my high school schedule from period 3 to 6. We had such a great time and became close friends, and we were excited for the second day, which is a month away, to see each other where I follow her schedule and meet new people. 

HOWEVER on that same day I have an Over-Night trip for my orchestra(This is the top orchestra in the high school) and I’m the most important one. I play bass and the other two bass players can’t go because they don’t want to. That day we’ll play for fun and professional would give us advice. Then we’ll go watch the New York philharmonics and visit Fredonia for a college tour. My good friend is going but she knows no one and really wants me to go on the trip(Btw I’m a guy). I don’t want her to be alone for the two days.

I don’t know what to do, picking one just gives me guilt towards the other. What do you guys think would be the best thing to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fclpgo/i_have_two_options_but_i_need_help_please_help/,2,"Ouch, that's a really tough situation to be in.

I keep reminding myself that i’d never have as much friends as the other people beside me, which just causes me to cry. I feel like it’s my fault that I did this to myself and never tried to change. I’m thinking about cutting myself. No, not the really open wound with so much blood spewing out. but just a mild cut that it doesn’t look like I did it intentionally. It feels so tempting, yet so shameful at the same time..",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ezo6pw/should_i_try_it/,5,"Dont do it. It's not worth it.

Please don't I fucked up my life this way went to a wilderness therapy program for three months DONT DO IT  I'm sorry to tell but don't if you do it will be a ride Awakening I'm gonna be honest ok it doesn't get better till something changes or happen wait as long as you can my dude please

Don't. as someone who has been self harming for years it really isn't worth it. Sure it can help or even feel good at the time but once you lose your cutters high your just left empty and worse than before, also even some of the smallest cuts can leave permanent scars. IT isn't worth it. it really isn't. I said that it would just be one when I started but then as a few weeks went past all I wanted to do was more and more and now I'm scared all over my body. Try art or other methods of distracting yourself. I find that writing down my feelings even poetry can really help. Also rock music... sounds weirdly specific but rock makes me want to kick ass and dance rather than cry and self harm. dms are open if you need to talk...

Scars are permanent. And can be especially noticeable.",2020-02-06 14:26:22

785,bonjde,False,,0,Why did no one warn me about the loneliness,AdviceForTeens,"Hi, First time poster here..
So in the UK we leave school at 16 and are forced to go to either college or an apprenticeship, I did ""okay"" in school so I ended up getting an apprenticeship in a warehouse on a 25 year olds wage. Since I started working, living an adults life, bills, rent, care insurance etc; I've felt extremely lonely. I wasn't the most popular kid in school, Wouldn't say badly bullied to the point of depression, but bullied as such, I mainly brushed it off. I left school with a couple friends, now I rarely even see my best friend, he's either with his girlfriend, in college or in bed, I've started smoking the herb to try to see life differently but that's just making it harder to do basic life functions, I'm trying to push my self to go out on walks alone (Not really for my fitness as I work out regularly, but besides the point). Does anyone have any tips on getting over this loneliness? Is it an age thing? Or is it one of those things you never got warned about?

Once she finds out she’ll probably un-enroll me so if you could offer advice on how to transition to a new school w. a very different atmosphere it would be helpful. This “new” school is much bigger, the kids are (generally) more hostile and im a socially awkward person who has a very difficult time making friends (I’ve been going to my current school which is very small for two years now and I havent made a single friend lol). It is also significantly more academic and I struggle greatly with academics...anyways thanks for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ek0u0o/failing_school/,2,"well I think that you should try to tell her that you tried your best if you did you should really just be honest with her and I know it might be hard but,you guys should make an agreement over something like a tutor if you can get one. You could try to ask friends or notes But, the best thing you can do is find something that excites you like for me notes don’t judge but, something like that you can find it and start to link it in with school. what ever you do don’t try to make matters worse with her if she gets mad or is trying to help you.

629,ex2q8v,False,,2,Homie broke the bro code,AdviceForTeens,"One of my good homies is trying to take the girl i want before i can get to her even though he has a girl.

We met her around the same time and he introduced her to me he told me it qould be good if we started talking maybe something could start between us. About five days ago him and her were chilling with her and her friend things were going good for me until he found out she smoked weed and wasn't as innocent as she was leading people on to belive. He started to get super flirty towards her which pissed me off

He the type of guy that puts hoes before bros and loves the attention girls give him. Whenever he arounda a girl or a group of girls he always switches up making himself seem more grand than he actually is which bothers me.

When they left i tapped him and asked him what he thought he was doing and he just told me ""maybe if you get better game and stop complaining so much girl will stop playing you"" which obviously pissed me off even more

The next day we were chilling at my house and i noticed they were snaping all day.

He broke the bro code and i dont know if i should try and take the girl by force or if shoukd just allow it and move on.

745,dk7ufg,False,,0,My entire life is toxic and I'm not too happy about it.,AdviceForTeens,"So hi, my name is Abby. I'm 16 turning 17 soon and I live with my parents. I'm pansexual. I knew I was pan in about 6th grade and thought I was bi for a long time (First female crush in 3rd grade).  Luckily throughout middle school my friends we're very supporting and nice. 

My parents on the other hand are not. My sister is bisexual (remember this) . My mom was raised Catholic so she's homophobic. Though I can't really blame her, she was practically forced to be. My dad on the other hand, is a known racist atheist. I am also an atheist.  My father and sister the other day had a whole conversation about how pansexuality didn't exist. Bisexuality is binary. Boys and Girls. Trans people is iffy. Pansexuality means that I don't base my attraction on gender identity. 

I'm so afraid of the reaction I'll get if I come out to my family. Afraid to the point where I'm tempted to wait until I move out to come out to them. My parents are also mentally abusive to my sister and I. Telling us both how useless and worthless we are all the time. My sister gets more than me since she's an adult (20) and they can threaten to kick her out on the street. My sister abuses me, but I don't blame her. She's doing a lot for the family and it all goes unnoticed and ignored. So even though we fight and I hate that she does this to me, I know that not all of her aggression is completely towards me. 

Getting past home life, one of my best friends is EXTREMELY homophobic. Even telling me that if I marry a female she won't come to our wedding because ""that's just dumb"".  I once tried to explain what Non binary and gender fluid meant and she again just said ""that's bullshit that makes no sense"" and ""there's only 2 genders. You're either born female or male and that's what you are"" so I can't even get support. To the point where whenever I have a girlfriend and I try to talk about her she fake gags and tells me that it's disgusting. 

How do I get rid of all of this toxicity in my life? Any help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/dk7ufg/my_entire_life_is_toxic_and_im_not_too_happy/,1,,2019-10-20 02:43:34

So, in class, I take all tough classes and I do band. The problem comes with not the classes themselves, but with the homework. It’s taking over my life, and it’s not even been a month. In class, I get stacks of homework. Stacks. But fine, lots of homework is manageable, I can deal with it. But I also have band. Now, our band is super rigorous. We go to after school practice every day for 3 hours - about. And let me tell you, three hours is a lot. But then I have homework to do, my stacks of homework. By the end of the day, it’s 2:00 AM and I’ve finally finished everything I need to do and I can sleep. But... it’s so hard. I can’t do anything other than school.

My weekends can be just as saturated with homework, AND IT SUCKS.

Abort it.

Get an abortion. You have no business being a mother at your age. 

On the plus side, when your kid turns 18 and moves out, you will be 32. 

I would definitely say give it up for adoption, a lot of teen moms get caught up in the emotional aspect of children. ""but I love him/her too much!"" that's understandable, but if you really loved your kid you would let it have the best life possible and, no offense to you, a 14 year old single mother is not the best home with the best opportunities.

Adoption or abortion (depending on how far along you are) is my opinion; you need to think about the quality of life for you and your child. 

No.. :'(

I'm considering adoption. Nobody knows. Pregnancy test? & 2 Months.. Please give me some good advice.

Have you thought about adoption?

Maybe bring in a paper w a fake signature?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/cuzhzb/septum_piercing_advice_needed/,1,"okay 1, you should not post where you want it done at online because this is a international form and people might be able to figure out where you live. And 2 most places have to have your parent actually there for you to get the piercing and they watch you and them fill out the paper work so you can't just ""fake"" the signature. I would wait until you are 18 if a place offers to do it without parent permission that place is doing something majorly illegal. If a place is willing to break the law like that they are most likely a unsanitary and unsafe place to get a piercing done.

579,f91uoi,False,,8,Extra aggravating crush,AdviceForTeens,"I am freshly 18, and ive never ever been interested in someone more than a year younger than me before, but now im interested in a 14 year old who i think is also interested in me.

I thought he was 16ish, not 14, when we started talking, he kept making sexual comments to only me, no one else in our group. Me and him have similar interests and sense of humor, he acts and looks like hes just a year or two younger than me, not 3 and a half... I feel like an awful person for feeling this way but i thought he was older when it developed and the crush has stuck.

Opinions on this and what to do :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f91uoi/extra_aggravating_crush/,1,"Age gap is a bit big now and strange, but you should be good. From all I have read you guys are cute as hell, don't be bothered by what people say. Love is love, and if it is true and honest, it has no boundaries. Just don't pressure him to do anything because that would make you look like a predator. Good luck to you guys, all the best.

Hey! You’re definitely not a bad person for feeling this way, I am 17 gonna be 18 this year and I personally wouldn’t date someone that’s years that much younger than me for the logistics of legality but also you’re probably a senior or gonna graduate soon and he’s a freshmen. 
You won’t be able to keep having this relationship (probably) and you’re also probably a bit more mature than him and you might start noticing that if you decide to date him (could be an issue if fighting or anything like that stats happening). You should talk to him about your feelings. He’s gonna want to do it anyway bc seniors or older people are hot as fuck to lil freshies but keep in mind where he’s at. Do you know why he likes you? Do you have the same goals? Would you be fulfilled without feeling guilty? If your friend were to be dating a person that age, how would you feel about the situation? Do you have siblings that are of similar ages? 

Morally, you’re both in high-school. It’s pretty wholesome right now and you’re not a bad person at all. Feelings are feelings and we can’t help them! And nobody would get hurt if anything happened between you two. You could probably just keep it cute and flirty without putting a label on it, or you could try making it work now. When you’re an older adult in your mid 20’s 4 years age doesn’t matter that much. Jsut try to separate prejudice that society gives us and you’re true personal feelings about it before making a decision.

Check up on your state’s Romeo and Juliet laws. This could be the difference between an illegal and legal relationship (y’all sound like you too would be a great couple tho best of luck)

Thank you for solid advice. I feel like the school thing is tumultuous for me because I havent been in school for years.. im a drop out, we know each other through church. I think that hes honestly really mature in a lot of ways, and me and my sister have a similar age gap and it wouldnt have bothered me if she had dated a 16 year old when i was 16 as long as the conditions were right, yknow? 

Its easy to judge these situations till youre in them because i honestly see him on a similar or same level as me, i dont see him as anything different than me when were talking and together. Its afterwards where i get concerned.. i dont wanna come across as predatory when i really just see him as another teenager, not a child

What would you guys do? Do you like him enough to wait? Do you think he’d look back at this and feel assaulted? If no then I say go with it! I feel not being in it so not understanding. Honestly, if you too are vibing and there’s truly no bad intentions in you then go for it. If he makes you happy and you make him happy than why not. Plus church is a hella wholesome place to meet haha

I think normal dating things just not sex, i like him enough to wait for that stuff, i dont want to rush him into anything and i wouldnt initiate sexual stuff at all with him, thats his choice. 

Like i think snuggling and normal kissing (not fullon making out) and handholding would be okay but anything past that i wouldnt be comfortable doing until he was at least 16.. 

Church is a really nice place to meet and im glad that we met there instead of a school setting to be honest because we have a more authentic friendship rather than just one based off of seeing each other at school. His parents dont force him to come to anything, he chooses to. 

I think im going to see how it goes from this point foreward. Im not comfortable making moves towards him or anything either, i dont wanna pressure him.

I’m really glad! I hope you are happy with him! Y’all sound cute as fuck and you sound super sincere so I hope you find what you’re looking for 😁😁😁

69,ejy6hq,False,,28,I don’t know how to help my girlfriend,AdviceForTeens,"Using a throwaway for this one. 

So my whole friend group (13 year olds) are like depressed, out of the four of us 2 are diagnosed with depression  and stuff, I see a therapist and have gotten out of my depressive state by myself and my girlfriend struggles with depression-like stuff. 

The thing is, I’ve recently started not caring about anything suicidal my friends say. I fucking hate it when people make suicidal jokes and stuff because it kinda triggers me? I don’t know honestly but it annoys me, especially when my girlfriend makes them and I’m like “well you should see someone” and she just makes reasons why she can’t ask her parents to see someone and other shit that makes me think that she doesn’t want help. I’m not spilling the tea on her about “how she’s faking depression” or anything.

Another thing which I need help with is that (we’re both female) she’s really worried about people thinking or knowing we’re dating??? And she goes on a whole rant about why I can’t hold her hand or hug her in public or I can’t even rest my head on her shoulder. I completely understand that she isn’t ready to come out to her parents and stuff but the thing I try to tell her is that most people will just think that we’re good friends or something. It’s like if we weren’t dating it would be completely different if I try to lean on her.

So the thing that I need help with is how to get her help when she just won’t let me try to help, and also how I can tell her she’s overreacting with how cautious she is when it comes to contact.

I really really like her so much but I’ve thought about breaking up, but I can’t because I’m scared she’ll hurt herself or kill herself if I break up with her. Please help me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ejy6hq/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_girlfriend/,6,"YOU need to tell an adult and if you’re not happy end the relationship you have to put yourself first

I’ve been there, but with a group of best friends. Please drop that group and move on. if not now, when you go to high school. When I dropped my friend group like this, I swear to god, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. My life got exponentially better.

while you want to help her, be aware that people use that stuff to manipulate the other person into staying in the relationship and from what you’ve written that’s the vibe I’ve got.

sorta but oh well that’s life

We are in the same age, and I have social anxiety and I am depressed too but I think it has do something with the puberty and I am also in a relationship with a girl (i am a girl too) my mom knows we are dating and when have no problem of being seen in public like you said, people will think u two are besties anyway. You should really make your girlfriend understand and make sure that she understands you, but can i know how long you two have been together?

Thanks, but I don’t know how I’d tell an adult like who would I tell, and what would my gf say? Also your name is perfect

Vine check failed?

Since the 26th of June

the name is my boyfriend’s (i kinda hate it😂😂) but anyone at your school an adult you trust and your “girlfriend” doesn’t treat you well evidently enough

that’s what you think now.  a friendship or friend group defined by its bad mental health does not leave room for growth. when our conversations constantly revolves around staying home and watching anime and shit for hours on end and our terrible lives, it made it so we were all dedicated to non-recovery. we all based our friendship on our depression, and that’s what sent my friend group crumbling. a lot of them are still together, but me and my best friend dipped and started talking to new people, which worked out really well. I got my first real romantic relationships and actual fun friend activities with the new people, who were basically just my acquaintances before then. these next couple years can be really awesome if you surround yourself with people who actually care about you and don’t just brush you off, and when you’re actually able to recover. it doesn’t happen immediately, but it’s super satisfying. 

do what you think is right. I hope things work out for you <3

I’ve told her about it like 3 times already but I might talk to her about it again. She just keeps saying “I overreact everything” and “everyone knows me so they’ll just tell my mum” so I’m lost

Thank you for your advice man, maybe I’ll talk to my friends about how instead of being depressed we can get help and not just be sad and say “same” or “mood” when someone’s like “hey I feel sad today”

Damn that hurts, thanks dude

Lmao what

Ok, thank you. And congratulations for 1.5 years!

honestly? you’re making an effort and she’s dismissing you entirely and you’re still young but that still ain’t a relationship

good :)

Don't forget to ask your girlfriend but when she gets angry or like...sad say ""I love you"" or when you say something aggressive say ""I think you're actions are stupid baby, honey, darling"" probably it'll make her less angry/sad

I have two great online friends. I've known them for a good five years and we've called and texted each other a lot, so naturally I trust them. 
Problem is, my mom doesn't. 
She caught me texting them one night, and the following morning she woke up early, took my phone, and read our conversations. (she does not allow passwords)
She didn't like a lot of things about them, nor did she like the conversations which we had (to be fair, we did use a bit of profanity) Next thing I know, I'm cutting every single contact I have with them. I wasn't even able to tell them what happened, she just wanted them gone and out of my life. 
It's been a while since then, but I've been very sad. They helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, and I had plans to meet them in a few years as well, so it's been very hard to let go. 

Should I continue to let go of them, or should I convince my mom that they're both nice people? I really want to talk to them again, since they were basically there when I had nobody else.

My mom has got a new partner. He has 3 kids: 2 girls and 1 boy. The ""boy"" is already like 20 years old. Youngest sister is 14, oldest is 16. I'm 16 too. Now when my mom and her new partner started to take the relationship seriously, I went to their house, and they came over to ours. I got kinda close to the oldest sister. We told eachother that we wanted to kiss. One night, I don't remember why, the oldest sister was spending the night at my moms. Only my mom, the oldest sister and me were home. We were watching some netflix and my mom got tired so she went upstairs. We kinda sticked around a little longer than my mom told us too, and we kissed. We went upstairs only for her to come into my room (she had her own room and own bed to sleep in) and lay on my bed. I put myself next to her, we lied there for 5 mins when we started kissing again. (I'm thinking about it now and it's really fucked up, I kissed my stepsister basically) It was awkward when we saw eachother again the day after, and a week later when I saw her again, we basically said nothing to eachother. I asked her what was going on. She bluntly said:""There's nothing between us. ""I'm there sitting in my couch, staring at my phone and I'm like: what?""

With some time and distractions such as any hobbies you have you can try and forget about this and try to form a better friendship with her. Also try and refrain from telling her to fuck off, that will just result in more bad memories to erase from your mind.

Hey man, thanks for helping and giving your advice. I told her we shouldn't do it anymore and she didn't agree. She wants to be fwb. I told her no.

Thanks mate it's just  that I am really confused when it comes to crushes. I am not really good at expressing my emotions, I am a very introverted person. Also I am quite shy and even tho my friends keep pushing me I don't think I have the guts to do it.

I'm exactly the same. If you want you could have a friend tell him. That's how my last crush found out.

Yep I was thinking about telling one of my best friends to ask him, but she's pretty crazy and she's gonna mess everythin up. I am gonna keep it to myself I guess until the feelings go away. Even though its pretty hard because I get to see him everyday.

I liked a girl for about 2 and a half years. The first year, nobody knew. I told my best friend and in about half a year, everybody knew. The last year my feelings kinda died down and I think it was better after people knew because I wasn't bottling feelings up inside.

Hmm that's exactly what I am trying to avoid. About you tho, 2 and a half years mate? That's a pretty long time. The longest crush I've ever had was about 6 months and it wasn't the best experience not because he did something wrong but because I am shy as I mentioned earlier and whenever I got the chance to talk him my tongue would stumble and fall

^^^^downvote ^^^^to ^^^^delete

Yes it was a very long time. I wasn't too into her for the last 6 months to a year though, it was just I had nobody else to have a crush on and I didn't have a reason to not like her and I didn't lose all interest. The only reason I stopped liking her is because I moved away. Don't know if I would still like her or not

I see, everything happens for a reason tho mate.

U moved out huh? Was it easy for u man?

No. Second time moving states in my life. I was like 8 or 9 the first time so that on wasn't too hard. This time is. I went to an amazing school and my new school is shit. At the same time I messed up my life by not doing all of my homework. Now I'm on break and supposed to be doing make up work but I just can't find the motivation. I'll stare at it for a little bit and write a little but I just can't do much or get very far on anything. I was getting A's and B's and now I'm prolly gonna finish the semester with 2 C's. For some reason I just stopped caring. After I left my anxiety went way up and now I'm super self-conscious and hate myself. Borderline depressed. All I want is to go back home. It's only been about three months, which felt like a year, but hopefully it will get better.

I see how it is. Well I dont know if my opinion matters but I'll say it anyways. Do u know what the word human stands for mate? In ancient greek ""άνθρωπος = human"" means looking up, trying to touch the sky. There's this latin phrase ""Dum Spiro Spero"" that stands for ""While I breathe, I hope"". Hope is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence. Mate we come from a dark abyss and end to an dark abyss the in between bright part call it life.

When it comes to school and studying walk towards the toughest path and one day u ll arrive.

Thanks

You're very welcome mate",2019-11-26 21:23:40

Dude you're in 7th grade, you're not going to be 4""10 forever (hopefully). Stick with it a but longer and wait till high school maybe, then if you still hate it then quit. If you quit now, you might regret it in the future.

I had a kid who was similar in height and was one of the best on the basketball team in middle school. He had to work harder because the only way he could shoot was if he juked out the guy who was covering him. Just work hard on ball control and make a good fake move.

Isaiah Thomas (not the former pistons player) is like 5'6 and was an mvp candidate like 3 yrs ago and he was more than double your age. Keep at it bro

From what you are describing I think she might use a keylogger (google it) to get your passwords. The savest  way to remove those is to factory reset every device you use to log into those accounts and then change the passwords. When you change the passwords, start with the email account that you use to reset the passwords. If you need more advice ask.

My best friend got in his first serious relationship and I do not like the girl. She has talked lots of crap about me in the past and told everyone that she would take my best friend away from me. Even with that I tried to be nice.... she denied me every single time. Later I decided to have a Christmas party and since she hadn’t been talking to me I didn’t invite her, I even asked my best fiend if that’s okay and he said it’s fine. She got pissed and decided to throw a party the same day. I apologized many times and I decided to cancel my party for her. I was close to a lot of her friends but I never told them how I felt because I didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Later we all found out that she has been talking crap about all of us and she ditched her other friends so they are kinda on my side. We recently we went on a trip for school and we decided not to talk to there group because she gets very jealous when girls talk to my best friend and we didn’t want to deal with the shit talking. They blamed us and started telling people that we were talking shit about them.

Can’t u just get it and hide it from her

I would suggest the same as the previous person. Ask a friend to share an account. Unfortunately I don't see any other way that works in your favor without you getting caught. I'm sorry your mom is that controlling and manipulative. I have a mom that's the same exact way so I've been there. Keep hanging in there

My parents are the same. After they got divorced things got a little easier on me. One thing I failed to realize was they secretly downloaded an app on their phone that connects to mine to show all my search history it literally sends an alert to them if I search up something explicit. I searched up porn hub one time cause I wanted to see what Alabama hotpocket was but it sent an alert to them that I searched it, they didn’t talk to me about it but the way I saw that they see this was I looked at my mail app and it showed that I searched porn hub. It’s called change.org or something. I search up really explicit things cause I’m a curious teenager (it’s nothing super bad, it’s life like sex Ed stuff that I should’ve learned awhile ago but they failed to teach me). It’s really upsetting that they can’t trust me with anything. I have life 360 on my phone to and I’m not allowed out of the house. I’m 15 I feel like I should get treated better but I don’t. I just want to live normal lives like all the other kids.

If you have a friend who doesnt have a parent who monitors their phone just make an account on their phone or do tiktok with them

I don’t see this as being controlling or manipulative. To me it just seems like they’re trying to protect their child but going about it the wrong way.

The fact that any parent puts spyware on their child's phone is controlling and is an invasion of their privacy. Privacy is NOT a privilege it's a RIGHT same as any other human being. There's way to protect your child without putting tracking and spyware on their electronics. At least let your child have the apps and then protect them. Keeping them from being able to communicate with people whether online or otherwise is detrimental to their social well being and is quite frankly inhumane.

Oh xD

113,ekuwcp,False,,2,"Wanting to move out, can’t yet",AdviceForTeens,"I’ve wanted to move out for a while now but the straw that broke the camel’s back is that currently, my very conservative mother has realized that I(17M) like most teens I’m assuming, masturbate and watch porn, and has put parental controls and censorship on all my devices. It’s not the end of the world but it’s irritating. I’ve found ways around them but it’s tough having them constrict what I deem “appropriate”.  They also control my life in a bunch of other, smaller ways. I realize they are trying to keep me safe but it’s becoming too much when I want my own freedom

I’ve gained a bit of perspective of what it costs to live on your own. From what I understand, I would have to take 2 full time jobs which I would be willing to do in order to have my own freedom. But the problem is, I still have to finish my senior year of high school, which I can’t finish and have time for 2 full time jobs(I already have a part time job as well which I could make full time). Finishing high school would obviously open up more job opportunities but I hate having to wait for that. I would go straight into college after but my family wouldn’t be able to afford it, and I don’t want to have to pay off student loan debt for years after, so I’m trying to look into ways to fully pay off my tuition(thinking of saving for few years once I’m living on my own then going back to be a programmer) 
My parents tell me that as long that I live under their roof, I have to obey their rules. I want to move out to avoid that but I can’t. I’m turning 18 in 2 months and am gonna try to make some big steps to change this then but right now I don’t know if there is anything I can really do other then just finish school. I’m sure there will be plenty of things along the way that I haven’t accounted for in my planning or things that will happen that are out of my control, but I am doing my best to plan out my future, atleast financially. 
TL:DR 17yo teen wants to move out from restrictive parents, but wouldn’t be able to afford it having to finish high school.

I unfortunately don’t have much of a choice to be honest. Closest family is my grandma on my moms side who is 3 counties away and would just bring me right back. I’m an introvert and don’t have any friends that would let me live with them. Even if I did run away to live with someone else, I already know my parents would flip and call cops, put out searches etc. I live in a relatively small town so I don’t think I could hide anywhere for long, and when I’m taken back I may be locked up forever. Idk exactly what would happen but it wouldn’t be an improvement. Sadly all we can both do it seems it to wait it out. Best of luck to whatever your situation is as well.",2020-01-06 22:34:44
815,audwgp,False,,1,"i’m so tired of my friend, what do i do?",AdviceForTeens,"i’ve known this friend for like 5ish years, and she’s seriously starting to annoy me. i don’t know exactly what she did but i’m literally around her 24/7, from being in the same friend group as her to being on the same team as her, there’s literally 1 day out of the week i don’t see her, and i’m so annoyed. i sit with her at lunch with our 2 other friends, i have a class with her almost everyday with one of our other friends, and like i mentioned i’m on the same team as her, and at most i’m with said team 4/7 days of the week. 

like i said i’ve known her for so long but we’re not even that close. i tell her some things, like minor problems in my life but i just feel so uncomfortable telling her anymore than that, and she doesn’t bring them up either. but, since i’m always around her (because i’m not THAT close with my other friends in our friend group/on our team) it’s normal for my other friends to leave me alone with her if that makes sense. i just feel like people associate us with each other in a way, since she’s always around me, and i don’t like that for some reason.

i like my other friends better, i feel so much more comfortable around my other friends than i do around her. yesterday we were at another school for a competition with my team. she accidentally got split from us and i was alone with the other 2 girls and it was so relieving to not be around her and as soon as she came back it was like.....stuffy. 

i guess it’s because i’m around her all the time that i feel this way but i just genuinely don’t want to be around her at all anymore. unfortunately for me, i have another 4 day week with my team, 3 days of school with her, and she basically invited herself over to spend the night at my house this weekend because her family’s gonna be out of town. i would tell my mom or one of my other friends i feel this way but i feel like they’d be so surprised because it’s out of the blue, since i normally act like everything’s ok. however, i sometimes am just a dick to her, not on purpose really it just happens. 

i don’t even know why i’m friends with her? we have the same sense of humor but that’s literally it. we don’t watch any of the same shows, like any of the same music, all we have in common is our friends, our sense of humor (a bit), and being on the same team. that’s it. i have so much more in common with my other friends, but this friend in particular has talked shit about the music/shows my other friends watch/listen to, to me, and i don’t really talk about music or shows i like with her a lot cause it’s just not what we talk about so it kinda made me feel bad in a way. 

i genuinely don’t know what to do, because like i said i like my other friends more but i can’t just randomly cut ties with this friend because everyone around me would think it’s weird. i just hate being around her all the time. i don’t really like being around people in general, i get too overwhelmed. i prefer to be alone most of the time so this is a really unfortunate situation for me to be in. i don’t know what to do at all, and i feel like i can’t talk to anybody about it, what should i do?

also, i would sit with the other girls from our team however, one of them is homeschooled and only comes to the school for practices and such, and one has her own friend group (i’m referring to the two girls i mentioned earlier) and i’m just not close with the other people on my team like that. just those 2. and even then, this friend is also friends with them too since we were all hanging out yesterday at our competition so she’d most likely follow me to sit with them. 

EDIT: also i said earlier it wasn’t anything she did but yeah nvm it is, she always asks me to buy her food and tells me to buy new clothes when for example my shoes are dirty and i guess you could say my family kinda struggles financially? and she comes from a rich family so she obviously doesn’t understand but i feel like by now she should. i tell her no because she’ll stand there saying “buy me _____” like 500 times when i’m standing in the lunch line and she won’t shut up and yeah whatever it is isn’t expensive but she always forces me into buying it for her when it’s her fault she never brings food to school/doesn’t buy lunch for herself. and she makes me feel bad about my clothing and always tells me my food looks gross? idk it’s not that big of a deal but it’s genuinely so annoying. and currently she’s spamming my phone because i won’t answer her texts so.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/audwgp/im_so_tired_of_my_friend_what_do_i_do/,1,"This happened to me, I slowly drifted off by saying this that he/she hates and then she will slowly detach because of interests.",2019-02-25 07:10:51

That's awesome you do journalling! Anything counts in my book, as long as you're able to get out the feelings sometimes you can't say in words. Really excited for you, sounds like a great opportunity to do all of that stuff. Motivation is definitely the hardest part of anything and I would say just try to create little goals and focus on one at a time until you complete it. Good luck, you've got this.

769,caos7o,False,,5,sibling stress,AdviceForTeens,"I have a younger brother who has trouble controlling his emotions, he has recently been diagnosed with dyspraxia and fine motor skills. Being extremely sensitive this effects me. Whenever I do the smallest thing that doesn’t involve him he starts crying, blames it on me or has a tantrum. He’s only 10. My mum tells me to go away and leave him alone, but when he calls me names and attacks me it’s real difficult to just walk away and let him win. I don’t want him when he’s older to think if he does something he’ll win and get away from it. But him doing all of this makes me stressed and anxious. From this I usually break down and start crying. The other day my mum called me a disappointment which really hit hard. I don’t know what to do and how to deal with when I get stressed, or how to cope with walking away. Any advice or anything please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/caos7o/sibling_stress/,1,"I would recommend to talk to something like a school counselor about this it always made it a lot easier to talk and explain this stuff to someone that is not in the situation but is nearby i wish you the best

EDIT: spelling

So I first want to say that I’m really sorry your mom said that to you. That’s unacceptable to say to any kid let alone your own. But in terms of your brother, I’d suggest talking to your mom/dad about what your brother does and ask for guidance as to what to do and how to handle it. Another route you could take would be to talk to whoever diagnosed your brother and ask about what you should or shouldn’t do with him and also ask them for guidance. It’s hard not knowing what to do and even harder when there’s someone around who isn’t just “normal”. Best of luck to you.

212,fa1e6l,False,,3,Should I feel like I am in the wrong?,AdviceForTeens,"This is my first post so sorry if I do anything wrong.

&#x200B;

So I live with my grandparents and they are Jehovah's Witnesses. After growing up with their religion I have chosen to not be in it. I am the only child in the whole family still ""in the religion"" and they have called me their only hope which puts pressure on me that I don't want. I have tried before to tell them I don't want to be a part of their religion but when I did they said I was disappointing them after all they have done for me (if i didn't go to when them when I was a year old then i would have gone to my mothers grandparents who i don't know.) and my grandma even cried. Before confessing this I have indiscreetly asked what they would do if I didn't want to be a witness and they said that as long as I am under their house they would take me to church if i wanted to go or not. Growing up in the ""truth"" I know for a fact that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that no one should be forced into their religion.  I was planning on leaving the religion and getting a job at 16 to save up money to be able to live after 18 as they will probably kick me out. But after confessing the first time and seeing their sadness I begun thinking that me wanting to do my own thing is wrong and that I should just suck it up and be unhappy but make them happy which is what I have been doing. Also if I continue to go after becoming inactive people would look at me with disappointment which would hurt me emotionally. I seriously don't know what to think about this so any advice at all is happily welcomed and worshiped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fa1e6l/should_i_feel_like_i_am_in_the_wrong/,3,"You're not in the wrong, your grandparents are. Freedom of religion is a human right. It's absolutely despicable that they expect another autonomous human being to conform to their religion. To me anyone who believes in religion so much as to do that to others is batshit insane and not worth my time.

You may love your grandparents now, but probably over time you'll see they're full of shit. I thought my grandparents were the world because they practically raised me and were nicer than my toxic parents. But then I realised they are just as toxic and full of shit.

If I was you I would stick with their religion, that means a lot to them, and you'd be supported. But I don't believe in religion, it's all one big bullshit, but if you do and it matters a lot to you, you gotta say it. Although it wouldn't be the best thing you can do, you need to think for yourself.

Thanks for the comfort bro. Honestly still being in contact with my dad has been helping because he has giving me advice and i can always turn to him for help. I use to think my grandparents were amazing but they pushed me so much that it felt like a burden and then some things in the religion separates me from my friends so i just wanted to know if i was wrong.",2020-02-27 06:16:06
353,f8h24k,False,,2,The guy I used to like and maybe still do,AdviceForTeens,"

It was autumn, october, everything was new for me expect my best friend, at least I had her among those people I didn’t know. 

I really wasn’t planning on starting to like someone, to have a crush on someone. Mainly because the guy i liked for years hurted me to the point I never want to feel love again. 

One day my best friend told me about this guy( lets call him John). Now my best friend knew John as a really nice and shy guy. She thought it’d be really good if I started to like someone who’s worth it and wouldn’t be like the past guy.

In the beginning I wasn’t interested in him at all, I began to see him every day, every time I would go out and slowly without noticing I had fallen for him. (Also just to put it out there, we were never friends and still are not.)

Now I told my best friend that I started to like him and she was happy because she had hopes that he’s a good person, I also told two other friend about him. Now lets name this other two friends Lola and Laura. 

Me and Lola would kinda be goofy around him because that’s just how I was around my friends and I didn’t want to act different just because I liked John or to impress him( being goofy sometimes around him also doesn’t mean that I was goofing around laughing loudly or talking loudly, basically doing something to get his attention). When I would get jealous Lola would go to John and just look at him angry, also she would call my name every time she saw him. 

In the other side my cousin had a friend who knew John so I immediately told my cousin to ask her friend what kind of person was John,(lets name my cousins friend Pete). 

Pete told my cousin that John wasn’t a good person he was kind of an asshole and very selfish, and that I wouldn’t be his type mainly because I’m not the type of girl to dress those fancy dresses and go to the club every friday. The description that Pete gave my cousin was very very different from what my best friend thought John was, and that was immediately a turn off lets say for me. 
I tried to forget him because I wasn’t prepared to be hurt more just like the last time. 

Now a year has past and John never looked at me last year, maybe sometimes. Now everytime we run into each-other he just stares at me, also we have sport class together, and he always looks at me, my friends always catch him staring at me. 

My question is: Why is he looking at me ?Is it because of the things my friend would do in front of him or he just stares at me without a reason? I know this was long but I wanted an advice from someone who might maybe know the real answer and can help me so I don’t have to haunt my self with those thoughts anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8h24k/the_guy_i_used_to_like_and_maybe_still_do/,2,"It's possible that he likes you. It's also possible that he wonders why you suddenly stopped hanging out with him.

Best way to find out is ask him directly. I know it seems super nerve-wracking to just go up and basically ask ""So I've noticed you looking at me sometimes...What gives?"", But most guys, especially at that age when they're all awkward, would really appreciate you being upfront about it.

Thank you for your advice I wish I had the courage to talk to him. We actually never talked, my best friend knew him from family but they never didn’t talk much, they only talk a little like if they see each other to a family gathering, since he’s very shy with family members.",2020-02-24 06:26:05
0,fcpbui,False,,13,Can't have sex the same,AdviceForTeens,"I'm in a relationship of 2 years, naturally being together for so long we decided last year to start having sex. Always wore a condom, and naturally figured eachother and ourselves out and grew closer. But we had a scare. She felt nauseous and threw up. Scared the hell out of me so we got a pregnancy test. This isn't the first time we've tested before. She's on birth control but I was still scared shitless. The test came out negative fortunately but every time we have sex I get wordied about the condom and pregnancy and I completely lose my sex drive and ability to keep going. 

What do I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fcpbui/cant_have_sex_the_same/,24,"Have you tried trying your hardest to just continue going after you lose motivation?

Maybe start small to build it back up again. Just touching and things like that until you work your way up to having sex. She has to understand how you feel and that would be pretty stupid if not. You could also use this as an opportunity to do other things and just enjoy spending time together without sex. Either way just do what you feel is right after getting more input. Maybe you could try talking to her as well.

The nausea is most likely due to sex not setting well with her the previous night. I would monitor the way she acts as she might be getting sick with the common cold or allergies as mine will cause me to throw up sometimes

I’m sorry

I have, but I don't want to get her to get me going every time. It's embarrassing so I resort to throwing my clothes back on and calling it without making it worse for myself. Thought about enhancements to help me out but I don't want to ge to the point where I can't have sex without them

We talked about it. She didn't have a lot to say just that it's okay and not to worry. She feels like it's her fault and I don't want that at all. Just trying to find ways to not worry so much.

She has a lot of genetic issues that make her feel sick. Since this post we talked about it and she was very understanding. But I still find myself getting worried for maybe half a second and my entire body losing sexual drive because of my concern. It's more of a mental roadblock which is why this issue is discouraging for me

Next time when you do have the motivation try and just focus in on the moment, maybe close your eyes for a few seconds and just embrace the details and focus to try and draw your mind off of other thoughts.

Granted I would kinda blame myself as well so I totally understand that. Maybe if she’s on a more effective birth control method it would help. IUDs are one of the most effective at over 99% for up to 3 years (Skyla). Maybe she’d be open to that.

Definetly don't want to make her put that up there because of my issue. She's mainly on BC to help with cramps due to her mom having shit genes and passing them onto her. It's a pretty tough situation to help myself out of but I just completely lost my sex drive and don't find myself to be as aroused as I was before this all happened

That’s exactly why I got my IUD. Couldn’t deal with the cramps anymore. And I know it seems like a rather large step for her to get one but they really do help with a ton of stuff. Whatever is going on I hope you figure it all out!

Thank you for the help, much appreciated

I wish you the best",2020-03-03 12:39:21

Even though I don't know exactly when you dropped out, that still leaves 3-8 years, so where you just doing nothing for all that time?

Then again, if you were really depressed and anxious to the point of not being able to do anything, why weren't your parents taking you to therapists or putting you on medication?

Now, I was always a boy, who was sensitive, weak but enjoying the books. My father managed to send me to the USA at the age of 15 to come back with a bachelor’s in robotics. This is sort of background. I totally differ from teenagers in my homecountry and think differently than most of the people home in terms of dietary guidelines, political views, tolerance opinions and religious points.

We’ve been talking since, but one thing to note is she has a boyfriend. This dude barely gives her any attention, (even though it may be unintentional), barely hangs out with her, and hasn’t been there for her much– on the other hand, here I’ve been, trying to show how much I care, respect her, and support her. She says she “needs” to be with him. She said it herself though, we talk more than she does with him.
    So last night was this play-thing I went to to support her, because she never said anything about her boyfriend being there— (we had already talked about this happening weeks im advance), and so as I’m chilling at the table waiting for it to start, her boyfriend walks in and sits right near me. Keep in mind, he barely knows I exist. 
    As you can tell things weren’t about to go smoothly, because she knew I liked her & that she had slight feelings for me as well. After the play, she comes off the stage and hugs her boyfriend right in front of me, since I was literally right there. Something hit me at that moment and I realized I liked her more than I thought because I pretty much bawled my eyes out afterwards. So I had to walk out of the school without even getting to congratulate her. I didn’t because I didn’t want to make anything suspicious / out of respect for him & her.
   The same night at around 8:00pm, she texts and asked if I was alright. I was blunt and told her no, and she responded with a ton of empathetic & meaningful I’m so sorrys— she didn’t know he would be there. But I had to tell her how I felt, so I said it. “Maybe we should pump the breaks. I’m really into you, and I’d rather not be the one lurking behind you & him for months at a time as y’all keep getting closer, and then get too attached. I honestly care for you a lot, and I want to be with you. Just let me know how you feel.” — she responds with something along the lines of “I want to be him but I also want to be with you, idk it’s just really confusing.” I told her to give it time, but honestly I don’t know if I can wait much longer knowing they’re in a relationship right now.

The thing is, she said she felt the same, but never showed as much as me and sometimes I felt like I was the only one trying to make our relationship work. We had great moments together and sometimes I could see in her eyes she loved me.

We were going through a strange week, we didn't have much to talk about and at the end of that week she told me she was confused about us, that wasn't the first time she said that. I asked if it was a phase and what she wanted to do, she answered ""I don't know"" to both questions. I said I didn't want to be with someone that wasn't sure she wanted to be with me, she just apologize and we say goodbye. 

She tried to reach me two days later saying how much she missed me and how much she loves me, I was heartbroken and told her how much she hurt me, with all her confusion and everything else she did, like blowing me off and how she didn't seem to like me as much as I liked her. She apologized once again and said she wouldn't ""bother me anymore"". My last messages were:
-you don't bother me
-I wish we could solved this
-but I don't know how.

I can't stop thinking about her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ezhs9a/did_i_rush_myself/,3,"Well first of all saying I love you shouldn’t take like 6 months or whatever. If you both are ready to tell each other you love them then it’s fine. I’ve dated people for like 2 weeks and started saying I love you. Also no I don’t think you rushed the break up. Maybe. It seems like the relationship got boring. You maybe stopped giving her love and affection, or maybe she stopped giving you love and affection so eventually it got boring. That’s normal. I personally think it was a good idea to break up with her. If she was questioning the relationship she probably would have caused you problems too in the long run if the relationship kept going. I’d work on yourself for awhile and just not date until you’re absolutely sure you want to again. That’s just my point of view. But you do you. Trust your gut I guess.

Holy fuck i relate to this. Dont have any advice as im still trying to get over it months later.

Yeah I guess I need some me time. 
My gut tells me to go after her and try to get back together, but I don't think I should do that, it's just... I feel this emptiness in my chest.
Maybe she got bored of me, I don't know.
I'll try to give time to time and maybe someday I'll know what to do.
Thanks for the comment, I really needed a outsider's view.

Yeah I feel you. I've been trying to feel my kind with other things to try to get over her, but I just can't. I think it's because deep inside I hope we will still work things out. 
I just had this ideia, that I'll wait a few days to put in practice. I'm writing down my feelings, trying to be honest to her and mostly to myself. I wanna know after these days what she thinks about all of this. Maybe she'll be sure about her feelings then. If she likes me we might try again or else this will be the ending of this chapter and I can finally move on.
Are going through that as well? Do you still believe things between u can work out someday?

The problem is, unlike you, she broke up with me bc she didnt want anything serious, while i wanted to fucking marry her someday. Our classes are over and we changed schools, and she was with another guy when i said that i didnt want to see her face anymore. But i was wrong, here i am, 4 months later, wishing i never said those words and missing her so much. I will only get to see her once more in a 15 yo party that will happen in 02/15, but thats it, ill never see her anymore. I just wanted her to come at me and say like “hey, i think i was wrong and i want to date you again, this time lets work things out”, but this is impossible as she don’t care about anything. I have no hope. I mean, she didnt say that she hated me or anything like that, she wanted us to still be friends, but i couldnt handle it. Maybe we can get back together one day, but we will only meet once and for the last time and i dont think she wants another relationship with me.

You could start telling her you're sorry about what you said. In the end you might not be with her and find someone else you love way more, but the feeling of ""what could've been?"" It's horrible. Just text her, u never know, she might miss u just as much.

She dont, i actually did not say this to her, some friends of mine said that she made up with another random guy and i told my friends i never wanted to see her again. And she doesn’t miss me because she is the kind of person who dont give a shit about things. If my girl friend asked her what she thought about me now, knowing her, she’d probably say “oh, that guy? Never thought of him anymore” I should probably text her though, just like you said

Fuck I know that type of girl. But that's it, u never know. Go ahead, I hope you the best.

Thanks, my friend said she have been feeling lonely bc she havent talked to anyone from my old class lately and maybe she will regret this. I think you should wait a little and then ask her what is on her mind, then depending on what happens u can try to get together again",2020-02-06 06:28:58

Advice

I  became friends with someone about 6 months ago and I thought everything has been going fine. We have shared some really personal stuff. But for the past couple of weeks I’ve started to notice something. I’m the one that always swipes up first on snap if he posts about something that he’s hurt about and etc, but never swipes up if I posted something I was hurt about. If we are on break from school, we could go 3 weeks without texting each other. He’s also very popular and has very close friends (like they have been friends since 3rd grade and are bonded through Christ) and I’ve been thinking that he’s using me for emotional support because I don’t know of any other reason that he would want to be friends me (just for the record, I’m a really good person and all). What should I do? I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m crazy or anything lol. Another thing, I honestly don’t know if he even cares about me, but I feel like I care more about him. I don’t want to waste my time on someone that doesn’t care about me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erclfh/i_need_some_advice_please/,6,"hmm i think thats ur relationship with him are just friends like for example i have friends that share secrets with me and i also do it to them.although during holidays we even hardly talk to each other.for close friends it will be different.  at least this is what i do. i am sry i could not help u much

hmm idk much but maybe he just wanted to socialize more and make more friends? idrk tho

462,deli1u,False,,3,I want to be my old self again,AdviceForTeens,"Hi! I'm 17 years old and don't know what's happening with me. I want to be my old self again. 

When I was in elementary, I was a really good student (please, I'm not bragging). I was always at the top in our class. I get high scores and grades. When I graduated elementary, I was the one who has most medals. When I took an entrance exam for a science high school, I was in rank 27.5 out of 200+. Yeah, I think I was doing great as a student.

Not until I reach high school tho. That was the time I started to lose my grip in acads. I started to have lower grades (but still passing) and I struggle in acads especially exams and quizzes and recitations. Still, I managed to pass and have a with Honor Award until the end of junior high (Grade 10). 

As I reached grade 11, Senior high, this is where I get worse. I can't focus and concentrate anymore. I struggle learning and listening in our class and discussions because my mind is always blank or always easily distracted. I daydream a lot. Whenever I review for our quizzes, I find it so difficult to review because the information I read doesn't retain in my head and i suck at memorizing now, unlike before, I was really good at memorizing. 

There was a time, I reviewed and studied for our quiz but at the time and moment of answering the quiz, my mind was blank! All the information I studied and reviewed was totally gone! I do not remember anything at all! I failed the quiz and I only got a score of 16 out of 45. I only got 16 because I managed to copy my classmate's answers. 

I was very frustrated. I'm not being lazy or anything. I can't seem to focus anymore. I am so unmotivated and I don't know why. I want to be the ""good"" student again. 

Now, I have realizations and thinking about the past. When I was 11 years old, grade 5, that was the time I  started to struggle more often in acads. And that was the time too when my dad's illness became worse and he started to become more really weak and thin. That was the time too when I started doing self harm and suicidal thoughts (but not much). I thought they were normal and I have this thinking before of harming other people like torturing them or something but that kind of thinking was eventually gone when I reached grade 6 (but self harming and suicidal thoughts did not stop). I don't cut myself, but I do punch or hit myself with something like bottles or hammer. 

Since grade 5, I did not saw my dad smile again and I was really studying hard for him. When I was in grade 6, I thought that in our graduation, I'll see him smile. I told him that he'll be the one who will be on the stage with me so he'll put my medals on me. Unfortunately, 12 days before our graduation, he died, and I witnessed how he died. The day before his death, he called me and I saw him lying in his bed, very weak that he can't even open his eyes. I went near him and he was raising his hand, so I held it. He told me the words that hurt me so much, he said to me, ""I'm sorry, I cannot attend your graduation anymore."" And that was his last words to me.

Grade 7, 13 years old, the time where my suicidal thoughts became worse and the start of me being so unmotivated in school and struggling on focusing. At that time, I searched on the internet about my suicidal thinking and there appeared about mental illness and depression. But I don't want to self diagnose lol

My ""depression"" became worse when I was in Grade 8. Everyday, I always think how I'll kill myself. I also had this situation wherein Everytime I'll sleep, I'll dream! I have this condition since I was in grade 7. I thought it was cool since dreaming in sleep makes me feel like I'm in another world or something but then eventually I found it very annoying and tiring! I wake up very tired because of dreaming and I feel like it's making me insane! In about 1 and a half years, there was no single sleep where I'm not dreaming. 

Thankfully, I managed to get rid of ""depression"" when I started writing in a diary/journal when I started to have interest in stationeries.

Another thing about me is that I daydream too much and I have characters. I started doing this when I was 5 years old but I think that is normal. The thing is, up until now, I daydream like a kid and it's worse. Why? Because it distracts me so much and I cannot focus with the things I do because of it. There is so many triggers of my daydreams. 

Addition, I do not like being with my friends often because I wanted to be alone because if I'm alone, I can daydream more and I can have moments more with my characters. The urge is too much. 

I have a best friend character named Coco and I like being with him. I don't like him romantically. He is my best friend so yeah, it's fun being with him.

I'm emotionally numb too, unless I am with my ""characters"" or daydreaming. There were times that my classmates were emotional but I was confused because why am I not feeling anything. Sometimes I fake to have emotions which results to me doing inappropriate emotions or expressions in some situations. 

Another thing is that I often find it hard to sleep because I am daydreaming. Even though I am really sleepy, my brain keeps on daydreaming which makes me struggle to sleep. 

I know that all of this looks like now making any sense but I haven't shared this to anyone. I want to know what is with me. I want my old self back. I want to be the person again who can focus and concentrate in her studies and have good grades. I want to be the motivated student again. I want my old self. Please give me advice, please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/deli1u/i_want_to_be_my_old_self_again/,2,"I daydream a lot too,I think a lot of people do,maybe it’s just part of who you are,think on the bright side, maybe you are somehow a good writer,maybe try to write again,studies don’t mean everything,but that doesn’t mean you should drop it, maybe try to sit down and sort everything out yourself,if you daydream again,you can write and get it out of your brain. It’s different for everyone on how they are able to concentrate,for me I usually listen to music or even watch a YouTube video while also studying,it actually helps me concentrate better. Find your own way to just ya know,concentrate. If it still doesn’t work,this is the world trying to say taht thsi is who you are now,maybe you are a good writer or something else you are good at.

Thank you, this helped me. I don't have any experience on writing stories and such. If I try to write my daydreams, I feel like I'm wasting my time to it because I'll be really into writing it hehe. Music is great, I'm a pianist and a violinist, but studying with music is not helping me because it will trigger my daydreams and music is the most trigger. I listen to relaxing music or like rain, wind, etc. sounds while studying too but sometimes I avoid them as well because they make me sleepy. Yes, I'm trying to find ways that'll help me on studying and concentrating but for now, I still can't find the right one lol. 
Thank you, again! And also, what is your problem? I'm willing to know and help you 😊

Thank you! This helped me. I'll try to search about tulpa. Actually, I've never heard of it and thank you for telling me! 
Not sure if Coco is acting on his free will tho...

I don't know how to finish or end the chapter if I daydream but I'm trying to learn how. Also most of my daydreams is that I'm with my characters the whole day and then at the end of the day, I'll sleep or sometimes we sleep together in a room and if I daydream the sleeping part, it makes me sleepy.

Yeah I daydream a lot and Coco is just really distracting me most of the time 😅, not only Coco, they are many! But there are only 4 characters who have names, the others don't have names yet. Just this day, when I was in a vehicle, I was daydreaming too much and then we passed my destination! So I had to walk back to my destination lol 😅 

Anyways, thank you for your advice! I'll keep it in my mind and heart",2019-10-08 00:05:14

They say they were there for me when it came to my passions and interests but they never actually were. I’ve missed out on a lot of my life because of myself and also because of their discouragement. Until recently I never thought I was capable of learning the things I wanted to learn or doing the things I wanted to do; I was isolated and in online school with no friends or socialization. I’m in public school now and I’m finding it difficult being happy for other people especially my friends. I’m accidentally envious towards them and I don’t mean to be, how can I change this behavior tho? For example, a lot of them are really into music. I am too, I’m a sound engineer but I don’t know how to play any instruments and when they talk about playing and performing I get really upset even if I try to stop myself from getting upset. It still upsets me, I think it’s because I wish I had that skill and I’m working on it, but it’s not something I’m capable of doing in the same way right now. Any advice? It’s just jealousy in general, like they’ve all known each other since they were little and I’m just kind of here. It’s getting better but it’s also getting worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/elws5s/how_can_i_be_happy_for_other_people/,2,"I would suggest taking it until you actually feel less jealous. Like when someone says how they love performing, say ""you're great at it too."" And if you keep saying positive things to people, you will start to believe them too. 
If you others success start to weigh down on you, remember what you enjoy, what you do, and if you think you're not measuring up use that to propel yourself into success.
Basically, fake positivity until you are positive. With others and yourself. 
I hope this helps.

I do that already, but if it’s helping it’s very slow. Like last time my friends performed I made sure to support and encourage them and talk to them after their performance just sucks that I’m not at that point yet with certain things. Everyone progresses different ig and I gotta understand that thanks tho.",2020-01-09 02:38:05

And to add on as of yesterday his best friend who touched me is now dating his younger sister. 

Update: 

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails and then the whole friend group turned on me even this girl named Sam who I was friends with and told the day after it happened

I have no clue what to do anymore I hate my body. I hate myself I can’t even have sex anymore because of how disgusting I feel all my anxiety and panic attacks came back that’s been gone for years and now I just destroyed his whole family and friend group and I also lost all my friends and no one believes me and I didn’t even want to tell my boyfriend because I felt this would happened and now I’m just so scared and sad",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eb7m17/my_boyfriends_best_friend_touched_me_during_a/,2,"that is not ok and you definitely need to tell him, especially since he started dating your bfs younger sister.

Best thing to do is tell your boyfriend what has happened. R u scared that it’ll cause drama? If so, please don’t be. Especially looking out for the younger sisters best well being you will need to tell your boyfriend what happened so that the same thing doesn’t happen to her.

If they're genuinely harassing you then... that's time to get the police involved. I'm sorry this is so so scary for you! But it's not going to fix itself by hiding under a blanket :(

That’s absolutely awful! I’m so sorry for you, I hope you’re okay. I feel you should definitely tell your boyfriend especially for the safety of his sister. I experienced something similar of a much lower degree and I was very conflicted and upset, but I told my boyfriend in the end and two years later I feel it was definitely the right call. I really hope things work out better for you soon.

Tell your boyfriend, eventually his sister his parents your parents, documents. Tell him to stay tf away from you. I'm so sorry sweetie. Text me if you ever need to talk I was sexually assulted by my best friend about a year ago too. It's okay, you're gonna be okay you need to tell people

Tell your parents as well as screenshot and record any of those messages they’re sending you. What he did is not ok neither is what his family doing to you now. You are not at fault for what’s happened he is, he took advantage of you and that is not ok. The decision is yours but you can go to the police, or your schools guidance counselor as well and tell them the situation.

Here's my question what's your boyfriend doing about hugs mom and sister

You should probably talk too someone or go to therapy, block his family, If he doesn't want to talk to his mom and sister then leave him. The abuse from them won't end

I’m so sorry this happened to you. Stay strong ❤️

don’t have sex if you can’t right now. it’s not your fault. fuck the people not listening to you.

police now, probably 💚

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails

So I’m in a WhatsApp group chat with me, Rachel and our 2 other friends (I’ll call them Ellen and Jessi) and Ellen is also bisexual so I renamed the group chat as a joke to “Bisexuh0es” and then Rachel changed it to “Bisexuh0es and Jessi” and I said 

“wait? Rachel are you bi?” 

And she said

“Yeah I am”

And then I said without thinking

“Wow I used to have a crush on you but I thought you were straight” 

And she was like “I had a crush on you too” 

So then I messaged we privately after that and asked her to be my girlfriend and such etc etc. So this was on the 16/1/20 and we had a school trip on the 19th-23rd and we were sharing a room with our friends throughout the trip and we were hugging in the rooms and holding hands and such and yeah 😂☺️. I know that the relationship is moving quite fast but, it’s been fine that way so far and I kind of want to kiss her (that sounds so weird but) and I don’t know how to go about doing it I mean with Valentines Day coming up I might do it then but I’m just nervous on what to say.

Haha that's awesome! I just realized I clicked on your notification of following me, and then I must have clicked on one of your posts. I thought this was recent... embarrassing hahaa

Actually, you probably should ask if she's comfortable with kissing you before doing it. Consent is always important and she may not be okay with you just going straight for a kiss if she's not comfortable with that. 👍

Thanks George! I’ll take your advice. Please add me on snapchat @jagkanhetahana

Laughing in class is wayy better than burping

636,esduq6,False,,2,2 years of this is too long...help,AdviceForTeens,"Alright so here’s the thing. I’m a (F) in highschool and my best friend is also a (F) in highschool. We’ve been close for a few years but in 8th grade, I started to question my true feelings for her. I thought nothing of it really at first but when we went roller skating with our friends, that’s when I realized she may mean something more to me. We did the couples skate because that was the last skate of the night and we didn’t want to stop skating. We had to hold hands the whole time because that was the rule to do the final skate. I felt really nervous for “some reason” but again, didn’t think much of it. In 9th grade, things got interesting. She shared some really personal stuff with me, one thing being that she was confused about her sexuality and everything. She even said that she thought she liked one of our friends (F). That night, I did something bravely stupid. I almost kissed her. I got closer and closer but I ended up not going through with it cause I didn’t want to ruin our friendship or anything. At this point, she thought I was straight which confused her even more. After that night, she texted me as soon as I left saying that she missed me and everything, we also shared overnight phone calls moving on after that. Long story short, things were revealed and she implied that she might feel the same way that I thought I felt about her. This little flirtatious and leading on stage went on for a few weeks. All changed after she “talked to a school counselor” and revealed that they said she was just confused. She told me this of course after I fully confessed how I really felt which took a lot. She sent me really long paragraphs basically praising me and saying that she needs me in her life basically. After that, she started acting a little differently towards me and I noticed right away. She wasn’t as touchy and she just treated me very differently overall. It made me really sad. We had a sleepover with our other friend and we had a 4am “confession” time and she revealed that she doesn’t wanna be gay but she doesn’t know her sexuality. She also revealed that she thinks or thought she liked this one guy in her class. After our friend fell asleep, I started blabbering and talked about that night and basically revealed that that night was messing me up and I’ve been feeling a certain way ever since. She acted like she was asleep for a while but after I put a blanket over her, she said very sleepily, “you should’ve just done it” of course I was shocked and like so confused. That all messed me up even more. She started acting so distant after that confession night and she ended up taking a break from me and our other friend all summer. The WHOLE summer. No contact with us at all. It was later revealed when she came back into my life that it was partly because of me and everything that happened. A guy friend of ours that just recently came into our lives (whom she had feeling for apparently) helped us kinda get closure from that whole situation but I’m still left sad. Ever since she’s been back, she’s been acting more like how it used to be. Overnight calls every night, she wants to hang out all the time, engages with me, all touchy and stuff. I feel like there’s no way she doesn’t at least feel the same even a little bit. Not with everything we’ve been through and everything we continue to go through. I’m still confused on my feelings for her constantly but I know that I love her. I don’t know if it’s in a different way than a best friend but it’s a strong feeling. I get jealous and upset and sometimes mad at her for no reason which I feel really bad about...what do I do and what does this all mean??",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/esduq6/2_years_of_this_is_too_longhelp/,1,"So do you know if you like her, in like a more relationship way? Or is that what your asking, like your not sure if you have feelings for her or not? Because if you do I would say talk to her about it see what’s going on see if she has feelings for you, which actually sounds really hard thinking about it because I know I couldn’t Do that if I tried, but maybe when she said that you should’ve just done it, maybe this is your second chance to do it, not many of those happen like this. If you got one take it, They don’t happen too often.

I’m just totally confused on where she stands in all of this. She’s giving such mixed signals when I’m trying to be pretty clear or I have been. Yes, she did say that I should’ve just done it and then after that is when the whole situation came into play where we got “closure” from that night when I almost kissed her. She told him that she doesn’t feel the same way and she feels really bad about it but there are so many reasons why I don’t think that’s true, even if it’s just a little shred of feeling or confusion or whatever. The fact that she’s confused is confusing me and making me question where I stand and everything.",2020-01-22 23:50:46

No problem. Be safe! Condoms plus birth control will save you from life-long regrets. Many people don't show any signs of an STD infection, even when they can still pass the infection to you. Many women who have fertility problems can atribute it to scarring from and STD that they never knew they had. If you're having sex, condoms are the best way to decrease your chances of getting an STD. If buying them in person is too much to deal with, remember you can buy them online! And in most towns there will be at least one clinic that can hook you up with free birth control!",2020-03-01 12:19:44

Socialize and have barbeques. If you have a car, take them out to fun stuff. Keep texting your friends, and whenever they invite you to parties, become a social butterfly.

For example, this is the worse he's done to me,  it might not sound like much but it really hit close to home.  When I would be hanging with my friends after school, he would never tag along even after we ALL begged and begged he LITERALLY said he'd rather play games 😒. So I left him.

When we started dating, the very next day D.H went up to me and told me not to date F.D and to be with him instead.  I WAS SHOOK. And at that time,  I still had feelings for D. H because the reason we broke up in the first place was because he didn't act like we really loved me when I knew for a fact that I did.  So,  I broke up with F.D and went with D.H to give him another chance. He was a better person but I started to hang out with F.D again and.... cheated.

589,f5lgr3,False,,0,Bashed by ex friend for something I didn’t do.,AdviceForTeens,"Sorry if this is a bit long, I barely post on Reddit.

So today, at school, I was bashed by my 
problematic ex friend on the basis of the statement that I supposedly shit talked all my friends. Which I didn’t, besides one, the girl who bashed me, and it was more like criticism because she has been doing lots of bad stuff recently, and all the others had been talking about her too. But I didn’t talk about the others.

On Sunday I get a dm from my best friend, saying that I shit talked her according to problematic friend, not to deny it because she know what I had said, how I better be careful what I do next and how it really hurt. I thought back to see if I remember doing so, which I didn’t. Got a bit mad and explained I had not done so, which didn’t garner a response. 

I send the dm to my other best friend, who said she believes that problematic friend is trying to both kick her and I out of the friend group, and I agree. However she comes back with a dm from the previous friend explaining that I had also shit talked about her?? Which I also knew I hadn’t. Confused. I said that yet again, I didn’t, and I get left on seen, twice. So then I asked the problematic friend nicely at first whether she had said that I shit talked my friends to them. She denied, and instantly said “I don’t need your bullshit, fix this yourself” and stuff like that, even though first friend explicitly said that problematic girl says this.


I leave it be, and announce how I’m leaving the group as I had other friends that treated me better, and I didn’t need toxicity and how they didn’t listen to me. No response either. Whatever, I guess. Then today came, and problematic girl told my boyfriend that I was to be bashed. She sees me, and starts yelling obscurities, and I told her to piss off. She comes up to me, and I try to de-escalate by saying how I didn’t want to fight, and how I wouldn’t hit her, and we could talk about this normally, to no avail, she threw a punch to which I blocked. However I’m a really really weak fighter, so I lost, she threw me to the ground and I just shielded myself as she threw punches at me and kicked and pushes, left school after that with all the kids laughing and filming.


I know I’m not in the wrong. The situation they brought up where I supposedly talked shit was misunderstood by a metric fuck ton. 
I went to get books from my locker, friends ditched me, and I was too tired to look for them. So I found problematic girl and her friend, sat with them for a bit. I brought up how I was ditched, but I didn’t really care and how I thought they were mad at me or something, and they must of taken this as shit talking. But I know I didn’t, I have no reason to, and I loved these friends. 

My question now is, what the fuck do I do? I’m thinking of moving schools, because I have no other friends, my bf is possibly going to break up with me after this, and getting those friends back is not an option sadly.

My mom just came downstairs to have a ""chat"" about the relationship between my sisters and I. My sisters both go the university while I'm still stuck in high-school. I usually can not get a conversation going with my mom because she thinks I have a bad attitude and don't try to make friends. I get really pissed off everytime my mom tells to change and make some friends at school. It's not like I don't try to make friends, but the girls in my grade are very materialistic and really enjoy gossiping. I'm not that type of person to go around and start spreading rumours. Therefore, I'm only acquaintances with the girls. I'm more better off talking to boys cause they're chill and fine with the jokes I make. After all, the guys don't take the things I say to heart. On the other hand, my mom doesn't like the idea of me having friends that are boys because they are guys. I have a cousin and that's like the closest friend I've got. However, I don't tell him my secrets because it's highly likely that he'll tell my sisters. My sisters are always busy cause they're in university. Sometimes they're not as busy, so we try to sit down and try to talk. Once I start talking another talks over me and completely ignores me. My mom always tells me to be nice and listen to others, but they don't do the same and take advantage of it. What can I do, can anyone tell me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f66qkf/i_dont_know_what_to_do_now/,3,"For the first part, I think you need to be more open about the girls around you. Unless you're in a super small high school, it's not possible for every single girl to be like you described. When I was in high school, I easily found people that are not like you described. Maybe it's just where I went, but I promise theres a group out there for you :) I'm not trying to sound like your mother, because I understand how pushy parents can be sometimes. What are your interests? Would you be willing trying out clubs or sports or other school activities? Do you like anime, drawing, singing? 

I felt the same way as you when I first started high school. But honestly, in the long run, the people you make friends with in high school almost never make it into your adult life. So dont stress much about it. 

With the second part, and your sisters... unfortunately since you're the youngest it's going to be hard to earn respect from them. Try your best to stand up for yourself and let them know how upset it makes you. If you have a decent relationship with them, they should try to understand.  Good luck with everything, I wish you well

Try and talk to your mom about how the girls at school are and why you socialize with guys better, don’t let her control your social life like that and just keep being yourself. As for interacting with your sisters, just ask them to respect your turn when you are speaking and not to talk over you. If they continue then in my opinion it’s not worth trying to talk with them if they just keep talking over you.

I've told my mom about what the girls are like in my grade and school, but she doesn't trust me. Thanks for suggesting what I should do with my sisters tho!

Doesn’t trust you as in she doesn’t believe you?

399,erpwhj,False,,1,Love... its complicated,AdviceForTeens,"So me and this guy met through a friend. Lesta call my friend Maria and let's name him John. Maria and a couple of girlfriend were going out, when a big part of the canceled plans. So Maria and me decided to postpone it, when later she called me telling me that she would be going out with a couple of her friends, and invited me. 

I agreed and off we went. I was introduced to John. MAN DID I FALL FOR HIM. As cliche as it might sound, we clearly made a click. He is just so sweet and attentive and just wow. By the time, he had something going one with this other girl, lesta call her anne, but stuff want working for them and they were breaking it off. 

So we met and it was nice, we chatted for hours like if we had been friends for years. We exchanged numbers and everything was great.  Me being me, I decided to make my move when I thought Anne and him were over, a couple of weeks passed and he hadn't talked about her, so I assumed they were over. 

We CLEARLY flirted back and forth, he started calling me sweet names and became veeery sweet with me, I obviously showed the affection back. And so a couple of days ago, we were talking on the phone when I asked him about Anne. 

Well, little did I know that THEY HAD BEEN DATING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THEN and he didnt tell me! Like, he knew we had something going on, and like I wouldn't be mad to keep him as a friend. 

I like him so much, that i would gladly accept friendship, I care about his happiness. And since we flirted, we opened up to each other and stuff, it did hurt a little when I got the news. Well, he now knows that I know about their relationship. 

When out of nowhere, he sent me something about being me really hot and stuff, complimenting me and I dont even know now. 

I'm in a weird position at the moment, I dont know how to feel or do. Like I said, I dont mind him as a friend, I just want to be in his life (not force myself into it obviously) but I just want his happiness. 

Maria (our friend) decided to invite me to go out with another guy friend and another girl friend, when out of the boom she is like ""oh, and John is comming"" when I already accepted the invitation. 

I really want to see my friends but my feelings are mixed about him. We will be going out on Sunday, so I've got this week. 

What should i do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erpwhj/love_its_complicated/,2,I mean things won’t be awkward unless you make it awkward.

219,f76904,False,,5,Am I ever gonna be a normal happy teenager?,AdviceForTeens,"I posted here a few days ago and since then things have gotten worse. 

My thoughts have lead me to wanting weed and to run away over the past few days. Nothing unordinary has happened so I don’t understand what is wrong with me. 

My mood just switches so quickly, for example: earlier today my mum and I were watching tv and I lashed out because she started talking over the program. I wasnt even that invested in the program so I don’t understand why?

This night too (it’s currently 5:15am as im writing this) my mentality hasnt been the greatest. I’ve had thoughts about becoming annorexic or bullimic and each thought that has consumed me tonight has lead me to suicide. 

You’d think I’d be happy that I have group therapy sessions to go to over easter, or that I have a 1-2-1 therapy session coming up (Im on a 6 month waiting list for that). You’d think I’d be happy that I’ve come in contact with an old friend. You’d think i’d be happy that I have everything I’ve always wanted such as a puppy, a cat, a computer, a big room. But none of this stuff makes me happy at all and I don’t understand why. Why don’t I feel happy or privileged that these things are happening in my life? I really don’t understand. 

The only reason I think I’m unhappy is because of me, I’m me. Im fat, vile, disgusting. Im horrible to everyone, rude to everyone I meet. I dont listen to people, I dont listen to instructions. I zone out and get clouded with my thoughts then when I zone back in I feel terrible for missing what people say and I zone out again and tell myself “Im so stupid” or “Just f**king listen to them”. But I cant zone back in and its often too late when I do. Its the same with people giving advice. I can’t take it. I try to, I try so hard to but instead go back to old habbits that I cant seem to change. 

I’ve tried getting help from an online friend but he doesn’t seem to understand anymore, not like he used to. He helped me with issues with my ex, he calmed me down when my ex spoke about killing himself, he calmed me down when I thought this other girl was trying to get with my ex and he liked her too. But I lost everything with him because my anxiety spiraled out of control. No one knew how much I cried the five months I was so scared of losing my ex. I cried atleast twice a week. Two of the months I cried so much over him but he never cared. He’d just disappear and make me wonder again. He’d make me think he’d killed himself, or that he hated me. 

When we ended things, he proved how much he hated me. I was high when we officially brokeup but he’d hinted that he wanted that for weeks and I didn’t notice until I was stoned out of my mind and happy for the first time in so long. And its weird because I stayed happy for a few days after. The day we ended things he said he’d “found someone else” and said “she helped him when he was going through things”. And now I look back at that, I wish I was that person, I wish he loved me back and trusted me too. 

The past month I’ve been feeling what I didn’t when we brokeup. I’ve wanted to message him, show him how much I loved him. But was it really love? He didn’t love me back? So was it just an attachment? 

I get attached easily, I trust easily too. Thats something else thats wrong with me. I should know I can’t trust people when they’ve already given me a reason not to, but I just dive into the deepend and trust them all over again, I dont just dip my toe in to see if I can, I keep diving in and drowning all over again. Sometimes its the same people, sometimes its new people. But I let go of the anxiety for a moment then realise I’ve done this wrong again and it’s going to go terrible. 

Thats something I think about alot. I think about this when it starts to get dark, I think about how I cant get myself into college, I think about how much I weigh, I think about how ugly I look, I think about the scars on my arms, my stomach and legs. I think about everything. And then I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep until I pass out. 

Its a loop that is like a neverending tournado that I cant escape and Im stuck in going around and around. I cant sleep, so I can’t get myself to college. I cant get to college, so I cant see friends and people that make me happy. I cant see these people, so I get sad and selfharm. I selfharm and start eating to try and feel bettwr. Then I cant sleep because I ate at the wrong time. 

And I don’t know when its going to end. Maybe it’ll end when my sleep schedule becomes normal again? Maybe it’ll end when I learn to grow up? Maybe it’ll end when Im dead? 

To growup I need to be happy though right? To be dead i’d have to not be scared of killing myself? To fix my schedule.. I dont know. Im lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f76904/am_i_ever_gonna_be_a_normal_happy_teenager/,3,"It will deffinatly get better when you're older, it's just puberty, cause it sucks. 
Start by doing small things that give you satisfaction, such as helping people or whatever. When you get older and begin to start a life it will be completly differentnas you will see things in a different light 
Also, try to set small goals that give you satisfaction as it will also take your mind off things

You could also try things like exercise, a healthy diet, read more and a better sleeping pattern, as these have been know to release serotonin and just improve ones standard of living. Try to force yourself to not self harm (I would also reccomend seeing a doctor or telling someone about that) and try to keep your diet and sleep at the correct times, you could set alarms through the day to tell you when to eat and when not to. To try and not self harm try to spend the night with someone who's supportive and will help,  and please seek more help, whether it be a professional or simply a teacher or family member. Also, remember that you matter so much.

In my opinion, a supportive friend group is a key factor in helping you be more happy.
It may seem like a lot of work but it will deffinatly help.

Try to force yourselves into situations you don't enjoy, whether it be social interactions or speaking to people, as this will increase your confidence and decrease anxiety in the long run. Try to force yourself to college and please PLEASE speak to somebody about this, there's always people to help you and to get you through a tough time.
Try to stay positive, when something bad happens try to be optimistic about it and remember that people will.not care if you fu** something up, and please remember that you matter, you matter more than you think, there are people in this world who will help you and want to help you.

Hang in there, it will only get better and you're not alone In this situations, and remember, You Matter❤❤

Unfortunately some people do not have happy teenhoods. Some people will never have much happiness in life period. But many people can work towards happiness. Lots of people only started to grow and feel good in their 20s, and only because they came from a toxic environment and worked hard for their happiness.

I don't think you're the problem. It's clear you're trying very hard to be nice to people, but you're experiencing a mental block. Are you diagnosed with anything? You should talk about this mental block you're experiencing in your therapy.

This stuff doesnt work. Ive been trying to do these things since I was 10 and keep breaking down instead. Each time it gets worse and worse. 

But thankyou for trying to give advice.

I don’t have the therapy for another few months due to a waiting list. I havent been diagnosed with anything either.

Also, post this into many other reddit servers aswell to get the most advice possible. There are mental health ones.

Do it for yourself though and not any other person or people in general.

Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder and I know that sounds cliche but it is very true. Someone will look at your nose and see beauty in it while others may see it the way you do and honestly that is okay and overall your own self value is the most important thing. Physical appearance is temporary. Someday we are all gonna look like wrinkly prunes lmao and we are gonna realize that the beautiful people around us aren’t beautiful solely based on their appearance and much more because of their heart, maybe their goofy sense of humor, and also their mind or a million other little things that make them special.

23,f6qk96,False,,5,I am a 15 year old girl and haven't been feeling great since October (details below),AdviceForTeens," Hi. as stated, I an fifteen and in my tenth year of school.

In October my family put our old dog down

In late November my Opa died, last week my family's other old dog was put down.

I used to feel so confident in my relationship with my friends and my academic achievement. Now I feel that my friends no longer need me and that I am not as smart as I used to be.

My Oma died along time ago and with my Opa dying and my old dog dying (gift from my Oma) I feel like I've lost all connection to my extended family, not that there was much to begin with. I am beginning to fake smiles a lot more at school and feel that I have to put on an act for my friends.

to add to this I have been seeing my abusive father around town (he still lives close to my family) and feel that there are certain places I used to love that I can't visit anymore due to fear that he would try to talk to me.

Due to all these things and my own depleting self-esteem I have begun to force myself to throw up. I don't to it to much to be worrying but when someone makes a offhand comment about what I eat (it's not their fault. I'm overreacting) I run to the bathroom and try to make myself throw-up. It doesn't always work and that makes me feel worse.

can someone please tell me how to feel better",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f6qk96/i_am_a_15_year_old_girl_and_havent_been_feeling/,7,"Ok well let’s start with not making yourself throw up, that’s just unhealthy to do all the time. Why is it that you feel you aren’t as smart anymore or aren’t as wanted by your friends? Is there a reason to this? And are you still struggling with dealing with your losses? As for your abusive father all I can say is to avoid the parts of town you think you may find him in.

I relate to this as I’m currently struggling but you’re perfect the way you are (that was awful advice, sorry).

Please don’t force yourself to throw up - it’s not good at all. Maybe try joining a club at school or become active. Possibly speak to your friends about how you feel?? If you ever want someone to talk to, my PM is open.

Are you perhaps Dutch? Opa en oma is Dutch for grandpa and grandma but I am not sure other countries use it aswell. I might know a group that can support you online.

sorry, no. it's just the names my family use

Make her feel special. A lot of us go through this and I feel like all of us need some extra attention when this happens. So just make her feel beautiful, special, and appreciated. I’ve been through this exact thing. This online friend that I had said he was gonna kill himself. He really only wanted attention.

You may not know where she lives but the police can track her phone from the messages

I think they will they should at least refer you to someone who can

Ok, thank you. She's done this to me before where she says she's going to do it and not respond for a week, and then messages me like nothing happened.

I was unsure whether the police would be able to help or not, but I will try and do so. Thank you.

638,erhfk5,False,,2,My crush is touching me even though he has a girlfriend,AdviceForTeens,"Okay so the boy I like has a girlfriend. His girlfriend is in another school, so they only see each other in their free time. The thing is, when I’m at school, he touches and leans against me A LOT. I don’t know if these are signs, or what those are. Some things that he does are:

When we are sitting on the ground or next to each other, he tends to lean his thigh agains mine so they touch. He often puts his hand behind me, so he is closer to me. I move away from him and he follows.

When I walk by him, he sometimes rubs his hand against my thigh. He does it discreetly, but I see it. Also he sometimes just grabs or *gently* slaps my thigh.

We don’t really talk too much anymore, but he has asked me and said that we are friends with benefits to me, and quickly brushes it off my saying “I’m kidding”. Once he asked if I was a virgin (yes) and if I wanted to wait until I was 16 (also yes) and he said to me “I’ll wait for you”. 

It’s not like I get uncomfortable from these things, I mean he is my crush. I just don’t understand if he is doing it on purpose, or if he is doing it without realizing. I want him and his girlfriend to break up, but I also don’t want to break them up, if that makes sense. I just need advice; is there a possibility that he is doing that on purpose?

My tip? Leave them alone if they want. That doesn't mean you can't propose to stay all 3, but if they go alone, leave them be. They maybe are in love and want to be ""intimate"" (not in a sexual way). 

When I ask my friend who has a girlfriend if he wants to hang out with the boys and he has plans he says no. I understand him, so should you.

Try to find another friends, but still keep contact with the couple. If they keep ignoring you or stop hanging with you, try to slowly leave them. It isn't hard to initiate a discussion and trust me you will be thankful for having friends from more backgrounds.

You can't be always with them, because if you keep intervening in their alone time you will become annoying. Try to find a moment when they are separated and hang out with them separately or be the one who comes with the hanging out idea with both of them.

And his parents adore me. They invited me to his family only birthday party and they even invited me to their family summer vacation. They love me and they’re great people! The problem is that I feel like my parents don’t trust me or him. I’m never allowed to go to his house if someone isn’t home and god forbid I go in his room with him with the door closed. It’s just stressful. He’s such a great guy and he would never do anything like rape me or try to convince me to have sex. And I don’t want to have sex either. No thanks. Not at this age (16).

351,f966id,False,,4,toxic friend???,AdviceForTeens,"so i have this friend and i think our friendship is toxic but i’m not 100% sure. Here’s our history: 
we went to elementary school together but we weren’t really friends because she was very quiet. However she was best friends with one of my good friends so we were friendly with eachother. We went to different middle schools and I had a huge group of friends and i was very social. I found out that she was transferring to my middle school for seventh grade and i decided to be nice and show her the ropes of the school and walk her to her classes and introduce her to people and let her eat lunch with my friends and i. I remember telling my friends that she would eventually get comfortable and make her own friends. but that never happened, she followed me around for weeks and slowly overtime because a part of our friend group. She wasn’t really friends with any of the other girl’s though, she was just always with me. we got really close and i really liked her, we were very alike and i was glad that i finally got to know her. Near the end of seventh grade however i realized something. She didn’t have 1 single friend that i hadn’t introduced her to, she never disagreed with me, and i never hung out with anyone without her anymore. Even my friends that didn’t go to our school she would follow me to hang out with them and eventually it just became expected that we came as a pair. Skip 4 years later to sophomore year of high school. My social circle has shrunk immensely and i’ve lost the vast majority of my friends. I have about 5 friends but every one of them is friends with this girl too. We are still very very close friends, and she still follows me everywhere, texts me all the time (a bit obsessively) and inserts herself into any relationship i make. Most people at our school will only hang out with both of us not just one of us because we are always together. One of my friends won’t talk to me anymore because we used to be really close but after this girl convinced our guidance counselor to switch her into all my classes my whole life was consumed by her and i didn’t talk to that friend as much. I don’t get lunch with other people because once i did and she texted me long paragraphs about how she felt like i didn’t want to have lunch with her and like i was excluding her. She didn’t have any friends that she had made on her own until this year. Now she has a few friends that she did make on her own and that i’m not super good friends with and i’m grateful for that but now i’m stuck because i don’t have a life outside of her and when i think about my life before she came to my school compared to my life now i am so isolated. She encourages all of my bad descions and still has never once disagreed with anything i have said. she invited herself to everytbing i do and follows me and it’s like i can’t have a conversation with someone without her barging in or just standing there listening. I am scared that i will eventually not even have shared friends with her and i will have 0 friends except for her. What do i do? How do i make real friendships with people that aren’t a three way friendship including her? how do i become less close with her so my whole life isn’t consumed by her",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f966id/toxic_friend/,2,"Tell her what’s one your mind honestly even if your friendship might be at risk that way , pretending to be okay with it won’t do you any good now and make new friends without her you don’t have to tell her where you are and what you are doing 24/7 , just start making new friends and try to get in touch with your old ones and tell her clearly that you don’t like what’s happening

Oof, I'm sure most people have experienced a clingy friend like that. Clearly in this friendship, she likes you a lot more than you like her. This is going to sound easier said than done, but you can either have 2 options.

Option A) You genuinely tell her how you feel in a calm, civilised and NICE way. You want to keep being friends with her, just not always around her, you don't want to lose her. Unless you genuinely don't want to have anything to do with her anymore -that's a different approach.

Don't talk to her about your feelings on text. That's a NO. Communicating through text is the worst way to do so, there will be misunderstandings definitely and most likely won't resolve anything. Perhaps she's the type of person who's too awkward and uncomfortable to talk about her feelings to your face? But you're just going to have to try.

Sit her down, someplace private, keep cool. Speak in a calm voice (don't raise your voice AT ALL- this will just instigate a fight) and explain how you feel. Just say, something along these points. 

-Your still my friend and I love you to death. But, I just want to branch out sometimes and hang out with my own friends but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate or neglect our friendship.

- I promise I am trying not to exclude you, it's at times, I want to get to know other people better too, and as a three it might not feel like that.

You'll figure it out.




Option B) You can play the long game and just distance yourself. I don't mean instantly cold turkey, and completely blank her. 

Create a strict schedule for yourself, slowly and slowly drift yourself apart. But if you don't want to end on bad terms, if you see her in the halls, smile and wave. Or occasionally text her here and there.

But start off, by limiting the amount of texts between you. If you text everyday, start texting her around 5x a week and slowly and slowly stop. Or only a couple of exchanges of texts here and there. 

You know what I mean.

Anyway..I hope this might have helped. Give us an update!

thank you! I tried option 2 for awhile but eventually gave up on distancing myself because it was so hard when she would just follow me everywhere and text me 24/7 :(

Don't reply to her messages all the time. When you talk to her, make it seem like you are doing her a favour for not hanging around with you all the time. ""I think it would be really good for you to hang around with other people ________ seems nice. Doesn't he/she?""",2020-02-25 14:43:42
616,f1syr6,False,,0,He's fucking with my head and it sucks. Pls help,AdviceForTeens,"F(17yo)
So...context. This starts with a crush on an exchange guy, he also liked me at the start of the school year but I wasn't aware of it. 
I don't know how to process feelings, I just don't realize I like someone until it's too late, so ofc even though I smiled every time I saw him and all  that cheesy shit I just wasn't aware.
Enter other guy, this one was making his move, he was shooting his shot with me and wasn't afraid to be obvious so I went with it cause, ""yeah, why not? it's easy ik he likes me and I'm sort of attracted to him, yh sure let's do it. "" BAD IDEA ( turns out he's an asshole I ended it quick). This made the 1stguy who I actually wanted, give up on me and start talking to some girl, a week or so later they're dating... yay. 

Fast foward 2months later, 1st guy and me are at a party, his girlfriend isn't there we're a little tipsy and he pulls me away from the rest and tells me he had a big crush on me at the start of the school year. WHY WOULD U TELL ME THAT?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT?!? THAT'S JUST SELFISH. But anyway, that night we talked about the whole thing until we fell asleep... in each others arms, we basically cuddled and then something happened but, we didn't kiss or make out we just kind of touched eachother, he was incredibly cute about it he was asking me if I was okay or comfortable etc. After that we didn't even mention it, well just casually said  we remembered everything between 3am and 7am which is when all that happened. 

A month or so later there's another party, and again we cuddled and we danced and he pulled me in by the waist etc. Next day all he does is talk about his ""ex-girlfriend"" (they broke up but they still talk and they're pretty much still together) TO ME AND IN FRONT OF ME.

When she's there he completely ignores me, but ofc at a party without anyone that knows her it's all good WTF. IM SO CONFUSED AND I HATE SEEING THEM TOGETHER. 

My questions, 
Am I being played?
Should I completely stop talking to him?
What tf is going on?

Use an online translator to translate what you would like to ask him. Ask him things like ""how would you like to be involved in the project? There are this, this and role, what would you like to do?""

Tbh I am tired of her always complaining to me about how her life sucks and how she wants to die and how She wants help. Then the breaking point for me,Ellie has this guy she likes,let’s call him....Ben,so Ben is kinda already knew but wasn’t sure if Ellie actually liked him, I heard a conversation taht ben had with my classmates and they were trying it get him to spit out who he liked, I joined in and they said this girls name and he said “no and it’s not Ellie either”,Ellie is one of these types who get sad and angry at the boy they like when they talk with other girls,she said to me once how she hated him for talking to other girls and not her I replied with “well since he kinda already knows that you like him,it’s probably awkward for him.” She didn’t listen. So she saw me talking with them and asked me what we Were talking about,I told her everything,she started crying and said she couldn’t do anything anymore,I then suggested the counselor again,another no. After school we went to our dance club and after that,I quote her “I just want to scream my lungs out and until my throat starts bleeding and kill myself” I said not to do that,and told her if the consequences of killing herself. I actually told her to confirm everything with ben awhile ago but she declined, and I told her before if she didn’t do it this type of situation will happen,and told her to just either confess and clear things up or keep it in and either forget about him and try to move on or be in this situation. Now after I told her about the consequences of her dying,She again said she didn’t care and thinks that we will be fine after a few months. I had enough at that point. Ellie is a sweet Girl and I want to be her friend but I can’t take this anymore, she complains to me about dying and her depression but she declines my help and continues complaining to me,so I simply said “well it’s either you forget about him or do whatever the hell you are doing now,if you continue to whine to me all the time and keep refusing my help, you might as well suffer until some doctor comes and save you which isn’t anytime soon,move on from him,he’s just one guy you met in your 15 years of life,you have so many more chances in life later on.

215,f8ohlp,False,,2,Why am I so conflicted?,AdviceForTeens,"Um, I'm not very good at starting posts, so I'll just start talking about my problem.

So, I'm new to being a teen (turned 13 a while ago) but I can tell I already want to be different. So many of the people at my school are the same. You have the nice people, the 6th graders, the sporty ones, and the ones that don't really fit anywhere else, but, from the looks of things, I'm the only one who is excessively concerned about my future. For the past five years, I've been trying to get noticed, prepare for that big day when I finish the project, but I've gotten almost nowhere. I'm not even half done with it, and I want to do it, but I can't stop procrastinating! Heck, managing to revise what I had made me happier than I had been for the last three months.

Now, for the conflicts, I'll just list them out:

•I don't want to fall in love or anything, but I keep falling for fictional characters

•I constantly daydream and lie about working on things in my head, but I spend weeks (even months) perfecting every detail, even when I daydream about real-life situations

•I like working, but all I do is procrastinate

•I stay up all night so I can work, but I continue to procrastinate, because I don't remember my dreams anymore, and I find sleep pointless, but I like the sleeping experience

•As soon as I try working on one thing, I immediately begin to work on a new project

So, uh, I'm causing myself a lot of stress for almost no reason whatsoever, and I can't seem to stop.

Anybody have advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8ohlp/why_am_i_so_conflicted/,3,"i rlly suggest you talk to a therapist, this sounds like a lot of overthinking but i’m not rlly sure tbh. i overthink excessively, i won’t lie. i just think if you talk to a therapist maybe she/he can point you in the right way for something like that. i’m sorry i wasn’t any help!

Another person suggested a therapist. While that could be useful, I don't think it's necessary. You have all the tools needed to solve these things on your own.

For starters it's good that you're concerned about your future. But at 13 there isn't much to think about or do about it. At 15/16 some big decisions may come, but for now all you have to do is focus on doing your best in school and pass exams.

Only you can stop your procrastinating. Try breaking up your project into small chunks and set deadlines. While doing any work, you can spend for example 30-50 minutes working and then take a 10 minute break. I literally take little breaks every 15-30 minutes because my attention span is so bad. But I still managed to get things done and it has worked for years.

Falling for fictional characters aside, it sounds like you're filling your procrastination with fantasising about fiction. You need to get your procrastination under control. Maybe a way to deal with your fantasies can be actually getting them out in the form of a book or fanfiction.",2020-02-24 16:49:37

If your friend doesn’t see a problem and wants to stay with him then I’m afraid there’s not much you can do as reporting him would probably get your friend mad at you. As for your safety if you are a few states away I wouldn’t be concerned with him going after you unless he’s just that crazy.

He is that crazy also religious wise as well cause we both believe in the same thing and he will probably wish death upon me and my friend told me that the people he wish death upon have died and like I stated I live in the United States of America and here since the dude is between 20-26 and him dating my friend who’s 16 is illegal and if he gets caught will be classify as a predator and I am afraid for my friends safety cause she has told me a few times like I say less than 5 times I say that she is afraid for her safety

They say they really love me and don’t want anything to happen to me one day, but the next they just treat me like I’m being a bother. I’m scared to make a mistake around them because if I do they’ll snap and start yelling at me. I remember the last time I made a huge mistake they told me to get out of their house and live on the streets... They said that I’m nothing without their support... I’m scared to talk to them, to ask them for anything... I feel like I’m just being so selfish. It’s not like they’ve ever hit me or anything, and I’m lucky to not be in that kind of situation, but I still don’t know if I can handle being treated like a monster... I know, it’s selfish and I’m being ungrateful but I just wanted to let this out... 

They always see me on my computer ( usually doing productive things like art, homework,etc. but they don’t know that...) and begin yelling at me for it and saying I’m a lazy, spoiled brat. they’re not wrong I suppose... but I still get hurt by their words... I know I shouldn’t, and I should just stay quiet and be doing things like study and homework, but I’ve already finished those things... so when I go onto my computer after finishing, they just yell at me and say I’m addicted... they say I’m gonna to get brain damage and I’m gonna end up stupid.

My older sister... She gets along so well with them... They love her so much and I’m so glad that they do! I really am! I love my sister as well, and she’s the most amazing person I know. I don’t want to tell her how I feel about how they treat me, she’s already so stressed from high school and I can’t push her to do more...  My parents always yell at me for small things like dropping small bits of food and such. And I completely understand this (I should never waste food) but sometimes I can’t take their constant yelling... and I end up crying. I try to cover my tears, but when they see me cry they just get madder and say that I’m so manipulative for trying to make others feel bad... they’re probably right, I don’t even want to let them know how I feel, because if I do they’ll say I’m being ungrateful and spoiled.

Even if I did tel, them, it wouldn’t matter to them I suppose... I once broke into tears and began crying when they said I was retarded and that I’m horrible. ( I was fairly young at the time, about 9 I suppose ) At the time I was young and immature and I thought it was okay to cry... I locked myself into a closet and started crying loudly... when they came up, they told me to be quiet. I cracked a little, and began pouring out all my thoughts... I told them I was a disappointment, a failure, other depressing things I really don’t want to talk about... What they told me next was something I’ll never forget, 
“Why are you like this? Only god can help you, you sick freak...”
I guess this was when I learned to not cry or show my feelings in front of them... I suppose they were right though... I’m a freak... I’m ungrateful, spoiled, and insane... I feel so bad... why did they have to end up with me? Why did they end up with a freak? I just... don’t know how much more I’ll be able to take... I feel like I’m going to break someday... I’m scared! I’m scared of the day when I finally can’t take it and break apart...

53,ezzlzd,False,,5,Is my dad abusive or am I over reacting?,AdviceForTeens,"So I'm a f14 living with my dad and brother.

About a year ago my mother split leaving me and my brother with my dad and she moved in with her friend. So at first it was sort of ok just really a shock and I think I may have been in a bit of denial. before my mother left she worked in some mines and was never really here (gone two weeks back 1) two of her days were spent driving and 2 were spent sleeping because its a physically tolling job. When she was home and awake she would spend all day sitting in her chair eating and spending al her time on her phone. She would often criticize how messy our house was and would argue with me constantly. I was dealing with a lot of secret mental health issues and didn't really socialise very well but she certainly didn't even try. This was how it was for a good few years. Then my mother had a cancer scare and sort of went through a midlife crisis. I knew things weren't going well in my parents marriage for quite a while and my mum has some really bad depression. My mum had a really bad time at work because people are bitches so he decided to do something nice for her ( flowers on the bed sort of stuff... it was also her birthday.) So she comes home and tells us shed thought about committing suicide and she needs extra help to get better. I was really worried and sort of took it easy on my hormonal teenage bullshit then the next day I got home from school to find my dad already home and distressed so I ran home and found nothing but a note saying 'sorry I ant anymore' on the table from my mum. I honestly thought shed committed suicide but I found shed taken clothes and calmed down. now things got worse between us, for the first few months she didn't even bother to call or anything and neither did any of her family (my dads side did). when she finally did it was because shed gotten a new boyfriend she wanted us to meet (they started dating 3 weeks after it all happened) I said no, hell no. Then another month past and she hadn't called bcuz my dad and her were sorting out bills and shit. IT was sort of ok for a while, shed take us out shopping or to swim and it was all fun but then she started criticizing my clothing and friends. she actually told me I scrape at the bottom of the barrel for friends bcuz im a loser (in nicer words) and I snapped and told her my friends were scraping for me and that I am a loser with a fucked up family. Then shed managed to clear out all her shit from our house and taken a lot of ours. now this whole time my dads been trying to push me to have a relationship with her and trying to 'stay neutral' while also bad mouthing her. Things got worse and worse until the point I was really depressed and suicidal thinking about or trying to commit suicide. She'd take things that belonged to me for her boyfriends kid without really asking me but I was too anxious to really put up a fight. I eventually found out she was telling people our house was disguisting and that my dad was mentally abusive to her. My dad started drinking again (he was a bit of an alcoholc when I was younger and e isn't particularly nice0 eventhough he had screwed his liver or kidney bcuz of It. He got really mean bcuz of it and started screaming at me and my brother all the time, even throwing a chair at the door and shattering it bcuz I started arguing with my brother. He threatened to hit my brother and me all the time saying we shouldn't start shit until were big enough to fight him, he never actually hit us. Hed thrown me out of the hous for a couple minutes but after each fight hed come back and say he hates fighting with us and that hes sorry but it all felt kind of manipulative. at this point id basically stopped talking to my mum all out but she offered to get an apartment so I could go live with her wich I said no but we started talking again and then we stopped again an dtsarted again and stopped again. anytime I said no to an activity or we got in an argument she wuldnt talk to me for a fww weeks as a sort of punishment. Then Christmas came around and she hadn't talked to me in months and we got into it again bcuz she didnnt talk to me for so long and I asked her how my dad wa so abusive and why she would leave us with him if he was really so bad and she refused to tell me bcuz I was too young but im almost 15. I told her not to talk to me and she hasn't tried to talk with me but now im kind of regretting it. I feel like my dad might be the one manipulating me bcuz ive said things about her that ive heard my dad say and I am rally confused. I want to talk to her but I don't want my dad to find out. What should I do and am I being manipulated? I need to know if telling her to not speak with me was a good idea and should I speak with her again? I'm thinking about taking her up on the apartment offer.

Im not. i live in a rural town an hour away from the nearest place i could find a therapist and talking to a therapist would mean asking my dad to take me. we also don't have the money for therapy.

100,eveqpb,False,,1,How do I forget a crush,AdviceForTeens,"I grew up going to a v small catholic school w about 25 kids in each grade (nursery-8th). Since sixth grade, I kinda like this one kid and he kinda liked me but I was always quiet so nothing ever rlly happened. We went to the same high school and we both found a friend group and basically grew up, but when we had classes tg we would always sit and laugh and joke and j generally have a good time. Last year he would always snap me, dm me, try to start convos, uk. Then we talked a little over the summer but again, I’m pretty quiet, so not all the time. I always knew I liked him deep down but was always afraid to say it and I was pretty sure he liked me too, bc that’s what all my friends said. When this year started, we still talked for a little, but as the months went on, he found a new friend group full of toxic people and girls who are all over him. We barely talk anymore and even tho I sometimes see him trying to talk to me in the hallway, he’s just a completely different person-the attention has gotten to his head and he usually acts like a total asshole now. At the beginning of the year, I was considering telling him I liked him bc, hey we’re about to graduate after going to school tg since nursery so what do I have to lose? But now I wanna stop having feelings for him bc he’s just not the same.

Ask the guy out while you have the chance

Now I have to be completely honest. Unless this guy gets a lot of girls and goes into relationships easily he will probably say yes if you ask him out yourself. If you are ugly af or really annoying he probably won’t say yes but if you are only annoying there is still a chance he’ll say yes. I doubt you are ugly and annoying, being clingy is ok, the only people who will be bothered are his friends.

Now I must warn you this is how relationships are around where I live. I know many other places where guys are different. Some places are full of people just sleeping around, some places relationships are looked for.",2018-11-12 02:38:38

He was the first boy I ever kissed and seriously liked. We started dating like a week after we first kissed and we’ve been together since and that was 2 years ago. I used to be so excited to see texts from him and to meet up with him but it feels like all that magic has been fading recently. We used to never run out of things to talk about but lately I feel like I’ve been having much less fun around him and I feel like I don’t have anything interesting to say. It just doesn’t feel right anymore. However, he is such a nice guy and I don’t want to lose him. He has no idea I feel this way and is constantly telling me how perfect for him I am and how much he loves me but it just doesn’t feel true when I say I love you back. He is so good to me and I’m so so lucky to have him but I feel like it’s not fair to stay with him when I’m not invested in this relationship anymore. It scares me how he’s so committed too. He’s openly told me that he can see a real future with me and that without me his life would be meaningless and he would have no one. I told him at the time this was crazy and he is valued by so many people, but I know that breaking up with him would shatter him. Like really break him. He’s not super close to many other people but we’re sort of in the same friend group so it’ll be awkward for us to break up. To be honest i feel stuck. If I don’t break up with him then I won’t be happy and I’ll just think about this all the time, but if I do then he will take it really badly and I’m so afraid of being lonely. I’ve known him for about 3 years altogether and I feel as though I’m too used to having him/I’m reliant on him. I’m terrified of being lonely and regretting it if I break up with him. Being with him is all I’ve known for so long and I think losing him would feel like such a hole in my life. I value having him around and he’s so supportive when I’m down.

Sometimes I can’t fall asleep until 4am but I’d have to get up around 6:00 am so I wouldn’t get much sleep. I found that it’s harder for me to get up when I’ve gotten more sleep. So when I get less I’m normally in a better mood but as the day goes on I start getting moody. So sleeping more in the long run is better than sleeping less. Sleep is important for growth especially when you’re 13 and still growing. I suggest talking to a doctor. I have bad insurance and was out with a really terrible children’s doctor that told me to “just put my down.” Play instrumental music if you want to fall asleep faster, and focus on it. I find that it helps.

Its normal for your age, but its not healthy for you

Everyone having to move on and start living their own lives. Everything just seems to be falling apart and changing. I’m probably very childish for wanting to keep this sense of familiarity but these people made me feel loved and appreciated and I have this strong sense of love for these people as well.

And it’s not childish to want to stay in a familiar place with the people you love and feel safe around! However, try to look at the bright side of things as well. After high school is a whole new chapter with new people that will become your best friends. It’s true everything is changing and it’s hard, but think about all the new things you will get to try in the future. Think about how you will tell your kids these high school memories and be proud of them. Good luck!

Middle school isn’t important at all. It literally does nothing. It barely prepares you for highschool. But anyways, it’s just drama that will be forgotten in no time. I think you should try to talk to her(the weeb) and try to explain things. Also she shouldn’t be in a relationship with him. He sounds super toxic. Everyone in middle school always follows the popular people. So once you explain yourself things will get figured out. Ignore the people that don’t believe you, they’re just ignorant for no reason and they won’t get anywhere in life. If nothing works out in the end I suggest just working on yourself. Making yourself more mature. And I promise highschool gets better once you find your friends.

Like DaddiestGracie said talk to the “weeb” and find a way for it to be forgotten. But if worst comes down to worst you will probably get in a fight(physical). and that is why you should be prepared for an altercation, because from what I understand he sounds the type to start a fight.  But by any means try to diffusing and clear things up. If he is unwilling you might have to get help from an adult, which right now it sounds like that is the best course for action. 
So in short I’m saying try to diffuse the situation, if that don’t work get an adult, (by adult I mean someone who will walk into the school or wherever and raise hell for you). Now I’m no expert but this all the advice I can give hope I am a bit of help.

Okay so, there’s about 7 people in our friend group. 6 girls and 1 boy. Though he doesn’t sit with us at lunch. Now I’m dating one of the girls in our group. I am also a female. Let’s name her Sarah. Me and Sarah have been dating since Saturday. I don’t really know if I like her or not I’m still figuring that out. Our relationship was a heat of the moment thing. I thought I did but I don’t know. I’m terrible I know. 

Anyways, I told the group about this on Monday. Sarah wasn’t at school. Now I had just figured out that me friend was pan (I’m bi btw..). This was a surprise for me. My impression on the group was privileged, white, straight, Christian girls. I was shocked. 

So, I started to ask her who she liked. She wouldn’t tell me at first and had me ask questions and stuff. So I did. And all of them lead to it being me. So I asked her. On paper. And turns out she does. 

Now I don’t really know what to do. I feel like it’s gonna be awkward. And I kinda like her which I told her so I feel like it’s gonna be weird. Plus me her and Sarah were planning to go to a play and the mall together on Saturday. Help.

It would be so much worse if it goes on like this, the sooner the better. She'll be ok, maybe it'll take few days but she'll be ok

I did. She seemed pretty upset but when me and another friend were talking she said she seemed mad.

You are probably feeling like it's your fault, maybe not but if you feel like this, if you can't like her it's not your fault, you did the right thing, I'm so proud of you sis

158,ethd1w,False,,6,(M14) I think I might be transgender.,AdviceForTeens,"(This is copied from my other posts about this since I don't know a better way to phrase it.)

I am a 14 year old boy. I feel like I could *possibly* be transgender, and have some questions. 

1: is it normal for teenagers to feel like they might identify as the other gender?

A few years ago, a friend was using the opposite pronouns and using a name of the opposite gender (not telling too much so people I know don't realize it's me) .  (also, people were being assholes to people who didn't use the pronouns/name they wanted, and I kept forgetting, so I almost lost a friend because of people being assholes, but back to the main point. Sorry I'm not staying focused) they eventually stopped and said they *thought* they were transgender but aren't. Could that be the same for me?

2. How do I know if I'm transgender?

3. If anyone reading this is transgender, how did you realize that you were?

Hopefully this post makes sense",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ethd1w/m14_i_think_i_might_be_transgender/,4,"Well I am trans and the thing is I never really went by that term until a couple of years ago( I haven’t told anyone except a few people, but I’ve accepted myself.) So some things I’ve kinda struggled with is Dysphoria, if you don’t know what that is, it is where you compare yourself to the opposite gender you were assigned. You also want to have that genders body. Also if your confused don’t worry, some of my friends thought that they were trans but they were just curious and confused (god I hate this sentence so much). But don’t immediately think that, and don’t let anyone influence you and say your just confused, just try stuff from the opposite genders side and see if it makes you happy. Hopefully this helps you.

Being transgender isn’t a choice. I’m not trans so I can’t speak for them and how they feel or how they knew they weren’t their biological gender. But anyways it’s completely normal to question your gender or sexuality. Society is very cruel. But the most important thing in the whole world, is you. Just you. And the most important thing in the world to me, is me. Please don’t stress over this. You have your whole life to figure things out. You don’t need to figure it all out in one day. Just take your time. If you really feel like you’re not the right gender then I’d research a bit or talk to a trans person and ask how they knew they were trans.

What things would u suggest trying from the opposite genders side?

Thanks

Thanks

You can try on the clothes from the other genders side. Another thing you can do is go to Starbucks and order a drink with a name from the opposite gender and see how it makes you feel. Also just think about yourself and wonder if there were other signs the you might be trans,(like comparing yourself to the other gender or wanting to be the other gender.) actually here is a website I found that might help you, I thought it was okay so I recommend you to research a bit more.

Well, me being a previous junior last school year myself having studied for the June SAT, I would think she has general interest in you. Which is enough to be able to determine whether or not she would really like to have more with you :) 

Contact her, now that it is summer, and hang out with her! She has no reason to deny you (unless she is taking summer classes/camps/trips) and if she does genuinely like you, it should be evident. (Otherwise, you can ask me for help, a fellow female creature who can interpret well the ambiguous meaning of actions done by other female human creatures.) 

So contact her, hang out with her, and develop the friendship from there :) If she doesn't hang out with you, and gives you constant reasons as to why she can't, she probably doesn't want much more than a friendship with you.

I am just barely on the spectrum.
Backstory: I’ve written about my mother before. She’s always so calm and fun, but the moment something small goes wrong she’s in a mood. I don’t know if I’m too close to see it or something, but some people have told me she’s gone way too far and not the best parent. 

I’m now in a Brain Balance program, started two weeks ago to help me. I have focus and listening problems, and can never actually think about the choices I make. I’ve gotten better, but this is a three month program that’s barely started. The gist of it is at home I have a set of exercises to do every day, and I do them even though it makes no sense to me. 

Here’s what led up to this problem- last night, in one of my not-thought out responses, I decided I didn’t want to do two out of seven chores. So I just didn’t. And who tells their parent “hey I don’t wanna do this so I’m just gonna walk away” no, everyone covers their tracks. Apparently because I didn’t fold sheets and do the dishes, mother was tipped over the edge.

She woke me up roughly this morning, and yelled at me that I’m doing everything right in front of her for now on, including moving my working station to right next to hers (she works from home and I’m homeschooled now). I could never work well while others were watching me in school, and now she wants to glare at my computer screen all day and judge each step I take to complete my work.

I can’t post pictures on mobile as far as I can see, but these texts happened this morning.

Me: I don’t mean to be rude, but I earned the ability to work in my room and chose to save it. Why am I being forced to work right next to you, just because I decided I didn’t want to do some chores? You know I’m bad at making decisions and thinking things through, that’s why I’m in a class. I’m trying to fix things but 6 days of brain balance won’t fix everything.

Her: We can discuss this in person.

Me: I’d rather do it over text, you know how bad I am at communicating my thoughts in person...

Her: Improving your in-person communicating skills is part of the goal.



I don’t post often to reddit at all, but I really need help here. What should I do?

Edit: we had a “talk”. She had her voice raised the whole time about how I had 5 ———— days to do work last week (It’s the same every week, why is last week special?) and how the chores just broke the camel’s back. Every time I asked for one day to make things up or actually spoke up (being in the spectrum, I have a really hard time saying what I want to), she would full on yell at me. She ended with “go cry into a pillow or whatever but this is how it’s gonna work. It’s called tough love... nevermind, not going to go there, it’s just offensive and will make you ugly cry more.”

The other day I was doing my homework. Mind you I always have a lot of homework due to the fact that I’m in high school and take many advanced classes. Anyways across the hall to my room is my brothers room. He is 14 and games. He was non stop talking very loudly to his friends on the mic and periodically yelling. I don’t have a door and neither does he so, I could here everything clear. I had asked him nicely to stop 2 or three times. He ignored I even said anything. Then I yelled for him to be quiet. My mother heard me yell and starting yelling at me to stop from downstairs to stop and that I was breeching her peace and to be quiet. I explained I was trying to do my homework and my brother wasn’t being quiet at all. She said he can play the Xbox whenever he wants and told me not to do my homework the last minute. She was aggressively telling me this. I was not doing my homework last min. I was doing it at the end of break because I wanted to enjoy my Christmas break. Doing it the last two days of my break gave me enough time to do my homework therefore it was not last minute. I said that is crazy and unfair. She then came upstairs and continued to yell at me saying she would call the cops on me. I said the cops would call her stupid for calling about me yelling at my brother to stop yelling. She said “NO YOUR BREECHING MY PEACE THATS A FELONY” I said you insane let me do my work leave me alone. She continued to yell saying he can play when he wants. She was mad at me for doing my homework while he was playing. I said he can play but I want him to be quiet. She continued to say he can play whenever. She said I’ve had 2 weeks to do my homework. I said he’s had 2 weeks to play the game. She replied yelling “NO no your doing it last minute he can play whenever he wants this is your fault.

I have young siblings as well when they are wasting time they don't go trouble but when we grow older it's like they  don't care about our opinion because they think they are in control of our lives which they are but what I am trying to say is try to put up with it until she doesn't a crap anymore.

641,eqy6zu,False,,2,I think my friend is being abused,AdviceForTeens,"Okay I’ll try to not reveal too much info.  So I have a good friend, she comes from a a strict religious family. Her parents are not her real parents keep in mind.  

The children there have a  certain age and requirement to have a phone which is fine. It’s 16+ and you have to have a job to pay for phone bills. That’s fine by my standards. 

However, my friend had turned that age and she has a job at a local store. So she does have the funds to pay their phone bill and they have do WiFi at home. She was finally given her phone and we were able to text easily.  

Texting is easier than having to physically walk over to the place (which is a mile away) and see if she’s home.  

Age had their phone for a while until it was taken away for no reason. They didn’t misbehave or anything (this is isnt the first time something like that this happened I’ll explain further). They had came over to my house, their sibling comes with her every time they come over.  Which is strange because there’s no one around their age to play with any of my siblings.  It’s really weird.  My two younger brothers are two young to play with the sibling while my two older siblings are older.  

I had asked about her phone and they said it was taken away for no reason. I asked if she had misbehaved possibly and she said no.  She said her parents decided to take away her phone despite meeting their requirements of the ability to have a phone.  

Then I asked what if there’s like an emergency and you need a phone (they drives alone to work late at night around 10 in a rural ghetto sorta neighborhood.) she had stated that her parents told her if it happened she should knock on every door to get help which is totally unsafe for a 16 year old girl to go to strangers houses let alone at around 10 PM.  However the houses are like at least a mile apart in this area.   

She then told me another story where her headlights had once gone out.  She didn’t have a flashlight or a phone for that matter, she had to drive on the pitch black.  

Another case where I suspect abuse is once I was over at her house, one of their kids (who has a problem) had wet their pants.  They began to scream at them for wetting his pants and told him to wash up. However I read that like screaming at young children for wetting their pants is bad. However this kid is slightly older. 

Another was I invited her to see a Disney movie. Her parents agreed to let her go the day before.  She was excited since she had wanted to see the movie. 
Next day we go to pick her up and she has tears in her eyes saying she couldn’t go at all. Later a few days ago I went to her house and asked about the movie.  She stated she didn’t get in trouble and her parents decided to not let her see the movie. 


So basically having a phone is good for safety. What if she got into a car crash? She couldn’t call for help. Even a. Flip up phone could be used but she doesn’t have that. I wouldn’t want my future 16 year old daughter walk at night all alone or drive at night alone with creepy people who are out there in the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eqy6zu/i_think_my_friend_is_being_abused/,1,"I know that this is hard to say. So well done for coming foreword.
Honestly, if you think that there is abuse going on you need to call the police. If your friend is ima situation where you don’t think she is safe then you need to call the police or local authorities.

It’s hard to see these things happen, and I know that you want to help, but the only thing you can really do is get authorities involved. I have a friend, and her uncle has a problem with self harm. His child was being raised in a very poor environment so cps got involved. That’s the best you can do. Tell authorities. Report it and let them know what’s going on.

But if you do, make sure your friend is ok with it. Don’t do anything she wouldn’t want you to. 

If you need advice message me and I can help you more.

Someone who steals people’s possessions off of their person. So if you pulled someone’s wallet out of their pocket and took it then you would be a “pickpocket”.

you should most definitely be fine. i’m also in a long distance relationship and honestly phone sex isn’t a huge problem unless you/her were 18 and the other being 13-14. plus you’re both close in age so it would be ignored. same thing happened with me & my bf. i suggest if you’re trying to stay quiet and not get caught (family) to maybe do video chats. it’s quick simple and quiet.

we are also in a very small house so that’s kind of hard, and my gf doesn’t want to ruin our relationship either and she does want to wait for it because of it

is kind of hard to when we were quiet when we did it the first and second time but still got caught

can’t really do that since she’s 6 hours away

She said she understood and we acted like nothing happened. We are best friends so I told her that I can’t just act like I don’t like her for long. So yesterday she told me that she had mixed feelings over the school year and that she likes me. I got happy so I told me friend about it. In the last class of the day I had asked her out, she rejected me because she said that she doesn’t think she’s ready for another relationship and her past ones stressed her out. Of course I didn’t feel right so I had my friend say that he was the one that typed that when I was in the restroom, he told her that he was just playing and she got pissed. I didn’t feel right with him technically asking her out so I did it again. I asked her out again and she said “can we talk in person”, I agreed and at the end of school I walked with her and asked her what she wanted to talk about. I didn’t tell her about the previous situation . This time she said something about how we couldn’t date because of her parents. I did stuff that her parents didn’t like, which where cussing in text, and saying the n word in text. I tried to say that I could change and stop doing that stuff but other friends kept intervening.

And I'm scared of having no one next year",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f7ogpd/second_guessing_my_friendships/,3,"Sometimes, friends stay only a while in our lives so it's normal among teenagers. Even adults go through that! As for your situation, give it a try on making new friends this year and I'm sure you'll find someone who will accept you just the way you are. 

What I learned from life is that we shouldn't rely on people that much, because one day they just get bored of you. It's not our fault, but theirs.  Because we think we can feel better just by putting our problems on others. We need first to learn how to love ourselves and then make relationships, whether it's a romantic relationship, or just a simple friendship

I know I'm not the best person to give friendship advice, I've been quite isolated my whole life. But friends naturally grow apart as they grow themselves, and it's not really anybody's fault. Many friends bonded when they were kids or tweens, at that age you bond over mutual kindness and what shows and music you like. As you grow older you start to value deeper things like attitude towards life, how people treat others, how mature they are, moral and political affiliations. 

So it's only natural that you grow apart from your friends. Even one year can make a lot of difference and send you down two completely different paths. Sometimes people become friends because there are limited options, you're in one school for years on end, you live in a small town. And frequently people settle, and once they get out into the big world they leave their old friends in search of new ones who they can relate to more.

Don’t be. I’m in HS and I am in your situation right now. It’s not improving buddy. So yk what just completely vibe your senior year and when u get out make new friends

Damn wow they just get bored of you? Even tho u didn’t do a single thing?

But is it like totally normal to be the odd one out in your whole grade? I'm always alone now and it sucks

Yeah that's normal.",2020-02-22 13:53:00
596,f4guxv,False,,2,Long story but 15 and need advice?,AdviceForTeens,"Pretty much theres one guy who at least to me seems amazing. He is really funny, nice, has the same music taste as me, makes amazing music, plays instruments (including saxophone like ahh i love sax so much its so preeetty), apparently has a really great family, has some of the same friends as me, is v cute oops, gave me butterflies for the first time (i thought that was a made up thing wtf), and more. So after posting on my spam account that I didnt want to like him anymore because im too awkward, one of mine and his friends said that i should do something because he wont be in my school next year. SO  I did probably the most brave thing ive ever done (im not brave if you couldnt tell ahha) and went up to him in person in front of all of his friends and spoke to him i was so nervous lmao; the full palms sweaty moms spaghetti. I then spoke to him after and he was so nice to me and ah. Its just that we havent spoken since and its too awkward to talk in person (he literally said to me ""sorry if it was awkward"" so, well...). So if you couldnt tell by now im 1.a naturally nervous person 2.someone whos never been in a relationship or anything like that. I dont know what to do now. We dont sit next to each other in class, and ive been told i give off a very shy vibe but then when you get to know me im surprisingly talkative (just dunno how to get to the point where he knows that because he makes me 10x more nervous than I already would be). Its weird because I always think to myself that nothing could ever happen between us but then there will be times where ill see him looking at me and that one time he spoke to me he was giving me loads of compliments (things that friends do too so i should stfu ahah) but like honestly id be just as happy just being his friend he seems like a great friend. Do you have any advice on how to actually talk to him properly in person and not just every once in a while over dms?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f4guxv/long_story_but_15_and_need_advice/,1,"You should probably start by trying to be his friend- geniunely try. A little flirting is okay, but try not to get so absorbed in the idea of a potential relationship that you can't treat him normally. Remember, at the end of the day, he's just a person- don't let the pressure get to you.

Second- Go out of your way to talk to him! If you share a lunch period, that's a great way to get to know someone. Otherwise, try to meet up with him before school. 

Ask him to hang out outside of school- this can be nerve-wracking, but it's not actually such a big deal. Just say, ""hey, are you free after school today/ tomorrow/ Friday?"" And if the answer is yes, invite him to go with you somewhere- to the park, to a fast food place, an ice cream store, a GoodWill, anything within walking distance that sounds fun. 

Try to be yourself, but also go out of your way to ask questions about him, and do your best to keep a conversation going.

And DEFINITELY text him often! Don't spam the guy, but send him messages regularly. Memes and ""what's up"" are good icebreakers, but try to look for things that could start a conversation. Maybe it's a piece of art you saw, maybe it's a video game you started playing, maybe something wierd and funny happened to you, maybe you learned a fun fact about a crazy waterfall or something. 

Good luck :)

Knowing those things, we move onto the actual problem
I like this boy, he's not the best at social skills and he mainly conveys his conversations with memes and jokes. But when he is genuinely seriously he can have a pretty serious conversation, and he is so smart on so many things. And I want to talk to him, I want to ask him so many questions but I get such a block. And I feel like it's because of his mental illness, no its not that I'm unable to look past it or something before someone says it lol. I love and care about every piece of him, but no feel like no topic is good enough to catch his attention or will not make him freak. I just don't know what to do, what to ask, how to learn about him!

I sincerely just want to ask him things that he won't find stupid and small, I want a serious conversation something that can drive us closer or something. I'm trying to see if I can somehow get him alone in person? Maybe he's just a bad texter idk but I'm just super anxious. Àny opinions?

First of all my mom is really weird about the house being clean and tidy. She works full time and I can understand that coming home to a clean house is something that is appealing to her. I am the only person in the house who doesn’t work also so I understand where her expectations come from. I mostly stay with my boyfriend over night every night at his and then come back to mine in the morning to walk my dog and just have some time to myself. Normally I WILL tidy up all of the dishes that her, my brother and my dad used in the morning and just around the kitchen and the living room. Cool whatever. However today I generally just forgot to clean their dishes and I sh* t you not there was literally one plate a few forks and knives a cup and a grater. I came home at 11 am walked my dog and started painting. I love painting and I was really excited this new painting ive been doing so naturally I spent a good few hours on it. She came home and started shouting at me because I never did the dishes. Honestly if you were a third person watching the way my mum behaves sometimes you would think she was just joking. She just get so engulfed with rage when the house isn’t perfect and tidy and clean and its really affecting me now because the only time she ever opens her mouth it is to complain or shout. No one else thinks the house is messy its just her. And whenever I do do something for her there is no acknowledgement there she just expects it from me.Im so sick and tired of it I was having such a good day and then as soon as she walks in the door the nice energy in the room just disappears and its just poisoned with her constant nagging and negativity. After listening to her getting all up in my face telling me how lazy and selfish I am I try to explain to her the way she makes me feel and the way she behaves and she will just shut me down, walk away or slam a door in my face. She’s always the victim in everything and Im always the selfish lazy bitch of a daughter who doesn’t think of anyone else ever. The only reason I’m spending more time at home is because she told me to. She said I was spending too much time with my boyfriend and that she barely got to see me which honestly is probably for the best. She will go nuts if there are fingerprints on the fridge... I dont know but I feel thats a bit extreme. Im so done with it its just getting old and she only seems to be getting worse as time goes on. Usually I avoid confrontations with her and just do as she expects of me but its days like this where I slip up that literally make me want to run away so far from this house. My boyfriends mom is so chill and her daughter has cystic fibrosis so she is a stay at home mom. She is always so calm and her energy is amazing, im sure the last thing thats on her mind when she goes to sleep at night is if there are any dishes left in the sink and whos getting it in the morning....
I wish my mum could realize how much life she is WASTING by moaning all the time over such miniscule things, and how much it affects our family. No one wants to be around her when shes like that, but its just the way she is.
I know its a terrible thing for me to compare my mom to my bf’s but she’s just so much nicer to be around in a house environment.  Is there any way for me to just accept the way my mom is and for me to block out whenever she’s being difficult?

Throughout my high school experience I have been a relatively quiet and reserved person who kinda hung out on the edge of the ""main bubble"" of people at my school. For the entirety of my 4 years I have kept pretty much the exact same friends that I have been hanging out with since middle school and I absolutely love them and would do anything for them. However recently, a couple of my friends from my group have really found themselves a lot deeper in the main  bubble and have begun talking to other people and even have gotten girlfriends as a result. Personally I could not feel happier for them and find enjoyment just talking with them about there experiences and such. I feel like it's important to note I am not scared of them moving away from me as a friend so that is not my problem. Due to seeing two of my best friends have this entire other life it seems like it has begun to make me feel quite lonely and left out. I want to try and get into the bubble somehow or just a bubble, but I feel as a senior it is kinda hard to move my way in as the friendships seem to have been found and developed already. I have talked to my two friends about this and it feels like there is not much I can do. The reason they got into the bubble comes from them being invited to a couple of get togethers    
a person or two that were in the bubble already. I feel like for some reason I have not been able to get that kind of opportunity, most likely due to something I have done or haven't done. My friends have told me that they feel I have begun to change personality wise and have started to become more social as a result which is good. I just want to be able to make my last semester of highschool great and maybe have the opportunity to take someone to prom. I also want to break my cycle of waking up, going to school, going to extracurricular, going home, playing video games/homework and sleeping. I was thinking about asking my two friends that are in the bubble to maybe try and invite me to a couple get together opportunities and see if I could Integrate myself in and become a part of the group but I feel like that is too much to ask and if they wanted me there they would have already invited me. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I  should do and how they would try and deal with my situation if they were me.

How do i even start getting over the panic attacks?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eangjo/help/,1,"I deal with anxiety. I’d do 4x4 respiration’s. You breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds and exhale for 4 seconds and do all that 4 times. I flex any muscles. Also describe random stuff you see

I think for the short term it might help to remember that the most time you can remain in an anxious state - having a panic attack - in a anxiety inducing situation (provided circumstances continue to be the same) is 90 minutes, but usually a panic attack lasts much less time than that. 

Anyway, I also avoid things socially, rn im not going to a restaurant with my parents because of it, and im fortunate enough that they just let me not do things that will just make me uncomfortable. You arent just being silly. 

TBH i dont know how you can 'get over' anxiety because i gave up CBT last week myself, i think all you can do is perhaps try and see a proffesional about coping mechanisms and for now try to make clear to your parents that its not worth forcing you into church for the time being. Can you just pray at home instead?

Sorry i cant give a definitive answer but I just thought its potentially more helpful  than just scrolling past, although my ex-therapist told me avoidance behaviour was not good, but i dont believe causing yourself to have full blown anxiety attacks helps either, its probably just a process of building confidence in your ability to handle stress incrementally. good luck.",2019-12-15 02:41:11

So I’m a high school M, and for over a year now I’ve liked this guy, let’s call him Pat. Now, Pat is the first guy I’ve liked seriously, and I didn’t tell anyone about it at first. I’ve never been super private about who I’ve liked with my friends, but something felt different this time. I didn’t talk with him that much, and we didn’t have too many common friends, but even if he paid me a few seconds of attention, let’s just say my day was made. He’s funny and smart and just flat out attractive.

A few weeks into liking him, I found out my (F) friend liked him to. I didn’t know what to think or how to respond to her, so I kept quiet. Turns out Pat liked her too, and a few weeks later they were dating. 

Eventually I told my friends, excluding the one dating Pat, about my feelings for him, and it kindve became a running joke in my group. Over the course of them dating, I came to terms with my feelings. I still liked him, a lot, but I realized that I would never date him, and just wanted him to be happy.

They broke up a few months into the relationship, but it didn’t change the way I felt about him. Throughout the rest of the year, he dated one or two other girls, and my group kindve forgot about my problem. It didn’t really matter, nothing had changed. It was weird because even though I knew we would never be together, I couldn’t move on. I didn’t like anyone else, and I felt strangely fine just liking him without him feeling the same way.

Fast foreword to this year. My feelings remained strong over the summer. I still liked him, but finally things and changed. I was no longer content just liking him. I know he wouldn’t date me, and I just want to move on.

Along with this development, I met another guy. He’s also straight so it doesn’t matter that much, but I guess it’s a sign I’m moving on? But I still feel just as if not more strongly about Pat.

i have always try my best to not burst into tear in school. it has always worked but the depress feelings are still there. then one of my friend privately ask me what happened. i burst into tear and told her how bad i’ve felt for the past week. at least for me it was a relief when some ask what happened because it showed that someone care about you.

Question - do you know this friend’s parents? If you think you can trust them, you should definitely try to tell them what’s going on with your friend so that they can get the help that they need. In the meantime (or if there isn’t a safe adult you can trust), I think the best thing you can do is respect your friend’s privacy (meaning I think you’re right for not prying!) but also let them know that they should feel safe telling you what’s happening in their life (whenever they feel comfortable enough to) if they think it would make them feel better to get it off their chest.

Best of luck! You got this!

Sounds like some shape or form of disassociation, it happens alot throughout teenage years it's just your body and mind just expanding and grasping reality 

this happens to me a lot, it’s been happening to me since i got diagnosed with anxiety last year. it sounds like to me you’re experiencing depersonalization, which is common in association to anxiety & depression, among other things. i don’t know you personally obviously but i’d talk to your parents, and you mentioned they got you a doctor’s appointment so that’s good. i hope everything’s good for you now. :) 

Thank you! I'll try it.",2019-02-07 07:52:41

17,fahjwi,False,,4,Why do I cry all the the time,AdviceForTeens,"Why do I cry all the the time

I’m crying almost every day since I remember. It can be caused by anything and often happens in public. It can be a bad mark, someone being mean or even someone raising their voice. Everyone thinks I’m weird because I cry so easily. I cried maybe 3 times watching movies, but when it comes to situations including me I’m in tears much more often. I can’t really control it. I also often cry at home usually because I’m overwhelmed by everything and I feel like I’m failing in every possible way. I had a few panic attacks in my life, but they don’t happen often. Are you able to help me somehow? I’m tired of being like this.

Sorry for bad English",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fahjwi/why_do_i_cry_all_the_the_time/,10,"Can’t really give out any advice as I am not a therapist, but I do suggest you try talking to people about the things that are stressing you out

Sweetie I'm no professional but your description reminds me of myself growing up. It could be a result of Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN) if you had a hard time expressing yourself to others as a child, or if others never made you feel welcome to say how you felt. 

You could also be a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) which means that you feel the emotions of other people much easier and feel rejection much easier when other people are irritated. If you feel overwhelmed in busy places, that could also make you feel upset. 

It takes a lot of work and time but if you don't want to see a doctor or can't find one, you can try  some things by yourself. What I find helpful is writing down what you are feeling every chance you can. If you can think about your feelings and look at them on paper, it makes it a little easier to understand that they are temporary. If you are okay with reading English, try reading Creative Visualization"", written by Shakti Gawain. It is a helpful book for accepting your emotions and focusing on good things. 

Always rememer that you are a special and unique person! I'm sorry you have not had the best of luck with friends, but you will find them! It is okay to focus on your hobbies and spend some time by yourself to accept who you are and where your emotions come from.

Edit: feel free to dm me if you would like to talk about anything!

378,f0851r,False,,3,"Don't know what to do from here, HELP!!!!",AdviceForTeens,"Ever since I was little like 4ish years old I felt like my parents were starting to abuse my sister and I. Like it was only from time to time and it was also during a time where my father was becoming successful. As years went on I found that my parents would shake, hit, and yell at my sister and I whenever we made small mistakes. We would sometimes get bigger punishments if we made bigger mistakes. I remember one situation when I was about 5-6, my sister forgot a iPad in an airplane and we realized this when we were home. My dad said he would pick it up but he was angry. The next day during breakfast I forgot what was going on because I was focused on counting the cereal in my bowl but my mom kicked one of the legs on my sisters chair causing her to fall backwards. She stood up and started screaming at me. I immedientley froze, my vision blurred, and the words she was screaming just sounded muffled. However, I was scared to death. We went to school and when our mom picked us up she apologized. The same behavior went on and then when I reached 2nd grade everything changed. My parents got a divorce. I remember my dad walked into my room and asked me, ""Would you be mad if I left for a little bit came back?"" I figured that if he left for a little bit that meant it would just be a couple hours, I thought he was just gonna go to work. He left the room, packed his bags, and I didn't see him for a couple months. After a couple days, I decided that my dad had went on a trip. During those days my mom would forget to feed my sister and I. We kind of just sat in our room and watched minecraft videos or whatever. After, more days passed we would hear our mom crying. Sometimes she would get up storm into our room and yell at us saying that the divorce was our fault. When I finally saw my dad he took us to a party. It was somewhere in Beverly Hills. Full of rich Hollywood people with 20 year old wives. He had got his own too, a girlfriend who was about 13 years younger than him. It upset me that my dad moved on so fast and at first he didn't even tell me that he was dating her. Until like 5 months later when I asked if they were dating. He never even told me they got married. For the next couple of years my mom would talk about how my dad is going to abandon my sister and I and start another family. I heard those words constantly and my mom saying she was the only one who we actually had. When we did visit our dad, every other weekend. It would usually be him talking about how our mom was crazy and him just yelling at us at the top of his lungs. He even showed us his divorce records and whatever and told us our mom said he was physically and emotionally abusive. He told us she lied, I didn't believe it though. My dad has always been a violent person. Last year, I kind of got fed up with my dad and the way he treated me and lied, so I called CPS. I stayed at my mom's house. My mom is a caring person but she sometimes confuses me. Whenever I make a mistake she tells me she's going to drive me straight to my dad's house and drop me off there, she yells insults saying I'm a liar, terrible daughter, a bad kid, how she sometimes wished I was dead, and etc. She occasionally will physically abuse me and when she does it can get pretty scary. I got diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety and I have kind of used drugs to help me escape, which I know is unhealthy. I have an amazing social life and friends I love, but my mom rarely lets me have plans. I feel so alone, I have zero trust for any of my parents. I trust my sister but she's usually on her computer or at my dad's. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I wouldn't do that, the thought of what happens after scares me. Staying at my mom's house is really tiring but I'd much rather stay here than my dad's. Me staying at my mom's means I get blamed for everything, go through constant emotional and mental abuse, and will sometimes be physically abused. My mom doesn't realise her mistakes, refuses to admit her abusive behavior, and we always get in fights. I don't know what to do, I've considered running away but I don't know if it's worth it. I love all my friends and I do still care about my mom. I won't ever forgive her or forget what she did and still does do but she has helped me in so many ways. She helped me find a place to stay after I called CPS on my dad and had nowhere to stay since she was in NY for a bit with my sister. She cares about my health and everything. I just don't really know how I feel about her. I just know the place I'm at right now just makes me miserable. I've tried antidepressants and therapy and both didn't work. I just keep feeling like I'm getting worse. I know I have a good life, I have a good education, a roof over my head, clothes, food, and other basic needs. I just feel like hearing all those words and insults at a super young age really traumatized me and whenever I hear it again from my mom or Dad I freak out. Whenever I look at my mom I just feel unsafe and mad. Both of my parents didn't really make an effort to be emotionally here for my sister and I and both didn't really want to help us with making food or teaching us important life lessons. I kind of grew up feeling like I was more independent than a lot of other people that I personally know my age. I was always kind of jealous of people who could depend on their parents. I've tried talking about how I feel with my mom and she just yells at me and tries to convince me that I'm crazy and how I should be normal. I feel like I can't keep living the way I do. I have no one to talk to and I am so depressed.

Is running away worth it? Should I get an emancipation? Where would I even go if I ran away? Will I feel even more alone? Will my depresssion get worse or better? I really don't know.

Some of the time the justice system doesn’t give a crap about kids, they trust adults more(at least in my area, I don’t know about you) I say run away when your 18, cause your parents can’t do anything to you by then. Get a job and save up your money. Or you can actually get a trusted adult like a teacher or someone from school and tell them about what going on and if their is any evidence of you getting harmed, show them.

I doubt they’re lying, and even if they are she still could like you. If you don’t go for it you’ll regret it for years. You should see this as an opportunity to get a gf!!

Just from the beginning with the ""Overboard with the partying"" I think you are probably fine. Trying going to parties in the new place you live because thats where you feel comfortable.

Well, finding work is a start. Once you find work and talk to the people there, maybe you can try going to the gym (if you're into that sort of thing) and try chatting to some people there as well. Just do as many things as you can that involve being OUT and around people, you should be fine.

the problem with that is i don't know anyone who lives here so i am not really sure how i would go about finding out about parties and all that up here once i meet a few guys at one party it ended up just spiraling from there into getting invites every Friday and Saturday night.

Ok so this started back in early December on Snapchat when I added my crush and started talking to her. Context we’re both 17 and I met her at my old school 3 years ago before I moved 2 years ago, we weren’t very close but we kinda knew each other. But anyways this convo started out when I asked her if she remembered me she said no. (Red flag 1) but my dumb self didn’t think about that. But we talked for a little bit after that and she eventually said she remembered who I was after hearing about some of the classes we were in together and other stuff and after that we talked some more. About 3 days later when I was over at a friends party drunk and high off my ass I decided it was a good idea with my drunk self to confess how I felt since freshman year. And how did that go. Awkwardly as fuck. She said I don’t know you which with my drunk self I didn’t think was a no but I was drunk so I started asking other questions like if she already had a bf or if she was interested in one or why not. Ps she said no she didn’t have a bf, that she really just felt like doing her own thing and just because she didn’t feel like it. But when I woke up sober the next morning I texted her a apology and didn’t get a response so I kinda just went on about my day. After that day though for like the last 2 weeks I decided I was going to give up on being her bf and just try to be her friend. I tried a way too often to try and start conversations by saying things like hi or what’s up or stuff like that and sending streaks or sending good morning or goodnight. But either way this went on for about 2 weeks without any responses until yesterday where she unfriended me on snap but still let me follow her on Instagram.  So I sent a paragraph long apology on Instagram and now I’m waiting to see if she’ll look at it or not. I’m emotionally confused, is there anything I can do to fix this situation or is it just done if you read thanks and please if you can leave honest feedback.
