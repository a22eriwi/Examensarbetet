Giving away too much in your description can do as much harm as it can good because it takes away from any mystery towards you which can suck out the fun of what dating actually is, GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. 

Personally I think you should get off your high horse, online dating IS superficial whether you like it or not and I can guarantee every single persons first judgement is based on your pictures, regardless of what your profile says on it. That's just how human psychology is.

924,bo8roj,False,Venting,49,Be cautious ladies and gentlemen.,dating,"I recently (Friday night) met a cute female at a bar.  We talked for a while, exchanged phone numbers and I went home and called it a night.

Proceeded to hear from her the next day (unexpected, drunken night at a bar doesnt usually work out)  and we decide to hang out.   All is great.  Learned that she seems to have her life together, drives a nice little range rover, makes her own money.

Saturday went well and she proceeded to ask me to hang out with a couple of her friends at one of the more expensive places in my area.  It's right on the beach.  I wasn't hungry but decided to go hang out with her and meet some friends.  

She ordered a double margarita (34 dollars) and steak and shrimp (38 dollars)  while I just drink my water.

810,be755v,False,,71,We’re exclusive now!,dating,"I’ve (25F) been seeing this guy (37M) since August/September. We never discussed what we were looking for and what our intentions were so boundaries were not created. He was dating other people which lead me to date other people and it was just very stressful because I did want more.
Over the past month a lot things have happened that made me feel confident he felt the same way too. I originally planned this whole speech to give about the situation and call him out for seeing other people blah blah blah. But knowing me I need as few words as possible to get my point across (because my nerves get the best of me and I end up forgetting what I wanted to say). 
So instead I planned on asking him “what do you think about us being exclusive?” because to me that hits all the points I wanted to bring up. It acknowledges the fact we’ve been seeing other people and it indirectly says I have feelings for him and eventually would like a relationship. I went with that.
It was this past Monday morning and we were on the subway. He was going to work and I was heading to the train station to go home. Doing it in a public place isn’t great but it made me more comfortable for some reason. We’re sitting there and I know I have to do it now. “Can I get your opinion on something?” I ask. He says of course. Then I ask him. And oh my god the look on his face. I have never seen him look so nervous/scared. The only thing he says is “well this came out of nowhere”. I told him I apologize for that but there’s no textbook way to really bring this up. We sit in silence for a few more seconds. I can tell the gears are turning in his head. I tell him to be honest with me, and that if he needs to think about it that’s fine. But then he says “okay, yea let’s do it”. It felt like fireworks were going off in my heart but I remained calm on the outside and just smiled. I think I asked him “are you sure?” about five times haha. He said yes and then kissed me. I could tell he was pretty happy.

I still can’t believe it worked out. I’m feeling so relieved and honestly 100 lbs lighter now that all the stress/anxiety is gone. I’m trusting him and the fact that he knows what this is.

He pinged my DM while I was out of town last month telling me he hadn't seen me in a while and asking if I wanted to catch up sometime. So when I got back, I asked him out to lunch (I'd previously thought he was cute). We ended up having to reschedule to Friday dinner last week, and it was fun - we even went for a few drinks afterwards and I liked a lot of things I learned about him. Unfortunately, he didn't text me much afterwards. Then I got an invite to a Halloween event and was told to bring a date. I pulled together my nerves and asked him if he was free this Saturday night. He said he was free, so I asked if he wanted to my plus one to this thing. He responded saying he had just confirmed on other plans. Ah. Last minute alternative plans. His gentle way of saying no, because let's be real - if someone likes you, they'll prioritize you. To be honest, it stings and my pride took a beating because I was so accustomed to always being the one asked out. But I honestly have no regrets. This was my first time ever asking a guy out. Ultimately it didn't end up great, but I finally understood how it felt to go after someone you wanted versus debating on whether you were attracted enough to someone that wanted you. And it actually didn't feel too bad.

Moral of story: Girls, if you've thought about asking a guy out first but never given it a shot, give it a shot. I won't lie, it's not completely painless. But it gives you a new perspective on how tough it is for a guy when they ask you out and get rejected, you learn to appreciate more the guys that do gather up the guts to ask you out, and it's also really refreshing to actually try going after someone you want.

I've been reading all the comments and I've noticed there are a few comments that suggest that I might be jumping to things in regard to his response. I'll respond to some of those comments below, but for the record I still do think that it was a rejection -  if it wasn't, hopefully this will show some of you guys the variety of answers that a girl will take as a rejection and prevent you from rejecting a girl if you don't mean to!

516,a2s7zi,False,Giving Advice,87,"Reminder: male or female, your lack of success on a dating app is most likely not your fault and in no way a fair reflection of you (or how I deleted my apps and started loving myself and felt happier)",dating,"You don't need me to tell you about the woes many people, regardless of gender and orientation, deal with on dating apps. Feeling like they're not good looking enough, like they're not interesting enough, not tall enough or make enough money, etc. Let me tell you, I've been there so many times before. I've been on and off dating apps over the past several years, all at different times in my life , and for different reasons (looking for something casual, something serious, just out of boredom)

I've had a decent amount of success on these apps (by success I mean simply landing a date with a girl, regardless of whether anything more happened with her after), but I've definitely had more failures than anything. And like everyone else, I'd beat myself up and constantly wonder what I did wrong: did I not choose the right pics? Was my opening line poor? Was I too straightforward? And so on

This bothered me for a long time, because I genuinely thought I wasn't good enough for a lot of people. But this past year I've made a genuine big effort to improve myself, physically and mentally. I'm 20 days away from turning 30, yet I'm in the best shape of my life, I look fantastic and have been dressing better, and I've finally learned what it's like to be a truly confident person. Also importantly: I've been noticing a lot of girls checking me out, smiling at me, etc

Why do I bring this up? Because this past weekend I wanted to ask a girl out that I'd been crushing on, only to find out she has a boyfriend. I wasn't necessarily bummed about it, more like ""Well, I don't really know anyone else I'm interested in, maybe I could get on Bumble and see what's up""

Then I stopped myself, and I thought, I've made all this positive, great progress so far, why mess it up now? I'll probably get on Bumble or Tinder, not get many decent matches, and then be left wondering, again, if it's because I'm not tall enough or not make enough or whatever. I've gotten enough good vibes from people in real life to know I can do better than what I'd potentially get on an app

I know I'm not the only person who's keeping away from dating apps for the sake of their confidence/anxiety, and I also know that plenty more people still struggle because they think they're not enough

But you know what? You are dudes. All of you. Are you a little shy or introverted, maybe awkward and not sure how to talk to people? That's perfectly fine. There's lots of people who are like that. Are you worried you're not good looking enough? You're probably better looking than you give yourself credit for, and if you feel like there's room for improvement, it's not as daunting as it may seem: get yourself in shape and get some new clothes. You'll see how wonderful it all feels

This isn't something that happens overnight either. I've been working on myself since the beginning of the year, and with each passing week I'm still learning new things about myself, about mindfulness and confidence, about positive self-esteem and loving myself. It hasn't all been smooth sailing; I've hit a few road bumps along the way, but something else I've learned is how to better deal with those bumps. Setbacks don't feel so bad anymore; the highs are gradually getting higher, and the lows aren't as low

This can be you, because if I can do it, you can too. It's just going to take a lot of patience, dedicated effort, and persistence. If you stick with it, you'll get there, I promise

But wherever you are right now in your dating life, just remember: don't take Tinder, Bumble, whatever you're using, too seriously. Most of the people on there are either on there for the attention, don't know what they're looking for, or have such ridiculous expectations that they're probably not worth the trouble anyways (if a girl's deciding factor is how tall you are, or a guy decides based on how quickly you sleep with him, they weren't for you to begin with)

These two pics are from the last month or two. They're both probably two of the best pics anyone's ever taken of me (for different reasons):
https://imgur.com/7uDsRTI

https://imgur.com/0ygcDPg

Sometimes when I'm feeling a bit low I look at them and remind myself, shit, look how far you've come, and how much farther up you could go still. And, again, I'm just under three weeks away from hitting 30. I know people from high school (my age and younger) who've let themselves go, have basically given up, etc. I wasn't the best looking or most athletic when I was in high school or college, but I wouldn't trade what I have right now for anything

Again, this isn't something that is unique to me. I don't have any special powers or talents or shortcuts that got me here. It just takes times and perseverance. But I don't have a doubt in my mind that all of you could reach where I am too (if you're not there already) 

Love yourself, and the right person will come around. That's why I decided against installing a dating app: I'm not in a rush, and I have too much on my plate to be worrying about why I'm not getting the matches I want

984,c665n0,False,Venting,170,The Flaws of Modern Dating,dating,"So here's my ***OPINION*** on the flaws of dating in our modern society.

***First off, let me start by prefacing that  I'm a single, hetrosexual  Korean American male, consider myself relatively attractive and relatively fit (whatever) but wanted to put this out there to begin with that so that you are aware of the perspective to which this originates from.***

&#x200B;

One of the biggest flaws in my opinion regarding dating in the modern age is that males overall are basically lost when it comes to understanding where they fall in today's societal role.  I'm often lost as to what if any role I play anymore in today's society?  Where do I fit in?  Does it fucking matter any more?  Whereas in the past, this was more defined (breadwinner, head of household, protector, etc) .

Now before you go crazy saying, ""So the fuck what?  Do we have to have roles? blah blah""  This is not my point.  In fact, this is a whole other topic but rather what I'm saying is that when roles are less clear as they are today and completely blurred as they are today, it's hard to gauge in the dating world the roles we play as males in the dating world as well.

This ultimately has an effect because if the roles in the past were more defined, then the roles today should also adjust to the modern dating world as well.  In other words, if the notion of a male working and providing in families are no longer the norm, then males *making the* ***first move*** or ***paying for the first date*** and all of these antiquated roles, shouldn't they ***also*** be adjusted to the changing times?  Also, the notion of women being considered ""sexually promiscuous"" or called a ""slut"" due to simply desiring sex as much as men do, shouldn't that also be adjusted in today's society?  Aren't we way past the notion that having consensual sex is no longer a big deal at any stage of the dating timeline?  Why do we hold on to certain norms, yet not let go of others?  This is one of the major issues I have with modern dating.

&#x200B;

Second, I believe that due to the age of dating apps and social media, we have been more molded to believe there are ""types"" or standards that must be preexist in order to even have a chance in any sort of engagement whatsoever.  I can not tell you how often I'm amused by Tinder profiles that state, *""If you're under 6ft tall, swipe left""*.  I'm left laughing out loud and amused thinking that this woman's height requirement will somehow magically spawn a connection with her Tinder date than a shorter guy because height requirements have everything to do with a real connection, right?  So with that said, I'm wondering if I were to put down, *""If you have anything less than  B Cup breasts, swipe left""*  is any more damaging or less offensive?

Of course there is nothing wrong with having standards,  but  the reality is that absolutely ***NO ONE*** falls into a ***perfect list*** or set of ***preexisting standards*** that will ever match ***BEFORE*** you even meet someone.  Thus, this endless swiping of lefts and endless non matching continues to pervade our society.

Have you noticed that on dating apps that allow you to pick categories or filter your matches in their search engine come up with less matches when you keep adding more filters?  So by that logic, if a dating app has trouble creating  matches due to preexisting qualifications, what does this say about the modern dating world?  And here we are left to wonder, why is it so fucking hard?

&#x200B;

The truth is, it really isn't hard.  I think if we let go of what we ""want"" because the truth is, what we want is irrelevant when it comes to a human being, because ***EVERYONE*** comes as a unique package full of  very specific and varied experiences and feelings and simply having an open mind of experiencing a person  and connecting with a person rather than checking off standards and ""red flags""  would make the dating world so much easier.

Alas, we don't live there.  We are now in a world of disconnected and entitled people who are more image obsessed, instant obsessed, and status or financially  obsessed.  We live in a world full of unrealistic standards, and ""don't waste my time"", bots, fake profiles, cash money apps before replying, instagram click bait cam girls, ghosting as a normal way to communicate etc.  Thus, in my opinion, the existence of Tinder and how within *nanoseconds* we put our entire self worth in a swipe, is just damaging to our mental well being beyond repair.

&#x200B;

Maybe I will never find my true happiness in a relationship, but that's ***TOTALLY*** ok with me.  Because I want to experience an organic relationship filled with all the ups and downs, including the tears and frustrations. But I want to live without the ***NEED*** of being with someone but rather the desire to experience life together with someone I want to be with and truly wants to be with me.  Because no one person is the answer to happiness.  I am the answer to my own happiness.

This reminds me of how often I used to go to parties and wonder why I wasn't having a good time?  Why when I arrived home after the party that  I was happiest?  After countless parties, I realized that the reason for this was that I was fully expecting the party to make me happy.  I would simply show up expecting all of these mental images to take place and end up disappointed and frustrated if this didn't play out by the end of the night.  ***How utterly ridiculous I had been.***  The party itself is ***only*** providing a venue and the ***opportunity*** for me to have a good time.  The real party exists within me.  ***I am responsible to create my own party and fun.***  Search high and wide and you will never find *""the ultimate fun venue""* that *""epic party""* you saw in that movie.  There will never ever be a *""fun""* venue.  ***I make it fun for myself.***  I can't tell you how many times the most fun I've ever had was telling jokes and laughing outside on a quiet porch at a house  party with a group of people I took the chance with to introduce myself to.  Or the countless times I went on amazing dates and had relationships with girls whom I found interesting and struck up a random conversation with no preexisting intentions or expectations at all.  10 out of 10 times this always happened when I honestly and genuinely only wanted to have a great time and great conversation, nothing more and nothing less.

In the same light, thinking that going on countless dates or even being in a relationship will result in my happiness is just as unhealthy and destructive because nobody wants to be with someone that expects this from them.  This is by definition unfair and unrealistic.  How can someone carry the weight of your happiness on their shoulders?  Absolutely no one should have to carry this responsibility.  Relationships, I believe flourish because both people can stand on their own.  ***Expecting the other person will fulfill anything in your life is just as bad as arriving to a party and expecting the party itself to make your evening fun***. That being said, I believe that ""the one"" does ***NOT*** exist but rather, a random connection that happens when two people randomly decide to make the effort and take the random  chance of wanting to give it a go and see what happens.  Failure is a huge part of this formula as everything is based on a random chance of things working and that's totally fine and ok.  And more likely than not, you will fail of course more often than succeed.  In the end, we have always been the gatekeepers of our own happiness in every situation of life.

819,aldq3p,False,,151,My (F25) experience with online dating as a hetero woman.,dating,"I'll get right to it. I've been using online dating on and off since I was 18. It's mostly been a lot of frustration. As a woman I understand that it's a lot of pressure to put on men to always expect them to make the first move, so I have always tried to get out there and make it known when I am into a guy. However, in doing so I have noticed a lot of common issues that are very likely getting in the way of people finding one another, so I thought I would make this post to hopefully help both men and women when it comes to online dating. Since I am heterosexual, I've really only seen straight men's profiles, so I'll be focusing on the issues that I see from that particular group as well as the quality of communication that I have received over the years:





1) **Profile Pictures** - Many of them are not even of the person themselves. A large majority have only one, poorly lit photo. Even more have only one picture in which they are wearing sunglasses that cover most of their facial features. Group photos that don't specify who is the profile owner. None of these options represents the person well. In my experience, I am far more likely to swipe left on a profile like this. It makes it very difficult to discern what someone looks like and determine whether you could be attracted to them or not. Whether you are confident in your looks or more on the shy side, either way, an accurate depiction of yourself will land you far more options than any of these I mentioned.





2) **Self Description** - I see far too many men's profiles that have ""ask me"" or just ""ask"" in every section. I understand the thought behind this, or what I assume to be the idea. If someone is interested enough, they will just ask, or maybe it's hard to know what to write. I get it. But remember, online dating is about marketing yourself to others. It's your job to do your best to represent yourself well and accurately to attract the kind of person you are looking for. I can say confidently that I immediately swipe left on this kind of profile no matter what the picture looks like. If you can't be bothered to fill in a little info about yourself, I'm not going to pull it out of you. That information is incredibly crucial. When someone does decide to message you, that information has already opened up a bunch of talking points and opportunity to get to know each other better. It's a super important factor to facilitate conversation. It's the combination of both pictures and personality that draws me to a guy. I personally appreciate an 'about me' section that reads like it was written honestly. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to give people an idea of who you are, what you love, and what you want out of life. A profile in which someone has put in some honest effort to convey that information is so much more attractive than ""ask me.""





3) **Omitting certain information** - Ok guys. Let's get real. Things like height, body type, having/not having kids, having a car, certain values, occupation etc. are all very important things when determining a partner. Whether you are totally satisfied with your current answers to these questions or not, I strongly recommend that you do answer them, and answer them honestly. Here's an example. I am a plus-sized woman. If I were to put on my profile that I am anything other than that, I would be matched up with men that don't prefer women of my size. I would then be disappointed that none of my matches are interested in me, and would have wasted a lot of my own time as well as others'. Instead, I answer it honestly and say that I am, in fact, a large woman. So I am matched up with men that are open to dating someone like me, and I have far better luck with dating. Makes sense, right? No matter what you have, where you are in life, what you look like, there is someone out there for everyone. But it's going to be a lot more difficult if you are casting your net in the wrong direction. Tell us the truth about things, guys. It's well worth it.





4) **Communication** - Ok this is a huge one, and one that I don't really understand to boot. It is far too common that when I message a guy first, and I almost always do, the conversation dies off very, very quickly. I take the time to read the profile of the person I am messaging so that I can more easily add to the conversation and make it easy for them to do the same. This is where it's important to have that information available. Most times, I will receive a single word answer to an open-ended question, and no follow up. They respond when I send a message, but with very few words and no attempt to keep the conversation going, never ask questions, etc. Now one might think that they are just not very interested, except for the fact that they often ask why I stopped messaging them, seemingly unaware. It's because I am not into one-sided conversations where I have to do all of the work. It's a give and take. So guys, if this happens to you, compare your messages to the ones you are receiving. Are you asking her about herself too? Did you reference anything that was in her profile? I will admit it is different talking to someone in person than it is messaging over a website, I think it's a little more challenging and that's why conversational skills are that much more important for online dating. Learning about each other is going to be a little tedious and awkward at first, or at least it is IME until you get the usual niceties out of the way. Don't be afraid try and say a little more, it just gives us more to talk about.





5) **Read my profile** - There are a lot of reasons for this, but the biggest issue I have experienced personally is due to my status of being Child Free. I've lost count of the number of times a guy with children has contacted me, and then been surprised or angry when I say it's not going to work out. Had they paid attention to the obvious disclaimer on my profile, we could have both avoided wasting our time. This goes right along with #3. Do not omit the fact that you have kids and expect a CF person to suddenly be ok with it. You are setting yourself up to fail, and not to mention, it's a dick move.




So these are the five biggest issues I've witnessed quite a bit. If you've read up until this point I'd like to say thanks. I hope this helps everyone in their dating endeavors and hopefully lessens some of the more frustrating aspects of it. 



If there is something I left out or if you have something to add, please leave a comment. Thoughts and constructive criticism are welcome.



Edit: I'd like to add that this definitely applies to everyone, gender aside.

I would also love to add a couple of things in reference to taking good pictures. I personally use the lighting in my bathroom to take my best pictures. Make-up lights will do absolute wonders. Some residential bathrooms have them, it's the kind with several large, round bulbs usually at the top of the mirror or around the perimeter. I do my hair and put on my best outfit, then just play around with the front-facing camera on my phone. Truth be told, I will get one really good picture out of every 25 or more.

482,ffrx1j,False,Other,37,reconnected with a girl i met 4+ years ago,dating,"It all started in 2015 when i (m25 then, 29 now) first met her (w21 then, 25 now)  via mutual friends. We both were single at the time. She never had a bf before and zero experience at all, on the other side i already had 2 pretty shitty short term flicks. We started to hang out more often and eventually i had a feeling that this could work out, so i did send that risky text, asking her about what she feels. I'm a pretty shy and introverted person so this was anything but easy for me and the reason i did it via text and not in person. She turned me down, not because she didn't like me but because she  felt more like being just friends would feel better to her. Back then i thought ""fuck yeah, i got friendzoned"" and sadly did not invest that much effort into the friendship anymore. I always told myself it was to get over my feeling to her, but in the end it was kind of a dick and selfish move.

Some months passed and i eventually met my now ex gf of the next 4 years. In all that time i maybe had a handful conversations with her, mainly on birthdays and new years etc. It still felt like there was some kind of connection even when we havent seen in all those years and barely talked. I actually was interrested in keeping closer contact and build up on that friendship now that i'm not single anymore and feelings probably couldn't hurt me. But my gf at the time was a really jealous person and did not want me to have contact or a friendship with a girl i used to have feelings for. So we never met in those 4 years, when it actually could have been so easy since she studied in the same town as i was living in for the past 2 years.

2020 rolls in, i'm a fresh single again and actually pretty happy with that. At first i didn't thought about her but she recently started being quite active on social media (she is a cosplayer) and it got my attention. I asked her to met up and she was in for it without any hesitation. It took us almost 2 months to finally set up a day but in the end we got there. Since then we have met more than once, just the two of us and sometimes with mutual friends and this past weekend she slept at my place because we were out with friends and she couldn't catch her train in time. ""Nothing"" happend, we just talked for hours straight (you know that drunken trashtalk you do) until it was already early in the morning and we totally messed up out sleepcycle by only getting 2 hours of sleep in the end.

I had to get up at noon for a football (soccer) game and told her she could stay in my appartment as long as she wants to. As soon as i left for my game i felt like i probably missed a chance there and couldn't help it but text her about how good it felt to reconnect with her and that i haven't been that happy in a long time. I once again send that risky text asking her about what she feels and if she still thinks of me as ""just a friend"". Even if she did, i would have been fine with it now, i learned so much in these years that i wouldn't have called it ""friendzoned again"". To my surprise she answered almost instantly and hell this fact and the actual response cheered me up like nothing did in a very long time.

She is in for the ""let's see where this is going and if it works out, why not"". Later we talked about the sleepover and what would have happend if i made a move that night. She said she probably would have gone with it, but she is very happy i didn't since we both were still a bit drunk and that i showed a lot of respect for her to not take advantage of that. She thinks it was way better to talk about it before and if i haven't send that risky text, she would have done it later that day.

Now here i am, looking forward to dating a wonderful woman and so excited for what is about to happen in the next days, weeks, months or even years. :)

Ghosting leaves individuals without a sense of closure. Closure, as we might know from personal experience, is incredibly important to many of us! When we are ghosted, we leave even the most casual encounters with a sense of unease and, perhaps, the tiniest bit of what feels like grief. 

I have been working on ending mismatches or flings I have met in person with simple sentences. My most general is, “I don’t feel this is a match.” Generally, it goes over well. Yes, I do have a fear someone will cling and make promises they cannot possibly keep. This is where my boundary setting skills get tested and I repeat that this isn’t a good match and wouldn’t work. 

I try not to bring up any personal things- sometimes it has nothing to do with who the person is, but rather who I am as a person. We’re all trying to find matches, and just because one doesn’t work out doesn’t meant there’s anything wrong with either. It’s simply not a good match. ANYWAYS I got off topic. 

END GHOSTING. Let’s be mature adults! 

Thank you.

EDIT: I’ve gotten enough responses assuming that I’m pissed off that I’m getting ghosted that I feel I should clarify on the post instead of individual comments: first, I am a woman...not a man. Second, I have been reflecting on my own ghosting and realized it’s kind of shitty of me to do. I’m not trying to change anyone, make them do what I think they should do.

341,ez1pas,False,Venting,396,"I (25F) approached a random guy on the train, told him he was cute, gave him my number; here's the real life account of what comes after",dating,"So, a recap: about two weeks go I posted on this subreddit [a simple question aimed at all men - how would you react if a woman approached you in a public space and gave you her number?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eqtj6e/men_in_this_sub_how_would_you_feel_if_a_woman/)

At the time, I had basically been faced with this situation: a really cute guy caught my eye on the commuter train, and I really wanted to approach him. Because I'm painfully shy and felt unable to make great conversation with him/couldn't stand the humiliation of being so publicly rejected, I took a post-it and wrote my number and a flattering little message on the paper. I held it in my hand forever trying to pluck up the courage to approach him, but he ended up hopping off the train before I had the chance to do it.

I instantly regretted not doing anything about it, and I promised myself that if this ever happened again, I would just. Do. It.

Fast-forward to today. I'm on the commuter train. Yet another guy shows up, and I have the same instinct - he's attractive, he's cute, I'm feeling him. I'm looking at him for a while with my sunglasses on, biting my lip and thinking ""Should I really do this?"". At the end, I just think ""Fuck it, what's the least that can happen?"". So I reach in my wallet for the post-it from two weeks ago (hey, might as well re-use it, right?), walked up to him. He was sitting down reading a book. I just said ""Hey, I have something I'd like to give you"", smiling; he just stares at me, surprised, at say ""Oh, thanks"", and takes the paper. I walked away immediately, so I'm not even sure that he read it or looked a it. By the time that I look behind me, he's opening his backpack and throwing the piece of paper inside. He looks at me with this dead serious look on his face, no smile, and proceeds to keep reading his book.

I eventually hopped off the train before he did, feeling absolutely defeated, disgusting, ugly, miserable. I mean, he was nice, he said thank you, he didn't do anything wrong per se. But I guess I was hoping for a more enthusiastic reaction, and his ""I could kill you"" look really demotivated me.

For a few hours I just kept thinking ""Well that's it, you're clearly unattractive and unloveable, might as well just forget about dating altogether"". But then again, I should be proud of what I did; I took a chance by putting myself out there and did something I never thought I could do. It gave me this strange adrenaline, my heart was beating so fast! His response was quite negative, a lot more than what I thought possible, but I'm trying to be positive and I'm still proud of myself. And hey, maybe some day some guy on some train somewhere, wherever I end, will actually make good use of my number, right?

So, TL;DR: followed people's advice from a few weeks ago to approach people on the train. Ended up getting deadly rejected, but that's okay, because I felt a strange rush I hadn't felt in years. Doesn't matter if the world thinks I'm ugly or fat or whatever, it still made me feel alive!

I speak from experience. This has actually happened to me. Situation was a little different. We had ran into one another more than once. She gave me a nice little note with her number. I was flattered. She walked away immediately like you did. I didn’t call or text because I’m not interested in dating anyone and I’m working on bettering myself and my situation. I saw her once more after that and was very nice to her. It was awkward though. There was nothing wrong with her. She was cute and nice. I sometimes regret never at least texting her and letting her know that it wasn’t her. I have trust issues and wasn’t comfortable giving my number when I didn’t really know her.

There was a time right after I was hurt REALLY badly that I wanted nothing to do with the female species at all.. even then I still would’ve been cordial.. my point is.. don’t feel ugly and unlovable and all that.

We have no social skills because we hook up.” (A really great read on current dating culture, people having less sex, declining social skills)",dating,"The Atlantic just published a great article on why younger people are having less sex. It goes beyond sex, though, and looks at the entire picture of how people are socializing nowadays, the problems with online dating and why they don't deliver, and how that contributes to the decline of not just sex, but basic social skills and connection overall. For anyone who is frustrated with not being able to meet anyone, I think the read will help you feel a little better.

I'm linking it in the comments since I can't link it here, but there's a lot interesting tidbits about online dating in particular such as:

>In all dating markets, apps appear to be most helpful to the highly photogenic. As Emma, a 26-year-old virgin who sporadically tries her luck with online dating, glumly told me, “Dating apps make it easy for hot people—who already have the easiest time.” Christian Rudder, a co-founder of OkCupid (one of the less appearance-centric dating services, in that it encourages detailed written profiles), reported in 2009 that the male users who were rated most physically attractive by female users got 11 times as many messages as the lowest-rated men did; medium-rated men received about four times as many messages. The disparity was starker for women: About two-thirds of messages went to the one-third of women who were rated most physically attractive. A more recent study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Santa Fe Institute found that online daters of both genders tend to pursue prospective mates who are on average 25 percent more desirable than they are—presumably not a winning strategy.  
>  
>So where does this leave us? Many online daters spend large amounts of time pursuing people who are out of their league. Few of their messages are returned, and even fewer lead to in-person contact. At best, the experience is apt to be bewildering (*Why are all these people swiping right on me, then failing to follow through?*). But it can also be undermining, even painful. Emma is, by her own description, fat. She is not ashamed of her appearance, and purposefully includes several full-body photos in her dating profiles. Nevertheless, men persist in swiping right on her profile only to taunt her—when I spoke with her, one guy had recently ended a text exchange by sending her a gif of an overweight woman on a treadmill.  
>  
>An even bigger problem may be the extent to which romantic pursuit is now being cordoned off into a predictable, prearranged online venue, the very existence of which makes it harder for *anyone*, even those not using the apps, to extend an overture in person without seeming inappropriate. What a miserable impasse.

&#x200B;

>He had better luck with Tinder than the other apps, but it was hardly efficient. He figures he swiped right—indicating that he was interested—up to 30 times for every woman who also swiped right on him, thereby triggering a match. But matching was only the beginning; then it was time to start messaging. “I was up to over 10 messages sent for a single message received,” he said. In other words: Nine out of 10 women who matched with Simon after swiping right on him didn’t go on to exchange messages with him. This means that for every 300 women he swiped right on, he had a conversation with just one.  
>  
>At least among people who don’t use dating apps, the perception exists that they facilitate casual sex with unprecedented efficiency. In reality, unless you are exceptionally good-looking, the thing online dating may be best at is sucking up large amounts of time. As of 2014, when Tinder last released such data, the average user logged in 11 times a day. Men spent 7.2 minutes per session and women spent 8.5 minutes, for a total of about an hour and a half a day. Yet they didn’t get much in return. Today, the company says it logs 1.6 billion swipes a day, and just 26 million matches. And, if Simon’s experience is any indication, the overwhelming majority of matches don’t lead to so much as a two-way text exchange, much less a date, much less sex.

3,dgizvi,False,Tinder/Online Dating,175,A tinder story,dating,"A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I’m not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn’t know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn’t like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we’re also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it’s just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father’s blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don’t give up.

(this is written as an encouragement, not as insult or put down)

&#x200B;

Through the recent tragic suicide of my ex fiance of 8 years (and me essentially becoming a widower before being a husband, at age 36), in which during the final minutes of his life, he has skype video called me — a call that lasted a full 90 minutes... from 7790 miles away... in 1080p... not asking me to save him.. but wanted my blessing for his final journey in his 3rd attempt after suffering from 4 years of depression... with a plate of charcoal burning on the side and more than a dozen sleeping pills already ingested...  — it got me thinking :

&#x200B;

why did he trust me in dying when many others don’t even have someone who ***ever*** have trusted them in living?

&#x200B;

My body is mediocre, face is acceptable, earn in low 6-figures but nowhere close to being a 1%-er, and definitely not the nicest person around. Am I that lucky, or is everyone else so unlucky ?

&#x200B;

For perpetually single folks, ranging from the uber hot very successful types, good enough all around but lower self esteem, circuit party queens, to so-so quality guys, I think I finally found the common theme that links them, which also points to each of those solving the wrong problem, and the solution I'm proposing doesn’t involve any part of physical appearance or money either —

&#x200B;

**THEIR WILL TO TAKE A STAND**

&#x200B;

The one common theme among this vast array of friends and acquaintances is that, driven by their desire to either maximize friend gain or minimize friend/potential candidate lost, all have a personality that prevents them from willing to take a stand ... on anything.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand doesn’t have to be on political topics. Doesn't have to be as polarizing as #RESISTANCE vs. #MAGA. e.g. Publicly declaring you like Benz over BMW is taking a stand. Saying you like Korean cuisine but not Japanese ones is taking a stand. Packers over Eagles is taking a stand. But saying you like everything and don’t hate anything isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand must involve prioritizing one item over another, and not hiding the preference when others inquire about it. Secretly loving Star Trek over Star Wars but telling others you love both or you have no pref isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

But that also entails the single risk all of the groups appear unwilling to bear — the risk of offending ANYONE. If u like A over B and make the preference public, people who like B may not understand why, and thus may get offended, however unreasonably that may be.

&#x200B;

So, this group of people, fear of losing any potential partying buddies or dating candidates, would present themselves as friendly-to-all, care-free, opinion-free (and maybe even cage-free), while punting all decision-making to someone else (deciding something on behalf of others is also taking a stand, even something as basic as like deciding a place for lunch) It goes back to them being single... because what exactly is dating?

&#x200B;

**Dating is someone willing to take a stand...** ***ON YOU*****.**

&#x200B;

Someone willing to pick you. Someone willing to shoulder the risk of offending his friends who don’t like because they believe you are important, and believe you are worth it. But it has to be reciprocal and mutual - they expect that you also would've taken a stand on him in the process.

&#x200B;

The obvious question to ask is — why would anyone be willing to take a stand on you when all they see is someone unwilling to take a stand on anything? Not just something, but **ANYTHING**, and ***EVERYTHING***.

&#x200B;

Many of them kept thinking others found theirs due to shear. dumb. luck.

Some thought their body isn’t hot and buff enough.

Some thought they’re not rich enough.

Some thought they’re not nice enough.

&#x200B;

So they all waste time solving the wrong problem, and doubling down when the solution doesn't seem to have yielded returns (in their minds : ""....yet""). But it boils down to — maybe, they aren’t principled enough to have principles. Start with taking a stand on everyday life options, like a car, a ski resort, an island in Hawaii, a book recommended by Oprah, a game console (yes, i'm the nut job who loves Nintendo Switch), take the risk of potentially offending one of your 4500 facebook ""friends"" and 6000 IG ""followers"",

“Into Fitness” or “workout regularly” with multiple bathing suit / gym photos or IG tag only = Code for I’m somewhat vein and superficial but I’m also fit and expect you to be as well.

“Go out or stay in” or “Ambivert” = Code for I’m not an anxiety-ridden recluse and I’m also not overcompensating for personality flaws with raw energy.

“Positive outlook” = Code for I know or have known someone with depression and am not looking to bring more of that into my life. 

“Day drinking” with more than one photo with an adult beverage = Code for I’m alcoholic and/or enjoy binge drinking. 

Fluent in Sarcasm = Code for I’m mean and snarky but I play it off as humor. 

These are the meaningless ones that I’m sick of. 

“Laugh” or “funny” = Code for I want someone who can hold an engaging conversation and has a similar sense of humor to me. Who doesn't?

“I love the water / beach / pool / lake / river” = Code for I can swim and am not allergic to the sun.

“Just ask” = Code for I’m too lazy to write stuff here.

It's like this balancing act. Well, before the balancing act it's trying to find someone you share some kind of interest in, be it physical or emotional attraction. If you're lucky, both.

K, then you like each other. You hang out. Then you suppress emotions so you don't scare the other off, so you overthink. ""They haven't responded yet, fuck are they ghosting me?"" ""They're probably just sleeping"" ""If you don't stop thinking about them you're gonna jinx it"" ""Did I jinx it"" ""Oh wait, everything's chill"" ""I just hung out with them it's fine"" ""I like them but I can't tell them because it'll freak 'em out"" ""The sex was AMAZING"" 

Or maybe you don't like them. Then it's... shit, maybe I just don't like them because they're not my ""type"" so, I should consider them. Broaden my horizons. I like their flaws, I can do this. Then you end up leading them on. You never liked them. Wasted time.

Because I can't reply to everyone, I just want to say thanks so much for all your replies, the concensus is more or less unanimouse that **""If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No"".** The *reasons* for interpreting such mixed signals as ""No"" are still worth debating....

PS/ 2nd Edit: I'd like everyone to remember that while many women do give mixed signals and ""lead men on"" the motive for that is not always manipulation!

643,exzcsm,False,Tinder/Online Dating,105,Dating App idea!,dating,"My idea for a dating app (pardon if this is dumb but I'm bored and drinking). You basically log in, create an account and then have to decide if you're looking for something casual or serious right at the start. This creates two separate groups of people and can only be switched by requesting which requires the user to fill out a form. This I think will make the process of switching tedious enough to stop people from toggling back in forth to take advantage of both groups.

Anyways, the profile has required fields. These fields include things such as a 3 picture minimum (at least 2/3 has to be ONLY you and you have to be visible), age, height, gender, career, education and two text boxes - one for a brief introduction and then the second for hobbies/interests. These text boxes will have a minimum requirement.

Here's where I think it gets unique. All conversation is live. You must both be online at the same time to chat. You only see users online at the time you are and these users are in the form of little icons you can click on to view. You basically go through and mark yes or no that you would like to talk to them and it will mark any users that want to talk to you in green on your screen so you know! If you match with them then you both get a notification saying that you want to talk to each other. Once you mark someone as a no they will disappear from your list so you can't see that they are online but you can go to another screen that let's you see everyone you've said no to and basically check any you want to undo.

If you both say yes to the notification to talk, you're brought into a chat room where you get questions based on if you're looking for something casual or serious. It is a specific number of questions like maybe 5-10 and it changes each time. Then you just share your answers and at the end you get to choose if you'd like to keep talking to them. If at any point you decide you aren't fond of the person you can exit the chat and then they get sent to your ""rejected"" group unless you go uncheck them. If you make it through though and both want to keep talking than you get your own chat where you don't have to be on at the same time and can exchange numbers/meet up or whatever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/exzcsm/dating_app_idea/,233,"I quit my job and spent the last 12 months building pretty much this.

196,ckdu92,False,,287,A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates,dating,"**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring ""success"" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily ""we had sex on the first date.""

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, ""I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want."" 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, ""What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?"" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, ""Do you want to get drinks some time?"" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, ""I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!"" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, ""I had a really great time."" 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet.

253,fadjou,False,Other,128,Why I like being single,dating,"Yes, I know this is a dating subreddit, but I figured it might help to share the view from the other side.  (I should probably mention that I'm ASD (formerly Asperger's), so my perspective is different from the norm.  YMMV.)

There's a lot to romantic relationships.  Stages, timings, things you should or should not do or say, etc.  Being single means I don't have to worry about or keep track of any of those.  There's the darker side of relationships--manipulation, abuse, cheating, divorce--that I completely avoid.  There's also the perils of dating that I avoid--getting ghosted, getting stood up, being led on, being used, and being stalked or worse.  Being single means that I'm the only one driving, and have full control over how I spend my time and money.  Finally, there's a strong sense of security and stability when you are the only factor in your life.

While I'm sure that ""the right one is out there,"" the cost and risk associated with being in a romantic relationship just isn't worth it for me.  Maybe I'll bump into someone who'll make me reconsider, maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who find ""the one.""  Until then, I have a career to pursue, a house to  buy, competitions to win, a furbaby to raise, and a host of video games to play (so psyched for Cyberpunk!).

TLDR; Being single isn't a curse.  Just like being in a relationship, it has it's own pros and cons.  You can prefer one over the other, and still be happy in both.

I don’t think women should ever ask men out. If a man really wants to date a girl, he will make it happen. If you look at animal mating behavior in nature, it’s the male bird that puts on a show and tries to win over the female with his feathers and twigs. The inverse is unnatural. Sure you can ask a guy out, things might even work out great. But eventually he will see the girl he would have asked out, and he’ll leave you for her. 

There are other ways to let men know that you like them. Flirting, appearing interested in conversation with them, subtly making it known you are single etc. If after doing that a guy doesn’t ask you out, he’s not into you.

Then I started meeting single people, going on dates, and slowly realized that the people I went on dates/etc with that were still single in their late twenties and beyond were drastically different than people Id meet who were married/taken etc. like, no matter what happened, the person eventually turned into ""ahhhhh this is why she is single"".  Either there was some very quirky about their personality, they looked way worse in pictures, they were attractive but just....not pleasant people. or...there was just nothing....attractive about the person?

Now I have nothing against her personally but I have the feeling my boyfriend has a crush on her. Now him having a crush wouldn't be a problem if it was a celebrity, not someone he knows in real life. He tries to deny it but I don't believe him. I tried bringing it up again today and he said ""what if I did? Would you be upset?"" Then he saw me getting upset and saying I'm the one who he should love. He says he loves me and that he doesn't have a crush on her, that he was speaking hypothetically. He said over and over that he doesn't have a thing for her. 


He's a friendly guy and he was upfront about the friendliness before we were together,  but hes always giggly around her. Like sometimes I just want to hide myself and be preoccupied on my phone because I can't stand it. Went to a yard sale yesterday where things were given away for free. He found a half dry erase/bulletin board he said he wanted for his room.. then later on he decides to give it to his sister, who supposedly doesn't want it and he gave it to the friend instead. Went to Dollar Tree and one of the things he buys is dry erase markers he gave to her.. he didn't buy me anything. His parents also said they heard him ranting outside about what I told him and said it was sad that I don't trust him and that he comes home to me. I have suspected for a while that he's been into her. He said in the past he was interested in her because she likes the music he likes, but that he didn't pursue her because it was his sister's friend. 

It's not even just the way he acts around her, it's social media too. He's always ""hearting"" or ""liking "" her photos even when I've told him the hearts bother me. He did it as recently as last night. He says this is how he is showing support to others, especially as she is a fitness guru. 

Now please before I suspect that I'll be told I'm being possessive,  insecure etc.. understand where I'm coming from. I'm very outspoken and don't hide how I feel.

I'm content with being single, however, I'm actively looking for a relationship, and I'm sure all of us single people know, it feels hopeless.

I currently live with my high school buddy and his girlfriend.  We all have a good relationship with each other, and its not awkward at all to live with them because they're both good friends of mine.  But there are times where they'll cuddle together and watch a movie, and I'll be in the other room, notice them, and start feeling like ""wow, it would be great to have that right now."".  Whenever the other comes home, they're always there to greet them, ask how their day was, and give each other a kiss.  Stuff like that is what I want out of a relationship.  I'm in a band with some other friends of mine, and they are all in relationships, one of them is married, another just became engaged, so on, so forth.  I don't have a lot of friends, but I'm very close to the people I keep regular contact with.  And everyone is in a freaking relationship.

We met at a birthday party and I asked her out. We hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship, but was fine with dating me. We got along great. Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point.

831,8ykopq,False,Venting,69,This sub has been toxic lately,dating,"I recently deleted my old profile on here because I just couldn’t deal with all the toxic people on this sub anymore. I cannot believe how many [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys), [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels), etc. have infected this place. So many disgusting comments getting upvoted and decent, reasonable people being harassed and attacked for saying things like “no, women don’t owe you, or any guy, anything.”

I feel like the user base here is highly skewed towards “thirsty dudes looking for the magic secret to getting laid/getting a girlfriend,” and that unfortunately leads to a tendency for this crowd to default to always take a rejected guy’s side in any situation, regardless of context. Since they really want (and think they deserve… cringe) more chances in their own lives, “give the guy a chance” is always their default answer. I’ve seen tons of posts where a woman describes all kinds of creepy, cringe-y, stalker-y, even rape-y behavior… and oftentimes the mob *stil*l takes the guy’s side and attacks the woman for “being mean to the poor guy and not giving him a chance.” I see this kind of mentality other places around reddit too. Any time the obvious answer to how to deal with a shitty person engaging in all kinds of awful and inappropriate behavior is “don’t put up with it and kick them out,” a bunch of people will complain about how that’s “unfair,” and that it’s “immature” of them to not put up with other peoples’ bad behavior. Or they act like if someone is acting inappropriately and making everyone around them uncomfortable, that it’s somehow everyone else’s responsibility to teach another adult basic social skills (or be a “dating coach”). In light of this, I have to think that a lot of these people rabidly defending “the creepy guy” or “the friend no one likes” in these stories probably *are* “that guy” in their own social lives.

And the anti-ghosting crusade. Holy shit. All these emotionally unstable people act like the fucking sky is falling, the world is ending, and the art of civility and human connection is irreparably broken… because people occasionally don’t contact some random person they barely knew after going on a date with them. News flash, it’s not everyone else’s problem that *you* can’t take a hint and/or have attachment issues. People will often tell (or respond to) these stories where it was *very*obvious the other person wasn’t into them, and then act all confused because “they didn’t say those words exactly.” Then they will inevitably blame the other person (usually, the woman) for “not communicating.” Communication is a two-way street, and if you miss or ignore every single non-verbal way that someone is communicating that they don’t like you and are uncomfortable with you, that’s a failure to communicate and act in a socially appropriate way. As an adult, you shouldn’t *need* other people to tell you those things. “I didn’t know any better” is no excuse for acting like a creep.

And these same people who absolutely lose their shit over getting ghosted and rabidly attack anyone who *dares* tell them that “no, it’s really not that big of deal and you should get over it,” have the nerve to gush about what great gentleman they are and how they would totally handle rejection well… They can’t even take a stranger on the internet saying something they disagree with well.

I see a similar issue with guys posting creepy stories basically outlining how obsessed/fixated they are on some girl, sometimes to the point of stalking, and then viciously attacking anyone who points out that “you know, it’s pretty unhealthy to be that obsessed with someone you aren’t even dating or anything.” They’ll say all kinds of nasty things to anyone who dares criticize them… and then do the same “gush about how I’m such a gentleman and *definitely* not a stalker” routine.

One of the best pieces of advice my boss has given me is “you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself as an observer. You have to see yourself the way others see you.” And these cringe-y guys just don’t understand that. Throwing a tantrum because you got rejected, not called back, or dumped looks bad. Ranting about “how terrible all women are” because of one or two bad experiences in your personal life looks bad. Expecting some kind of gold star or “credit you can redeem for a wonderful girlfriend” for being a law-abiding citizen who is generally polite, has a job, a car, and your own place is laughable.

You match with someone on whatever app/site you're using, agree to meet up, and then they show up looking little like the actual person you matched with.

I've seen so many of these people complain that there's unfair standards, that everyone else is shallow and places too much emphasis on looks, whatever. And they're completely missing the point: you being 20 pounds heavier than in the past isn't the issue, it's the fact that you had to lie and deceive someone into meeting you that's the problem. It also screams insecurity. If you're lying from the get-go the relationship, assuming it happens, will be toxic. Unless the other person is desperate and happy with anyone

I felt trapped and like I couldn't get out, so I just packed up and left one day. I felt lonely and joined a social/dating app. I just wanted to talk to people again, since I don't have really any friends. 

I got so many messages, my app was crashing. So many creeps. I messaged a few back, but it either got weird or didn't go anywhere. But one guy just asked me why I was on the app. I said I was lonely, and he asked to Snapchat. 

I expected him to ask for nudes and all that, but I was surprised when he didn't. He was ice fishing with his brothers and it was Christmas Eve. I like fishing, so we got to talking. 

We talked 24/7 (except when we were sleeping) every day after that.  Snapchat and text every minute were awake. He calls me on my work break every evening. We have soooo much in common. I'm super outdoorsy and he is too. Plus he's cute as hell and sooo sweet lol. 

He's in the next state over, almost 5 hours away. But I jumped in my car and headed over there for a whole weekend two weeks after we started talking. 

I had the time of my life. We went ice fishing for 12 hours, and I had a blast. We went back to his place and smoked weed, and he made me amazing chicken enchiladas. We had sex, which was mind blowing. I had never had sex so good lol. We watched Netflix and cuddled until we fell asleep. 

He came to my place this weekend. I took him fishing on my favorite lake. We hot boxed his fishing shack, and had some risky sex. A warden came to check licenses, and we ended up both getting tickets for paraphernalia. Oops. Went back to my cabin. The generator blew up (we planned on watching movies) so we played cards under the gas lights and drank beer. Pushed the couches together by the wood stove and cuddled all night in our makeshift bed. 

He handled our shit situation so well, and just made the best of it. 

He asked me if I wanted to make things official while we were waiting for our tickets that night, I said yeah lol. 

I'm falling hard guys. He's so nice and respectful toward me, unlike anyone I've been with before. He met my dad, and left a great impression. We share so many of the same interests. Made so many plans to go camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing. Its early yet, and I've been drinking tonight, but holy cow am I hoping this works out.

You don't also don't have to specify that it's a DATE... just invite her out to some event you're already planning on going to or just to simply hang.

also, did you try to do any small talk? you said you knew her for 2 years but how much interaction did you have??

My guess is you talked to her initially when you first got there..

 didn't talk for a long time but thought about her a lot... built up the courage, made a weird intro and just asked her..........which doesn't work.....

the reason you use small talk, is to gauge her interest level..... actually you can use this with anybody.... and through small talk you can seamlessly transition into asking her out or exiting the convo....

lastly, if what she said hurt you because it's true, then fix it... that means take care of yourself in the mental, physical, spiritual, finances etc.... or find your purpose in life... do any of these things and then the shit people say will just be white noise ",2019-06-29 10:57:22

I  have recently moved to Canada and don't know anyone here really and  decided to give tinder a try to see how it goes(in the country i came  from it was really dry to say the least). Anyway, to my surprise girls  were more responsive and were willing t go out(I am not exotic or  anything like that). Went on a date with one girl, it was okay, really  formal, got ghosted after that. Went out with the second girl the next  day and we had a really good connection, touching each other and stuff  like that. Unfortunately she lives in a nearby town and only comes to my  town for work, and got a horrible disease recently that put her in a  hospital. We still chat but she doesn't have time to date, but i will of  course go out with her if she wants. Went out with one more girl, again  something was off but it wasn't bad, but we stopped talking. The final  girl i met at a bar, while the others were all at a cafe, and this girl  was really quiet. It was like i had to pull words out of her, maybe she  was nervous , but she messaged me later saying that i am a great guy but  she had no time due to work lol.

What  these 4 dates did for me is that they gave me a huge confidence boost  and that it's okay if it doesn't work out. But I still need to work on  my first impressions.

Me and this guy made eye contact... Pretty normal but then i looked away and then i looked to cross the road and he was still looking. 

Then we crossed the road and he started chatting to me. Seemed pretty normal. 

Then he was like “you’re really pretty, you must think i’m nice too hehe” i had my headphones in so kinda missed bits of it but then he asked for my name and where i lived. I said east. He said he lived west. 

Then he said “oh you seem really nice can i get your number or something i’d like to get to know you.

 I was like okay...gave him my number. He’s like when are you free. I’m like not until Friday/Saturday. He for some reason won’t believe this although i’ve told him i have deadlines... 

Then he was like cool, can i have a kiss i was like LOL no. Then he was like “come on don’t be shy.” And i was like “i’m alright thanks.” But he just keeps asking, then asks if i can kiss him and i’m saying “no. I don’t do that.  Sorry.” and then i’m like “right, i’m going this way now...” and he’s like “ok hug goodbye?” 

So i was like fine whatever, and then he kissed me on my cheek and i was like a bit annoyed but it’s a minor i suppose... until i realise he isn’t pulling away like you usually would post hug, he does that lingering around thing fairly close to my face and he then says “how about a proper one now?” 

I was like “are you for real?!” Like i’m pulling away quite aggressively and he’s still got me in the hug at this point. And i’m shouting “seriously, get off me” and he’s like “okok haha well i will definitely see you on saturday.” 

No you definitely will not. 

I’ve blocked his number etc. But it’s still grinding my gears that this happened. He genuinely seemed alright at the beginning. 

Not sure how i always seem to attract the nutters/unreliables/uncertain/inattentive/dishonest ones. 

But a guy i just started dating also decided today that it was too soon for him to date after being out of a relationship for 1.5 months (which is totally fine), but he told me to book mini golf for our next date a few days ago and then we hadn’t spoken over the weekend. I told him i’d booked it and he said great can’t wait and then i’ve been busy this weekend with uni work so today messaged like are we still on? And he was like i had a great time with you but i dont think im ready to date or anything yet and i don’t want to waste your time. I said that’s fine but annoying cause already booked it, he kindly paid me back. And said its a shame as i was looking forward to it and it was nice that we both weren’t wanting anything serious. I think it ended on alright terms, he said he just needed to figure stuff out with himself but he enjoyed meeting and talking to me. Didn’t really have anything to say. So that’s that. 

I’m not annoyed that we’re now not going to date, it’s not a big deal and if he needs time, that’s totally understandable and i said that to him. What i don’t get, is that had i not contacted him, when would he have contacted me?  I gave him the opportunity earlier in the week to be like oh no i don’t want to do anything, before i booked the activity. So i just don’t get why that happened, if i didn’t want to do something or i changed my mind, i would let the person know, when i change my mind.

Edit 2/13/19
Sooo went out last night with the girl. Dinner went great, she had a blast. She left her juul in my car last  night and she wants to hangout today and have me drop it off(hanging out the next day seems like a slippery slope, so I told her I would swing by on my way to work and drop it off).   I also have a hilarious NSFW story about the date but Idk if it would ruin the wholesomeness of the post, so maybe I'll just keep it to myself....anyways dinner went great and she invited me to go see hippie sabotage with her, not sure If I'm gonna take her up on that.

sorry for being totally awful at updating this. Okay so it's basically been around 30 days. I've been super busy with work and applying for grad school. Anyways...um life's been great! Having another doctors appointment the end of the month. The ladies have been great! TBH I started getting really picky with the girls I felt worth asking, only cause I really wanted to be excited about talking to the girl. One big issue I ran into was that the girls seemed to be much more interested than I was. One girl I've been seeing regularly, I go over to her place and she's made me dinner and I've taken her on a few dates, starting to know her sister pretty well also. This is bad cause Idk if I'm looking for a LTR. 
Another girl has been a blast hanging out with, but she seems more invested than I am. We are going camping next weekend so I'm thrilled about that. 
Another girl was really sweet, I started up a convo with her about her shirt and then got her number that way, haven't gone out with her, not all that interested. 
Another girl just wanted to be a booty call but I'm not looking for any hookups so that was short lived. 
I've also been interested in asking out a coworker but I've heard from others she has a bf, however she's never expressed that to me. So not sure what to do.
All in all I'm definitely gonna keep this mentality up, I've learned you got to be selective with who you ask, you can't just ask every girl you find attractive cause you need more than just physical attraction to keep interest.

199,d4r8fi,False,Venting,376,The hardest part about dating as a man is that women are attracted to you for being confident. But your confidence is constantly tested.,dating,"There was an interesting exchange I saw earlier this week on facebook. In a group I am in. One of the leaders. A really confident guy that is always happy go lucky, made a post about how girls always want him as a bf. Someone responded about how hard it is really to achieve that, and everyone piled on and made fun of him, calling him cringy and creepy. this sort of exchange happens in all the circles i am in. It would probably happen to me too if I didn't hide my feelings.

The fact of the matter is that we men can't show our feelings. We can't show weakness. We can't show vulnerability. That is cringy, creepy and draws women away. Everyone piles up and boots us in the face if we do.

I don't know how to explain it. Its like the confident guys get propped up and the unconfident guys get torn down. And that is why so few men get women.

And I think. Thats just how human beings are wired to be. It makes sense. We evolved such that strong men are rewarded. There is no escape from it.

I'm sorry. I'm not angry. I don't hate anyone (except myself really). Its just like. I understand more and more why I don't deserve love and I'm trying to process it a lot better.

OK so everything I have heard hear I actually have heard before. There is a lot of:

\- Just believe in yourself it will happen eventually

\- Don't fall for toxic masculinity. Women love vulnerable men

\- Just take a break.

\- Get therapy

\- Workout

\- Fuck you. Your too negative.

\- You wouldn't want the attention anyway. If you actually try you'll get a quality relationship

\- You are better than you think you are

\- Get hobbies and make friends. It will make you happier

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

That no matter how long they spend on these apps or how many times they tweak their profile or opener that they can't seem to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Here's why.

Online dating (apps, sites) isn't really dating. It's really just a way to set up meetings between people. Your profile, at the end of the day, is more like a marketing brochure than an actual representation of who you are. Without developing the skills needed to be emotionally in tune with others (particularly strangers), you will find yourself consistently struggling to attract people into your life long term. How does one develop those skills?

By engaging in social activities that create regular social circles where there are people who consistently show up and new people constantly rotating in. Learning how to make friends with strangers is the first step, learning how to gauge signs of interest through invitations and physical escalation rounds out the process.

Which happened. We met. 
Guy arrives at my house and we have a nice little chat for about an hour. Honestly I think it was going well. No sloppy subjects, no blanks in the conversation, he looked relaxed and so did I. Then he suddenly hits me with:
« Okay. I don’t want to be here. It pisses me off. I’m leaving. ». I was so, so, so surprised. We were having a chat, and right in the middle of it, he just... said that.

&#x200B;

1. it puts average looking men at a severe disadvantage. I’ve spent so much time and effort into tinder and bumble, getting the perfect pictures, sending a ton of messages, swiping right on everyone, etc. fucking nothing. it’s wrecked my self esteem, and it makes me resent those who effortlessly match with dozens of people
2. if you’re and awkward texter, you’re completely fucked. there’s an immense amount of pressure to be charming, funny, etc etc when you start texting your match, and if you’re not, you’ll never get anywhere.
3. it’s allowed women to not have to even set foot out of their homes to find tons of men to date. that’s taken away the impetus for many women to actually go out and meet men in real life.

&#x200B;

I moved to a new city about 6 months ago. I’ve wanted a relationship desperately since I’ve been here, and I’ve tried it all. I’ve spent months swiping on tinder and bumble. total failure. I’ve tried approaching girls whenever I’m out and about, got lots of numbers, but in the end that was a total failure too.

&#x200B;

I also spend a substantial amount of time going to MeetUp events to meet girls. I try to put myself out there and meet as many people as possible, in the hopes that one day I will come across a nice girl who I can pursue. as it turns out, the gender ratio at the vast majority of these events is about 75 men 25 women, and of those women, maybe half are my age.

&#x200B;

to me, it seems that the age of online dating has made the dating world as a whole more isolating and emotionally crushing for average looking men. I’m so fucking frustrated sexually and emotionally I have a hard time thinking straight sometimes. I don’t have money, so those singles meetups in bars are out of reach for me. anything that costs money is out of the question.

&#x200B;

and yet here I am, back on tinder and bumble. why? because apparently that’s one of the only fucking ways to meet girls. I hate it, but I feel like I don’t have a choice.

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you!

That’s more of a you have it or you don’t kind of thing. And a lot of men don’t have it. Men have much less control over that I think. It’s a roll of the dice and a much more difficult skillset to learn if you don’t already have it. So basically I think it’s frequently easier to be boyfriend material than hookup material.

So a lot of guys are boyfriend material but not hookup material. Which sets things up for a lot of confusion and frustration for these guys over why they are apparently not wanted when all the cool kids are hooking up all the time. Then eventually most of them get settled for. I think a lot of these are the original “nice guys finish last” type of nice guys. But it’s not that they’re nice.

From the moment we sat down, she starts talking politics. Oh no. She tells me she's a major Trumper supporter, which isn't an absolute deal breaker, but when I asked her why she supported him, she said ""I like what he's doing with the minorities."" Now, mind you, I'm ASIAN, so I'm just cringing super hard and chuckling awkwardly to prevent a full on verbal assault. 

Then she starts talking to me about the penises that she's seen. She tells me that Asian guys have pretty small penises and that she hopes my ""pecker"" isn't too small. Now, I don't think I'm a small guy, but it definitely made me feel very insecure and a bit curious as to what the hell is wrong with her. I quickly changed the topic to pets to avoid another awkward conversation. 

Finally, as we're leaving the restaurant, she tells me about how guys who participate in gangbangs/threesomes are all gay because they like the sight of other men's cocks. This was not a topic that I was well versed in, so I made another effort to change the conversation. She then tells me out of nowhere that she doesn't like gay guys, and that's why she'll never participate in a threesome with two guys. At that point, I just wanted to get away from her, so I nodded and smiled at everything she said.

As we're getting in our separate cars to leave, she starts smoking a cigarette and then kisses me on the mouth. It wasn't great.

After a guy rescheduling with me for the second time (see how generous I used to be), it came out that he was otherwise engaged.  so cancellations become red flags to others.

After that, make sure that plans are tight.  Date, time, place, activity are firmly set.  No ""calling to confirm / check in"" even a day before / of the date as that sometimes suggests to others that you are not quite all in.  My response to such a suggestion is ""we have everything we need finalized.  If you think something might come up, then let's dissolve plans now and you can call me later.""  Nor should you accept that kind of behavior from your date.

It's sad that she took the opportunity to stand you up.  although these days, I've had enough of this myself and I view late cancellations (day before / of) as the same as being stood up.  If you can manage your schedule and anticipate when you might be extra busy, then you should. Don't double book and don't overbook.  Know your limits.  I met someone who worked in finance who said she simply did not make social plans during evening hours of Monday to Thursday.

932,aq4ej7,False,,109,My super handsome friend is often rejected because of his origins,dating,"One of my friends is originally from Syria (he was born and grew up there, but he left Syria when he was 15). He then lived in Switzerland and moved to the Uk for University. He left Syria with his family long before the war, and so he has nothing to do with it. I have known him since he moved to the UK. He is very handsome and attractive (he looks exactly like Maluma). He has been facing a lot of problems just because of his origins. Since he is attractive and doesn’t have a typical Middle Eastern appearance, people in general and girls in particular approach him a lot in parties and clubs thinking he is Spanish, Italian, or Brazilian. However as soon as he tells them about his origins, they just leave him and their interest in him fades away. He had a lot of problems with dating. Girls would go out with him once and then when they learn about his origins, they would stop talking to him. Same story happens on Tinder. When we go out and socialise with people, sometimes things get worse. Some people would ask him where is he from and as soon as he mentions Syria, people would start asking him questions about the war, when is he going back, and how did he arrive to the UK. Some people were even rude to him and said things like “are you a refugee”, “did you come here on a boat”, and “why didn’t you stay”. Some people and particularly girls said racists things to him like “I don’t do Arabs”, “you’re too hot to be Arab”, “sorry I thought you were Italian when I gave you my number”, and “oh how come? You don’t look like those poor refugees”. He recently decided to not go out anymore, and he is isolating himself and avoiding all social encounters. Recently, I managed to convince him to go out with us few times but I noticed that he was avoiding to introduce himself to new people. If we meet new people in the bar or the club, he would step back and pretend to be on his phone or go to the bathroom. He doesn’t want to face the question of “where are you from”. He is smart, well-educated, goes to one of the best schools in the UK, and speaks English fluently in addition to three other languages. What do you people think?

644,bumz1j,False,Venting,151,Realizing you're the problem,dating,"Hey r/dating. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this rant.

I haven't had a second date in six months. I'm a somewhat conventionally attractive woman, take care of myself, etc. and on dating apps, I get tons of matches pretty easily, and even sometimes in public or when I'm out with my friends, I'm approached and asked for my number. However, it's after someone meets me in person for a date that things tend to go south and I get politely rejected or ghosted.

The pattern tends to go as follows; I match with someone, they seem super interested, we talk for a couple days on the app or via text, one of us asks to meet up in person (I like to take the initiative sometimes and am fairy confident), the date goes okay/good in my opinion, but then I either never hear from them again, or when I try to reach out, I get a polite message indicating they are not interested in seeing me again.

And if this clarifies, some of them I slept with after, some I didn't. 

So, I've come to the conclusion that while I consider myself attractive and have no issues getting interest/matches from people, I have some seriously blaring personality flaws that are really turning the people I'm going out with off. After the same exact pattern happening so many times, it's pretty clear that I am the problem.

I think for one I talk about myself too much, I know that for sure. And I have a tendency to overshare. And maybe I'm not asking my dates enough questions. Or, maybe I'm drinking too much on the dates bars. Or maybe I look better in my pictures than in real life?  I'm trying to figure it out and work on it so I can be better at dating and finally get past the first date.

Anyway, rant over. I guess I'm glad I'm self aware enough to see the pattern, but it still sucks to be rejected so many times and feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. I have tons of friends I'm close with and I get along with my coworkers, but for whatever reason I guess I'm not bringing the qualities that make me likable in other situations into my dates.

Some days, I’m happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can’t have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I’m just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I’ve been with are. I’m torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I’ll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I’ve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It’s like I’m trying to convince myself that I don’t want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who’s actually good for me.

113,go1i6d,False,Giving Advice,272,My dating journey as an ugly guy: from rough beginnings to decent ends,dating,"As an ugly person, it has been painful but also rewarding to accept my place.

It was challenging to accept the truth and consequences of my appearance.  Society places enormous emphasis on appearances.  People everywhere will judge you and treat you negatively based on appearance, no matter how intelligent/educated/nice they believe themselves to be.  So it can be very depressing to open your eyes and see how many people discriminate against you (usually just in subtle ways, thankfully).

The reality of my ugliness dawned on me very slowly.  I noticed how my attractive friends were treated better than me in public-- random people would commonly make friendly eye contact with them or even smile at them, which has never happened for me.  I would be excluded from certain conversations or events.  I saw myself ageing much more harshly than other guys my age.  I noticed that I was usually the least attractive person in group photos.  Needless to say, I struggled to find girls to date, or even talk to.  Eventually, it was no longer possible to delude myself.

I also really struggled with the idea that, even though I'm ugly, maybe I can still find an attractive mate.  I got over that through numerous painful dating experiences and by observing how couples usually have similar levels of attractiveness.  I have learned that, if you want to ""date up"", there is a very low ceiling on ""up"", and that ceiling can only be broken if you allow yourself to be exploited in some way (e.g. maybe they want your money or status, or maybe they are just a psycho trying to hurt you).

Once I got past these painful truths, a deeper truth also dawned on me: that there are girls who, just like me, are straight and also tired of getting mistreated based on appearances.  Knowing that, I found it much easier to find high-potential mates and treat them kindly.  I knew I could treat them the way I wanted to be treated, and that they would appreciate it.  By focusing on that mantra, I was able to not only avoid painful interactions, but also make new friends, enjoy the company of women on casual dates, and eventually, I found a romantic relationship.

There are so many good possibilities out there, even if your appearance isn't good.

And we both learned a lot. 

He swiped right on a lot of guys that I normally swipe left on...and in the following days I learned that a bunch of them were actually super cool, leading me to resolve to be less picky in the future. Also learned that there were some guys that I should just keep trusting my gut and swipe left on. (after about the third creepy message that I got in a short period, my friend says ""damn why do guys feel like they can talk to you that way? That sucks"") 

I also learned that you can run out of likes, which I didn't know before haha. 

I would judge my friend and I pretty similar in terms of looks and datability. However I found that a LOT more women were ""swipable"" than I have experienced with men. Asking the question ""would this woman be cute and interesting enough to date my best friend?"" meant that a lot of women made the cut, which was interesting to me. 

Last thing I learned was how genuinely shitty it feels to use up all your likes and only get one match. He told me that it was something of a miracle that I even got that single match for him. 

I feel like a lot of guys complain about this (especially on this sub) and girls roll their eyes like ""boo hoo, just have some confidence."" Or the classic, be attractive, don't be unnattractive.

You can literally have everything going for you and get absolutely nowhere these days with dating and I think a lot of it has to do with the apps. They're successful precisely because they don't work most of the time, and are specifically designed to keep you on them so they can monetize off your frustration. They're making everyone flaky, indecisive, and non-committal due to the illusion of choice, but they're not entirely to blame, and thats the remaining piece of the puzzle I'm trying to figure out - do I have a character flaw I'm unaware of? If so, nobody has given me any insight as to what it is..

I have never had a problem with women my entire life before my last LTR ended in the beginning of 2016, and I have WAY more to offer now than I ever did in the past. When I got out of that relationship apps were the go-to and I've only had intermittent success with them since. Here's the typical pattern for me; Match with someone, meetup, things appear to be going well, then we talk for 2-3 weeks, possibly meetup a second time etc and then....crickets, OR they convey that there's no 'spark' or aren't 'feeling it'. I'm sure that may be partially true, but not the entire reason for them losing interest. It's just crazy how everyone is trying to judge or replace you before they even give themselves a chance to get to know you, but I guess these are the rules that are in place in the throw-away society we now live in.

This is going to sound like a humble brag but its just me being objective about my situation - I'm a handsome guy (so I'm told) I workout regularly, have a great career making DAMN good money, good credit, a house, a dog. I've got my life together. I'm respectful, educated, driven, introspective, multifaceted, emotionally relevant, not clingy, and I take care of myself.  I've got a satirical / nihilistic sense of humor and I'm decently witty, but I'm also kind of chill and introverted. I've dated, been in LTRs, and FWB type situations with drop dead gorgeous women so I know what I'm capable of, but man it's just been really confusing lately as to why I'm not having any luck. I recently started dating women with kids which I no longer see an issue with given my age, but no luck with them either....what. is. happening?

I needed a new pillow, so I was looking around and ran into a guy. He asked me questions about memory foam and air mattresses. He was going on a trip with some friends. 

I made conversation and kind of threw out a vague “Oh are you going with your wife/gf?” Since he was older he caught on to what I was doing. He asked me why I asked. I told him he was attractive. I didn’t expect him to ask for my number immediately after. Never in my life has this ever happened. I feel very proud of myself. 

Not going to lie I was a bit nervous as I just met him and didn’t know much. We ended up going on a nice date to get some food and go see a movie. He touched me the majority of the movie. It felt so nice to actually have affection. (My last relationship had no affection and was very verbally abusive) 

We ended up kissing at the end of the night. I text him as a courtesy to let him know I had a good time and to give him a compliment. He did text back. I’m not going to read to much into this as I know how dating is now. 

We both aren’t seeking a relationship, but I do eventually want one just not anytime soon. 

Regardless of the outcome I’m very happy it happened. (I’m a pretty positive person, but my assumptions will always go to “Yeah that’s gonna be it.”) 

I’m trying my best to play it kool and not stress if I don’t hear from him at all, but I don’t want to come off as uninterested. Should I just lay low and not text anymore until I hear something? 

Another thing ladies. Just go for it. If you get rejected oh well. Or you might be surprised. After years of off and on OLD I told myself I would never do it again. I’m glad I stuck to it.

When I finally made it on my own in the world and moved away from home, I realized that many factors in my life, including abuse from my mother when I was a child (she is NPD and BPD), have caused me to develop an anxious attachment style — in every type of relationship in my life, including friendships, family and casual things. 

When I first meet someone, I’m chill. They tell me how respectful, genuine and relaxed I am, and they like me because I respect their boundaries... until I don’t and sabotage. 

Most of the time, I push away and ghost, but other times, I become this ridiculous person, insecure and emotional, over the tiniest emotional spark. If I have a NSA hook up with someone, I’m someone else, this calm, collected, cool, mysterious, fascinating person. But then the moment we find we have a lot in common or we vibe well, I start to feel vulnerable and it makes me act like a lunatic. 

It’s really embarrassing and it’s not me. Over years of therapy and medication, thankfully I’ve overcome a lot of self esteem issues, depression and PTSD, but I’ve noticed there are some remnants of anxiety and insecurities I am having trouble overcoming. 

All of my past boyfriends have cheated on me or abused me, and I feel this has torn me apart emotionally. I don’t want to be insecure. 

I mean, my life is insane. I work, I have several hobbies, I have things keeping me busy, and yet I fall into this awful behavior that makes me look bored, desperate and needy. 

I need to kick this crap to the curb, because I’ve met some really awesome people lately, but I can’t seem to “go with the flow” or “take it slow,” and I give off this vibe in the beginning that I’m pretty cool with all of that, and then turn into this over dramatic person. Texting too much, calling too much, overthinking every interaction. Wondering if they even like me. 

It’s so unattractive and embarrassing. 

I have to talk myself through everything, telling myself to chill, that they’re human and this isn’t even a thing yet, and I’m going to ruin it if I don’t shut up and go with the flow like I should. 

I hate to be a walking red flag. I hate knowing at any moment I’ll sabotage something good (before it even begins at times) because of this. 

Can someone help me understand this? I have been in therapy for four years and on medication for two. I guess I just have to keep working at it....",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/emd6qc/i_am_realizing_i_have_an_anxious_attachment_style/,213,You sound like the normal american girl nowadays.

609,cbj48v,False,Giving Advice,122,Online Matches,dating,"I (F24) see lots of guys on reddit and IRL complain about the lack of matches they get, and how many matches women get. The guys i know, plus the guys on reddit also swipe right on every single girl they see to make their chances better. Understandably so, cast the net wide, you'll be bound to catch something. I cant speak for every girl, the the girls i know dont swipe on every guy, they are a bit choosy, hell, my BFF will send me screenshots of guys profiles and ask me what i think, and we'll talk about it before she makes her decision, thats just before she even swipes right, for all she knows, he might not like how she looks. it got me thinking about how women and men play the online dating game very differently.

&#x200B;

If every guy swipes right on EVERY girl, and every girl swipes right on SOME guys, of course women are going to have more matches. It's over-saturated at this point. Also, just because a girl may have 100+ matches, it doesn't meant that shes talking to 100+ guys. 1/2 of them are bots or catfishes, i guarantee it, many dont answer, LOTS are looking for one night stands and hookups, and then there are maybe a handful out of that group of men are are actually compatible with the woman they matched with. i admit, i get lots of matches, and i message them, but not everyone talks to me, because even though they swiped right on me, i'm not their preference. Ive had guys swipe right on me, i say hello, and then immediately unmatch me lol. It happens to us all!

&#x200B;

Not to mention, people have different tastes, i know its hard to not compare yourself to some Calvin Klein model looking dude and think, ""if he isnt matching with every woman, what chance do i have"". But you have to remember, not everyone likes that, people have different tastes and preferences. I'm short, and i am VERY hesitant on going out with guys over 6 feet, because it feels weird to me, i know that guys who are over 6 feet tall are popular online for some reason, but know that not every girl likes it. Yes, online dating is extremely shallow, and i get my ass kicked on it too, i'll be the first to admit it, but it is a good way to meet people, and not every meetup needs to end in a relationship, maybe a friendship can come out of it. If you find yourself getting in a dark place mentally from these apps, take a break from them, its ok, i do it, my friends do it, your peace is the most important part of this

852,8nko61,False,Other,73,Dating in your 30s is weird...,dating,"It's also tough. It's also confusing. You can have a career, financial stability, be subjectively attractive, fit, have enough hobbies to make you a well\-rounded person, be social, put yourself in environments where you'd think you'd meet someone, join all the dating sites and use all the apps... and still, nothing. I'm halfway through my 30s now, and the spot I'm in is where it's like of course I want to meet someone, but at this age, I get easily  exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life. It's almost as if there's more unnecessary stress and less courtesy when all you're trying to be is a human trying to genuinely connect with another human.

This is not being pessimistic either, but just a fact of how eventually dating wears me out easily at this stage. I have friends where the process has been pretty easy, so seeing that doesn't light a fire in me either. One friend of mine who is a girl who never dated in her entire life until two years ago signed up for Match and met a guy within two months. They're living together now and very happy. Another friend of mine married a girl who accidentally messaged him on facebook because he had the same name as a former college friend of hers, and one thing led to another. That sort of easy, effortless strike of luck *never* happens to me haha

I still put myself on dating sites every now and then without expecting much, and always look for opportunities out there in the real world to potentially be introduced to someone new, yet I would be lying if I didn't say there's also those nights where I see that things aren't changing, I get tired by that thought, and really don't care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8nko61/dating_in_your_30s_is_weird/,147,"Part of the problem is that society convinces everyone that they need to be in a relationship.

I’m a 29F who got into this last lease with my ex fiancé (broke off last June) after trading my fully paid car off for it. The lease fell on me as it was in my name and I have barely been able to afford it on my own. Fast forward back to tonight, she asks me if my new boyfriend will be paying for my new car.

I've been going to the gym for 3 years, and today after a long time, my past kicked me in the balls all over again. I left the gym wanting to cry.

Growing up, I was the shortest dude in my class, and I'm still short compared to people around me. I was one of the few Indian kids. I also wasn't very strong. I used to get singled out by the gym teachers in high school to compete with girls, was never allowed to compete with guys on sports events (btw, I don't think women are weaker than men, or that there is anything wrong with having to compete with women, because hey, I'd love to be as badass as so many women I know). I used to get bullied in so many ways.

""Your mother must be scared to look at you"" ""Why are you so pidgeon chested"" ""Don't worry man, you'll find someone""

I used to get valentine's day cards saying ""I like the smell of your armpits"". I didn't have any BO, but people wanted to see me excited, and then watch my face drop.

The girls who asked me to dance at school parties did it because of a dare, and only wanted to make fun of me.

Guys used to push me into girls, and then everyone would call me a creep. As an Indian guy, I'm already very sensitive to girls not feeling safe around me (yes, we have a terrible reputation, and we collectively need to get better). I hated it. I hated being the reason for other people not feeling comfortable.

So I made myself really smart. I got really creative and artistic. I became a student leader. I made myself weirdly popular, respectable, and untouchable just so all of the bullshit would stop. I never got strong, not for lack of trying. I never attracted or genuinely excited anyone.

At the end of college, I experienced heartbreak because the girl I fell in love with after 3 years of knowing her didn't feel the same way about me, and fell for my best friend. So I graduated, and let myself go completely. The only thing I held on to for dear life was my career.

3 years ago, after a medical emergency, I started getting my act back together again. I started from the bottom of the bottom. I started keeping up with my creative pursuits again. I started doing everything I could to be the best man I can. After 3 years, I've only now managed to achieve where most people start.

110,f21nud,False,Giving Advice,310,10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective),dating,"Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a ""cool guy"".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

&#x200B;

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

It’s hard to believe half the year has gone by with lockdowns and pandemics and what not. I had really hoped to make this year a good one, after recognizing what some of my challenges were and having a plan to overcome them. 

I had realized some time ago that a lot of this year may well go by before any sense of normalcy or safety returned. More than that, I’m sort of accepting that this whole year may well be written off. I have tried Skyping and video calls with potential dates, but it just isn’t that easy to really progress anything until you meet in person. 

I say to other singles on this sub, it’s probably best to just accept that this year won’t likely bring substantial positive change to our dating lives. And honestly, that’s ok. It’s a difficult situation that most of us can’t do much about. I’m not saying I’m happy about it in the slightest, but I am saying that accepting it means that we can at least focus on other things.

281,g971es,False,I Need Advice,258,How to stop feeling like/being used as everyone's trophy girl?,dating,"Everyone I’ve ever “dated” (never turned into serious relationships) has only wanted me because they consider me to be attractive, and I guess I’m what’s called conventionally pretty (not trying to sound snobby, it's just what people tell me). Before you say it, I dress conservatively and I honestly don’t sleep around. I don’t throw my self at guys, and I’m not even on dating apps. I’ve only ever “dated” three guys in my life. With that being said, I’ve still had the bad luck of only meeting people who only like me for my looks. They’re not even your typical player types - they start out really nice. But eventually they stop even trying to get to know me or my personality. It’s not like I’m dumb or boring - I have a master’s in Economics and have hobbies outside of that. But no matter how educated/interesting I could be, nobody wants to get to know me for who I am. Interestingly enough, even though I’ve made it clear that I won’t sleep with someone unless I’m in a relationship, these guys still keep inviting me over to only makeout with them, and then they brag about it to their friends.

To me this is weird because if sex isn’t on the table and they don’t want to be involved with me on a personal/emotional/serious level, then why stick around for just making out (its not like we’re high schoolers)? I’m 27, and these guys have all been either my age or older. They could easily not get involved with me and go sleep around with everyone else, so why bother? But I digress. Long story short, nobody cares about me as a person - they only care about my looks. I feel like I’m in a limbo; people want to ""date"" me and I have tons of options, but eventually all anyone cares about is how I look and how I make them look to their friends. I don't even feel like dating anymore, because I feel like its just going to be the same thing over and over again - guys only want to keep seeing me because I'm they find me attractive. 

It all feels so fake, and I feel completely disillusioned. Honestly, sometimes I think it would be better to be average looking/not attractive, because at least then you'd know from the get-go that the person you're dating is interested in your personality (I don't mean that hurtfully). I don’t think most people understand how bad it hurts to only be desired for your looks. I feel like nobody will ever want to be a companion to me. I’m happy and secure in myself and being single, but I’m still very lonely and want a boyfriend who sees past my looks. (Also, when I was in grad school, there were a few girls in my cohort who were like gorgeous. They were in serious relationships with guys who loved them and wanted them, so I know its possible. I just don't understand why it hasn't happened for me yet, especially since I really liked all three of those guys I dated).

I do believe some people probably have healthy, functional, non-committed relationships. But, I also believe a lot of people (In my case, guys), who are looking for a non-committed relationship online are full of shit. 

Yesterday, I asked a guy what was he looking for after having talked for a bit, and he basically said that he wanted someone he could go to the movies with, eat out, go on dates and have sex,  but not dating seriously.

To me, this just strikes me as ""I want someone who will be in a pseudo relationship with me, but without any sort of emotional responsibility and commitment from my part"". 

&#x200B;

Obviously, after I discussed things with him, he threw in the ""I'm open to a serious relationship with the right person and if things go well between us"", which in my experience, is a complete lie. 

There's a huge difference for me between getting to know someone slowly and see where it goes vs. the pseudo relationship with no commitment these men want. 

I think this sentence is thrown out to reel you in, and make you think there's hope it will develop into something later, but it most likely never will.

If you are looking for a serious relationship, or actually getting to know people, don't fall for this bullshit. It leads nowhere. If a guy says he wants nothing serious, believe him.

When you ask him where this is going, or if he wants something more, he will deny everything and act like you are crazy, but will try to convince you to stay.

It’s a Hallmark holiday. Not significant. Just another day.

I don’t think I’ll find anyone significant in this country. It’s all games and lack of commitment. Romantic love is like a unicorn and usually fades after seven years. Even between friends. I’ve found that European girls are fast to commit and have a better idea of what kind of guy they like. If after a decade has anyone considered that their SO may exist in another continent. I think it’s funny how contained men are in the states yet you go to places around the world men are free to love and express. Girls in the states preach for more sensitivity and expression yet we find ourselves constantly undermined and understood and largely under appreciated. I’m talking to all the blue collar guys who can’t get a girl to commit due to pop culture and the popularization of man hopping. I refuse to be a serial dater I don’t think it’s becoming. I also don’t find high count in girls progressive. It’s a bit a red flag for most guys since most guys count are naturally low.  I think dating apps bring the wrong people together.

353,c7j60k,False,Giving Advice,31,I think it's important to figure out why you want to date before you start dating,dating,"For the last couple months, I've made a half-assed attempt at dating. I think deep in my heart, I didn't actually want to date and knew that now is not a good time to date. I am already spending 80+ hrs working and studying a week, and there's just no way I can squeeze out time for dating. Recently in a moment of introspection, I realized that all the working plus studying in the last couple years have put me in a pretty bad place, mentally. I'm not depressed or anything, but I am absolutely burnt out. If I were a steak, I'd be well-done with a black crust. I realized that I wanted someone to date because I wanted someone for me to complain to and comfort me, but I also realized that I didn't have the time or the energy to reciprocate if my partner wanted the same from me. Also, since a lot of my friends are in a relationship, I felt pressured to do the same, but then I realized that while they work to live, I live to work. They're all pretty complacent with their careers (which is totally fine) while I'm more interested in gaining as much experience and making as much money as I can. Trying to date with my schedule would have been a disaster, and dating for the sole reason of not being left behind is pretty dumb. Thus, from the very beginning, my motivations to date were tainted.

What I really needed all this time was to find a way to relieve all the stress and do things that I enjoy. Thus, I started practicing yoga recently, and it's been rather incredible. It helped me with my hip pain that's been bothering me for the last year, and I felt very at peace at the end of each class. I'm also planning a trip to the UK, and my plan is to travel to two new countries per year. I've always wanted to travel the world, but I've been so busy in the last couple years that I haven't even left my home state (well except one trip to NYC for work). Essentially, I want to get to a place in life where I can get up every morning well-rested and content rather than scrambled and irritated. Only then do I think I'll be ready to date.

I think a lot of people view dating as a panacea to their problems in life, but this is almost certainly the wrong approach. Until you're in a good place in your own life, you're not really in a good place to date. Dating is give and take, and you cannot expect someone to care for your physical/emotional needs while you're in no place to provide either. If you're feeling stressed, lonely, angry, or anything negative, then that needs to be fixed first. Otherwise, people will see right through you and your problems, and most people don't want to handle that kind of baggage from the get-go. For example, in the past year, whenever I met someone new, I always found myself talking too much about my job to them because I was stressed and kinda turned a conversation into a personal therapy session. I was shocked when I realized that, and if I could see that, then others must have seen right through me. It's no wonder that I didn't make many lasting relationships in the last couple years. A lot of our misery comes from not being able to pinpoint our problems, and life isn't a romantic novel where a mysterious stranger transforms our lives from a shithole to Eden. If you are in a shithole right now, you have to figure out why you're there in the first place and then climb out on your own.

It's as if lately we encourage highly emotional decision-making in dating and rationality is getting lost. When did it become not OK to have some doubts when first getting to know a new person? Why isn't it OK to question or challenge your feelings about a new person? Serious relationships can develop slowly. Can't it be argued that a slow steady relationship build is preferable to quick and careless, so to speak? Using critical thinking in new relationships sounds good to me, rather than going with highly charged instincts.

As Dan Savage is fond of saying, you won't find the ""one."" You should look for someone who is close to the one and round up.

A lot of this comes from the ""paradox of choice"" that is a hallmark of dating today. So many people here seem to throw in the towel at the slightest sign that a potential partner doesn't meet all of their requirements, because there are so many other people to ""try."" But ask any person in a happy, long term relationship, and they'll tell you there are things about their partner that irritate them. That's just how human relationships work.

My advice: figure out what actually matters to you. What are those things that are legitimate deal breakers?

She seemed really interested and was setting times and just seemed keen on meeting up with me.

When the day we would meet up arrived, she told me just a couple of minutes before that she would be bringing her friends (she said 5)*. At first, I said ""ok sure"" but deep down I was pretty nervous because the whole thing was unexpected.

When the time came, she brought like a whole crowd (and I mean like 15 or so [in total]*) of friends and I have never felt this uncomfortable in my life. I knew that all of them knew that I was trying to date their friend, and I just wasn't mentally prepared to handle that [the girls were giggling when I tried to talk to the girl I was originally interested in].

Just when I thought I'd handled them well, she brought in another group... and another group... [4 groups of 5, 3, 4 and 3 in them, and yes, SHE BROUGHT 3 DUDES too]* it was like they took turns and waited outside so that they could specifically come in to talk to me [whenever a group would leave, the next group would come in like the wave system you'd see in a video game lmao]*. I ended up being thrust into conversations with new people that I just didn't want anything to do with for the night, life's been busy enough with all the work I have and I just didn't feel like having small talk with loads of strangers who I knew nothing about. 

[While I was trying not to seem too disinterested while talking to one of them about the stuff they did, out of the corner of my eye I noticed that girl just... observing me and smiling in a funny sort of may the whole time and actively tried not to get into the conversation even when I tried to pull her into it]*.

[Sooner or later]*, they all just ended up just hanging out with each other [outside, leaving me alone in the place]*, so I just left when I realized that I'd rather be spending my time finishing my work than entertaining this sh\*t.

[I was told later that was the place they hung out alot after work and the time I met her was exactly when they left it]*.

I felt like I was humiliated by her and the whole group who's probably laughing at me for not being chatty or charismatic or wimping out.

I know that some girls like to test how well their next potential partner will integrate with their friend groups, but I just felt like she forced me into a social situation that I didn't want to be in, and I now fear ever approaching any other girl ever in my life. They will ruin your day.

So I asked her ""How do you meet people nowadays?"" she chuckled a bit and said ""I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life).""

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said ""Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult."" then I said ""Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person.""

This is the part that hit me. She responded ""That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them.""

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about ""the one"" or ""the one I'll be compatible with"" she was kinda shaking her head and she said ""We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc...""

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

I hear so many comments about not having a girlfriend from my family and coworkers. Either they’ll ask why I’m not getting dates despite explaining myself so many times, or they find ways to make comments about it in conversation. They act like it’s the easiest thing in the world, they’ll say “just go on tinder” even though I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable with the idea of hookups, not that I would even be able to get them. 

The worst part is that everyone is absolutely enthralled by my younger brother, he’s the little darling of our family even though all he does is constantly pump and dump chicks like some kind of pickup artist. He’s a beefy jock type so it makes sense that he’d have more success. But I just feel like they’re always trying to compare me to him because the rest of the family (especially the men) are a lot more like him than me. It’s always been that way. I’m usually the lightning rod everyone gangs up on. 

Here’s the thing. I’m smaller, I’m nerdy, I’m less outgoing. I like to stay inside and read books or discuss various topics. I like myself though. I don’t want to change. I’m sick of feeling like everyone wants me to though and that to be a valid man I have to attract women and to attract women I have to be a certain way. 

You know, I’ve tried. I’ve approached so many women. I believe I have a lot to offer and that I’m not a loser, so I don’t have confidence problem. Whats bothering me is the endless rejections I have come to expect. I’ve kind of given up at this point because I always just know I’ll get rejected. It really hurts constantly feeling worthless and lonely, after a while you begin to think there must be something mentally wrong with you. But you can’t find the reason and that drives you crazy so you try on all these different philosophies about dating but none of them really ever fit.

Now I just want to be left alone to not date and tell people I’m just not really interested. But maybe I’m the biggest hypocrite of all because that’s a greasy lie. The truth is, late at night all I can think about is how nice it would be just to know that somebody I like actually likes me back.

If you can’t afford it, there’s plenty of free online resources to help maybe evaluate your behavior and reflect if you might be doing something wrong. 

Example: (This one guy I was friends with for more than 5 years...great friend initially but I pity the fool who ends up with him. ) This guy comes from a divorced family where mom left. Christian and very dismissive about women. (I’m guessing his mother got tired of the abuse and just got up and decided to leave all her 8 children. Idk) 

One day said he would just buy a wife. He would take all of these girls on dates to see if they would like them and then when they would start to, he’d drop them. 

One day I helped him move and it was raining outside so he offered to drop me off closer to where there was cover from the rain. He then said, “oh you just wanna use me” and then made me walk in the rain with him. He would brag about trying to use his ex-girlfriend because her family was loaded. He talks about getting a girlfriend like it’s buying a toy. 
Things just got worse with him and he became a worse friend so I just stopped seeing him altogether. 

My evaluation of him is that this guy doesn’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like considering all the abuse he’s faced at home and NOW he’s tired of being alone and looking for someone to project all of those insecurities and trauma onto...when in reality he really has a lot of bad behaviors he needs to clean up.

There are so many friends of mine who many would not consider to be attractive at all. However there demeanor and attitude and manners is what has everyone falling for them. Human behavior never changes. We’re just becoming more lazy and want instant gratification for our approaches.

Leave everything you see. Do the 24 month no contact period.

As long as you have no migraines nor other sensitivity to the burnt steak smell that's everywhere in space, even being Space Ex is better than being reminded of her during the 24 months.

Stop judging a book by its cover. Just cus a girl has her shit together and is presentable and attractive doesn't mean you're not worthy or she'll break your heart. Stop being afraid to go for it and give it a chance. Stop being so scared to open your heart.

People think being attractive makes it easier to date and they are wrong. I'm nothing special but sure you can classify me as ""attractive"" and smart and somehow this intimidates some men. Great.

All I want is to find love. Real love with someone  that means something. Why is that so hard?? Sigh. :(

Whenever we will get into a disagreement or an argument (or even if I am being quiet because I’m tired or grumpy) they will get very upset and get very stressed. This usually leads to them banging their head off doors or cutting their wrists or hands until they bleed. 

I have no idea how to help them and I am feeling very alone in this. I don’t want to tell my friends or family incase they worry for me. I have discussed this with my partner and they have downloaded some mental health apps on their phone but I know that they won’t stop.

I have a high sex drive, and while I haven't been in a proper relationship for 5 years I somehow managed to have longer dating phases or FWBs, so at least I got some quite regularly. Now my last 9 months thing fizzled out in December, and since then it's been dry. I hardly get to know new interesting people where I am, and I suck at OLD. So I had ONE date this year, resulting in nothing as the guy started seeing someone else (no hard feelings).
A few weeks ago I adopted a cat. I got one from a family who couldn't afford keeping her, she hasn't been chipped or fixed. And now that poor thing went into heat and is crying for sex. She is crawling through the flat holding her butt up hoping some male cat comes along and notices her. She's longing for affection and making such desperate noises. This is exactly how I feel inside. 
Lucky her, she's getting spayed next week and won't care anymore. I will have to continue this lonely life.

143,fbq03l,False,Giving Advice,48,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,dating,"... it shouldn’t leave you guessing and worried.

What I’m saying is that I see so many posts from people who are so damn unsure and worried about the person they’re dating. They make themselves crazy because they’re trying to decipher what the other person is thinking or feeling and worried whether or not they’re into them.

But dating shouldn’t be like that. You should be sure about what you and the other person want.

And to be honest I used to think that being unsure and self conscious was just part of the game and I’d be so self conscious about every text I’d send, every word I’d say, every action I’d take.

But the truth is that if you find someone who gets you and wants to be with you, you won’t have to bend and break to know where you stand with them. I know this isn’t some sort of groundbreaking epiphany I’m sharing but I want to share it nonetheless.

Dating should be fun. You shouldn’t have to overthink every step you take. And simply put you should be able to be yourself and not question every little thing you do or say.

Because in the end... if the person you’re dating leaves you guessing and worrying when you’re not actively with them... you should move on from them. 

A person who wants to be with and cares about you will let you know and let you feel it. They’ll build you up and give you the attention you deserve. They’ll answer your texts in a timely manner, they’ll take you out to dates, they’ll make time for you even when they’re busy, they’ll build you up when you’re down...

They won’t leave you on read for hours, they won’t flake on you, they won’t be unsure about you, they won’t make you question their intentions. 

Basically I feel as if we should all listen to ourselves and our own feelings more. How that person makes you feel when you’re not around them will tell you so much more about how good they are for you than when you’re with them. 

It’s not even what *they’re are doing but so much more what you yourself are feeling*. 

If a person manages to put a smile on your face even though you haven’t seen them for a few days... that’s where it’s at. If they manage to make you feel down and question your own self worth in that time... do yourself a favor and move on.

103,g2jlv5,False,Venting,119,I miss innocence/youthfulness in dating/romance,dating,"I don’t know if this is even the right place for this post, but I felt the need to get this off my chest. Im a 27 year old male, have only been in about 1.5 real relationships and a couple of young heartbreaks/unrequited love situations.

I found myself reading the initial messages between myself and the first girl i “loved” when i was 18 years old. Classic case of became best friends, had way too many feelings, we couldn’t date for a variety of reasons (religions, family, etc). Eventually I couldn’t handle being just friends and it blew up.

But reading the messages just left me with a huge void for a couple of reasons. 1. The idealistic view I had of love and relationships at that age that has seemingly been destroyed by breakups and failures and heartbreak and aging. I understand that’s a part of growing up and it is normal to view romance and relationships different at 27 versus 18, but it leaves me with a bad feeling nonetheless. 2. I miss how innocent it was. How pure it was. There was no pretense or alternative interpreted meaning behind our conversations. There was no pressure.

Since that time, among other things, I have app dated a lot. Like >60 first dates a lot. And this has seemingly beaten down the aspects that made me so hopeful and joyful about love and relationships to begin with. It has become so formulaic, even when it is moderately successful. The dates are grossly similar, the conversations blur together. Always preparing to be ghosted at any given moment. Always prepared to throw copious amounts of money on a date with someone I may very well never see at again. And at its best, it just becomes this pattern of going on a few dates, before feeling pressured that its time for intimacy/physical intimacy or to decide if this relationship is going anywhere. 

I guess this is more of a way to write my feelings out then seeking any specific advice or guidance. I do wonder if any of you out there feel the same way and if so how you deal with it.

I’m definitely not a master chef, but women I have over seem to like it when I cook for them! It’s also loads of fun to have them involved in making the dish. I make sure to ask for feedback when I’m adding spices or ingredients, and I like to have them help out with chopping things up or other such things — that way the dish isn’t just mine, but theirs too. 


**Wine.** 

A nice wine selection never hurts. It’s a good way to take the edge off of any initial awkwardness if you’re just meeting them, y’know?


**Scents.**

If you’re bringing someone to your place for the first time, it’s good to have a pleasant smell to greet them when they walk in. I like to have little jars of spices and potpourri, as well as scented candles.


**Having a space of conversation starters.**

I like to make my room easy to comment on. This can range from having books on the nightstand, instruments laying out in conspicuous places, posters, that sort of thing. (Of course, I keep it clean and smelling nice too, but that’s a given.)


**A weighted blanket.**

This might sound corny, but it’s frighteningly effective — I have a weighted blanket, and I like to offer people a chance to try it out, usually after a glass of wine or two. I don’t think I need to explain this one.

Back story: My ex and I dated on and off for 5 years. We had a cute start-up story. We both worked in a King Soopers. I was his barista and he was my banker. I asked HIM out on a date. (Trophy points for me). I loved him with everything I had and he was my world. He was my first real love and I cared for him deeper than I ever cared for anyone. Throughout our relationship, I chose not to see how he was mentally and emotionally abusive to me so much so that I completely lost my confidence and who I was as a person. Manipulation really puts a toll on the soul. He officially left me 2 months ago leaving me feeling like everything was my fault while I was already going through a very dark time in my life. 

Present tense: I have been seeing a therapist to try to understand who I am without him. My therapist and I have been very proud of my progress and I found my fire again! Yay me! 
Today I walked up to someone that I've been flirting with and found extremely attractive. We seem to click well and I needed to see where this would lead. I was terrified. Rejection is one of my biggest fears. Despite this, I walked right up to him and asked him out (shaking but tried to portray confidence)... verdict is, he said, ""of course"". 

People of Reddit: Ask him/her out! Take the leap. Find that courage. Remember you are worth alot, and if the other person cant see that, it's alright! As long as you see it and the good ones will see it too. Good luck in the dating world!

Not that this is some new advice that’s never been dispensed before, or even something clever. As a matter of fact, I’ve seen many people suggest this before. I just want to reiterate how important and effective this is: Go out by yourself!

Go to the bars by yourself. Go to shows by yourself. Go to coffee shops and read by yourself. Go for walks, do this, do that, and do it by yourself.

First of all, it will help you get comfortable in your own skin. The first few times might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’ll pass the more you do it. You’ll notice over time that you’re more approachable, and you will find that you’ll be more confident in approaching others. It all comes down to enjoying your own company out in the open. 

For me, it was going to the bars by myself when I realized how easy it really was to meet people. And also, don’t be afraid of getting friend zoned. Actually, it’s a good thing to think friends first. Value your new friend as a person and not as a potential companion. If you value them and their time, it may turn into something more, or they may be able to recommend you to one of their friends. 

Go out by yourself with the intention of just being social and increasing your social network. This will build confidence and attraction, and before you know it, you may have someone pining over you.

Dating is hard. Not talking about FWB or casual hookups but dating. Finding someone compatible and interesting enough to spend an evening with. Finding someone willing to fight at least as hard as you do when things get tough. Our time is valuable. Or it should be. 

So we try to get out there. Maybe bars. Maybe the deep dark abyss of the online marketplace. Maybe we join clubs or volunteer. And we don’t meet anyone that we connect with. Or we do, but it’s not reciprocated and in an era of instant gratification we find ourselves competing with greener grass that may not even exist. 

But here’s what I’ve noticed lately. 

As a 43 year old female, I’m noticing so many of the relationships around me. 

A same age friend just recently started a relationship with the man she has fallen in love with.  They originally met in high school but timing wasn’t right. 

Another friend found her forever partner eight years ago at age 35. 

Another friend ended a 12 year relationship where she hasn’t been happy for 11 years. 

Another just celebrated her 12th anniversary with the love of her life. She’s 42. He’s 44. 

Myself? I’ve been in a relationship for just over a year with a man who has shown me in so many ways why past relationships never worked. He’s everything I never thought possible. He is my anything but not my everything. We met online a week after I proclaimed to someone that my life is pretty amazing and someone’s going to have to be spectacular to be a part of it. He is. 

So I’m not saying you have to be mid 40’s to find the relationship you crave.... not at all. I’m saying that it took an awful lot of us 40+ years to truly figure out what we wanted and to find the courage to say no when our relationships fell short. In that time, we learned a lot about what we didn’t want. We learned a lot about ourselves. We built careers. We raised kids (some of us) and in the end, we allowed our journey to shape us without giving up hope for what we desired in life. A partner. In every sense of the word. 

Kudos to those who already have it all figured out. For everyone else, enjoy the journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/d59fzp/dating_isnt_for_the_weak/,649,"I don't want to meet someone at 40. 

If I'm actually alone at that point, which is actually a possibility, I'd rather just fuck around for the rest of my life and when I'm like 60+ pay to bang super hot prostitutes. Nobody to drag me down with their regrets for having to 'settle' now that they're old and probably going to die of a heart attack within 10-20 years. ",2019-09-17 00:40:31

Like everyone progresses at their own pace, I don't care that you've never touched a girls tits, but the amount which you've talked about it is really concerning. I don't care that you live with your parents, I do too, but I don't want to hear about how they cock block you, read the fucking tone of the convo.

I don't think the penny drops until the get to 36. Up to 24 they're just dumb and think they can have anything their own way, late 20s nicer but still dumb, early thirties expect you to be drunk down the pub and ready to go and they are snivelling about how their lives haven't worked out the way they wanted to and theyre the victims. Mid thirties something clicks. They realise they need to take you out be normal but they often still want to play the field, and in their forties theyre complicated dragging around baggage , just looking for sex if they've been married for years. Oh and the ones that move back home after relationship break downs. Don't bag out the millennials for that. Tail end of Generation X did that first..staying home into their thirties, got married moved out, divorced back home repeat. You realise it as you get older. It wasn't you, it's just how they develop or don't.  Oh and don't forget the dick pics and wanking videos. Mostly guys under thirty do that. ",2019-05-06 04:24:33
653,9s8wee,False,Venting,184,"Online dating sucks for everyone, not just guys",dating,"I see a lot of posts on here about how online dating is not for guys and only girls have any luck finding a lot of dates. 

I (24F) go through weeks where I might get one match, maybe two if it's close to a holiday.  An issue I have with matches is guys not messaging for days at a time, then saying sorry, I was busy for ""x"" reason. Also, most of the messages I receive are guys ""complimenting"" my body and messaging inappropriate or unwanted sexual advances without any provocation. 

For every good date I actually have, there are 5 that are horrible... I'm not talking about no chemistry or had a difficult time conversing, I'm talking about comments that make me cringe and shutter or inappropriate touching. 

So, next time you're frustrated about not getting matches, please remember, this sucks for everyone. 

EDIT: I am not saying that it sucks the same way for everyone. Men and woman may or may not have different challenges with online dating. This was a vent directed towards people who think if you are even a remotely attractive woman, online dating is an all you can eat buffet. Online dating sucks for everyone in one way or another.

She immediately got up and left. We were 2 blocks from her house and there was clearly no smoke from a house fire at all. I texted her and called her out on it and she said it was the best way she could think of to get away from me. We had been laughing and having what I thought was an enjoyable 10 minutes prior to this. 

Apparently honesty is a foreign concept for people and they feel easily provable lies are the best option. Definitely the worst and weirdest rejection I’ve ever had. Before this I never thought the whole friend faking an emergency was something people actually did.

798,a0wygv,False,Giving Advice,38,How long before you are truly invested?,dating,"There is no textbook answer for this, but one thing I have noticed a trend in this sub is people who are still just starting out in a relationship (6 months in or under) and questioning red flags from their BF/GF. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, and this comes only from my personal experience and observations of others is that if you are still within a year of getting together, you are still learning about who the other person is. Even if you feel that beautiful deep connection in your soul (Which I truly believe in), this other person is still a stranger to you. You are learning who they are, which is part of the beautiful game of dating and of life. 

&#x200B;

You don't owe a stranger your mental and emotional health. If you see a red flag, feel the strength to take a step back and say to yourself, ""I have only been with this person a few months and this is what they are showing me as who they are. Is this who I want to be with?""
