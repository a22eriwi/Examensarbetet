902,2jjcmy,False,,5,"My crush is seeing someone else. It's not bad, but it still hurts.",whatsbotheringyou,"Background: I'm a 19 year old male, studying at college.

I've met this awesome girl, let's call her Julie. Julie was good looking, fun, a nice person overall. I'd give her a 7/10. We started talking after she asked for my help during Programming class. It seemed like she was interested in me. We texted a lot, talked a lot, all that stuff.

Then she became colder and colder. She didn't talk to me with the same interest as before. Then Julie started talking to this other guy. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""she's just talking."" Then they started dating. 

The worst part about liking someone is when they don't like you back. Maybe I bored her, or maybe I was just misinterpreting her. But even worse than that is when they begin dating another person. EVEN worse is when both are in the same classes as you. You're forced to watch them kiss, hold hands, hug, be happy, while you're lonely and bitter because you don't have a girlfriend and never had one. It's like a psychological torture...

You know that one moment, where you walk out of the classroom, and see your crush and her bf kissing? It got me by surprise. It was a Monday, they started dating on Saturday. I walked outta the classroom, and saw they kissing. It's that moment when your heart stops for a second or two. A friend of mine described this feeling: ""It's like a guitar string snapping"".

And the same thing happened last year. First year of college, met another awesome gal, I'm gonna call her Mary . She was interested (I'm 100% sure of that), but due to my stupidness (and a small misunderstanding), Mary started hating me, and then began dating someone else. Of course, as time passed, she forgave me, and now we're good friends, though she is still dating the same dude.

I know that being bitter because of a girl sounds stupid. I'm not angry nor bothered by the situation, because I know it's my fault.

I got a friend who's been through a similar problem. Yesterday we talked about our failed love lifes, comforting each other. He then jokingly talked about becoming gay, because ""happiness is at the tip of a dick"".

That last part was unnecessary, but it was funny. Anyway, sorry for my rant and my poor grammar (English isn't my first language).",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2jjcmy/my_crush_is_seeing_someone_else_its_not_bad_but/,9,"It's rough dude, I'm sure you got that massive stomach dropping feeling when you think about it. I can't say it doesn't suck, because it does, but I wouldn't try and think about her too much if I were you. Go hang out with some friends, try and meet someone, don't get too caught up.

957,1k9r65,False,,9,The thought of being in a relationship opens the floodgates of negative emotions.,whatsbotheringyou,"I've dating and had a few relationships before, but I've been single for about 10 months I guess.  
Since the last relationship I've tried dating, but it hasn't worked out.

But I've developed, sort of by accident, an almost-dating relationship with someone.  
We spend a lot of time together (2-3 days a week), we go out to eat every other week, we're close intellectually and at times physically - but the concept of us ""dating"" or being in a ""relationship"" does come up directly.

But when I think about us being together, and all that would come with that, I feel just horrible in ways that are hard for me to put into words.

My grandmother lives with me and my father visits recently. Whenever she or my father sees me working on anything (not just this hobby) they tend to look at me tilt and ask ""what are you doing"" in a tone that, to me, implies I'm doing something strange. 

They don't ever discuss my hobbies with me directly. They have a tendency to ask my brother questions about my interests. So, if it ever gets brought up, I feel really embarrassed talking about my interest and hobbies.

Am I nervous? A bit.
Am I scared? A bit.
Am I excited?... yes. Very

When my coworkers ask what opportunity I am heading to and they react in a judging fashion about me heading to unemployment I am undeterred. I feel sorry for them! not me. I had the courage to take a leap of faith in myself.

I only lied so I wouldn't scare her off because I knew from the moment we started talking that I would develop amazing feelings for her. Well she mentioned it last night and I told her straight up that I was just getting over the old girl but we were not together while I was texting her(which was mostly true).

238,dk63qp,False,,4,I really hate my life.,whatsbotheringyou,I'm tired of this shit. I can't believe that I'm 27 years and I'm the way I am. I'm still stuck on a dead end job and can't figure out what I like to do for a stable career. I still live at my grandmothers place and still haven't gotten my shit straight to get on with my life. Im literally a fucking loser. I hate that I put myself in this situation. I have no social life or no friends so in order to keep myself busy I have no choice but to go to my moms house where she acts narcissistic. I feel like I stuck myself like this because I'm afraid to put myself out there and break away from this comfort zone I'm in. I've always been afraid to get too involved with other people and I isolate myself. I don't know why I'm like this. It's now taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired of this lifestyle and it's only causing more stress. I still can't even choose a career. I'm tired of feeling like I can't financially support myself if I move out. I'm just a empty human being. I don't even know what my problem is and why I'm doing this to myself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dk63qp/i_really_hate_my_life/,17,"Oh my goodness that is such a heavy load to carry and I and I can tell that you're in a tremendous amount of pain.  I've been there and I know how tough it is, but I know with some work and commitment you can turn your life around. 

The only way to change things is to start and I think in your case you should pick just one thing a little outside your comfort and do that.  I like to recommend you try volunteering.  Look through your community for organizations that are looking for volunteer sign up and do that at least once a week.  Commit to at least 4 visits in one month.  After that, you can decide if you think you will benefit from it and continue or look for something else but commit to volunteering for at least 6 months.   Volunteering helped me so much when I was in a similar situation as you and I still volunteer to this day.  Helping others takes you out of your own mind just for a little bit and after you're done it just feels good. 

The second thing I can suggest is for you to start to develop a self-care plan.  It doesn't have to be very complicated.  Figure out something to do for exercise, whatever you like to do and do that three times a week for a minimum of 15 minutes.  Then when it feels right add something to it and then continue on like that.  Then start working on your diet.  Slowly start to incorporate more fruits and veggies into your diet, then slowly take away things that may not be the healthiest for you.  If you don't know how to cook then start experimenting with recipes.  Make sure you are getting an adequate amount of sleep.  Reduce the amount of screen time.

If that is overwhelming then break it down even further.  The important thing is that you just do something.  I know you can get out of this funk. Your whole life is in front of you, make it happen. ",2019-10-19 16:35:07

What inspired this topic and made me feel guilty was I could hear him spanking her HARD. **WHACK** and a moan. **WHACK** and a louder moan. I can hear her talking dirty. I can hear how fast he's fucking her because the bed creaks. I can hear them kiss (I assume not just faces). I hear *everything*.

And I feel guilty, because I enjoy listening to it entirely too much. I feel like I should leave when they're going at it, but 1. I don't want to, and 2. They bang it out at random times during the day, usually three or four times, sometimes more.

88,1kk9i0,False,,16,My mom is worse than a bill collector.,whatsbotheringyou,"Let me preface this by saying that for the past year or so I have been slowly, slowly working my way out of a mountain of debt.  I work in fast food while I am finishing up school, and money is unbelievably tight.  I'm not on any public assistance, and my paychecks only average about $430 every two weeks.

About a month ago, my mom was listening to me complain about how I couldn't afford to renew my license plates and I didn't know where I was going to get the money to do it.  My mom makes great money (If I remember correctly, 65K last year, and she has been working full time this year) She offered to loan me $200, which I was extremely grateful for.  However, ever since then, she will not quit hounding me about it.  Every time I have spoken to her on the phone it has ended in me bawling my eyes out, or her hanging up on me.  

She keeps saying ""Well I need that money, lolacherokee! I am so broke, your siblings need school supplies, etc."" This just pisses me the fuck off because just last week I went out with her while she shopped for new beds and mattresses for my brother and sister.  She told the salesman that her budget was 5K, and she was going to write a check.  She didn't end up finding anything she liked, so we left.  Just a few days ago she took one of my sisters to the mall, and she called me saying she had ""only"" spent $300 dollars.  

My mom grew up poor.  She knows how hard it is to make ends meet.  But she worked hard, was a frugal person, saved, and now she has something to show for it.  I can appreciate that.  However, I don't think she realizes that $200 she can make in five and a half hours takes me twenty three hours to earn.  

The icing on the cake today was when I told her I was hungry, she said ""well if you can afford to buy groceries, you can afford to pay me back.""  Actually mom, I have only been eating my free meals at work the past four days because I only had money for either me to eat or my cats, so I bought cat food.

They both have multiple tattoos all over, I have none, so I was a bit hesitant at first and said I probably wouldn't, even though they managed to strike a deal with the artist for a cheaper price if we all went together. I reconsidered and said yes a week ago, I wanted to, and they were both ecstatic. One of them tells me casually on our way to class that they decided to make the appointment tonight to get it done in another week or so. I was a little taken aback as I expected more time to decide on a design and everything, as I wanted something a little more ornate than them. I asked why, and she said that because of the various trips they were both planning (some of which we're going together on) and other tattoos, they should just go ahead and schedule it. I expressed that I was upset that they went ahead and planned it without mentioning it to me or taking my preferences into consideration, since this was something we were supposed to do together. She responds that ""I guess we just forgot you weren't involved in that conversation"".

They have ways they make money, but none are sustainable or consistent (thankfully they're not into mlms if that's what you're wondering, I'm just trying to remain vague). I see their roommates putting out their gofundme's for doctor appointments and fixing their cars. What does my friend ask for? Hobby supplies. New electronics. You get the idea. They have the nerve to try and blame every single one of their problems on the corporations and the government and what have you, and I get it. I'm anti-establishment, I wish I didn't have to work under a corporate-mandated system or kiss ass for my shitty paycheck but that's the only option I have. That's the only option most people have. And you know what? Some of those people end up moving out of their shit hole apartments and moving on to better places. It's broken, its backwards, but if it's food and Healthcare you need, you can't just wait around and hope that it'll be handed to you. I sympathize so deeply. There isn't a moment that I don't worry about what will happen to me if my current situation falls apart, but I'm not at people's doorsteps arguing about how privileged and gross people are because they live in a house instead of a rinky dink apartment. 

Cuz that's what my friend is doing. All they do is talk about how many meals they had this week and how they were soooooo pissed that they had to drive past a nice neighborhood to run an errand. Are you really that jealous and petty? They started making videos about and people called their bluff saying that not everyone they're angry at is a shitty, one-percent old white man who never knew poverty (and of course many were unkind and insulting but a lot of them were just honestly confused and hurt by their words). And what does my friend do? Screenshots their comments and talks about how much hate and ugliness they're getting from voicing an opinion. 

And honestly? I don't want to hear it anymore. I admire my friend's creativity and personality but this misguided (amd frankly hypocritical) hate is so much. And they have so many people rallied around them that if I so much as say that they're wrong that their friends and roommates will gather around and burn me at the stake.

However, I never have been in a relationship and even now when I got to college I am still single. I have managed to get several replies to me on dating sites like OkCupid and POF. A couple of them are mistresses who are looking for a submissive male and they seem really nice and attractive. I am currently talking to one of them but I am not so sure how the relationship is going. I never had a girlfriend before and this is kind of depressing for me. I would like to get a girlfriend sometimes soon because I fear that I will be forever alone in the relationship department. I have a hard time getting around since I do not have the available transportation. I want a girlfriend but I would like to know what are some tips on getting a girl to like you and go out with you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3k00om/i_am_21_and_i_never_had_a_girlfriend_before/,11,">Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. Transpiration is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves.

So I'm not really sure what you mean by you not having the transpiration... but anyways, if you want a girl to like you or something, don't focus on trying to get a girl to like you. Find something you like to do, join a club for that thing, do that thing, be confident in yourself. Girls will see that confidence and be drawn to it. And also don't get down about not having a girlfriend by 21. There are posts on here everyday about that same thing so it's not that weird. Also if you *do* like a girl, just ask her out.

I'm not so conservative (though prior to this year I hadn't done anything you can really call scandalous).  Anyway, last semester one of my guy friends asked if I wanted to have a one-night stand, and I said yes.  I was a virgin (which I told him) before that.  Anyway.  He was really nice and we messed around a few more times.

Then over Christmas break he texted me telling me that his therapist said he really shouldn't be messing around (I'd known he was seeing a therapist and that he tried to kill himself and was hospitalized last year).  So of course I didn't want to give him a hard time about that because I mean he's been having a shitty time anyway.

When we got back to school it was pretty awkward though (mostly my fault) but eventually we smoothed things over.  Then after about a month I saw him for an actual conversation for the first time since.  And he told me he'd tried to kill himself again.  I didn't tell the admin (DON'T GIVE ME A LECTURE I SWEAR TO GOD I'VE HEARD LIKE TWENTY ALREADY) but someone did and so he's at the hospital now.  Well he has been over a week and last year he told me he'd been there a week.

I'm worried I guess.  People just keep telling me like ""oh don't worry, at least you know he's safe"" but it's getting so annoying because YES I KNOW he's physically safe but I don't even want to think about how he's doing emotionally right now.

Now I know exactly how hard it is to be away from my best friends, family, and pets, and I am dreading having to leave them after only having a few short months with them. I don't adapt well to change, and for some reason college seems to be a hurdle I simply cannot overcome. Other people act so nonchalant about it, and I wish I could be like them.

I do have friends in college, but we're not as close and I think my sadness at being away from my best friends is causing me to have difficulty making and maintaining new friendships. I worry that my friends and I will grow apart, that we will all meet better friends and go our separate ways, and it's tearing me up inside. 

On top of this, I have strong feelings for a friend, and had many opportunities to express those feelings, but chickened out every time. In two days he will be moving ~1000 miles away to go to college. I know that ship has sailed, but it doesn't stop me from feeling deeply regretful.

I feel so overwhelmed. I wish I could just stop time. When I'm away at school I feel like I'm underwater-apathetically letting myself be carried any which way by the current, experiencing a muted, unhappy life and keeping myself going by thinking ahead to breaks and other times I'll see my friends.

So after nearly breaking down at the thought of living there for the rest of my life (I wanted to stay for my friends), I moved back home.

I guess I want to say from the perspective of having got to the other side, you can always move back. Four years is a long time but it goes by quickly. Many of the friends I grew up with have moved back or stayed local and some days it feels like college was a bad dream.

I felt like there was really something wrong with me being homesick as a senior in college (and some of my friends had seemingly forgotten about home by thanksgiving break freshman year), but I think everyone is different. It's perfectly reasonable to feel how you're feeling, to want to stick it out, to make whatever decisions you want to make.

&#x200B;

All I want is someone to watch endgame with

&#x200B;

Right now I'm on a greyhound in between Las Vegas and Magic Mountain, not even two hours into a six hour trip. It is 5:30 and we should reach the hotel by 9 pm. If I decide to post this, it'll probably have to wait until I get to the hotel. To be honest, I've had something to say here for a very long time, but I didn't want to talk about it in case I was wrong. But I'm not wrong about what I feel.

I'm writing this in Notepad on my laptop, so apologies for random line drops.

It's a Senior end of school trip, and I know everyone's name just as well as they know my name. Yet, I am somehow just far enough not to be able to talk to my own clique -- Tom, Noah, and Anne -- and close enough to read their faces and hear their conversations. Who I would consider my three closest friends are sitting  just ahead of me in two rows of two seats. There is a fourth empty seat, but I can't sit there because the person sitting there, Noah, says he gets claustrophobic, and after knowing the kind of stuff he deals with on a daily business, i decide not  to challenge him on that.  So the people in my general vicinity are all listening to music and catching up on sleep, and I can't help but watch my closest friends on the bus ride of their life. I'm one of those kids that ends up moving schools a lot. I spent each year of  middle school somewhere else, and I'm graduating high school from the third  high school I've attended. It even cost me taking a calculus class since I kept switching curriculum's. Though I don't feel knew to the school, it's been only a year here since my birthday in march. Of Tom, Noah, and Anne, I've known each person for different amounts of times. Noah, i met first in elementary school, and met him here again after I had thought I said goodbye to him for the last time in middle school. A lot has happened to him since then and I'm still learning piece by piece. Tom, I met after shadowing him a week before I was enrolled in this newest school. We ended up having a near identical schedule except for Latin, so it was pretty easy to become friends with him. We even became Public Forum partners and took our skills to a tournament in Arizona. And then there's Anne. I knew Anne by name when i first started  going here, but it was only since the beginning of this school year that I  started talking to her more. Between us, we are the only seniors on the speech and debate team, meaning it was pretty easy for us to keep close. But then there's this curse that anyone who's always switching schools carries: the moment you truly feel close, you're on your way out the door. In this case, we left for Magic Mountain right after a college declaration assembly in which Noah said he'd go to UNLV, Anne to SUU, Tom to Washington State, and myself to UNR. These are our last moments, and I can only watch them. The worst of it is that I never even felt like a close friend to these people, rather just the  fourth guy that showed up one day. To them, I feel like only a PF partner, only a Speech and Debate teammate, and nothing more. 

All I wanted was someone to watch endgame with. It's been I think three weeks,  and not one of us four had gotten around to seeing it. Because it's about the end of the school year now, AP exams finally out of the way, I thought we could see Endgame together. I asked Tom first, but he told me he was busy. I'm always left to assume with him because he's always busy and then I ask him Monday how his weekend was and he'll tell me he didn't do anything. I was on my way to ask Noah second, but I didn't even bother with him. He got into really bad trouble  that kicked him off the Debate team and his mother doesn't let him leave the house anymore unless it's a mandatory school event. And then Anne. Now if I can take a second to be fully honest, I am in love with Anne. It's not just one of those teenage crushes you get every 7 seconds you spend with a cute girl you wish you might hang out with more often. I know, because I swore off that at the beginning  of the school year, and every second with her, the thought never crossed my mind. I only realized how I felt about her when we hung out at prom. I told her that I  wished I asked somebody, anybody, out to prom and she asked me who, and I didn't  respond because in my mind, I was about to tell her ""you."" Anyways, I ended up asking everyone else, kept getting the same answers, and ended up watching the damn movie by myself in the dead of night at some little theater out of a casino. I'd give it an 9 out of 10. I really liked the scene where Steve Rogers picked up mjolnir. Tom already dated another ex of mine this year. Jane. Last year, I took Jane to  Junior prom, and we lasted about about two months after that. For the longest  time, Tom and Jane were always fighting with each other, Jane being Chinese, Tom liked to show her pictures of Tienanmen Square and say ""That's you, lol."" I don't know why they decided to forget all that for six months to have some sort of show-up romance. I actually don't take it personally, but it really bothered me because Jane was still uncomfortable talking to me and wanting to take Tom away from me so that they'd have more time together. That's why I'm scared that the more time they end up spending together, the more likely they'll be dating when I finally say something.

That's why I've made a promise -- and I don't make promises too often -- to tell Anne before the bus ride home Friday morning. Now there's another three hours left to the hotel. I can only hope I have a chance to talk to her some more when we get there before.

702,1k3frh,False,,19,"Wasting money on buying clothes that I like, but then society/my mother/myself makes me embarrassed to wear it.",whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry this may be long.
This has been an on-going problem for me.  Ever since I started to develop and mature into a woman, I outgrew my ""Junk Foods"" T-shirts and tried to find trends that I liked/were somewhat popular in the times.  However, I've grown to dislike certain aspects of clothing, such as: sheer clothing (I don't like to layer, though I've forced myself to for years), things that show imprints of what you're wearing underneath (tight pants show underwear lines, and my mom won't let me get thongs, or bra lines that show against shirts), long sleeves (I end up rolling them to my elbows), too tight/too loose shirts, lots of cleavage, shorts that are too short, really skinny and really flare jeans, etc.  I don't know why these bother me so much, but it really limits what I buy.  

But I could live with my stunted clothing choices if my mother didn't come into play.  I love my mom, and I value her opinion in my life.  Since I still live with her, and have not gone into college yet, she has a lot of say when it comes to clothing.  And it's not the typical, ""don't wear that demeaning clothing"" because I don't like the new daring trends.  She pushes me to wear ""pretty"" or ""sophisticated, trendy"" clothes of today.  And it's weird because I look at the clothes and think ""I might actually look good in/like these"" but then I get uncomfortable.  I don't know why, but I think it might be due to my mom's past criticisms of my clothes or the fact that I've dressed basically one way for my entire life, and if I changed people would notice.  I would often wear a t-shirt and jeans for school, but right on the way out of the door she would look at me in disgust and say ""you're going to wear that? wear something nicer."" So that puts me off when it comes to the clothes I like.

When it comes to the clothes she likes, I think that if I wear them, people at school and people I know would comment with something like ""I've never seen you wear clothes like that, etc"" These could be things like skirts, nice blouses, or layered cardigans.  I think I would enjoy them, until I realize people would take notice, which somehow makes me feel uncomfortable wearing them.  Also, if I do wear them, I get uncomfortable in public, and begin to take off layers and change pieces throughout the day until I'm basically at a bare minimum when it comes to jewelry, layered clothing, uncomfortable shoes, makeup (which I never wear btw) and etc.

Sorry this has been long.  Basically, I spend too much money on buying clothes I like, my mom likes, and new adventurous pieces that I end up not wearing because I realize I dislike the fashion, my mom puts me down for wearing such things, or that society would take notice.  I don't know what to do, and this is especially killing me since school is coming up.

Part of maintaining them involves being outspoken and, if necessary, confrontational. 

I've found that, for myself, viewing grudges as allowing others to have control over me helped me let go of grudges most of the time.

A grudge can change how I respond to others. It can influence my decisions and cause me pain. How does that help me? How does it further my goals for myself? How does it move my will from daydreaming into reality? If it doesn't (and in my experience a grudge never helps with those things) then it's restricting me. In holding that grudge I'm letting someone else have power over me.

That's fuel to propel me away from holding a grudge but it doesn't necessarily stop me from holding one. Actively letting go of a grudge is very personal and I do not have a road map for it. Hopefully you find this mindset helpful. It helps me let go of grudges and avoid letting them happen in the first place. ",2020-05-09 01:00:19

3,1k3sis,False,,15,Girlfriend of Last 5 Years Passed Away,whatsbotheringyou,"Hello everyone. Long time reddit user here, first time posting. So I'm sure the title pretty much explains everything, but I'll try and give a backstory that isn't too lengthy, or gives our personalities away.

So I met my girlfriend (ex?) my freshman year of college. Both of us were involved with other people at the start of college, but our paths crossed and started dating Junior year of college. We're both involved in the performing arts and I've been working shows here in NYC and throughout the country, and she's been singing on cruise ships. Long story short, we both said that we would make our relationship work as best as can while we're away from each other. It worked....magically. Both of us were working in our fields of work, but unfortunately away from each other. She got offered the last ship she hadn't worked on, which would've meant she would've traveled to every continent, and practically everywhere worth visiting.

I told her not to go to the last ship in hopes of starting things earlier, but of course I wasn't going to prevent her from seeing the world. We both agreed on holding until September of 2013, where we would move in with each other and both promise that we'd both work in NYC. Unfortunately, she passed away within the first month of working her last contract. This happened 6 months ago, and they still have no idea what was the cause of death (they've ruled out suspicious activity, and are leaning towards natural causes.....she was 24 years old and perfectly healthy).

Fast forward some, it's been 6 months, her birthday is.....very soon, and we're drawing nearer to the date where we were supposed to move in.

I'm very lucky and have had ZERO experiences of anything remotely like this happen (both of extremity, and dealing with death). I guess what's I'm throwing out there is....

Is there anyone out there that has dealt with something remotely close to this? I don't want to get into specific details in the intro, but god damn.....this is just ridiculous, especially with her having passed at 24, and me being 26.

Has anyone out there dealt with a similar situation? I've went to therapy twice and pretty much thought it was a waste of time, and was very open to my thoughts and my 'ideology' on therapist sessions. This was during the second month, and I'm going on Wednesday for the first time since then. Love you guys and everyone who has to read this, thank you.

DM",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1k3sis/girlfriend_of_last_5_years_passed_away/,62,"I dealt with a similar situation :


- Your age more or less
- Girlfriend died just before living together after a period of long distance relationship
Not much hinsight though since it was a few month ago but here is my strategy.

Carry on with life and try to make the best out of it until the final day. Concerning possible culpability for the future (fading memory, someone else coming into my life), I understand that these feelings will eventually come. Therefore I try to make a work of prevention on myself accepting life and the human condition: death will come one day or another so why make it sooner. Since I accept the time I have left why not try to live it fully while I'm here ? In a way culpability would mean my life mentally stopped when my girlfriend died which is not the case. This point makes culpability somehow absurd and is enough to be reassured, for the moment.

I hope you will find the strength to go on, I strive to.

Maybe you have some tips I didn't think about, I would be glad to hear it :) ",2013-08-10 19:58:32
845,d72jbz,False,,1,My mom thinks I won't be able to keep a job because I changed hobbies,whatsbotheringyou,"So last night my parents asked where we prefer they move for retirement and I told them they need to move wherever works best for them. They said what if I'm still living with them and I said ""what, you guys are moving within the next two years?"" And they said ""no probably in eight years."" These people think I'm gonna be living with them in 8 years?! I already have plans to move out after community college (lucky enough that they're letting me live at home), or maybe even while I'm in it (depending on when I get hired as a sheriff service officer since it takes at least nine months).

I tell them all this and my mom says ""well you change your mind a lot so."" I said that's for hobbies and she's like ""well you don't wanna do orchestra anymore so."" I said that's a hobby and having a job would be different. She said ""you can't quit a job right away just cuz it feels awkward or something."" I said that I'm quitting orchestra next semester because I'm *burnt out* from my former *passion* which is why I'm not gonna have my passion be my job so I don't get burnt out and want to quit or be miserable anyway or whatever. Plus I'm doing orchestra for the rest of the semester anyway and I do/have done other things I didn't wanna do anyway so why wouldn't I do that with a job?

She thinks that because I don't wanna do violin or orchestra anymore that means I won't be able to keep a job ever and I'll be living with my parents for *eight years* because of it. Wow. Ignore all the shit I'm doing to be more responsible and be able to live on my own and provide for myself, and pay attention to my fucking hobbies instead (she also brought up ASL cuz I was super into it at first but not anymore).

Then she brought up I wanted to be a musician but not anymore, and I told her I decided not to cuz it's not as realistic and I probably won't be able to support myself that way (on top of losing passion and stuff) so I decided something else. I dropped an unrealistic career for a more realistic career, but since I changed at all that means I won't be able to keep a job.

My dad was on my side luckily. He said that I'm right about a job not being a passion and just being something cool. He also said that an SSO is a good job. Being supportive and encouraging basically, instead of doubtful like my mom. I'm finally starting to get a solid and reasonable idea of my future and it feels like she's trying to tear me down.

I hate how my mom thinks I can't even move out of the house because my hobbies change. When I still did violin she had no second thoughts on anything,  I ditch violin and suddenly I'm gonna move out of state with them in 8 years still living with them and probably unemployed.

56,frechs,False,,2,"Dear life, please. Get better.",whatsbotheringyou,"I do honestly feel like I am going crazy right now.

I know that right now is strange time for everybody But I feel like for me everything is going down way worse.

So basically my university got shut down around three weeks ago. The Monday after it got shut we got a message that one of our fellow Professors we had lessons on Friday with, is Corona positive.
I showed some symptoms of Coronavirus after that but still did not manage to get a test done, since I am very low in the queue of my local doctor. 
By now I'm feeling better but not with my mental health.
The thing is that I have been writing an exam around one month ago and i really feel like that I messed it  up. I will get the results on the second of April, however I really feel like I messed it up. If I mess up that exam when I will lose my job.

So basically before this whole Corona  shit started i was already mindfucked. Problem now is that my girlfriend did not really support me. At that time we have been a couple since one year and eleven months. On the first of April we would be a couple for exactly 2 years.
However since around that time she is trying to meet up with her old friends and stuff which is good and all but I wanted her to be there for me in the time when I felt really like shit.
Which she obviously wasn't. 

Ever since that day things have changed quite a lot for worse. 
As of right now we are not a couple anymore but we are not broken up. We are basically doing a break.
In the past few days we have been calling each other and we really had want talk when we were really talking about having sex together again and  we would love to see each other again which was not possible because I was in Quarantine. 
Quarantine ended on the 27th  of March, however I'm really feeling very very very bad in the past few days because I do not enjoy gaming anymore. I have been gaming since I was 11 years old, which is 9 years ago.
I don't have to go to university anymore and I cannot see anything or basically i have nothing to do.



So my problems right now: i have a girl that I love more than everything but I don't think that she loves me anymore.
 I'm probably about to lose my job and since I don't enjoy gaming anymore i feel like I'm going crazy because I have absolutely nothing to do during the day. I have been doing sports in the past three years and I'm still doing it but since Coronavirus is there at the moment there is no possibility for me to do it outside and you know I cannot train everyday at my home.

I really just hope that there's something in the next few days that will cheer me up again. Because of right now I am hoping that the second of April all the first of April will do something for me.

Maybe the first of April will do something for me because that would be the day for me and my ex girlfriend when we would be a couple for exactly two years. 
Second of April might do something for me because then I will get the results. That will let me know if I have to start everything all over again, with studying and so on. 

Don't get me wrong if I lose my job right now I have something else that I will study and it's no problem at all. It's just that I really want life to get better by now.

797,1sfvc6,False,,8,I'm starting to feel lonely,whatsbotheringyou,"Hello, first of all, thanks for taking your time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I'm a man, 24 years old and never really had a girlfriend. I've dated a few girls once in a while but it never got serious and never lasted long.

I was really ok with that in the past, I haven't really felt the need to have a relationship as I see most people do, I always tough that I'll have someone worth it when its time.

But obviously you cannot choose who you have a crush on. As far I remember, I had 7 big crushes, basically one each school grade or new job during the last years.

The problem is that I never knew (in fact, I still don't know) how to deal with a crush, I remember always pretending I was talking to her and planning to, on the next day, finally talk to her but ended, on the last moment, doing nothing and feeling disappointed with myself for that and every time it happened I hurt myself a little more.

I feel like all this happened because I was afraid to lost a real good friendship which caused me to never know what exactly to say, I'm really introvert and don't talk much, so when it comes to talk about my feeling I normally freeze and no word comes out. When it comes to talk about something else, I have no issues at all, even when I have to talk or perform something to a crowd.

After all that I think I learnt how not to have a crush on someone to not hurt myself, it's about 3 ~ 4 years since the last one and I was still ok with that until now.

I'm starting to feel the need to have someone closer to me, to hug someone not just to compliment, to share some laughs, to discover things together (new good musics, places, movies, books, ...), to enjoy someones else company. 

I always see happy couples having a good time together doing all that things mentioned before or just by enjoying each others shoulder/nap and want the same.

I'm not hasty, I know if I push to hard for it to happens it might be a bad experience and that's exactly what I don't want right now.

Besides that I have absolutely nothing to complain about, I have a really good family, I'm healthy, so are my family and friends, just finished college last year, have a good and stable job, no debts, ...

The only thing I want for now is this anguish to go alway from my chest, that's all.

It was for the best, but I'm having a hard time staying positive now that I'm single. I'm a college student (undergrad). I've always been overweight, but over the past 2 years I've lost over 100lbs. I've been hitting the gym more often since the breakup just for something to do. I'm still overweight, but I'm working on it. I try very hard to dress up every day and make myself look my absolute best for classes, the dining hall, etc, because I'm seriously so anxious that I will ruin my chance to find someone new if I ever for even one second look too frumpy. I've made it a personal policy to try new things and talk to as many people as I can. I've even gone out to a couple of bars on the weekends with some friends to try and meet somebody.

All I really want right now is companionship. I really want to go out and date somebody, even just make new friends to talk to. Hell, I'd just like someone to text me now and again and make me feel like I'm loved by someone, instead of me always having to initiate conversations and feeling like a burden as a result. I'm frustrated because it isn't happening. I do understand that the world doesn't just make friends/boyfriends appear, but I'm just scared that I threw away the only person who was willing to put up with me, my personality and my weight, and now I'll be alone forever. 

On top of this, I have a lot of anxiety related to school stuff (applying for internships, scholarships, finals coming up etc) that is really eating away at me. I've been so emotional lately that it's getting in the way of me getting things done.  What can I do to stay focused on what's really important (school), without feeling depressed? Also, with winter break approaching, I'll be moving back home for 6 weeks, and the prospect of being completely isolated for that long makes me extremely unhappy. My school friends live too far away to see them regularly, and I don't feel comfortable asking them to skype me all the time because I'll feel so needy and gross when they're trying to enjoy their home-friends. I just don't know how to be happy by myself anymore. Any advice is welcome.

341,1xy826,False,,5,I'm a failure,whatsbotheringyou,"Two mays ago, I graduated and soon dated a wonderful young girl.  I had quite a few close friends, was in a band, had great grades in high school, and life was pretty great.  This was probably the highest part of my life.  I then went to college, and didn't really meet anyone who stuck around to stay in touch with me.  Guess I never had much to say and didn't have strong enough interests to get involved in things.  

Anyway I guess I became depressed or something, and my mind became restless with weird existential thoughts.  Everything felt pointless, from classes that didn't interest me in the slightest to making new friends since they would be gone from my life like my old ones to even my then girlfriend, whom I cared about more than anything.  Just knowing that it would end made me crazy.  

So then, in whatever weird mental state I was in, I essentially gave up.  I failed two classes and was kicked out of university.  I pretty much lost touch with my former friends, and I became bitter and shitty, which ruined my relationship.  

There's worse stuff out there in the world no doubt, but I'm a spoiled white pos so this is all I've known.  

Turns out I was terrible at breaking old habits, and had to withdraw from another course and the tech school that I went to the next fall.  At that point I started seeing a doctor for depression, but both medications I received didn't have a noticable effect, and my mother seemed to think I was feeling better over Christmas break so we agreed to cancel future appointments.

I got off to a bad start this semester too.  If I have to withdraw this class again I don't even know what comes next.  

This is obviously all my own fault but it drives me crazy.  Just the tip of the iceberg.

Also it blows to come home, visit your grandparents (of course that part was nice) and then they show you that your ex is on the front page of the local newspaper essentially for being an exceptional musician.  It's good to see that she is just as amazing as ever and I didn't hold her back, but goddam I would kill to be part of her life again, just to cheer her on and watch her grow.  If I somehow just knew that I could've had some kind of lasting relationship I think it would've been enough to hold it all together.

Anyway, incoherent rambling beside, I just don't know what to do

there's enough stuff troubling to write about for days, and I guess I just am not strong enough to cope with it or keep it internal and not affecting my other aspects of life

0,1jy7px,False,,41,I was raped and I don't know to fix it.,whatsbotheringyou,"I recently went away on a family holiday. My cousin and I decided to go out for the night just the 2 of us. Everything was going great and we had a nice catch up as I hadn't heard much from her since I've been away at Uni. She was very drunk but I'm used to dealing with that so it didn't matter. I wasn't drinking as I've been having trouble with my breathing and didn't wanna be drunk when an attack came on in case I couldn't sort myself out. Again, not a problem.

My cousin is single and so did meet a few guys throughout the night, however I have a boyfriend so when she was making out with a guy I'd usually just talk to his friend or someone nearby and met plenty of lovely guys and girls. Until 2 guys came over to talk to us. She immediately got off with one of them and I was left talking to the other. He seemed nice enough and I told him about my boyfriend, he had just gotten out of a relationship, told him about my new flat, he had just started renovating his own, told him about my pets etc etc. 

Then my cousin decided she wanted to move on, but they followed us to the club and the guy my cousin was with insisted on buying her drink - he then asked me what I would like. I've always been very cautious about people buying my drinks but since I was only drinking water - what could go wrong? When I saw that vodka and redbull was being poured for me as well I turned to point it out to my cousin and she just shrugged it off and said it was probably easier to order the same for everyone. I agreed and thought one drink isn't going to mean I won't be able to pull myself together if my breathing fucks up. 

From then it's a blur. I remember a brief moment of waking up and I was in a hotel room and this man was on top of me. It was the most horrible feeling. Like my brain was working but my body wasn't. I couldn't feel anything happening to me but I just know something did. I attempted to move to push him off but I couldn't control myself and my arms flopped to my side and I was out again. I was woken up by my cousin around 9am, still feeling rough. I didn't know where I was. There was a man sleeping in the corner and the main door was open for some reason. We some how managed to run and I don't remember how we got to the cab but my cousin told me we went to reception to ask for one. It was all still a bit hazy and so we didn't think to look at the hotel and the room number. 

Eventually we pulled up at the villa. We both felt sick, numb, ashamed and just decided we didn't want to tell anyone. Everyone assumed we just had a crazy night out and we left it at that. The last 3 days of the holiday it wasn't spoken about at all.

As soon as I got back home I broke down to my boyfriend and told him happened. He's still the only one I've told. But I feel like a horrible person. I've only ever been with 2 people both of whom I was in a long term relationship with - 1 being my current boyfriend. And I was always proud of that, but now I've had it forced upon me and that's ruined it. I feel angry and dirty. I feel numb, embarrassed, just so horrible that I accepted that one drink despite it not being what i asked for, and now my boyfriend isn't the only one I've been with in this relationship. 

I haven't left the house yet and my boyfriend works full time so I've been alone a fair bit. I keep just breaking down wherever I am in the flat and drop to the floor crying, until I remember I'm not that weak anymore and manage to pick myself up. But this is just a cycle and it's not fixing anything. I don't know what to do. For myself or my boyfriend. He needs help as much as I do and whilst i have him to comfort me and tell me it will all be okay, that doesn't work for him and I don't know what to do.

316,g5g4n3,False,,21,I need advice on a really difficult situation.,whatsbotheringyou,"This is incredibly personal and long and I made a throwaway account just to get it off my chest, I’ve tried to omit any identifying details because of the nature of my story, but I had to get this out and honestly I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because really, I’m not the one who needs sympathy here. I have a dear friend, we’ll call him Noah, who has a twin brother we’ll call Jamie. I’ve known Noah and Jamie since we were children, we grew up together and our mothers were friends before Noah and Jamie’s mom died when they were teenagers, they lived close to us and we were always together as kids. We went to school together, and they are both wonderful people, but Jamie is very sick. He started acting “strange” when he was a child, Noah says it was around 7 or 8 that the family started noticing it.

Sometimes he would say things that didn’t make any sense, or respond to something no one had said, or laugh at completely inappropriate times. He was screened for asperger’s and other types of disorders on the autism spectrum, but it was determined that his issue lay elsewhere. He was diagnosed with disordered schizophrenia at the age of 16, and by that point he was not doing well at all. He and Noah had always been extremely close in that stereotypical twin bond sort of way - they always seemed to know exactly how the other was feeling, what they were about to say, even when they couldn’t possibly have known. Noah has always been fiercely loyal to his brother, to the point of getting into fistfights at school with kids who made fun of him.

They’re 30 now. Noah was dating a girl I’ll call Stephanie for almost a year, and he seemed happy with her, but she never liked Jamie. Jamie, when he was thinking clearly, went out of his way to avoid talking to Noah about Stephanie or interacting with her whenever his brother was around, because apparently she was really mean to him sometimes but he knew how much Noah cared about her and didn’t want to be the cause for his relationship crumbling. Jamie spent some time briefly institutionalized after a series of upsetting incidents in which he kind of lost it and ended up hurting himself during some kind of violent, screaming, terrified fit. Noah tried to explain that he wasn’t a danger to anyone, he’d just been so scared of what he thought he was seeing or hearing, but Jamie ended up in the hospital for several months.

So Jamie comes home eventually, and since their father is an asshole, Noah agreed to become Jamie’s legal proxy of care, being responsible for Jamie’s well-being entirely. Jamie moved in with him, he was taking his meds and going to psych appointments and seemed to be doing well. I would go over to their house and play video games or watch movies with them, and whenever Stephanie came over Jamie would just quietly retreat to his bedroom. Noah picked up on the tension between them, and asked Jamie about it, but Jamie insisted that he was just shy around girls and Stephanie made him nervous because he wanted her to like him.

One night about a month ago though, Noah canceled a date night with Stephanie because Jamie was having a bad, really depressed night. Noah curled up on the couch with him and made him eat something and put on his favorite movie and texted Stephanie to apologize and explain what was going on. She was absolutely furious, and she went off on him for it, but he firmly told her that his brother is always going to come first for him and if she can’t accept that, then they weren’t going to work, and hung up on her. She came over to his place a few days later to “make up” but the minute Noah left her alone with Jamie for a few minutes to run down the block and get something from the store, she pulled out some bullshit.

She told Jamie that he’s being selfish, that Noah’s entire life has always revolved around taking care of him and keeping an eye on him and protecting him and that deep down, Noah resents him for it. She told him that if he really loves Noah, he’d try harder to get his shit together and set Noah free from the burden of him, she said all kinds of terrible things and triggered a massive depressive period for Jamie. Noah couldn’t get him out of bed in the morning, he wouldn’t eat or shower or anything, and he’d been doing so well the previous day that Noah was like “Jamie, what the hell?” and Jamie cried and told him that Stephanie had been right, which led to Noah storming over to her apartment to scream at her like “What the fuck did you say to my brother?”

This resulted in a major fight between Stephanie and Noah in which Noah called her a bitch and told her that she’d had no right to interfere with his family business, and she was a piece of shit because she didn’t even care if she pushed Jamie into a suicide attempt as long as she got what she wanted, which was for Jamie to leave them alone. She told him that she’s the only person in their lives strong enough to be brutally honest with Jamie because everyone else is afraid of triggering him, and Noah told her that he didn’t want to see her ever again and came over to my place to cry on my shoulder.

The thing is though, I get it. I get why Stephanie was frustrated, even if she was an asshole to do what she did. I know it must have been hard to be in love with someone and have their entire life dominated by someone who needs him so much and so constantly. I know it must have sucked to have Noah always canceling dates and things that were important to her because his brother needed him. I know it must have been hard to have Jamie there with them all the time, just sort of hanging out when she’d wanted alone time with her boyfriend. But I also know that Noah could never be with anyone who didn’t love Jamie too, and who didn’t understand that Jamie is always going to be his priority.

The problem now is, we’re all in each other’s mutual group of friends. There has been a lot of shit talking and taking sides and everyone is splitting off into smaller groups now because it’s awkward for all of us to hang out. Stephanie has a lot of support, because apparently Jamie being 30 years old means that he needs to get his shit together and stop relying on his brother to be his support system, and Noah absolutely refuses to entertain the notion of sending him back to his psych facility. Personally, I’m with Noah on this one, none of our other friends have a twin and none of them could understand. Jamie is literally all Noah has, but things are really weird and tense between everyone now and I don’t know how to fix it. I hate how things are right now, especially with all of us quarantined so we can’t all just get together and talk this out in person. 

Noah is a mess, and desperately struggling to deal with maintaining his brother’s schedule and well-being while dealing with losing his girlfriend and about 75% of his closest friends all at once, and he’s been leaning pretty heavily on me for emotional support. On top of all of this, Jamie has been extremely depressed ever since the night with Stephanie, and no one can pull him out of it, which is awful for him and making things harder on Noah. He is trying so hard to be strong and pretend everything is fine and normal for Jamie’s sake, but Jamie knows him too well and he feels incredibly guilty. Any advice on how to deal with this situation, or help either of them, would be really appreciated.

I wish I had some magic words of wisdom for all three of you. I really don't like Stephanie, I'm sorry. There is frustration, and then just plain mean/selfish. She falls into the latter category.

These days I'd be more interested in a Star Trek universe, where it seems everyone is allowed and encouraged to seek self-actualization. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs 

The Star Trek world is like an open game world where you can choose any path that freedom sounds nice. On the other hand in a star Wars scenario we feel we are compelled to throw ourselves and all our energies into a fight to protect all we love and value.

Fiction, sci-fi and historical are popular and universal because it is human nature to imagine other worlds. Some better and some worse. This is biologically adaptive. 

If you feel overly sad about living in this time, place and environment look for ways to make it more rewarding by comparing and contrasting what you would like with what is. See if this can help you make the here and now more fulfilling.

Soon after this decision I realized how much I was holding in and the need to talk about my issues.

I also tried running, playing an instrument, journaling, paying attention to proper nutrition, focusing on my schoolwork, focusing on my sleeping habits, meditating, hanging out with my friends more, and getting out of my house to break routines all while receiving help from my doctor and counselor.

565,1z7usg,False,,5,"I don't confront my problems, I feel like crap all the time and I lost my mother a week ago... (Long post)",whatsbotheringyou,"Hello. I am a 21 year old male who's in a weird situation at the moment. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer, I drink too much coffee and I don't get enough sleep. I also spend too much time by myself. I think I'm addicted to the internet and isolation.  

I've been doing this since I was fourteen, but I had a big breakthrough two years ago. I decided to become a better person and I did something about it. I started to work-out, eat healthier, take risks and be more social. The ""golden era"" ended last summer. I don't know how, but I gave up all of a sudden and went back to my old habits. 

I know that I'm being an irresponsible, lazy brat who's not doing anything productive, and I know that I should do something about it, but it feels like my motivation and sense of responsibility have disappeared. It's as if my common sense and my decision-making hate each other. It doesn't help to know that I should get out of my comfort zone and take small steps toward progress every day. I've tried that and it usually ends with that I give up after two or three days.

I also lost my mother a week ago (which sucks a lot by the way!!!). She had been struggling with cancer for nine years, and she got really sick in November. The doctors told us that she only had two months left in December. Me and my family spent as much time as we could with her. I feel that I didn't do enough to show how much I appreciated her, even though I helped her a lot, talked with her and was told that I did a good job. I was tired most of the time (due to my habits) and I didn't get to say all the things I wanted to say because of that. 

My shitty computer-coffee-staying-up-late-addiction/habit ruined my last months with my mother, and it sucks to know that I did that towards her. I *think* she appreciated the help she got from me and my family, and my emotional state *might* affect my perception of reality, but still: How could I be that selfish and useless?! 

My mind has been a beehive for the past couple of months, and I'm worried that I'm about to get a mental disorder or something. I've been to a therapist several times, but she thinks I'm fine. Baaaaaaah... Sorry about the long rant. 

Anyways; I would appreciate any advice on how to become less lazy, self-absorbed and self-destructive, and how to cope with the death of a loved one. 



",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1z7usg/i_dont_confront_my_problems_i_feel_like_crap_all/,14,"Well, I've totally been there. In fact I still am, but slowly making baby steps out of it. So I guess I can relate. I have spent the last 2 years basically in front of a screen, gaming addiction, reddit addiction, internet addiction. I have alienated almost all of my friends(oh, who am I kidding - all of them). I just stopped interacting with people, even online. I couldn't post on reddit for a while(I still am a little scared to post btw). And motivation? What's this? I almost went broke after almost a year unemployed and was considering homelessness for the fear of interacting with people to get a job. 

But enough about the past. This post should be uplifting and motivating and stuff. :)

So, what helped me, OP? I'd like to tell you one day I woke up and decided to change for the better, but that would be a lie. It happened gradually, with many ups and downs. One day I'd be all excited and vigorous, the next - back in the pit. Go for a jog 3 days in a row, make a post on reddit, check job postings, get outside, felt the sun and the air and everything's so fresh and beautiful. The next day - back in the pit, back to self-doubt and anxiety, back to the complete lack of any desire to do anything. 

But you know what happened after a while? The uplifting sprees got longer. I stopped smoking and started some mild exercise(like seriously mild), changed my diet a bit. Of course, there were days, when I got back to my pit, days I ate shit and didn't move from my chair. But as I said, you just keep going. You learn to forgive yourself, to love yourself, to be patient. What would you think if the person you loved failed from time to time and needed support? You'd support them and still love them. So why go hard on yourself? Don't set yourself impossible goals and don't punish yourself for failing. Embrace failing, failing is a part of the process, it means you're trying. 

Also, if you are afraid or not very good talking with people(I am incredibly bad and the 2 years of isolation certainly didn't help), you can try volunteering at a retirement home. It certainly helped me a lot. The people there do most of the talking and you can learn to read body language and to observe. Also the stories you'll hear will give you perspective on how young you are. You can literally do whatever you like, strive for whatever goal you want the next 5 years, fail, and still have the time to start again, twice. Time is on your side. So be patient with yourself. Get to know the person in the mirror and find out what you both want. And then when you are certain and when you have forgiven your past you, when you love the present you unconditionally, then you can gaze in the future and start dreaming again. 

Good luck, and I sincerely wish you the best. I believe in you and want you to find the strength to become the person you want to be.  ",2014-02-28 22:41:24

She's diagnosed with stage four lung cancer on Saturday. They do a biopsy on her lung and a petscan the next day. The nodules are the size of golf balls and are basically everywhere in her lungs. There was talk about chemo and how they'll do and MRI on Monday to see if it spread to her brain.

She's exhausted and embarrassed because she couldn't breathe well enough in the MRI machine.  They don't mind, you can do it in the morning when you feel better. I tuck her into bed. It'll be okay, Grandma. 

Tuesday, they find two tiny spots in her brain. The doctors don't seem too worried. They decide to only go ahead with chemo instead of both radiation and chemo. We're told she can come home Wednesday.

She calls us from the hospital saying that they haven't told her when she can leave yet. Actually, hang on, the nurse has some news, call you back. We get her oxygen and room set up.  She calls back. She'll tell us what the nurse says when she's home. 

She comes home and our dogs are so happy to see her. She says they're smiling at her. We get her settled She's happy just to be home and to be in her own room. So what was the news, Grandma? 

They did another x-ray, just to compare with the initial one. The tumors are much larger. It's growing rapidly.

I would sometimes arrive home feeling like absolute shit and I would cry in my room and only come out for basic things. I haven't had much luck getting a girlfriend either and this always has bothered me and can bring me to tears just thinking about it cause since childhood all I've ever wanted to feel loved and have someone to love back, to be with me and I feel hopeless and scared of dying alone. in 2016 the bullying finally stopped but I was still a bit of an outcast. in 2017 I finally managed to get a group of friends who, to this day am still with. despite this, I was always the butt of jokes and got pushed around by them but I didn't leave them because I had no one else and they knew this too and took advantage of that. I became depressed and would cry myself to sleep almost every night. after some time I finally had a small light of hope come to me, I developed a crush on a girl and do to my lack of social experience I would do many weird and cringey things to get her to notice me (thankfully I've learned how to interact with people properly). the one normal thing I did for her was a poem I wrote. I took an entire week to write it, to make it perfect. then I gave it to her, it turns out she had a boyfriend, I was heartbroken and also felt ashamed of myself. I felt hopeless like no one would ever love me. my friends made fun of me for that it got so bad that one day I attempted suicide. failed. am not glad I failed, but neither would I want to do that again.my parents are religious and they think mental illness is stupid and that even if I killed myself I would still be a sinner in the eyes of God. my parents are not abusive thankfully, they are just ignorant I suppose, but it still hurt to hear that not even god cared about my problems. and by the way, I am male so my father telling me to ""man up"" is a bit of a problem.2018 was quite calm, my depression calmed down, my friends started to respect me more, not much but still something. I would often cry about past events though.now in late 2019, my first year of high school began, I made friends with this girl, she was by far the nicest anyone had ever treated me, she suffers from depression and anxiety and so we would relate to many of each other's problems. I have become close to her and also a bit attached. I deeply care about her and do everything to try and comfort her when she's down. it turned out she has a boyfriend but I have recently reached the point of loving her.

80,eb8wzu,False,,6,4 days clean from everything and it hurts really bad,whatsbotheringyou,"I’m 20 years old

I’ve been struggling for years now with major depression and I spent too long masking it and hurting myself even more with drugs 

I’ve never done “hardcore”  drugs but I used to abuse prescription amphetamines until about 2.5 years ago, with a one time relapse a year ago

After I quit those, I went straight to cigarettes then vaping which kept me hooked until a few months ago now with too many failed attempts at quitting to count (thank god it’s over now)

My most recent vice was using a LOT of Kratom on a daily basis (20-30 dollars worth DAILY) and while I was using that for about 6 months I didn’t go to class and failed all of my classes and finally told my parents (I still live with them) and they basically cracked down on my behavior by having me do more chores around the house and stuff to keep me busy

They aren’t the most empathetic people, but the mood I’m feeling at this exact moment is telling me they’re only doing the best they can to be pragmatic about it

I have a wonderful girlfriend that I’m in love with and if I need to break into tears, she’s there for me to do it. It hurts me so much to put that kind of emotional weight on her, and I try to curb it when I can. 

The bottom line I guess is that it’s my fourth day clean from anything but caffeine for really the first time in years now and they’ve been some of the longest days I can remember 

Maybe this is how days are supposed to feel, maybe I’m not supposed to zone out on some substance or another for hours on end until I eventually crash and repeat the cycle. I know I have to get used to this

Even though I feel lost as hell right now, there are some good parts of me coming back that I missed for a really long time. 

I don’t get angry when customers don’t tip enough because I won’t be able to pick up kratom and vape juice after work. I see dust on my shelves and spills in the bathroom sink. I can lay down and listen to music without having to have my hands busy at the wheel of my car or playing a video game. 

These moods come and go on a minute by minute basis, and have been doing so while I’ve been writing this. I think it’s going to get better. I think I’m in an upswing. My cravings scare me but I have to push forward.

544,2lp8my,False,Update,6,I Surrender,whatsbotheringyou,"TL;DR I got divorced, lost my job, burned through savings, and have completely run out of hope.

Today, I finally called to get help with my bills and expenses. This is the latest stop on an 18 month slide. Go grab a snack...

18 months ago this week, my wife of 8 years, mother of my 3 sons, gave me a letter for my birthday. The letter was many pages long, detailing every way I had made her miserable since the day we met. At the end, she gave me one week to move out of our home, or she would be taking the children and leaving. Meanwhile, she sat in her office and wrote a check to completely pay off her student loan, wiping out our entire savings account.

I moved out, begging for counseling, or at least a chance to understand what she was talking about (many of her examples of my failure to do anything right did not make sense and were clearly untrue).

I took my paycheck and some money my parents had sent for my birthday, found an apartment and enough Goodwill furniture to sit, eat, and sleep.

The shock wore off, she initially set 6 months as the break, then 2 months in I stopped to pick up my kids (I was seeing them almost daily then) and said, ""You're never asking me to come home, are you?"" She laughed and told me how much fun she was having, she had a realtor ready to list our home for sale, and said she'd be filing for divorce. A few weeks later, she followed through.

At this point, a lot of very close friends simply abandoned me. I cut a few off, they only helped make me more angry. I didn't blame them, it was their own shock, hurt, and empathy coming out poorly, but I didn't need more anger. The majority just quit calling, and I didn't blame them either. I wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Not a lot on my mind except this out-of-nowhere disaster. The few conversations I had with friends and family boiled down to, others have survived it and I would too.

Still, all was tolerable. I was still working, still seeing the boys almost daily, and as the first year passed, it actually wasn't bad. I took my tax refund and sent myself on a 10-day vacation to Europe because I'd always wanted to go. I bought a house because she wouldn't allow the boys to stay overnight with me in my studio apartment, and now they could. Our joint custody meant they were with me half the time, and actually a little more than that due to her work schedule.

Then I lost my job. I was told my position was being eliminated and that was that. I had no desire to contest, it was a miserable job, which made me so miserable I am certain in contributed to my divorce. So, I set out for a new adventure, sending out 3 resumes per day to jobs I was well-qualified for or even positions I had held before.

I had managed to rebuild some savings after my trip and house purchase and that got me through 2 months. Then I cashed out the modest IRA I had wisely set up many years before, and it lasted about 4 months. 

Now here we are today. My mortgage payment is a week late, I have a little under half of it. My electricity is due next week, might make it, but the furnace (set at 55) keeps kicking on. I realized last week my car insurance was due 3 months ago, but I let it slide because I can't pay it and eat or put gas in it to go job-hunting.

The divorce is dragging on. I've convinced myself she is stalling until I completely self-destruct, at which point she will demand full custody and move with the children out of the country (we're in the US). 

I have applied to close to 500 positions in the last 7 months, from my old job titles to entry level. I have had several professional job-search helpers and resume assistants. I have done everything every website says, even the ones that contradict the other ones. I have been referred for jobs by contacts within the companies with openings. I have had two interviews. One required me to work every evening and weekend (which translates to no custody of my kids) for $8/hour. The other, I just found out, opted for the other candidate. In total, I've had 4 responses to applications.

I have one friend. Leaving out all the Facebook buddies, who are quick with a Like and a happy comment every once in a while, not actually friends, I have been completely abandoned. I told my mother two days ago that I was scared, she has not replied. 

How and why has everything failed so completely? Hundreds of people I know could have stepped up to do something. They could have talked to my ex, tried to make her be reasonable. They could have helped me with a job. They could have called once. How did I manage to go from solidly middle-class a year and a half ago to food stamps and the beginning of losing my home and losing electricity and the furnace it powers? 

I can't stop thinking about how completely abandoned I am, how many people failed to help when I finally gulped down the shreds of pride that were left and cried out for help. I can't really put my best effort into job searching, because no, I don't believe Mr. Job Coach and Miss Resume Helper that THIS will be the one. I can't sleep because the furnace keeps kicking on and I know it's the last few days of heat. The only thing I do know is that I'm not suicidal because there's still one little scrap holding on that maybe, maybe, there's a way. I just don't want to wait any longer. I'm so tired.

Updated: Somebody added on their prayers or something, I got a great lead today, and I got scheduled for an interview. Not out of the woods yet, and even if I'm hired this week, it will be a lousy couple of months until the paychecks flow smoothly and things ease up, but it's something. A good leap from where I was the other night.

533,3m0vkk,False,,3,Broke up with ex-girlfriend of 6 years. Never will get closure or reconciliation.,whatsbotheringyou,"I broke up with an ex-girlfriend of 6 years a few months ago. I left her because I highly suspected she was cheating on me. I do not know this for sure, but all the suspicious behavior was there.

- She had stopped wanting to have sex with me. I had asked to start using Condoms because we had a bad close call with an unwanted pregnancy but that's not a good reason for no sex.

- She had started guarding her laptop and cellphone with her life, and would get upset if I even glanced at the screen when she was on facebook.

- We never went to bed at the same time anymore, and all of a sudden she always needed space, she was complaining I was always around.

- I been told that when you confront a cheater, they blow up on you, and my ex had quite a temper and would become very angry that I ""accused"" her of cheating.

- She would accuse me of cheating on her all the time, and I also heard cheaters will do this to cover their own guilt.

- She had been hanging out with this male friend more towards the end, and putting on make-up and stuff, plus working out more. 

To me it seemed she had moved on, and I kind of don't blame her, I had waited too long to confront a trauma disorder issue I had which caused me to quit jobs and break-down a lot.

However, I wish she had been more unfront about it, and until this day she denys she cheated, and I would have been more apt to believe her, and even apologize for accusing but, she never even tried to talk to me about it.

Anyways she texted me today after not speaking for two weeks, and I thought it was going to be the start  of working things out, but instead she told me to stop talking shit about her. I do not even know what she is talking about because I do not talk about her on facebook, with mutual friends or to her. 

If she does come up, its in brief passing. I don't know I am crushed because I really miss the woman, but in the end she still has the same flaws which is the inability to remain calm and solve a problem.

Why I am attracted to her, I do not know, but deep down I miss my best friend very much, our relationship may have been shitty but she was still the person I loved to spend my time with the most.

739,5qker7,False,,3,Trying to get my life moving where I want and my mom isn't helping,whatsbotheringyou,"I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables(perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

---

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make, and my coworker constantly make me feel inadequate. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving the quality of my life and well-being.

---

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications but so far no interviews (the response was today actually; I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all relevant jobs.

Now to what’s been bothering me. For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

the day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that fi it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom, and I haven't heard back from either of them since.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items; this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) that I’d only told a few very close friends of because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s blabbed about to others. I’ve basically decided to keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t remotely true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family.

edit: My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and what she had said to everyone else; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time I had mentioned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/5qker7/trying_to_get_my_life_moving_where_i_want_and_my/,11,"Jobhunting is really soulsucking and depressing.

422,fb9i5l,False,,4,The fear of getting fired,whatsbotheringyou,"I work a (shitty I guess in terms of pay and overall feel but not shitty because of the people/management) fast food job while juggling school. Work at a mall and hopped from one food place to another (whole different story). This one is infinitely better than the previous one. 

Couple of weeks ago, for the first time since I’ve gotten cashier experience, the cash register came up short 40 dollars. Don’t know how the hell it happened and it petrified me. Don’t know what happened but knew it was my fault 100% because I’m the only other employee there. Just 3 people total work there . They were, as expected, super cool about it. I offered to pay them back and they said no but I was ultimately stubborn and they took it.

This past Sunday was a shit show. It was short again. Don’t recall the amount that was said first because I think the owner said he forgot to put my tips of the day into consideration, but the end result ended up 5 dollars. Still just let them keep my tips (I insisted because they’re genuinely good people and it’s fine if I had fucked up) and like last time, came up with the 5. Doesn’t stop there though. To add a cherry on this shit Sunday, it was discovered that I knew the admin/owner/manager login to the register.

*No*, not for any scandalous reasons, I swear. Not like I can steal money knowing their login or edit transaction amounts. I knew it as to keep track of my credit card tips (I can see from my end when I get a tip and how much but not the total amount of tips I received) and to check the cash flow/how much is supposed to be in the register since in my end, I can’t see it. The first situation scared me shitless and I wanted to myself see where it was at and count it when I could. I also don’t have keys or anything to open the register, owner does. The only time the register is open is when I have a cash transaction. I was in lunch that day and noticed both of the owners (it’s a couple - that’s the “3 of us” part of this post) were outside and looking at the cash register screen. This is unusual because one of them is always outside to be out front and the other is in the kitchen. When it’s me out front, both are inside, doing everything inside the kitchen - prepping, cooking, washing dishes etc. Because of this, a bad feeling immediately washed over me and I feared I was short again, which would be confirmed true as I stated earlier. Once back from my lunch, I was going to see the cash flow and count to make sure it was all in there the next time I had a cash transaction. The login didn’t work anymore. They didn’t wait a day to change it or even confront me about it. They have had to see me login when I wasn’t looking because it was working fine right before my lunch and they were both out there. There’s literally no other reason as to randomly changing the login unless they somehow caught me logging in. Nothing was said to me and all resumed “normal”. 

It’s nothing major but it eats at me because I can only imagine how I must look to them now. Not only is the register short *again* but I knew their login? It eats at me because they’re good people. They’re nice. It’s a small business which is why the employee situation is the way it is and why I 100% wanted to give whatever money was gone, back. I only work two days (already have another job lined up to start in may so either way I’m leaving this place regardless but again, cannot stress how good people they are) so tomorrow is when I’ll finally show face again after all this. Nothing was said about firing or the login thing and the owner even said he’ll see me tomorrow at the same time when I was leaving. I’m just expecting the worst I guess and would hate to be fired when I hardly have anything to my name at the moment and am counting on this job to keep me afloat until at least May. My mind has been going mental gymnastics regarding the whole thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/fb9i5l/the_fear_of_getting_fired/,14,"Haha I can tell!

I can imagine it must be pretty stressful for you, sorry to hear that, but ultimately you have little ability to influence the situation - it is what it is, which I know is absolutely not helpful at all, unless acceptance that it may happen brings you some level of peace/reduces some stress.

I imagine you’re already doing this after the first time but try and check yourself if you find you’re being complacent with counting what you receive and give back as change, I get complacent all the time in some things and have to check myself. If no one took the money the only way it doesn’t balance is a systems issue or counting issue when receiving cash and giving change.

875,48vj2x,False,,1,I doubt myself too much.,whatsbotheringyou,"Hi.

I'm not sure if anyone else has ever felt this feeling but I suppose it has to do something with my low self esteem. For some reason I can't help but feel insecure about my relationships with my friends. I find myself doubting why people want to associate with me. Probably because I've been alone for such a long time, growing up, that I'm not used to this or perhaps it's because I don't understand, but..

I doubt myself at every turn. I don't want to. I want to believe that people want to hang out with me, but there's that voice in the back of my head that keeps going ""Why?"". I don't think I'm fun, in fact I think I'm rather cringey. I think I'm annoying.

I don't know, it's depressing me lately and I'd love to just believe but for some reason I can't.

It's tearing me up inside. Worse off, at the end of the day I feel like I'm not even needed.

I'm really not. I'm just a placeholder until people get bored. I fail to be interesting or show any knowledge of anything other than video games. I have a hard time picking up on things and am very slow mentally entirely. It's hard to not think that people are just being with me out of pity.

It hurts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/48vj2x/i_doubt_myself_too_much/,10,"You're totally fine the way you are! And even if your self esteem seems to be crushing you right now just know that other people seem to genuinely like to be around you. That's judging from the way you describe yourself, when you haven't said anything that makes me think that the reaction is coming from others. 


You'll get through it. You'll find friends and realize that they do care about you. You may already have those friends, but aren't admitting it to yourself. So, I hate to say it, but you'll likely feel bad for a while if that doubt isn't going away or seems to be getting worse, but hang in there and have as good of a time as you can. You'll definitely find a place to be happy. 


This is especially true if you're in high school or earlier. We're all cringey, even through college and beyond. The only difference is that some people know how to own that cringey-ness. So don't worry, be yourself, and enjoy the times you can! If you're feeling depressed when you're alone with your thoughts, but you tend to forget about it with your friends, then I think you're perfectly normal and liked, but may need to get deeper with your friends sometime to recognize that they appreciate you. If you're feeling bad all the time then I would still recommend talking to someone close, but don't be afraid to try exercising, getting into reading or movies, or anything else that will make you healthier mentally and physically. 


So, just to summarize, have healthy and deep relationships, be healthy, and be busy. Above all, remember that everything you're feeling happens to everyone else too, and it gets to some more than others. To me it sounds like you're a great person, but it's going to take you to convince yourself.  So feel better, we're all wishing the best for you.  ",2016-03-04 03:13:25

We had been a long distance all throughout highschool and she moved in with me while we went to college. I thought I was going to spend my life with this girl. But apparently she needed independence, and to grow, and to hang out(and fool around) with a guy who has a car. 

I don't know what to do. I helped her through so much. I saved her life. We were going to grow old together. I had my problems, I'm a bit of an introvert, and I spent most of high school at home, talking with her(lest she get upset) and didn't really learn how to fun outside easily. She had her problems, such as huge jealousy issues(which I overlooked) and anxiety

she still treats me the same(except in public, which I'm not allowed to show her any sort of romantic affection, but that fucking ass hat is), seems to be hurt that i'm hurting so much,
but that doesn't really change her plans much(aka hang out
with this fuckwit as much as she can)

i'm so broken, i don't know what to do, she was everything to me, she tells me I need a ""life"" outside her but I did have one, how is that supposed to change how crippling this is to me? i live with her
so i can't avoid her, when i'm away from her i break down, i've missed class because I can't get myself out of bed in the morning,
i've broken down at least once a day, i'm still a total sucker for her
and baby her when she's at home because I'm a fucking dope, right?

i'm so lost. i've tried to start improving myself(finally getting my license, which is due to insurance issues more than lack of want; and starting to diet and work out), do more things with her, but I
thought she'd understand that with my full time schooling(i'm at school 75% of the week) it's hard for me, especially with our conflicting schedules

I'm just, so so lost, i can't enjoy anything, i enjoyed breaking bad,
but i'm all caught up and there's nothing to see until sunday, I'm an absolute wreck, i can't even tell my mom, because I made promises to my ex that when she moved in with me that i'd make sure if we broke up her housing wouldn't be compromised because of it, and i know if my mom knew her rent would be jacked up, and the whole house would be tense, etc.

i'm just stuck. and it's impossible. i don't think i'd ever find
a girl i felt so perfect with, and i'm stuck like this in a nightmare
that I never wake up from, just resume the next day

He was awesome and saved me but sacrificing a 7 year friendship, long story, don't hate him.).

Shortly, after and right before the break up I didn't want to tell people about the troubles we had because I knew I'd only be telling one side and that people would give me bad advice because I could only tell one side. I BELIEVED I DESERVED IT. 

Sure, I was a bitch sometimes, I'd withheld sex a few times (I regret that), would become overly jealous occasionally. I learned from a therapist later that he was manipulating me into doing those things and behaving that way so he could he justifie his 'punishing' me. 

**REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE DONE IN THE RELATIONSHIP GET THE FUCK OUT.**

Seriously. You are too close to the fire to have a clear head. Walk away for a while, move out. Go live by yourself of with a friend, or a parent. Remove contact for a while and re-eval your life.

You are awesome, you do not need someone who is abusing you like this to make you happy. be selfish for a little while and do something that you've wanted to do that she wouldn't let you. reconnect with some old friends. Please, at the very least get out of there.

I am typically a very placid person and not aggressive at all, so when I was at a club on the Gold Coast of Australia and was ""king hit"" from behind for no known reason I just couldn't believe it had happened.
I didn't know the guy, speak 2 words to him or anything so when the police asked why he did it I couldn't give them an answer.
He fractured my jaw and smashed 3 of my teeth with over 10k worth of dental work I have to pay for (which I can't afford).

I struggle to befriend new people because I do not connect with them on an emotional level. People think I am cool initially but they never find me all that memorable. I really want to change that but I don't know how...

I feel like it is telling stories about myself when they are related to whatever we are talking about. But also I am just trying to find my emotional motivation behind things that basically make up my life. I imagine it is important for when people ask what major I am or why I chose to join the Air Force. And I just have no idea what my emotions are behind them. I started writing down what I believe my emotional reasoning/motivation behind what I do and I showed it to my friend and he told me ""You're kidding yourself with some of the stuff you said"" so I guess I don't know what my emotions are behind them- if I even have any. 

So as you can see I am a very logical person. Everything I do in my mind is just because of logic. It just makes sense for me to be an engineer and it just makes sense for me to be in the AF but I mean...at some point it must've started from an emotion even though of course both of those things will lead me to success in character and money-wise. Maybe I just need to evaluate what my goals are in life first?

Just a side note: I am a 20 year old engineering student in AFROTC who was put on zoloft about 6 weeks ago due to depression and anxiety. Although I am starting to think that zoloft is not the answer. I feel like I have difficulty concentrating and finding motivation and such because I have low dopamine, not serotonin.

Since you suffer from depression and anxiety, it would be a good uneducated guess that those conditions contribute greatly to your plight. Depression and anxiety can often cause people to ""disconnect"" from themselves and others. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia ) would be an interesting wiki page for you to check out. Part of solving this problem is relaxing. Almost laughable to tell someone with an anxiety disorder to relax, but unfortunately it's true. I also struggle with extreme depression and anxiety and it didn't get better for me until I started to ~breathe~. Just calm down. Don't force it. Don't let people's expectations of your emotions make you feel like you're lacking. Emotions are fluid, impermanent things and you can't feel them if you always fill yourself up with worry. It's taken me years to see little bits of progress (because I've done this on my own), but if you talk to your doctor and ask him for help or a referral to a therapist I bet you'll have more luck than me. There is no overnight or easy fix, but you *can* do it and it's not *as* hard as it seems.

Anyways, we went to the yearly county fair yesterday, I invited my best friend and her husband so they can finally meet this guy I couldn't seem to shut up about. Lets call him Jim. 

We're having a blast the entire day, then we all start getting hungry. Usually at county fairs here where I live, all the food is deep fried. I'm talking ""death on a deepfried stick"" ranging from deep-fried sticks of butter to Klondike bars deep fried with added whip cream & a cherry on top. He gets a donut covered 2-patty with 2-cheese burger. I go with the traditional mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwhich. My friend and her husband get their own food. I'm enjoying this cheesy heaven melt in my mouth when out of no where, Jim's hands is in my dish. I look at his plate and its gone... WE LITERALLY BOUGHT THE FOOD 3 MINUTES AGO.

At first I didn't mind because he took the side dish of my main meal. So I let it slide... but he kept eating it, and eating it, until there were no more sides left. I'm almost thinking in my head *this fuck-tard better not ask me for the rest of my heavenly cheese sandwich*... but he does... 

""You're not going to give me a bite?""
""No, you ate all of yours and my chips"" 
""really? But it looks so good""
""I know it does, which is why I bought it. Not my fault you ate yours so quick""
""well fine""

And I finished my orgasmic cheesy filled sammich. Out of the corner of my eye I see him, in shock. After last night, I am NEVER going out with him again.

I just moved back to my apartment from visiting home because my first day of my senior year of college starts in the morning. I was reluctant to leave because I kept having this funny feeling about going back. 

Since I got here several hours ago I keep crying because I’m so homesick and sad and I just want to go home more than anything. I miss my parents and my boyfriend so much and it really hurts. 

I’m scheduled for 35 hours at work this week which is going to put me behind on school work already on the first week of class. On top of that I don’t think I’m going to be able to keep up with my hectic schedule this semester. 

Feeling so sad and overwhelmed before school even starts gives me a bad feeling. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety problems before and I’m afraid this is the start of falling back into it which worries me. 

Despite how I feel it doesn’t seem like I can do anything about it since the semester is already paid for and my lease would still need be paid regardless of whether or not I moved home. I’m not even sure I’d be much happier moving home since living with my parents has its challenges. 

I guess the point of writing this was to get off my chest how unhappy I feel and to just acknowledge the fact that I have no clue what to do.

I still love her way too much, even after realizing that she was basically cheating on me (emotionally) with this guy for the last 1 1/2 months of our relationship. Even knowing that, I can't seem to let her go or move on from it. I haven't had any contact with her for 2 months now, and have deleted her #, texts, pictures, etc. I even deleted her off facebook almost immediately, but curiosity still gets the best of me every few weeks and I check out her page which has some stuff open to public view - that's how I'm seeing these pictures of the two of them together.

Anyway, there's a TON more to go along with all of that, but basically it has led me into a horrible spiral of depression that I can't claw my way out of no matter how hard I try. Some days are good, some bad, but it seems like there are WAYYYY more bad/""blah"" days than there are mediocre or ok days.

The worst part about it is that he lives halfway across the country (about 600 miles) from her (us), and she is somehow finding tons of time to go visit him (2 week trip this last time from what I heard), whereas she could hardly ever spend time with me when we were together.

351,1nf2ot,False,,6,My ex is back in my life...,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry for the long post... trying to summarize the best I can. 

One year ago I met this guy one night and we immediately hit it off. It started as a hook up and we just couldn't stay away from each other after that. About a month later I went 8 hours away to college. We Skyped every night and became really close and were dating, even though it was never official because he had some issues caused by his last relationship that he couldn't get over. 

Anyway, things ended around Christmas in a huge fight and we went 6 months without talking. In the mean time, I dated one guy for a short time and am now dating another man. Me and my current bf, have been dating for 3 months and are very hopeful for a long future together. 

Here's the problem: My ex is now back in my life. He's been here for a few months but we are just now starting to really talk again and it's so nice. He's opening up more than he did and we joke about the past. He's told me that he misses me and regrets some of the choices that were made. And I'm caught because he was the first guy I've had a fire for, and it never really died. But I don't know if it's because I still love him or because he was the best sex I've ever had and I'm dying to have that again.

Not that my current love life isn't good but it's just... my ex does this thing to me. I don't want to lose him out of my life again and I really do enjoy having him around but he's making me double think my current relationship, especially if I even love him because there isn't the same flame. I know it's stupid but I so desperately want one more night with my ex, but i'm sure that would just turn into one more and one more. 

It's basically how I'm living my entire life. Unpaid internship vs. paying job, college vs. traveling... it's all about planning for the future. I want the instant gratification of having my ex back now, but I just know that it could never work out between us. We want different things and we are different people. And my bf is the future, I can see myself with him in a long time, we get along and have similar values and want the same things. 

I'm just sad and torn because on the one hand, I really want to try again with my ex even though I know it wont' work. I just want him back. But at the same time, I can't think about giving up my current bf.

755,2jyptw,False,,3,"I messed up with a girl, everyone tells me to move on even though it's my fault...",whatsbotheringyou,"So started hanging out with this girl.

We clicked at an extrinsic level at the very least. All the same interests and similar personalities. 

Hooked up after a ball I invited her to. Got her sick. She's incredibly busy but she agreed to clear her entire day one day so we could hang out all day. But she got mad at me for getting her sick/was resting so that was scrapped. 

I was somewhat annoyed and went out to a party and ended up hooking up with a random girl. She gave me a hickey.

Next day I see my girl and she sees the hickey. She texts me later asking about it and I just fudge around with her about it because she said it is no big deal.

So I keep inviting her to hang out and she keeps on flaking or saying she can't. 

Finally after telling her I like her for her personality etc. etc. (like after a month of flakes) she FINALLY gives me the time of day and we hang out for an hour or so. 

At this point it is finals time and we try but fail to hang out. 

Over the summer we text some and we both like adventure so we agree on me driving all the way to her house, 2 hours away, sneaking into her house on a Thursday. (Her family was going to be gone the next morning, for the weekend)

So we do that, smoke weed the next morning, and end up hooking up some. I get her out of her shirt/bra and start fingering her but she starts giving all these reasons why we shouldn't go further. So after some persistence, I give up and the day goes on rather normally. We hangout with her friends and they all did crazy ass drugs while I drove 'em around. 

Then around 9 PM she goes across her yard and starts talking with a couple of her girl friends...next thing I know she tells me she doesn't feel comfortable staying with me the weekend and is going to sleep at her friend's house...she says I didn't cross any boundaries with the hooking up and she just realized that she didn't feel comfortable spending the entire weekend with someone she doesn't know really, really well...

I act calm and collected and actually stick around for a bit before she brings up that she is surprised I stuck around and a switch flipped in me and I basically said ""you know what, I should leave."" and leave. She is saying sorry and all this crap whilst this is going on and I just say ""actions speak louder than words"" and she leaves me in my car in the garage all upset. 

She texts me apologizing again. I don't answer her for a week or so before deciding that maybe I was also in the wrong. We had only hung out 10 times and considering the sluttiness I already exuded she probably felt like I was just another conquest to her and she herself felt like a slut. 

So in comes the next semester. She flakes or can't hang out with me again and again and again. I finally tell her I like her and all but if she isn't going to make the time for me to hang out or if she doesn't even like me then don't even bother texting me. 

So she says she'll make time. We hang out. Everything seems pretty good in our little world.

Eventually things go to shit as they always do. She was telling me how she was on tinder just for when she was bored to talk to guys so I felt no problem going on tinder too. She texts me saying her friend saw me on tinder and she was happy to be in one of my pictures...so I just say how I don't want to be on tinder and that's because I like you but I never see you. She goes on to say she doesn't wanna lead me on and she isn't sure whether she likes me and thinks she would by now and all this bullshit. I couldn't believe it. So I get all sappy and smooth and try to get her to give me one more chance and that I know she liked me in the past and needs to look past the whole hickey issue and all because we clicked in the past. She ignores all of my emotional opening up just to say ""hahaha ___"" ___ being some random anecdote I mentioned in my text. 

I don't text shit after that. 

Then I bought pot brownies from a guy she knows about a week later and for whatever reason she decides she needs to text me to let me know to only take half a brownie because they are really strong. I ignore of course.

And she has been snapchatting me ever since. Everyday. 

So I feel like shit and can't get her off my mind. I feel like I fucked up by making her feel like a slut and she also probably associates me with bad feelings because she decided to kick me out of her house (she said that was the worst thing she has ever done to anyone...). 

But things are more complicated than that as it doesn't even make sense that she was mad at me for the hickey crap...she was actively hooking up with a dude whom she apparently ""really liked""...though I do imagine she means moreso the way I treated the situation by fudging around/beating around the bush. 

So I don't know. I want her bad. I find her adorable...we click at an extrinsic level...I feel like we'd have a good thing going if she ever gave me a real chance. But maybe she is a bitch like all my friends, guys and girls, say and I should just move on...but my heart doesn't want me to. 

Thank you for reading and even more so if you let me know wat do. 

My birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks so what I THINK I should do is just see what she does...I am hoping she texts me and I can then say ""we should talk in person"" and mention that I am frustrated that she's overlooking the great times we had before the hickey incident and that I am upset at myself for being such a jerkoff and I acknowledge that my actions made her feel like a slut and a dirtbag. But if she gave me that day she promised me way back when, I'd charm the hell out of her, with pizza.

799,1rlcm8,False,,6,"My studies bore me, the girl I love lives thousands of miles away and I dont really know what I want",whatsbotheringyou,"Hey folks, let me introduce myself first:

I'm a 17 year old aerospace engineering student from Germany. Although the following will sound cheesy as fuck (I know it is) bare with me:

About 2 months ago I met a girl on omegle and we've been talking twice a day for almost all the time now. A few weeks ago I confessed that I kinda like her (a bit more than that) and she admitted the same. To make it short: we basically confessed that we love each other. Whenever I'm talking with her I'm feeling great but lately it's starting to fill me with sadness because everytime we talk I realise that chances are that I'll never see her in person. It's gotten so far that it actually keeps me down for an entire weekend. 

Furthermore I've found out that aerospace engineering isn't what I really want to do and despite already having an alternative plan what to do, a friend of mine recently gave me the idea of maybe going to the US to study. But because tution fees are very high I've been looking for a scholarship online and haven't found one that's either realistic or relevant yet. I'm kind of afraid that our 'relationship' or whatever we have there will slowly but steadily fall apart. Obviously I don't want that to happen but I don't know how to prevent it either. I know it might just be stupid teenager love (and it probably is) but it still bothers me. 

I also don't know whether I should just accept my fate or try my hardest to travel to the US or maybe look to study in the US. 

By the way, on the last topic: does anyone know of scholarships for foreign students that can't afford to pay (the entire) tution fees?

Distance especially is tough, if the two of you really care about each other and are both willing to put the effort into it, then go for it.

Could it be because I speak too much? Sometimes I feel like that must hinder myself because it ends up making me look silly. I'll say something that is self-deprecating, for example. Which I don't mind because I like to make people happy. But perhaps that is the problem. Maybe they don't respect me and such. 

I imagine if I am leaving everything out there with girls that isn't good either. Sure I know everyone which they must be attracted to but I feel like if I say the occasional dumb thing or use self-deprecating humor they'll be less likely to be interested. 

Maybe it also stops people from taking me seriously. I imagine that makes it bad for myself. I have a very serious side to myself, but I only show it when a person needs advice or on an intellectual topic. So perhaps people just never bring that stuff up to me, which makes up half of a relationship with a human being and thus it makes us less than friends.

So he's in constant pain and the doctors won't give him pain medication. He also can't afford to go to a doctor on his own and only goes when the state or his old job or whatever is paying for it (I have no idea how the whole American medical/workman's comp/injury at work situation works).

Anyway, a couple of months ago I guess one of his buddies gave him some heroin and he's been smoking it for the pain. He only told me about it a few weeks ago and has several times expressed a desire to go to rehab and get off of it, and mentioned how much he hates it and hates being addicted. I told him to talk to one of my friends who was in rehab recently for the same thing and he refused, saying he doesn't want anyone to know. In fact, he swore me to secrecy when he told me about it.

I don't know what to do. Our parents don't have any money so they wouldn't be able to help him even if they did know. I have no idea who his current circle of friends is so I can't even contact any of them to ask if they've seen him. Our mom said she talked to him on Tuesday. 

Also, his girlfriend broke up with him last week and told him she had been seeing someone else the entire time (it was only a few months I think, but still), so I know he's been depressed about that. I really don't know how I can help him. I'm all the way on the other side of the country and I'm in the military, so I can't just drop everything and go home to look for him. I don't want to send him any money because he'll probably just use it to buy drugs, and I don't really have money to just be throwing away at him. I've already loaned him way too much money (that I'll probably never see back) over the past ten years.

And I just got an e-mail from my mom saying that he got a letter saying he was turned down for some sort of treatment for his back, so that's just another turd on top of the shit heap that is his life lately.

Remember that at this point he isn't family because he would do anything for drugs. All he cares about is herion. Try and get him to go to NA or a similar group and you should go to a group for people who have family members that are drug addicts. It will help you a lot. ,2013-09-26 20:17:07

217,1p64ux,False,,23,"My parents took $8,000 from me.",whatsbotheringyou,"I'll try to keep this a little brief.

I'm a sophomore in college. My grandma on my dad's side gave my 2 younger sisters and myself $8,000 each in trust funds when we were very young.

Last year, I commuted between campus and my parents house. Because of this, I agreed with my parents that using *some* of that money, and not *all* of that money for a car would be the best option.

I felt like saving money in that fund for emergencies like rising tuition or car problems/insurance was a great idea, and it would give me a cushion if I needed it.

My father took all $8,000 and bought a truck, without consulting me. I never drove that truck when I was home, in fact I was banned from it. Instead I drove the family Crown Vic.

Now I'm an RA on campus. In order to continue to pay for tuition here (it's a private school) I have to keep another off campus job. This new job is about 15 minutes or so away. 

Tomorrow is my first day at this job. I wasn't able to find a ride with our on campus shuttle to get there, so I decided to call home and ask for a ride. I felt that was logical, because my sister was available for said ride, and wanted to give it to me. So I set up plans with her for that

My mother called me on the phone, was very angry that I would ""have such guts"" to ask for a ride to my job when I should be able to find rides. ""It wasn't in our agreement""

I was also told by my father that our shuttle service runs *until* noon on weekends. It in fact *doesn't* run before noon.

What would you suggest I'd do in this situation?


Longer than I thought, but 
**TL;DR My parents took $8000 to buy a car I never drove, now I don't even have any car and I'm still short a lot of money for college**",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1p64ux/my_parents_took_8000_from_me/,21,"It doesn't matter whether you need a car or not. That's really not the issue here, they're just bringing it up to distract you from the fact that they took $8000 that your grandma gave you and spent it. 

Definitely contact your grandma about this if you haven't yet. I know everyone says 'sue them' but well, it's not always that easy with family. Call your grandma and tell her you're in a bunch of trouble, you're short a lot of money for your college, your parents took what she gave you and now won't even give you a ride to work. Don't be afraid to exaggerate the whole thing; just make sure you get your point across and she's bound to put some pressure on your parents. I strongly suspect that the amount of money you're going to get back or whether they're going to give you the car depends on how distressed you will come across to your grandma. 

As for your parents, as long as you don't get anything from them, start showing them exactly how much you resent them for taking your money. Make it a big deal, because currently, they're obviously not taking you seriously. Whenever they ask you to do them a favor, tell them exactly why you're not going to do it. If mom says anything about 'your agreement' again, tell her that they broke that agreement when they stole your money. Hell, break any rules of 'your agreement' until you see the money or the car. You screwed things up the second your father showed up with the truck you didn't agree on buying, and you didn't challenge him about it. You made matters worse when you let them forbid you from driving the car they bought with your money. Because of that, they don't see you as someone they should take into account; they got used to the fact that you'll more or less swallow whatever they do to you. To battle that, you have to become enough of a nuisance that it will be easier for them to give you your money back than to deal with you.

Warning: this is a nasty way to do things. I do it sometimes with my family when they get manipulative with me, and while it does work, I feel like a horrible person for doing it. I know it's their own damn fault for trying to use me, but I really dislike being nasty to people. If you're not willing to go through with this, you might as well not start, because if you give up in the middle, they'll just use this 'bad behavior' of yours as an excuse to do things their way.

949,1na33p,False,,13,Long term girlfriend and I are having serious problems at the same time someone I'm interested in has become available,whatsbotheringyou,"I am very confused right now and I just feel like I need to get it all out. I made a post a few days ago that my girlfriend was unsure if we should be together anymore, now another big complication has arisen.

My girlfriend and I have been together for several years, and through that time we have seen our ups and downs. We live together and have been building a life together and we have very similar interests and we both care about each other. We get along fine most of the time, but that ""spark"" has diminished a great deal. She doesnt feel like I am passionate about her and I dont fulfill her romantic needs, while I dont feel satisfied sexually and havent for some time. We have talked about marriage several times, but always in a ""someday"" context. 

A few months ago, I became very close with a female coworker of mine at another job. Over the course of a few months we became very good friends and texted each other constantly, mostly about mundane things but overall we had a great time together and enjoyed each other's company. Nothing explicitly inappropriate happened, but it made my girlfriend uncomfortable that we got so close. There was definitely some mutual attraction between the two of us, but she was in a long term relationship as well and there was never any chance of anything happening. I feel guilty even typing this, that there were times when I wished things had turned out differently - if we had met under different circumstances maybe we could have given it a shot. But I never pursued it, and I never made any steps to cheat, at least not in a physical way.

I came to realize after a certain point that part of why I connected with her so much was I liked how she made me feel - she thought I was smart and funny and made me feel confident in ways that I hadnt felt with my girlfriend in months, maybe even years. I had this emotional relationship with her that I was using to supplement how lacking my own one felt was at home. I realized this after a blowout with my girlfriend, and decided to try and cut ties and salvage my relationship. That happened about a month and a half ago.

Recently, my girlfriend went to a wedding and seeing the other couples there made her start to seriously question if we were right together. She is afraid that we are together now out of comfort and habit more than anything. We got together in college and we have both changed so much since then, she feels like maybe we just grew apart. She is worried that we are going to end up being just good friends who live together, rather than two people in love. I still love her and care about her deeply, but I have had the same fears at times. Sometimes I feel like she just isnt happy with the person I am naturally and wants me to change to fit her needs. I've been trying to reassure her and show her that we can make it work, that the things we have gone through are natural and happen in all relationships and that we can fix things if we work really hard. But honestly, I dont know if thats true because I haven't dated that many people and I dont have enough context to be sure.

I just found out that the other girl, who I felt so connected to, recently broke up with her long term boyfriend as well. I feel like this just adds another huge layer of complication to what I was already going through. If I broke up with my girlfriend now it would be a huge, painful, complicated mess, but I would be free to pursue this other person who I feel strong chemistry and attraction towards. Sometimes I feel like my current girlfriend likes me for who I was and who she thinks I have the potential to be, whereas this girl likes the person who I am now. But maybe thats just because things are fresh and new and I had used them as an escape from my problems.

I'm not planning on breaking it off with my girlfriend anytime soon because we have invested so much time and effort into being together, but I cant help but wonder if we are just forcing it when we could be happier with other people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1na33p/long_term_girlfriend_and_i_are_having_serious/,12,"Both you and your girlfriend have zero faith in the relationship, why are you still together?

Almost all of my friends go to a very different school and I talk to them maybe once per month at best.

I have known this one girl for less than three years through work and for a substantial portion of this time we were great friends.  I grew feelings for her early on, but did not press on anything due to our work relationship.  We spent a significant amount of time together inside and outside of work and I definitely felt like an emotional support for her.  She knew I was there for her and we enjoyed spending time together.  

I think she knew I liked her, but I just kept it moving forward as it was until I eventually brought up how I felt about her and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship at this time, but she should be dating someone like me.  However, even though she said these things to me she started having sex with another guy and she knew this hurt me and actually apologized, but continued to fool around with him anyways.  I should have moved on at this point looking back at it, but I continued to remain friends even though I still had feelings for her. 

We stayed pretty close and people regularly thought we were dating.  I felt as though our relationship was more than just friends, because it felt like and we would treat each other like we were a couple.  However, we never kissed or went any further than a hug.  She was always very open, comfortable, and giving me her attention when we were alone, but when we were out with a group she was regularly very cold towards me and almost ignoring my presence.  Even though this was the case, she would always end up reaching back out to me after whatever social event.

I eventually wanted to know where this was going, because I felt as though I was being put on the backburner or she was getting the benefits of a boyfriend without being in a relationship with me.  I had a talk with her and all she apologized and said she felt terrible, but wanted me to move on.

I still see her, but I don’t know how to act at this point.  This really has me torn up inside and I’m sure she can sense that, because I have not been spending much time with her over the past few months and have kept the communication to a minimum.  Also, we do not talk as frequently, because I have been only letting her initiate the communication, but it still seems she wants to be friends or at least hang out.  I have not been rude to her and have been polite when we talk, but I keep short and to a minimum.  I feel as though I haven’t moved on yet, but she continues to reach out to me.  When she does speak with me now, she seems a lot nicer to me than she has in the past, but now I am the one acting cold.

Ultimately, I want her to be happy and she knows this, even if she is not with me.  But, I am too unhappy remaining friends with her at this point when I still have feelings for her.  The rejection stings too much right now.

TL,DR; A good friend I have feelings for told me to move on, so I have distanced myself and don’t communicate with her as much.  However, she keeps communicating with me and will ask me to hang out.  I still have feelings for her, but being around her reminds me of the rejection.

171,2rxohw,False,,3,My friend just beat the shit out of this guy,whatsbotheringyou,"He just told me that it happened earlier today. 

It's his birthday. He went to the mall with his girlfriend. He tells me it was great. I ask, ""Yeah? Did you get any action?"" He says, ""No, I got to beat the shit out of my girlfriend's stalker."" Pause. ""What?""


He tells me that there's this guy who's ""been texting her"" and ""making her cry"" as of late. Apparently, he broke his nose and knocked a few teeth out. I ask how the fuck that ended up happening, and he tells me that his girl and him planned it. Pause. ""WHAT?"" He tells me he went to the mall, had his girl text this guy and have him ""meet her"" there. ""The rest is history,"" he says. 


Bewilderment is my initial reaction. Why? Because someone got their face smashed in for one. Why should that matter to me? Here's my worry: she fucking loved it. She probably suggested the idea. She probably told him, stop, he's had enough, please, stop...and relished the whole thing. 


My friend, he's very susceptible to control. If he says he likes cars, and I say I don't like cars, he'll reassure me that cars aren't all that great. 


When he tells me about this girl, I remember the little things. Things they do together, things that are always her idea. I'm worried about him. If what he did, he really did over some guy who apparently texted his girlfriend, then he does not have an breezy future with her.

I got out of my poor living situation.  I thought this would help greatly but it's the same problems, just better scenery.  I got a job I like over the summer, it helped greatly as it distracted me from my problems, but I don't have the time to work during the school term.

Some problems I've tried to fix, but they keep persisting.  I have no friends, so I tried to put myself out there.  I joined a couple clubs on campus, and went to some social groups organized over meetup.  I had a good time and met some people, but after a few months of this I've only managed to make more acquaintances.  I've tried talking to a school counselor, but I can only see him every 7 weeks because there's so much demand.  He recommended I see a therapist but it costs more than I can afford on a student budget.

Good job! 

Okay, let's get to the critical point of the situation. I do understand that you are invested in clubs, which is good! One thing I may ask though, is that do you actually enjoy this club? I personally am also in college, and though I was intimidated to join certain clubs, due to ""social stigmas"" that people may have had towards me, I joined them anyways. My primary example towards this would be joining the eSports club here on campus (specifically League of Legends). Here I was able to meet some people that had more ""personal"" common characteristics that I had. Furthermore, no one ever gave me crap about the clubs I joined. 

The people I met were similar to myself in many aspects, and the gaming in teams is a good break to the constant workload that I receive. Whether it be an Anime Club, eSports club, brony club, or basket weaving club, make sure that you choose something you are PASSIONATE about. 

Finally, I'm gonna tell you this. **Everything is mindset** If you don't believe you can be fixed, no one can help you. That may sound harsh, but it makes sense. I can't make you think one way, because ultimately, you are a unique, special person. However, fixing that mindset, and opening up yourself to opportunities that the world has to offer, believing that there is more to just trying to fix the unfixable, and dealing with the beautiful idiosyncrasies that life throws at you can really change the way one can see everything. 

The journey won't occur overnight, at least mine didn't. Give yourself some time, get yourself out there, and little by little, you'll notice things that aren't there, but are. These things are the little things that keep us going.

(that I never really enjoyed) I play the alto sax, am good at playing it, reading the music, but am not really all that good theory. 

Other the summer I got a job working at a factory and my father holds a high level position there so I was able to have some time doing maintenance work even though it was not what I signed up for. I enjoyed it. A lot. And there are far more jobs for this than in Music.

I'm thinking of switching because I don't want to sink tens of thousands of dollars into university were I would most likely hate the courses, sitting there listen to a prof ramble on for hours on music theory etc, when I can go to college, learn a trade which I like doing, hopefully find a good job somewhere and live comfortably.

I go in thinking this is just routine with me having been ill etc, only to find out I should have been locked in my house the moment lock down was announced as I take two different Corticosteroid based medications.

GP has advised me that I have next to no immune system due to the medication I am on, and as one of them is for my lungs, I would end up critically ill if I contracted covid.

55,gv23ha,False,,1,Racism. My Thoughts. Discussion?,whatsbotheringyou,"This post represents what I think about what's currently happening in my country today. In it, I share my first experience with racism and the biggest lie about racism that's still being told now. It is a post that I wrote out of frustration, disgust, and fear. I wanted to share it here, to vent, but hopefully to start a discussion. 

Please mods, if it's not allowed, remove it. 

Currently, I'm a white woman living in the Deep South of the USA, what we call the Bible Belt. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, I've seen some of my (now *former*) friends and family members either try to justify, defend, and some outright agree with the racism that is happening in my country. I sent the contents of this post to them and asked if I was somehow misunderstanding what they were trying to say. Almost all of them replied and all of the replies broke my heart. After they so proudly defended their ignorance, I replied, ""As much as it pains me, I'm not comfortable remaining in touch with anyone whose values oppose mine so radically."" and I blocked them. 

I saw this put beautifully earlier and it's stuck with me: ""You cannot say 'All Lives Matter' until black lives do. 

The atrocities being heaped upon our black communities should make you sick. There should be crying, wailing, and gnashing of teeth at what we're hearing about right now. There is no justification or excuse for such heinous actions. 

Do you want to know what one of my very first memories is? As a kindergartener (age 5), I remember coming home from school and telling my (then)stepdad that I made a new friend: Stephen. Then, I said that me and Stephen were gonna get married. That's the first (but not last) time, I can remember being asked, ""What does Stephen look like? What color is he: does his skin look like yours or is it darker?"" I got my ass whooped for that one and told ""Not in my house"", but with the worst language you ever did say, much less direct at a 5 year old.

In sixth grade, my entire class was made to write an essay. ""My Eyes Don't See Color."" As I remember writing that essay, we were made to explain just how much we didn't notice the color of someone's skin. As 11 year olds, we were required to write a paper to show that 'racism no longer exists'. 

You cannot sit there and tell me that racism no longer exists. To have the nerve to think that we 'don't see color' and everyone is treated equally is demeaning, ignorant, and downright dangerous. The racism in this country has been shown to us, time and time again. Yet, time and time again, we turn a blind eye to their plight. 

We, as white people, need to do better. Stop and acknowledge our privilege. Realize that we did nothing to earn this privilege. Understand that our privilege comes at the detriment of others. That just because we live in a country that values our white skin tone above others, certain aspects of our lives have been made more simple.  

I refuse to stand by any longer. This injustice will not be tolerated. My outrage will not be silenced. I will fight alongside you for as long as it takes. I will use my privilege to instigate change, to bridge the gap of inequality between us.

Living in the south I have come to believe that the racism we see here comes from a deep rooted history of racism, but also from ignorance and lack of exposure and relationships to those on the other side. It is hard to be empathetic when you do not experience the strife and struggle of the other. In that way, I would also encourage that rather than blocking and cutting people out from your life, be a part of leading them out of ignorance. Continue to have challenging conversations and expose them to the things that they have been either deliberately or inadvertently blind to. I believe that the growing extremism between the ""right"" and ""left"" that we see across our country stems from both sides having decided to cut each other off and surrounding themselves with only those who think and believe in the same things. This has created an echo chamber where beliefs cannot be changed. I would encourage you to be a bridge to your fellow human who does not share the same beliefs as you and seek to understand why they believe what they do and work to show them that their beliefs are wrong and built on centuries of racism and prejudice. Don't let your anger and hatred at what they believe cloud the fact that they are human and they are capable of change.

850,bveqiv,False,,2,How can I accept the life that awaits me?,whatsbotheringyou,"This is gonna be awfully long, I understand if you don't want to read this. You can scroll ahead.

&#x200B;

I like to think I'm aware of what's waiting for me ahead. I'm 22, I dropped out of school, I've never worked and I've been isolating myself for the past 5 years... there's no way I'll have a decent life.

&#x200B;

I say isolate, but that's not entirely true.

&#x200B;

I live with my family and I don't have a room so I'm alone only in the bathroom. I even go outside with a friend, even if it is only 5 or 6 times a year, attend the local cosplay con once a year and go to my father's for some days twice a year.

&#x200B;

The fact is, I can't even show how I feel for one moment. I can't be honest with my family so I'm faking happiness, without even doing it right, and that's kinda tiring. 

I could be honest with my friend, but she has a lot of problem of her own so I don't wanna burden her with mine, she can't even help me so I'd just make her worry.

At the con and with my father is even worse. I don't really know how to approach people, so I kinda have created a fake personality to exhibit in such occasions, but people try to befriend me and I'm not strong enough to stop them so I just let myself be dragged... after the con reality hits back, I lose contact with those I met and feel incredibly shitty about myself as a result, thus my self hate keeps growing.

&#x200B;

As for my father, I've piled up a huge number of lies and the only way to not make everything crumble is to keep lying... I do feel bad doing it to my father but there's no way back, I even told him I graduated from high school! As things stand now, I can't go and casually say I've told him a bunch of bullshit for years and that my life is actually shit but I'm fully aware that one day everything will be destroyed...

&#x200B;

The solution to all my problems, even partly those with my father, is far too known to me: go out and work.

&#x200B;

Sadly in my country even to clean the stairs they want an high school degree, that cuts me off from about 90% of the jobs, and that's just the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

I'm paralized by fear, so there's no way I can just go out and work. I'm scared of changing the fragile balance that's created in my house and, since what I'm afraid the most is confrontation with other people, the only thought of doing something that's different from my usual routine terrifies me.

&#x200B;

The other problem I have is that I can't bear the thought of spending my life doing something I hate. I know I'll never have my dream job and that I'm far too miserable and ugly to find a lover, but if i leave those out what's left?

In the best case I'll get a job I'll hate that makes me scrape through life until retirement, when I'll be too tired and empty to do anything but wait for death quietly.

In the most realistic scenario I'm just gonna have to nurse my relatives all my life and live off their money like a parasyte.

&#x200B;

The fear problem is gonna solve itself, for better or worse, in a few months when I'll move in another city and my family will kick my ass towards employement, and since I'm a spineless coward, I'm gonna quietly obey.

The other one still remains though, how can I accept the shitty life that awaits me? I've already crushed my dream, suffocated my hopes and negated my wishes, but it worked only partly and didn't even resolve a thing, it just hurts a lot.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna ask all those of you that have experienced life more than me, is there a way to accept life? Am I just automatically stop thinking about it while working my ass off? Should I keep destroying myself by exposing me to all that stuff I've been avoiding because it hurts until I'm an empty shell? (By the way, the last one is what I'm currently doing)

&#x200B;

Before you reply therapy or something similar, that's not an option. That would man face my family and there's no way I can do it. Online therapy also isn't an option, as I said before I can't really hide stuff in my house, even for writing this I had to leave another browser page in background to switch to.

&#x200B;

If you fear I might commit suicide don't worry. I am depressed and suicidal, but I'm not gonna end my suffering to make more people suffer, I'd rather keep the pain for myself.

Thanks for staying with me for this gigantic rant, kudos for your patience.

To like football, to be a douchebag,  to placate others through soft emotion, to wear what you want, all of these things are subjective to YOU. Not requirements given by the title you believe you are. They are level and human qualities, not categorical stipulations.

Shit, I[M] love makeup. Did yall know it Makes you less ugly than you think you are? I was taken back, like ""you tellin' me I can look better but not look like a crossdresser or clown. What? That's ridiculous.""
So why do guys, who have figured out how to alleviate the beautification standards set by others around them get treated like they broke some unmentioned law of the universe.  Just because it is a predominantly female asset does not mean I am female, nor does it mean I wish to be one. I wish to be me...just better looking. 

The same for girls. You do what you like. Being a douche nozzle is not a selectively male trait. Choosing shorts and comics, over skirts and barbies does mean you should be a guy, nor be treated like one.
 It means you like what you like and do what you do because you like it. Save for those who have the chemical anomalies which make them  uncomfortable in their physical form, there is not a goddamn thing wrong with you in your own form.

What the fuck is acting like a dude or a girl anyway? 

Being an asshole means your an asshole, being tough is tough, having a soft heart means you have a soft heart. There is no ""acting"" like you completely replaced your reproductive organs for a few minutes as a spider landed on you.

485,1pjrdr,False,,9,I Don't Know if I Should Join this New Fraternity,whatsbotheringyou,"Hey all...so this has been bothering the absolute hell out of me. 

I don't think I am a big frat person but I feel like because it is a new fraternity, I can make it cater to the above average joe who doesn't wear boat shoes with a pink shirt everyday. I want to be in the most well respected fraternity if I join one. I want to have one that is full of gentlemen who know how to treat both guys and girls well. I don't care if the person has a differing personality or different values as long as they are selfless and respectful. 

So fraternity life probably isn't for me...but I like the networking, the brotherhood and the sorority girls. And if I can get rid of the things people hate about fraternities in this one, I think that'd be beneficial for myself and all. But that is a lot of work. I have to hope the other guys have similar views. 

The dudes in it vary. Most seem like your average joes, but there are some weirdos and perhaps a couple fratty dudes. That has turned me off because I don't want to be associated with weirdos and disrespectful lames. One dude of course said ""You're a fag"" while we were just walking away from a meeting to someone...and then seconds later a kid whom I know walked by and you guessed it, he is gay. I don't like that s%8t. I am all for morbid jokes about whatever if they are well done...but just calling someone ""gay"" or ""retarded"" etc. is just unnecessary and immature. Girls don't like that and most respectful people don't. 

But hopefully with the good guys in the fraternity and myself, we can make it a great place to be. 

So should I do it?

Some other things: I am in Air Force...so I feel like being a founding father wouldn't be as ""wowing"" on my resume once I get out...they'll just love I have actual leadership experience and actual engineering experience out in the field for the AF. 

It is also 744 the first semester...180 every semester afterwards.

I was also thinking maybe I should just join the school's engineering fraternity. It is more likely that I'll be able to network obviously, it'll be cheaper and lastly...access to past tests for all my hard classes! But obviously it will not be as fun...

I wish I had better friends so I didn't have to consider being in a fraternity really. But I just don't see how I can meet girls and friends in general without it. Let's be honest, it is unlikely I'd like the people in the video games club or the photography club. But I didn't meet friends freshman year that I really clicked with and I am an engineer.

Also, I don't really like partying all that much. I enjoy it if I know the people there...so going to house parties doesn't really work for me which is why a fraternity would be nice. I'd know all the guys and hopefully I'd know some of the girls beforehand.

I have just been so burnt out from all my decades of working, and finding incompetent companies, incompetent managers, and corrupt corporate culture, that I just don't trust myself to find a place to work, that won't be just like my worst nightmares.

I don't mind working, but at age 51, I don't want to go back and work for crap fast food, telemarketing, or programming jobs. Where the pay sucks, management incompetent or chaotic, treated like a cog where I don't matter.

I want to go back to college to study Economics and Politics, because I feel that inside my head is a few ideas and solutions to solve our massive incompetent and ineffective federal government. I won't talk politics here, just that I want to be a part of solving our national problems, even if in a small fashion.

I have this complex of wanting to make a difference in my life, because at age 5, I was told I could never have kids. 

So how else will I be remembered, If I don't leave a mark in some fashion?

I am interested in learning economics and politics, but today I took a math assessment test, which went fine, I passed, but didn't do great.

But in the experience of that, what such utter disorganization, miscommunication and chaos, reminds me why I hated my days at other colleges I've been to.

I am very cynical, but I've had many experiences that feed that cynicism. 

I have no friends, outside of my youngest brother, but he's married and he's expecting his first child. So he's pretty busy with his life.

I just want my own life.

My girlfriend, died about 2 years ago, My Cat died 5 years ago, I broke my right leg 3-4 years ago. 

But I am tired of being a victim and feeling like a victim, I want to be sure that I am taking the right path.

I am so afraid of making the wrong move, that sometimes I make no move.

The kind of person I want to be, is the kind that see's patterns, and provides tools and methods to solve our problems. 

I have zero interest in trying to persuade or sell or give speeches. I just want to help solve real problems.

For the former, try and pursue a passion and get involved with others. If you become involved in a group doing something you think is important, it may give you more of a purpose and improve your happiness.

For the latter, consider reading about [positive psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Personal_Finances) to learn about what you can do to design a lifestyle that it well-suited to happiness. For example, going back to college may help you become engaged in a community of peers who have similar goals.

71,1kuz2z,False,,10,"My selfish, abusive mother disowned me while dealing with kidney failure that she caused. Let me explain... (Incredibly long, but I need help so bad...)",whatsbotheringyou,"Part 1: The Setup


My mother has never been good to me. She has always adored my twin sister, to the point that, when my sister smashed me in the head with a rock when I was nine, I awoke to see my mom comforting my crying sister. Because she was the victim.

If I got into every detail, I'd be here all week, and no one wants to read that. But mom would lose patience with me and after age eleven refused to discipline me. She would tell my dad lies about what I had ""done"". He handled my discipline; at age nine I called him ""Igor"" in my diary - the willing servant. The most damaging entry has to be when she accused me of groping my pubescent sister.

I was the Stoop Kid from Hey Arnold! I wasn't allowed to leave my yard, and kids used to ride by my house and laugh at me. As a teenager with a girlfriend, she got worse. Her controlling behavior became so bad that she often accused me of things I could prove I didn't do, but it didn't matter: mom's word was gospel.

I was required to stay home four nights a week, and I had a ""dating rulesheet"" I had to adhere to that specified holding hands as ""the same as sex"". She had a weird love of popping zits and blackheads, and one day she wanted to get a tender one residing along my spine. She climbed on my back and used her weight to force me on the bed when I wasn't expecting it, and I pulled a muscle in my back. Once face-down on the bed, I rolled out from under her, and she screamed at me for ""hitting"" her. Dad hit me for ""hitting"" her.

So many stories, so little space...

But dad was also my hero. He defended me from mom when he could, but he could never understand that she was doing 97% of her abuse when he wasn't there. I told him that she was lying about the things she said I ""did"", but mom's word was gospel.

When I lost my virginity at sixteen, she locked herself in the room and went through a ""grieving period"", because that's normal, right? She chased me to my room one night, and I told her to get out; I was rewarded with a palm to the ear, which ruptured my left ear drum.

Oh, but that's not all:
 
- I was hit in the kneecap by a toy thrown by my dad, and left with a deep bruise which encircled the entire joint. During marching season.

- I was punched in the throat for hanging out with a friend who wouldn't date my sister.

- My 85 lb body was pinned against the wall by my 220 lb dad, who called me a pussy and dared me to hit him. My mom crossed her arms and smiled, having accused me of putting a virus on her computer.

But again, not enough time or space.

Dad always came back and apologized for what he'd done; mom has never apologized for a thing in her life and meant it. And in my brainwashed mind, I thought I deserved this treatment. I thought an apology would absolve the problem, and I was convinced that an apology meant it would stop. So mom's a sick, conniving bitch, and dad is an angry, gullible bear of a man.

Around age sixteen, at 135 pounds, I finally pushed back. Literally. I locked arms with dad, and held my ground. His face went from red to pale, I shoved, and dad later said, while apologizing, that I was getting too big to tangle with. I was no longer intimidated.

But dad was also my best friend. I could tell him anything. He'd lock my secrets up like the Fort Knox of filing cabinets. We crossed the country by highway together. I think that's what I miss the most. If mom weren't in the picture, things with us would be okay. He'd have never done those things to me. But if mom's the president and dad's the army, then he is still bound to use judgment in deciding the execution of orders. And he fucked up. A lot.


Part 2: The Sickening

When I was eighteen, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Mom decided soon after that she would find the cure. She spent thousands on internet cures, and I tried them to be a good sport. More often than not, I got much more sick than without them, and I stopped taking them. I tried one method for eight months, losing weight and energy the whole time, and after stopping I got the phrase that I was so used to by now: ""If only you'd done it longer, it would have worked. You always 'poo-poo' (dismiss) all my ideas. I've wasted thousands...""

But like a good (brainwashed) sport, I kept trying the homeopathic/alternative bullshit. I developed horrible arthritis - and a painkiller addiction - because of all of her ""treatments"". Then I moved off for my bachelor's degree.

What I left out until now is that I suspect mom of Munchausen's and Munchausen's by Proxy. If I got the hiccups, she got them twice as often. If I had diarrhea, she was also vomiting. My first girlfriend was in the hospital with leukemia, and mom hit the ER at least twice. I swear to God, if you said your dick was big she'd say hers was bigger. And none of it has ever been true.


Part 3: The Burning

I moved with my fiancee of eight years into an apartment near campus, 70 miles from home. I was taking a vitamin regimen my mom set up, and I was in both incredible pain and shedding weight. I skipped a lot of class. I would wake up, start bawling, lay my head in my fiancee's lap and cry until she had to go to work. So I'd sleep eight hours until she got home. Something was wrong, but I didn't know what. I moved from six 10 mg lortab a day to Fentanyl patches, then to four 10 mg percocets a day. Then I began taking probiotics, at mom's suggestion.

In January, I stayed with my parents for a weekend before a spinal surgery to finally fix my pain. The night before, mom told me about the new extra strength probiotics she'd bought, and told me to take two of them. I did.

The next morning, I was standing in the bathroom when the pain hit. I hit the floor and started vomiting. At the ER, I was abused by a nurse who grabbed my face, called me a wimp for crying and bellowing once, and informed the doctor that I was drug-seeking. I went to CAT scan, which revealed the pancreatitis that was about to kill me.


Part 4: The Failure

I spent a week in ICU, during which time my kidneys failed. I was in a virtual state of lucid coma. The Versed kept me awake, yet incapable of forming memories. It also made me extremely suggestible. During this time, mom made arrangements to move me back home, coerced me into denouncing my fiancee (who was then confronted at my house with bullshit allegations), forged my signature and opened a credit card in my name (legitimately for me, but still...), and begin accusing me of faking my pain for drugs.

The cause of the kidney failure? The combination of supplements I was on had chemically burned and scarred my kidney cells. The pancreatitis? The probiotics the night before.


Part 5: The Nightmare Begins

Mom began a crusade against the drugs that were keeping my pain under control and keeping me sane during my two-month hospital stay. She cornered my doctors and nurses, who willingly violated HIPAA and listened to her bitch about my ""addiction"". She screamed at me every night. She threw a water bottle over my head and into the wall. She slammed my laptop on a table. My dad couldn't control her.

I was put on a special and very restrictive renal diet. I was only allowed food that the cafeteria would send me according to my diet, but mom somehow grew convinced that I was cheating on my diet. Going home after two months was bittersweet: I missed my dog, I missed my bed, but I knew the monster I was moving in with.

My dad put my clothes and all my essential things in my room as they were before I left for school. I opened a drawer and saw my neatly folded clothes, and I hit the floor. I wasn't going to make it without dad. He and my fiancee had a burden, but they'd never failed me. Not in a situation like this.

Mom made all my food. The dialysis left me with little energy, and when I wasn't sleeping, I was either eating, shitting, or seeing my gal. I went out every week or so with my friends for a long time. I just didn't have the energy, and I always left early to crash. I was doing everything I could to hold myself together.

But mom decided that I was ""partying"" all the time. She accused me of breaking my diet, even though my nutrient blood tests came back perfect without fail. She told me that I wasn't going to ""hurt"" myself in her house. I lost touch with myself; I lost hope. It fucked with my head. I thought I was doing something horrible to myself without realizing it. After all, dad and my sister were with mom on this one.

The screaming happened daily. My dad was free once again to jab, scream at, and intimidate me. They said it all. I wasn't doing enough work around the house. I was sleeping too much. I was eating all wrong. Tests proving otherwise didn't matter. She demanded that I ask permission to eat certain meals and snacks. When I told my mom that I was thinking of suicide, she made fun of me. When I told dad, he told me I needed help and walked off.

But I didn't need help COPING with the bullshit - I needed the bullshit to stop. A therapist can't do that.

I moved in with my grandparents and aunt, who took care of me, but doubted my claims. My mom then made an appointment I didn't request at the Mayo in Minnesota, without my permission, when I wasn't ready to go. She said she was going to pay for it, but it actually cost me $1700.

On the trip, dad said that the bullshit would stop. If it didn't, he said he'd have failed me.

Just a few days after going back home, dad started in on the bullshit himself. On top of that, I developed chronic pancreatitis. Strangely, mom diagnosed herself as having a precancerous pancreas. She also began claiming she had mold poisoning, several years after legit poisoning had been resolved. She began fearing the NSA, the FBI, the FAA, and started claiming that my family was being targeted by bioterrorists bent on population control. She was fucking insane.

I told her all of that was bullshit, and behind closed doors my dad and sister agreed with me. But to her face, they supported her nonsense. After dad jabbed me in the ribs hard enough to be bruised just an inch from my dialysis catheter, I left again. The other end of that catheter is in my heart.


Part 6: Disowned

After I left, mom began claiming that I was kicked out for ""abusing"" her. When asked how I abused her, she just said that I had told my dad to ""control [his] woman."" I'd admit it if that was true, and even if I had, that's nothing compared to the treatment I received.

She calls anyone who'll answer the phone (a dwindling roster of ladies) and tells them that I'm trying to kill myself by breaking my diet, as though she's seen me eat in the last two months, or as though I don't have a .45 in my truck.

Dad claims that his marriage to mom is paramount. He has taken her side on every occasion, although attempting to appear fair. Over beers, I told him of my suicide plan back when I tried to warn them. He was apologetic and remorseful for missing the signs, and we parted as friends again.

Now, my fiancee and I have decided to buy a house. We've never had anything of our own. I asked dad to go to the bank with me to walk me through the loan process and to look at a property. Dad walked out to the car already pissed. He started a fight with me and blamed me for not accepting that I won't get an apology and for not ""burying the hatchet"" with my mother.

He screamed at me, called me names, and criticized me for wanting a house instead of an apartment. He complained about his life and claimed that my kidney ""issues"" were better than what he has to ""deal"" with. I took it all, but quietly changed course to take him back home. He then said something that REALLY got me: he told me that I should stay under mom's thumb longer. 

I saw red. I punched my steering wheel repeatedly, almost sideswiped  a van, and screamed back. I told him that I only wanted what he had at 25: a home, a family, a job, etc. He claimed that he was ""miserable"" at 25, to which I replied: ""Oh, and so I have to be as well?""

He then called me an idiot, and I let him have it. ""DON'T CALL ME ANYMORE FUCKING NAMES!!! I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU ANYTHING, AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! AM I CLEAR?!!"" He didn't answer, but he did bail out of my truck at 20 MPH. I learned shortly after that my mother had disowned me. Dad was pissed because she had threatened him for ""aiding the enemy"". Because her own son is the enemy.

So now my brainwashed father is threatening me on a regular basis, and my mom is phone-bombing everyone to tell lies about me. My sister is also pissed at my mom about their own conflict, but she can't rationalize that I'm going through the same thing with her. My own twin won't even look at me.

The plan was that I'd move in with the boyfriend (who's currently living about 2 - 2 and a half hours away by train), go back to school for two years, qualify as a teacher. Get a job, get married, have a family. But now I'm not going back to school. And sure, I can apply again next year, but I don't want to have to add another year on to basically starting my life.

Why not? You'll be in a career for 40 years. What's 1 year now to that 40 years of your career? I guarantee it will be worth it if it takes you an extra year to land your dream job. A year is not that long.

There's no way around this, you have to use this setback to fuel the fire and get motivated. Get feedback from the universities etc... (chase it if you need to) and find out what exactly you need to do for next time. It doesn't matter if its for university or for a job, everyone fails the first few interviews (I must have had at least 5 mock interviews with various people but I still screwed up my first uni interview, I still screw up the first one or two interviews when applying for jobs) but you have to learn from these.

Make sure this next year you do something relevant to the career you want. Want to be a teacher? Try to get a job as a teaching assistant. It doesn't even have to be where you live, you can take a TEFL course and teach English overseas, in fact I don't think you always even need that. Anything that shows a drive for your chosen career will look good when applying next year. If you have to move far away for it then so be it (so long as you can afford it of course). A long distance relationship isn't too hard for you for a year is it? And if it is, you should really evaluate the reasons why you think it would be so difficult.

Don't worry about the driving for now. As you've said yourself it isn't a priority. Focus on what is a priority instead.

654,29o8qn,False,,6,"Now that I'm losing weight, I no longer love my body like I used to.",whatsbotheringyou,"My entire life I've been overweight. Now too overweight, but just barely in the unhealthy zone. I can remember being 5 years old and crying to my (crazy) mother about how kids called me fat in Kindergarten, and her response was, ""It just means you have a skinny back"".

Bullshit of my life story aside, I had to grow up fast, and stand up for myself. And when I did, I became confident in my abilities, in my intelligence, in my personality, in my beliefs/morals. Basically instead of working on losing the weight for other people, I worked on my self confidence. And it worked! I know I'm strong. I know I can hang with the guys, because my size is partially body fat partially muscle. 

But this summer, I started eating healthier out of moralish obligations. No soda, no fried food, more vegetables and fruits and less red meat. I also started going to my friend's bootcamp to support her. On top of it, I'm not participating in Ramadan, and the not eating, but continued work is making me drop inches. I wish I could tell you how many I've dropped, but I don't know the beginning number. I would say maybe 3 or 4 inches.

Here's the thing. Now that I'm smaller, I don't identify with the ""Big Momma"" trope that I had always aspired to be.

747,34na0h,False,,5,Rebuilding after depression.,whatsbotheringyou,"Tl;Dr: I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again.


I've been a depressed for years- sparked by an existential crisis and botched suicide attempt in grade 9- and within those years of chronic depression I was lively and didn't give two shits about anything. I could talk to anyone about anything because I was **out there** , masked by not giving a shit, burying my pain in comedy, ala the clown of the group (being alone at home was a totally different experience) It wasn't healthy, but it gave me a close circle of people who cared about me for what I was, because they experienced the depths of depression themselves. 

I eventually even started to love a girl who was just as crazy as me, but disaster struck home. One of the closest people to me, my best friend for all intensive purposes, took her life last year.

I *shut down*. 

That lively, depressed, jovial asshole, people loved and hated loving, instantaneously transformed into your classic depressive cynic. A textbook troglodyte terrorizing my truest companions. There was no mask, no joking, no smiling. I stopped laughing. Stopped caring in the slightest,  and if you did anything that agitated(regardless if you meant to or not) me you'd end up unjustly roasted by verbal hellfire. Imagine Carlin attacking every member of his audience. 

I got with that crazy girl of my dreams at the worst possible time (a month after the death) and spiraled from there into the darkest depressive stupor I've yet survived.  

I lost the girl of my dreams, but it kinda didn't even matter because I was going to take hangmans exit anyway, until I saw how she looked at me. I've never had another, especially someone I loved, look at me exactly how I felt. 

It shattered me.

 I was confused and fighting myself, and once my mind was under my control I stepped up and cleaned house. Within the last 5 months the depression seemingly drifted away, of course I still get sad and weird sometimes, but I can handle it. 

Except.... I can't talk to anyone. I don't know how to be jovial. The part of me that could be friends with anyone and could talk for hours on end about everything appears to be buried with my friend. That crazy girl who is still of my dreams I cannot speak to for more than a few messages. I can't talk to my closest friends, I don't know how to talk to anyone anymore.

I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. Sure I know much of them, but that didn't stop me before.. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was regularly depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again. I don't even remember much of the last year, which saddens me greatly. I look in the mirror and see a stranger of whom I admire little.

Any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/34na0h/rebuilding_after_depression/,10,"Heya,

I'm going to start with the (probably) expected, you gotta stop talking to this girl of your dreams, give yourself time to get away from the epicentre of it all and be able to see the situation for what it truly is. The saying ""love is blind"" is true in so many ways. 

It sounds like you're just getting out of this bad bout of depression, give yourself some time to get back into the swing of things. But you clearly want to be proactive, join a club if you can stand it, go to music events of people you like, you already have one thing in common and I've made friends at these events, add them on Facebook/social media and then you can chat to them about latest releases, the next event they plan on going to and I've made a point of saying to these guys that if they're going to event that I'm going to and they have no one to go with, that they're more than welcome to chill with me and my friend. Try reconnecting with old friends who you maybe haven't spoken to in a while and miss a little.

And with your old friends, speak to them and tell them what has happened, ask them to help you out and tell them what to do! They may not have dealt with a situation like yours ever before and simply don't know what to do. 

Being a friend will be like riding a bike, you'll be a bit rusty at first but you'll soon get the hang of it

My name is Alex, as you can see in the title I am 23yo and few weeks ago I became unemployed.

I was working for a small online gift shop company for 3years where I was dealing with everything there from A-Z: Contact suppliers to order the needed stuff, talk with customers, use all the machines we have to craft the products that we were making, doing new desings for new products, everything that was related to the online shop, literally everything. 

2 and half months ago I asked for a promotion/salary increase since I started to have issues with my budget, and ofc my ""boss"" declined as the business during the summer doesnt have that much income. Then since my apettite for work  decreased alot due to not enjoying anymore what I was doing and the rewards I was getting, so I have tried to talk with him for one more time and again the same story, so I decided that will be better for me if I will go somewhere else to work. I was still working there until 3weeks ago where I said enough its time to move on with my life and my career.

Since then, I am constantly looking for similar jobs since its something that I already have some solid experience and I somehow like doing, you see, I like everything that is related to computers and graphics.

Now my biggest issue is that I live in a small island(Cyprus), there are not many jobs in simillar domain, and I feel that I dont want to have a boss anymore, I would love to make something for myself, have my own thing, that will make me wanna wake up or not even sleep some nights and build it, I would like my own business , but I dont know where,how and what to do as I dont know what I really enjoy doing with my life. I love talking with different people, have weird convos about the universe, about our existance, about this type of stuff. I like reading others people personal experiences in life, business experiences and so on. I like editing photos in Photoshop as its something that I have learned and still learning since I was 10 because was something that I really love doing. I like fizing computers, trying to figure out why is not working and so on. But at this point I feel that I have no energy for life, I feel that I suck and that I cant do a shit anymore.

When I had the chance to visit him I walked in on him crying with his mother saying, ""I'm just so tired of this life. Why does it have to be so hard?"" It hit me really hard hearing him say those words. I held his hand and cried with him. It just really baffles me why he would want to end his life.

Short story, she wanted me to help pay for her to come to America. Boy was I dumb, and naive. After talking to my parent's I realized how naive I was. 

And this was over 10+ years ago.

I'm 51, about 2-3 week's ago, stupid me, placed an advert in the craigslist, and got a response. With this lady named Shannon. 

Said she lived in my state, and but had family in Phillipines, etc.

I had indicated that I wanted to meet her, before deciding how well we got along. Almost immediately she ignored that, and kept giving me lovey dovey talk.

Then I got an email about 5 hours ago, saying she had medical problems in the Phillipines, and wanted me to send her 300 bucks.

I just sent a response, tolding whoever this was to ""Get Lost"".

I know I am a lonely man, but why do I let these idiots scam me and hurt me so much, lol.

Just very frustrating.

My life is moving forward, joined Toastmasters, going back to college in the Spring. Volunteering at the local community to help with English Second Language.

But outside of that I have no job, no friends, no one really show's any interest in hanging with me.

I am just tired of that I have to be always the one to show interest in others, why do other people refuse to show any interest in me?

167,bmiyl0,False,,10,"I went on a bender that ruined my mental health, my relationship, and maybe my job.",whatsbotheringyou,"I’ve been dealing with depression and panic attacks for years. I take meds to help with the panic attacks, and so far they’ve worked pretty well up until this point. Though they really don’t do a whole lot for depression, and that aspect has been getting worse and worse.

I took off work last Friday to go to a friend’s bachelor party. Now this friend is a mild mannered Christian guy, so very different from me, but I love him all the same. I guess I kinda lost it Thursday night and just started drinking. Heavily. And then Friday rolled around and I said “Screw it, it’s a bachelor party”. So I woke up and continued drinking. This kept going till Sunday. By Sunday I was more hungover than I’ve ever been, and more depressed and anxious than I’ve been in a long time. I also had to deal with the fact that I acted like a complete drunken fool the whole weekend to my Christian friend and his other Christian buddies. They basically said they couldn’t hang out with me anymore..

Monday rolls around, I’m feeling almost worse. I take off work. I spend the whole day doubled over, body locked up, shaking and weak. “Must be the hangover” I thought.

Tuesday, I feel like shit still but go into work. Everyone tells me I look like death, that I should go home. I try to stick it out and almost pass out so I leave. I’m still shaking and losing consciousness. I go to the doctor, nothings wrong.

This continues until today. I realized last night that these are panic attack symptoms that I haven’t had in a long long time. I’ve basically drank myself into having panic attacks again. I took off work again, making it 2 days and 2 half days. People at work are wondering what’s wrong, and I feel like I might lose my job. And the worst part is last time I dealt with these issues of panic attacks it took almost a year to get over them before I could function enough to have a steady job. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t get a grip in the next few days. 

I’ve never posted on reddit before, but I figured this was a good start. I’m at rock bottom right now.

I think potentially you subconsciously went on this bender because of your anxiety and depression. It will take some time to get over this obviously but forgive yourself. You made a mistake but don't keep beating yourself up over it. Drink plenty of water, eat well, get a little exercise and do things that are calming. You will fix this one step at a time but if you don't forgive yourself, you'll just draw out that time. Maybe you should deeply consider not drinking, at least for a while.  
If your Christian friend and his buddies hold all that against you then oh well, they weren't that close to you anyway. What happened to the tenets of Christianity? You know, like forgiveness, patience, and the other virtues.  
I've been on many benders and some of them altered the course of my life but you just focus on positive things in your life and you'll get better. If you lose your job, you'll get another one but hopefully you learned a good lesson. Take care of yourself! ",2019-05-09 12:06:10
400,1shd70,False,,4,I can't stop thinking about some old explicit text exchanges I found between my GF and another guy,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry for the throwaway. I think I just need some of you guys to slap some sense into me.

A few months ago I was concerned that my GF of two years was lying to me about something. Turns out she was. It wasn't a huge deal, and we've discussed it and since worked everything out. Thing is, to FIND this ""truth,"" I did some snooping. I'm not proud of myself, but I looked through her phone.

In addition to what I discovered, I ALSO discovered a number of old texts between her and a former fling. Now I KNOW these were before me, so really I have no reason to be upset. But they were sexually explicit. And in some ways, they were more sexually explicit than any exchanges that have ever occurred between her and me. She seemed more aggressive, less inhibited. 

We love each other very much and know she's the one, I just can't stop thinking about what I read. And to top it off, she's still kind of friends with this guy. They don't talk or anything, but he still comes around when a bunch of other friends do.... and while I openly know they ""dated"" (or whatever), she obviously has no idea I know about their exchanges - or any details of their sex life.

516,edbey4,False,,4,I just want to know why,whatsbotheringyou,"That’s something that’s been bothering me for years. Every time I have emotional breakdowns and meltdowns; my train of thought tries using logic so that I can at least understand and help myself. I ask myself why am I like this, and naturally my mind responds that it’s the childhood trauma that drilled into my mind a depressing and anxious view of the world (or so my old therapist said. It’s very hard for me to admit that I even had “childhood trauma” because I was always reminded that *other* people have it worse.) 

I still question why. Why would someone look at a 9 or 10 yr old, freshly moved out of her mom’s care, and get so angry at her over losing track of training bras or running out of clean clothes that they slap and squeeze them in the face? 

Why was I later yelled at for “creating marks on my face to make me look abused” when I didn’t? 

Why were things like not keeping my backpack and room clean met with shouting and my book bag thrown on me while I tried to sleep?

Why is it that when I tried telling them (both my guardian and the counselors at school) about being bullied, absolutely nothing was done to stop it, rather, I was the one sent to another room to “speak with the guidance counselor”?

Why were my attempts at reaching out and telling others that I was depressed... ignored? Treated as if they were my own fault? My first suicidal thought was when I was 10.

Why is it that I was damn near rewarded for keeping quiet about it all? I remember that any time I was hit that morning, I didn’t go to school. We’d later go out someplace to eat after both of us “calmed down.”

Why was it that I had needed glasses since MIDDLE SCHOOL, but I was actually faking it. Even when the doctor said I failed my eye exam, to look at me dead in the eyes and say smugly, “Ya know, you’re not supposed to lie on those exams!” When there was *NO REASON* for me to lie.

There’s more I could add. But most importantly, why is it that if that happened to any other child that I wouldn’t hesitate to call it abuse? Yet I struggle to call my own aunt abusive; she *has* done a lot for me.

I hate how badly I struggle with my emotions now as an adult. I feel robbed. That maybe I never deserved a good support system or anything. I look at pictures of me when I was around that age and I keep telling her that she didn’t deserve it. Maybe it’ll echo into the past and I could finally heal like I always wanted.

Anyway, thank you to those who read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/edbey4/i_just_want_to_know_why/,12,"I'm really sorry that all happened to you as a small child. It's just a sin how your guardian and other adults in your life treated you. Even abusers can be nice and do a lot for you, that doesn't negate their abuse. I often feel the same way about my upbringing.  My parents didn't physically or verbally abuse me, I was emotionally neglected. I was raised by a narcissistic mother and an emotionally neglectful father. From the outside, it looked like we were an idyllic family so I was a bit shocked with I started having horrible anxiety attacks and health issues.  I had to have a therapist tell me that my childhood would be considered abusive.  Maybe I felt that way because I was told all the time how lucky I was compared to other children.  It's even hard for me now to explain my abuse because each incident doesn't sound that bad. I feel when I try to explain it I sound like an entitled brat.  At least in my head I do, especially when I see other's dismiss what I'm saying.  People who had a great childhood never understand.

I feel like a piece of shit.,whatsbotheringyou,"I was at my friend's house for the first time and got to meet all of his friends.  It was a party and we all got more and more drunk as the night progressed.  I recently (about a month ago) broke up with my girlfriend and haven't really talked to any girls since.  I ended up getting drunk, and the girls (who I have never met, and will never see again) all seemed so hot and attractive, and a majority of them seemed interested in me.  Late in the night, one of the girls sort of backed into me and started grinding on me, and I was totally for it.  From then on we started making out and stuff, and I got really touchy feely.  I was groping her ass pretty much nonstop and I started thinking about sleeping with her.  Soon, everyone at the party starting warning me about her, telling me she has herpes and stuff like that, so I (thankfully) decide to not sleep with her.  She goes upstairs and ends up passing out on one of the beds, and me and some of my friend's friends find her a little while later.  We kind of try to wake her up, and one of the guys slaps the girls ass a few times (she wasn't moving, she was totally knocked out)  I checked to make sure she was still breathing, she was, and after the guys left me and her in the room and I ended up kind of groping her some more (she had her jeans on and everything) even though she was passed out.  My drunk logic had me thinking it was okay because she was fine with me doing it to her when she was awake.  The next morning she was still totally into me and was like touching me and messing with my hair and everything, but as I slowly recollected everything that happened and how I acted with her, I felt worse and worse.  I always try to treat women with respect and I look back at my actions that night in complete horror.  It was like someone else had taken over me.  It might have something to do with being recently single, but still... it makes me not want to drink again if I turn into some kind of monster.  :(

ALSO:  With a little facebook stalking, I found out today that she has a boyfriend.

I try not to make too big of a deal out of it. I don't comment on it, I talk about it only when I'm asked, except with a few very close friends. 

Yet so many people still frequently comment on my weight. Some of them because they are concerned, which I get, yet others because they are jealous, which I think is downright insulting, *and I'm just so done with it!*

978,cuo8xy,False,,1,"I miss my old college crush. I still have feelings for her, and just can't quit thinking about her.",whatsbotheringyou,"Over 2 years ago. When I was in college, I met a girl I had a real connection to. Cute as a button, I honestly think she may have been ""the one"" but I never took the initiative. I liked her. A lot. After 2 years, we've gone our separate ways. We haven't talked at all, but I still have feelings for her. Strong feelings. I have always regretted it.

I actually thought i loved her. I might still, i know i still have dreams about her.

Actually, if I tell about how we met and everything, tell me, do you think I would've had a shot?

Here's how we met. It was my first year of college, there was another couple group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.

We were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn’t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.

I started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little ""quip"" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said ""Any relation to (that celebrity)"". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said ""Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names"" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked “well, looks like Hillary just got another vote”. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said ""If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.""

Yes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she’d snort. That’s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything

Anyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn’t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).

We had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn’t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn’t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn’t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t formulate the words to do it. I’d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself “next week, I’ll surely do it next week” but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.

She was smart, she was cute, she’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.

i kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we’ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn’t remember me anyway. I haven’t even bothered trying.

727,aytz59,False,,3,I'm trapped until I'm 26.,whatsbotheringyou,"Greetings...

I'm a 20 year old American still living with my parents and working as a cashier at a dollar store. No matter my grades in school, this is what it's come too. Unfortunately this is as far as I can really go right now.

Let me summarize my life, this might take a while.

I live in a crowded house still with my parents. Since as long as I can remember we've always lived with at least one of my step-siblings and their children. This is possible because my stepfather is a dozen years older than my mom. Currently it's my parents, my oldest sister and her three kids, and my younger brothers and I. Since we all have crap jobs we're struggling. I give half of my $8 an hour cashier wage to savings, and the other to bills. The food pantry really helps us out.

Even though I'm twenty, I can't drive. This makes me the go-to babysitter so I can't leave the house to practice driving anyway. The few occasions where I get to use my permit my mom gets so nervous that she decides to drive or has someone else drive. I'm isolated, and lonely, so the internet is my only escape. I don't even want to date because of my situation.

Debt is hurting a few of my siblings, and that scared me away from college for a year. Now that I want to go, I can't because I'm still on my parents taxes and my mom is scared of filling out the tax information for my FASFA. I don't know how, but the questions make her feel stupid and she literally yells at the screen when I try to get her help. My dad is usually busy with work because of how our schedules work, or whatever other excuse they can come up with.

I think I've become too useful and my parents secretly won't let me leave. I tried to point it out to them and they pulled every guilt card they could get away with. They won't let me leave, and most of my other family is across the country so I have nowhere to go.

Given that I can't drive, and don't have any education other than a diploma, I'm nearly unhireable, unemployable. I can't get a job that pays living wages to get me out of here.

I'm trapped as a permanent babysitter until I'm twenty six when I don't need my parents to file a fasfa and get scholarships.

Also, this isn't what I'm saying. I'm just saying I don't like the way she talks to all her guy friends so regularly. 

Basically, she has a ton of guy friends. Like, a ton. And I don't know any of them. They're all either from her work or from her old schools. She texts them a lot, really regularly. As well, her female friends text these guys from her phone. So one of her friends might use the phone to hit on the guys, without the guys realizing it's someone else. That's worded kind of confusingly - basically, a friend will text a guy using my girlfriend's phone. The friend will call the guy 'sexy' or something, without telling the guy it isn't my girlfriend. So the guy will think my girlfriend is calling him sexy. 

Also, I feel uncomfortable with her talking to all these guys because they're either her exes, or at some point have had a crush on her. Each one has confessed their attraction to her, and she's turned them down. That hasn't stopped her talking to them, though, and they're accidentally being led on by her friends. I just really wish she wouldn't talk to them quite like that. Another thing is, when talking to her friends about them, she'll call them sexy and hot. Like, right while I'm there. It doesn't really help my self esteem. 

I'd love some advice on how to change my opinion on this. I don't want to make her stop being friends with anyone, I just wish I didn't feel so uncomfortable with this. Thanks in advance.

Also, as a sidenote, her lesbian friend makes advances on her all the time. They both joke about it, but I don't really like how this girl can do inappropriate things and pass it off as a joke.

College started out great. Made a lot of friends, got to learn cool things, etc. However, it has slowly but surely been getting worse and worse and worse, and it's entirely my own fault. I made mostly A's and B's my freshman year. But starting in sophomore year, I got more and more C's. My GPA within my major is horrible. 

All this because I can't seem to make myself do *anything* anymore. Even this very moment, I should be starting a take home exam I had a week to do, which is now a day late. An EXAM. I want to make good grades, I made fantastic grades in high school. But I just can't seem to make myself put in the effort...

I cant remember the last time i got higher than a C on a test that wasnt blatantly easy (because my school has rather poor tests that dont really test your knowledge, but instead test your ability to remember a bunch of facts for the 20 minutes that you need to write them down)

I've always been told by teachers that im intelligent, which is annoying because i believe them. When i enjoy a subject, i do really well in it. The problem is, i enjoy nothing in school except talking to people and sharing my funny stories, and ""people"" includes teachers.


I love my teachers, i think they are doing beautiful things in my life and i cant thank them enough for providing me with advice to improve my current life and my future.

I've been out of high school for almost a year now and I've taken time off to work and make money and have a break from school work. I hate my job, I wash dishes every day and only see my friends at night. I've been feeling really unsatisfied with my life and realized that I miss school even with how awkward I felt a lot of the time. 

I miss when I would learn about stuff that actually interested me and I miss meeting people with similar interests. I never realized how hard it'd be to meet people once you're no longer in school. Since I've been thinking about school so much eventually my thoughts turned toward a girl in the same grade as me who I had 3 classes with my senior year and who I crushed on hard pretty much the whole year. 

She's cute definitely, curvy if nothing else, but what I really liked about her was her mind. I think intelligence and confidence are extremely attractive and this girl was both intelligent and confident. Or at least she seemed to be. The reason I say that is because one of my friends worked with her and they texted sometimes and he said she was actually really insecure which blows my mind because there was literally no reason for this girl to feel like that, but anyway. 

She was really smart and had a sarcastic sense of humor just like I do, literally every thing I heard come out of this girls mouth made me like her more. In one of the classes we had together I'd play music sometimes and I would play stuff like Beck (I'm very big into alternative music) and she would be into it which I loved because it's hard for me to find other people into the music that I'm into. She also always dressed really nice which seems random but I like dressing well myself so it stands out to me whenever girls do the same.

Let me see what else... she also hated the small town in Pennsylvania we lived in (she went to school out of state) and was into theater (I took four years of drama classes in high school), drinking (I prefer smoking weed but hey whatever), and books (I used to read a book a day) among other things I'm sure I would have discovered had we ever hung out. 

Despite all this, I never asked her to hang out once when we were in school together. When she signed my yearbook she even said she'd wished we'd been better friends.

829,1iji5g,False,,26,I just feel completely overwhelmed.,whatsbotheringyou,"A few months ago my family and I were in an [accident](http://i.imgur.com/Ijujvq2.jpg). Our S.U.V., which had been a gift from my uncle, [rolled over](http://imgur.com/a/HgiRp) and I was [horribly injured](http://imgur.com/a/Ra2WQ#0) (warning some images potentially NSFL). Having found out upon calling my insurance co. to report the accident that my policy had in fact lapsed I found myself in a real bad situation and it has been a few months with no transportation.

Clarification as to how my insurance lapsed: Our policy began towards the end of Nov. when we received the vehicle from my uncle. I thought that my S.O. had paid the entire 6 months of the policy. We moved in the middle of Dec. For whatever reason (still not sure why) nothing from the ins. co. forwarded to the new address. My S.O. believed that I was paying the monthly bill., I thought it was paid, clusterfuck ensued.

No transportation means that I also can't get any follow-up medical care that I need for my head injury. I had an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and had to have reconstructive surgery done on my scalp to cover the  10 cm x 5 cm area where my skull was exposed. Right now it looks pretty lumpy and gross and scabby, I have no feeling at all in parts of it and extreme pain in other parts. I also still have nightmares and have a lot of trouble sleeping. I used to be a voracious reader, but can no longer read books, though I have worked my way back up to short stories and articles which is a huge improvement over a few months ago. I'm supposed to see a nueropsychologist in August to have my brain functions evaluated, but I figure that will be yet another appointment that will be cancelled without being rescheduled.

No transportation also means that my S.O. wasn't able get to work, he lost his job and has had no luck finding a new job within walking distance. With no income coming in the bills have been piling up. We had the water shut off 3 weeks ago and have to get water from a nearby spring for washing-up, cooking, flushing the toilet etc. Our landlord has been amazing and understanding through this but things have reached the point where he can't be understanding much longer.

The investigating officer upon interviewing me said things that completely contradict what he put in the police report. The skid marks at the scene in no way match up with the skid marks drawn on the police report. There were multiple witnesses at the scene who said that the other driver told them that her child had thrown something at her and she lost control of the car and she hit me, this is noted in the police report (at least it's noted that one witness said it, all other ""witnesses"" in the police report saw nothing at all). Yet the police report says that I sideswiped her. Her insurance company has not yet denied the claim, but they haven't done anything else yet either. I feel like my lawyer is barely even working for me at this point.

For comparison sake: [the other vehicle](http://i.imgur.com/5y1vxyV.jpg)

Meanwhile my entire life is falling apart, I am in tremendous amounts of pain and can't even go to the E.R. because I wouldn't be able to get home from there. I have been trapped inside my house since April, I had to explain to my child that we would have to live without running water for an indefinite amount of time, I know that worse is coming and I need to prepare myself for it.

I know that there really isn't anything that anyone can say to make this better or less overwhelming for me. I'm sick of being judged for it though and having people not believe me about it. I have a huge fucking crevice in my head, that's not something I'm going to lie about. Thank you anyone who took the time to read this.

TL;DR: Missing a chunk of my head and life fucking sucks.

717,cd8inm,False,,8,Found out my girlfriend does drugs and I can't stop thinking about it,whatsbotheringyou,"A few disclaimers/apologies:
-I currently working for another 7 hours and I'm working on this throughout my shift between rushes. I'm sorry if my thoughts seem to jump around.
-The drugs aren't anything of the major ones ex: heroine and cocaine

Ok here's a few placeholder names and ages. Coworker (cw) is in his late 20's and girlfriend (gf) and I are both 17

So this is what's bothering me. About a month ago I found out that my girlfriend used marijuana recreationally (no it is no legal in my state). J found out one day because after our shift we were headed to get wings with our coworker. I was slow clocking out because I felt the need to help out a little after my shift. Eventually I walked out back and saw the two smoking together. My first thought was ""Oh yikes I didn't know she smoked"". When cw saw me he asked if I was ready to go and we headed out. Before we sat down cw turn to my gf and said ""I wonder if it was a bad idea to smoke weed, cause now I'm about to drink a beer. Hope it isn't dangerous"". At this point I am just shocked. The rest of the night was me pretending to space out while my gf, cw, and CW's friend were eating. The next day I talked things through with my gf and told her that she can keep doing what's she's doing as long as she keeps herself safe (like not endangering her body or getting into trouble with the law). I also told her drugs were a touchy subject with me and to not talk about it in front of me.

Fast forward about a month to today. I'm in for a 10 hour shift with cw. While working I hear him mutter to himself, and I asked him what was on his mind. He turns to me and told me that he was wondering if he should start his mushroom plot (no not normal mushrooms) for my gf before or after he leaves for his vacation.

Now I get if you're scoffing at this and saying that I'm overreacting over something so small and I totally understand that. I was raised by a very strict dad and a paranoid schizophrenic mom. I hate to blame my mom but I think my habit of over thinking/worrying about every small thing comes from her. Ever since I was a kid, I was taught to be the type of person to always follow rules and to stay in line. This definitely made me a more reserved person who is afraid of taking risks no matter how small. Because of these things my brain is always running wild and it has been for the past 5 hours now. I'm just scared that she might get hurt while on drugs or even move on to stronger and more dangerous drugs.

I know you guys are going to say, so here's somethings I can answer now:

Why don't you ask your parents for advice?
- My parents wouldn't allow me to continue seeing her if they found out about this

Try to talk her into quitting?
- She is a free spirit who hates limitations/restrictions being put on what she can or cannot do. Also it is her life not my life and I shouldn't interfere too much.

Why don't you talk to her family about it?
- Her only family (mom and grandma) actually do these types of drugs as well

Any advice is greatly appreciated and even if you don't have any, thank you for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/cd8inm/found_out_my_girlfriend_does_drugs_and_i_cant/,12,"Let me preface by saying yes, you can trip out on marijuana and have a bad high. And the risk for bad highs are hundred fold for magic mushrooms. However, the risk of long-term mental damage is very low.

You cannot be physically addicted to either of those substances, but can be mentally addicted or addicted by habit. As these two drugs are disassociates, meaning they allow you to separate emotionally and mentally from reality, the biggest question is why does she feel the need to do these drugs. 

As a boyfriend, you don’t own her life so you cannot tell her to not do drugs. However, you can be there as her guide in life and someone who wants to understand the reason behind why she makes choices you do not understand. 

Many people do disasscoiative drugs to deal with stress or pain, and if they do it everyday, the drug starts inventing reasons for you to keep using. Back pain, creativity, stress, sadness, loneliness, fun, food. All of these can be solved via sober means, and these drugs offer a shortcut to certain states of bliss and self realization. Occasional use should be tolerated. Daily use should not be tolerated and the root cause for such daily drug habits should be uncovered. 

I recommend asking the following questions from an understanding standpoint:

If you are 100% happy, would you smoke weed or take mushrooms?

Why do you feel the need to do these drugs?

If you stopped doing these drugs, would you feel bad? ",2019-07-14 21:27:29

But I'm starting to realize that its never going to happen for a few reasons. I can't afford to get any decent higher education, my dad is very rich but I'm basically not his kid anymore since I chose my mom over him because he was physically abusive and he told me to never expect a dime from him. I'd consider myself to be somewhat bright, I make straight A's in average classes, but there are kids who are ten times smarter than me in the higher classes and they would get a scholarship over me in a heartbeat. Right now I'm looking at a steady job as a coder, it pays well and is pretty easy work. But I know that that won't make me happy and that being a conservationist is what I've always wanted. I've always thought about how lucky people like the Irwin kids are who were bound to get my dream before they were old enough to want it. I've been so depressed, but it's not like I hate myself it's the fact that I hate what my future is looking like.

I'm also a huge fan of the Irwins and I'd love to visit them someday.  Being able to work or volunteer at the zoo would be really cool too. 

What can you do to get yourself there? 

1. Keep working hard, good grades count. You don't have to be smart to get good grades, but it helps. Good work matters more (take it from somebody with a Master's degree). Ask questions when you don't understand and your teachers/professors will enjoy having you around. :) 
2. Now that you've worked hard, apply for some scholarships and ask the teachers you impressed to write you good letters of recommendation. A lot of scholarships is luck- finding one that fits you, winning it, etc.- but you will have MUCH better chances if you have strong letters!
3. Apply to colleges with awesome study abroad programs or programs along the same vein of what you'd like to do in the zoo. Go to those colleges, do well there. 
4. If you can study abroad in Australia, DO IT!!! I think the zoo does offer internships; I've looked it up. 
5. Don't give up hope!!! You've chosen a dream job that can be very difficult to achieve. Anything is possible with hard work, especially since you're still young. 
6. If it's worth anything, when I was 15-16 I really wanted to go to university in Australia for biology. I looked into different programs there. My life has taken a drastically different turn since then (I am now a proud I/O Psychologist) but I remember being so excited to talk to people about my dreams!

700,1khjr9,False,,10,I'm holding on to hope,whatsbotheringyou,"Recently out of a relationship that, to me, was magic.  I was older, she's in grad school, it was an LDR.  We were engaged.  She broke it off because she was confused and conflicted.  Didn't want to be a step mom or really a wife.  Wanted to live a little first.

Had she said, ""I don't love you any more"" or ""I'm seeing someone else"" I'd have been devastated, and I'd have moved on.

But, she said, ""I don't know what the future holds.""  And ""I just need to be on my own for a while.""  And ""In a few years, who knows?""

Now, I know, as a grown person with a lot of relationships under my belt, that these are all nice ways of saying she doesn't want to be with me any more, and she wants to be with someone else.  My problem is, I can't let go of the hope.

This isn't a matter of forgetting her, or not loving her any more.  And I haven't talked to her in weeks.  But I've had worse relationships before and I've had a hard time letting go.  She was the best thing that's ever happened to me, I celebrated that every day, openly told her, shouted from rooftops.  I'd planned to quit my job, leave my kids with their mom (joint custody) and move to be with her.  I'd have given up everything.

So now I'm insanely holding onto the hope of maybe.  I'm holding onto ""who knows?""  I'm 40 now, how long do I wait?  How long can I wait?  To me it's worth waiting, but I don't know if I'll be able to.  I can fill the time while I'm waiting, but when do I stop?

Knowing how relationships end, and what you're supposed to do is one thing.  But how do you deal with removing that hope?  Has anyone else ever hoped and waited and won out?

I'm sorry to say it, but don't hold onto hope.  Were you important to her?  Yes.  Are you still and will you always be?  Probably, but just not in the way you'd like to be.

I was planning on getting married a number of years ago.  I was going to move to the city she lived in, and we were looking for apartments together, etc.  Then she left.  I don't know her exact reasoning, but it wasn't because she didn't love me.  It took me years to get over it.

Now I have a new girlfriend who I'm pretty crazy about.  She's not better or worse than the last one, but a completely different person who also makes me happy.  Had the last relationship gone as planned, my life would be very different now; not better or worse necessarily, but different.

Right now, you're sad that things didn't go as planned, because you're experiencing the painful results of that.  Eventually you'll experience other wonderful things in your life that you wouldn't otherwise have, and the pain won't be so bad.

I also have a short answer:  you shouldn't be with someone who would hurt you so badly.  I know it sounds terrible to have someone say this about the person you love more than anyone, but they aren't all that, and you deserve better. ",2013-08-16 13:45:21

My aunt was good friends with one of the teachers, who could tell something was wrong and tried to help.

Article Two: One of the year 11 students jumped from the top floor balcony when I was in year 9.

One of my best friends was in the building at that time - about five minutes before I arrived - and she saw it happen. The school went into lockdown and classes continued like normal after two hours but everyone was hysterical and refused to do anything. Most of us ended up sitting in classrooms listening to people screaming and crying about what happened. His sister had to be taken out of her lesson and sit in the office for a while. No one got sent home but no one really had lessons that day, either. The year 11 student did live past the event but I don't know what happened to him after we both left high school.

I've got a HUGE deadline looming at work. I've only got 3-4 weeks remaining, but my immediate bosses keep changing what I need to do or forcing me to start a fresh.

I'm putting in 60-70 hour weeks and getting nothing but, ""we need you to start again, but do it differently"" out of it. The work I'm doing is not possible with the tools I'm using, but management wont hear any of that, they just keep telling me that it ""must be doable. If not, try using this tool/technique that we found after a few seconds of Googling,"" which has lead to me wasting days on end collecting evidence that something can't be done, rather than it just being accepted and worked around.

Every few weeks, I'm being taken away from my current project and told that I'm spending a week doing completely unrelated tasks, ""because someone has to do it,"" which is impacting on my ability to reach the deadline.

Because of all the above, I'm not sleeping or eating properly, neither am I getting time to exercise so my health has taken a direct hit. I'm supposed to be taking a big exam (that has nothing to do with my employment) soon, but studying for that has been put on hold (which means that I'll forfeit my entry, or will do poorly). My relationship with my SO has taken a *HUGE* hit, too. She lives 150 miles away, and I'm not getting the time to go see her or her to come see me.

My colleagues seem to know more about my current (deadline) project than I do, which tells me that someone intentionally isn't telling me what I need to be doing for a reason. The extremely exhausted, *VERY RECENT* stomach ulcer suffering side of me is left thinking that there is a very specific reason why folks are telling me things (paranoid, I know).

Whenever I have to call someone I don't know (e.g. making an appointment, calling customer service, calling a store to find out their hours/if they have something in stock, or anyone I don't really know), I end up staring at the phone for up to several hours trying to put it off. And when I eventually do end up dialling the number, in those long seconds of dial tone, my heart is pounding and I get really sweaty as I try to remember what I'm about to say because as soon as someone says ""My name is ________, how can I help you today?"" I will automagically forget everything I had rehearsed in my head. Hearing ""this call is being recorded for quality control purposes"" makes me even more nervous because it makes me think that they are evaluating and judging *me* even though I rationally understand it's probably the specialist being evaluated.

The same goes for leaving messages. Sometimes I think this is even worse than getting a live person because I know that whatever stupid things I say are recorded and can be listened to and replayed many times. Once I hear the beep it's time for me to go but I simply end up stammering and trying to piece together ideas that I wanted to say (probably in the wrong order, too). The worst thing is I'll hang up when I think I'm done and I won't remember what I said and what I wanted to say but forgot.

This anxiety doesn't stop at phones. I am also horribly afraid of (inflated) balloons. Just the rubber ones, not the aluminum ones. When I see a balloon I freeze up because I know it could pop at any instant without any warning. **Seeing a balloon makes me want to talk on the phone all day with complete strangers.** I have been ~~forced~~ persuaded to play ""balloon popping"" games where the objective is to pop as many as possible and I basically end up with a panic attack, and when I explain that I'm afraid of balloons nobody takes me seriously. I mean my sister has even threatened to blow up a balloon and pop it if I don't do what she says, so I am forced to comply. I wish I could get therapy for this but I don't have enough money or time (as I'm in university).

I thought I had another close friend, but he was telling that same circle of friends what I had been confiding to him all along. 

So I feel betrayed.  My family is falling apart.  My stepdad has been cheating on my mom and was recently found out.  I broke up with my boyfriend (it was mutual) two weeks ago.  

I'm in grad school right now. I made a huge mistake.  I don't want to do what I'm going for anymore and I'm in a very specialized field so if I want to change careers I have to go back to school.  I'm in a ton of debt so I can't go back to school.

When I try to talk to family about my problems, my mom just says ""God has a plan for you."" Which is almost insulting and is certainly infuriating since I don't believe that at all.

Granted, these people don't casually appear overnight. I would just try and strike up as many conversations with as many different people and try see if anything works out.

Don't get bummed over it. One of my teachers went to University of New Orleans then went to grad school at Yale, it can happen.


Keep that rejection letter with you and let it fuel your desire to enter it, let it give you the energy to get good grades.

310,h7bqzo,False,,5,Speaking about my teenage problems,whatsbotheringyou,"My name is Javonte and I’m a 15 year old boy who’s a nerd that has no life and is socially awkward. I know this might just be a teenage problem but I need to talk about it somewhere. Since I’m socially awkward I have no friends, no life, or no girlfriend all I do is sit in my room watching YouTube and play whatever game I can find on my xbox of course with no friends. 

  I really want to fix these issues but it’s hard for me because I have no one to talk to about this. I’m starting to think about what my future is going to be like whenI try to go for a career if I can't even hold a conversation for more than 10 seconds or will I be able to have a wife and kids( I doubt many females like awkward guys). Having no friends also gave me low self esteem so I tend to avoid having to talk to people because I don’t want to make it awkward so I become socially distant even from family. 

  My awkwardness probably came from my hard time being vulnerable that’s why I’m speaking about my problems on Reddit( it was hard enough for me to write this) and not to my mother because her words won’t really help it’ll feel bland and not very sincere(it’s because I live with her and she knows everything about me except this) I also feel like I’ll be judge upon in a bad way from many people. The answer would be to obviously speak to people more but it’s harder than it looks because I’ve been dealing with as long as I can remember and I can’t just do it because my mind will start to think negatively and I’ll look down upon myself thinking that they probably think I’m weird and strange for whatever reason. 

  I don’t want to be like this forever and I know I have to put effort and work into fixing it but it’s extremely difficult for me and I’m sure how.

782,1ypjvz,False,,17,Have you seen the opening scene from Idiocracy?,whatsbotheringyou,"That feels like my life right now. I've been feeling very lonely lately and I am watching each of my friends get everything right the wrong way, while I sit here doing things (mostly) right and I'm getting everything wrong.

All I've ever wanted in life is to raise a family. I'm not a crazy girl; I've known people who have their marriage collage they created when they were ten who have been dreaming about getting that perfect rock from whatever man is pleased enough with them to ask them to spend the rest of their lives together - that's not me. I'm not baby crazy. I just want to meet a great guy that can be my partner and equal and wants to raise a family like I do.

Meanwhile, all of my friends are irresponsibly and accidentally getting pregnant, having children, and somehow finding their happiness in all of this. I'm not talking about ""best-of"" happiness, I'm not simply trolling their Facebook pages and looking at the surface of their edited lives, we're talking about people I'm very close to that I know well. People whose houses I spend time in and not as a guest. They really are pretty happy. Not perfect, nobody is, but happy.

Why do I have to be the one watching everyone else get what I want in life simply because I'm responsible with my birth control and discerning about my choice of bed partner? Why am I alone when I'm the only one of us working on personal growth and trying to better myself to be in a great position to achieve my goals? I'm the only one of my friends that even knows anything about children at ALL and yet they're popping them out like candy.

Please understand, this is a moment of weakness. Normally I let these things slide off and I understand that it simply isn't going to happen yet; what I'm doing is still right. I'm not going to poke holes in the condom of the next guy whose dick I trip over just for a fleeting chance at happiness. I know I'm on the right path, even if it's taking longer for me than it is for so many others. I am truly happy for their successes, it would not make me feel any better if they were failing.

It's just hard some days.

Some weeks.

In addition to this, a close friend of mine placed me firmly but gently in to the friend zone. That's a story in and of itself. He's not put off by my family attitude - in fact, that's something we agree on - but there are mitigating circumstances. It simply adds to my frustration in that...well, a guy who is up to the standards I would require of a future partner and father, someone perhaps a bit more attractive than I think I deserve, with all of these great qualities...isn't interested enough to give it a try. It's a blow to the ego, no matter the circumstances.

I know what to do about it, I'm just looking for a little bit of understanding. I obviously can't take this to either him or any of my friends with children without it being somewhat awkward, so I entreat you to give me some sorely-needed compassion. I just need an e-hug. Thank you.

TL;DR - Everyone is having babies except for me and I'm sad about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1ypjvz/have_you_seen_the_opening_scene_from_idiocracy/,11,"I hate to say this, but that opening scene could end up being your life, if you don't do some rather drastic shit soon.

I am trying to get you to be a little more realistic and I'm pretty sure baby fever talk will ward off potential partners if you bring it out too soon.

853,9c794y,False,,6,I was dumped,whatsbotheringyou,"I was just dumped by my girlfriend last night, and I don't know what to do. ""I can't really say I'm in love with you"" is what she said. This just came out of nowhere and I feel like I can't breathe. The day before yesterday I thought we were still madly in love, now I'm heartbroken. 

&#x200B;

I just wish I knew what went wrong. I wish she would tell me that I did something wrong, tell me that I fucked up, tell me I had abhorrent personality traits, at least then I could make \*some\* sense of it. But she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. She loves me but she's not \*in love\* with me anymore. How am I supposed to react to that? How can you say you love me on Sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on Friday? She keeps insisting that I didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am I supposed to understand that? I'm just hurt and confused.

&#x200B;

She stopped by my house last night to return some things I left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents I gave her for Valentines this year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent all night crying, I feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. 

&#x200B;

It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Whenever I was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. Despite all the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis, I always felt alright, because I knew that no matter what happened I had her beside me, and she made everything alright. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the year.

&#x200B;

The worst part is how nonchalant she was. She seemed just so apathetic about it. Our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and I was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. But when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. We were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. She said she doesn't see us having a future together; I saw us potentially getting married one day, I definitely saw a future with her. And she used to see one with me, I just don't know what changed.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with this. Without her I just feel dead inside. Just last week I was so happy, now I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, now I feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. She said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. I don't think I could ever find anyone else as amazing as her.

&#x200B;

The only one I feel like I can turn to at this moment is my best friend. They try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but I'm a crying mess right now, and I don't feel ready to try to date again.

Being young is like being stuck in a bubble- the bubbles of your parents/friends/community. You're probably bored with that bubble. College will definitely help to show you what more there is to the world. Maybe for now you should go out and do things you normally wouldn't do within your bubble. Talk to the kid you don't have anything in common with. Do you like sports? No? Go join one. Listen to music you think is bad, and then dance to it. Go explore and have an open mind.

I know my fear of learning and asking questions likely comes from when I was younger, and my mother would yell and scream at me for hours when I tried to do my homework (if I messed up the answer to a question). That makes it hard to actually focus on my work to this day.

They want you to succeed, they want you to prosper. Just tell them you're having trouble. Nobody utilizes office hours like they should and I just think its ridiculous. By far the biggest difference between high school and college, in my experience, is how far your instructors will go to make sure you're comfortable in their class and are keeping up. If your professors have office hours, just go by. Worst case scenario is they kind of blow you off. Maybe even let them know its a big deal to you because you're afraid of being wrong and needing to be told how to do things.

I tried to organize it a little bit so similar issues are near each other and it flows a little bit, but it's almost 3 am and I've been awake for 18 hours on 4 hours of sleep.

Just to preface this with a little bit about myself: I'm 23, in my sixth year of college and what should be my last year of engineering school. I grew up in an upper-middle class family. My parents pay for my rent, school, car insurance, gas, and cell phone. I had an internship over the summer and they liked my work enough that they're letting me work part time from school (about 10 hours away; they gave me a laptop and I connect remotely).

One of the classes I'm in is being offered for the last time this semester and I don't know what will happen if I don't pass. Everybody is expecting me to graduate in May, and I don't know if it will happen. I just want to be done with school, but I can't make myself put forth enough effort to pass any of my classes. I would love to talk to my family about it, but they don't seem to care. If I get a bad grade, all I hear from my parents is things along the lines of ""We know you can do better"" ""Are you talking to your professors and getting help"" and ""Are you still going to graduate on time."" I would talk to my professors, but when I actually do manage to do my homework, I procrastinate so much that there's no time for me to go see them. I was a straight A student through high school and got a 28 on my ACT so they expect me to be a straight A student in college. I mentioned that I was planning to stay at school and take one last class over the summer, and my parents' reaction was asking if I could take the class in the spring semester because they want to stop paying rent. I understand what they're doing for me is expensive, but there's no inquiry of why I'm taking a summer class. Even though I'm so close to finishing, I really just want to take time off of school and figure out my life.

My mom is also obsessed with losing weight. She lost a bunch of weight a few years ago and still complains about being fat (for the record, at this point she is probably underweight), but that's an issue she has to worry about. What bothers me about it is that she's always pushing me to lose weight. I want to lose weight, but I barely have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. At one point she said if I hit 250 lbs she would take me to get some form of weight loss surgery. I understand that she wants me to be healthy and live a long time, but the way she goes about it just makes me feel like a fat piece of shit.

And if that doesn't kill my self-esteem and confidence enough, I've never had a girlfriend, or even been on an actual date. One girl kissed me at a party once and I obsessed over that for a week. I have plenty of female friends, and I have no more problems talking to girls than I do guys, but I either can't read the signs when a girl is into me, or they just don't seem to be into me. I feel like part of my problem is that I suck at/hate small talk, but I'm so self-conscious about everything that I can't seem to carry a conversation unless I'm really comfortable with the person I'm talking to.

I seem to spend all of my time on Reddit, Netflix, or both. I used to love reading and video games, but now I get bored within a few minutes. The only game I seem to be able to play for extended periods is Fallout 4, but even that gets boring after an hour unless my friend is on Teamspeak with me. I remember when I was playing Fallout 3 and New Vegas I would just get sucked in and play all day and have a blast. I miss being able to do that. 

I feel like I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about my life. I tell my friends the ""fun"" stuff, but I seem to pretend that if I don't talk about what I'm really dealing with, it doesn't exist. It works great for evenings out, but it's not working long term. 

This post took me an hour to type when I really should be working on a lab report that's due in 5 hours. I haven't started, and the reports for this lab class take longer than that to get a passing grade on. At this point I'm just going to sleep for those 5 hours and force myself to go to class. It just all feels so pointless, especially this late in the semester.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3utqra/pretty_sure_i_have_depression_not_sure_what_to_do/,9,"OP I know you don't want to hear this, but try to get some exercise.

157,1pzfl0,False,,12,My dad is heartbroken because I accepted a job 100 miles away.,whatsbotheringyou,"**EDIT: The title should say 1000 miles away. Sorry about that..**

I am a 24 year old woman and I have been looking for a full time job in the creative field since i graduated from college last year. I also have been wanting to move somewhere new and see and experience more of the world. I've lived in Tennessee my whole life and I've never experienced living somewhere completely new and different. Just to the next town over for school. My boyfriend moved a thousand miles away for grad school, and we don't want to do long distance anymore. I got an offer at a company I really like where he is that is perfect for me. I accepted it today, and I have to be there on Monday. So it's pretty quick.

I told my dad about the job offer today and that I would be going, and he's really upset about it. My father is very traditional in that he grew up in a rural area where most people don't move more than a few miles from home after they get married and start a family. I've been taught my whole life that family and the farm we grew up is pretty much the most important thing on earth. Family sticks together and stays together.

He went to the same college 50 miles from where he grew up (and where I grew up). After he graduated, instead of moving to where he could have gotten an engineering career started, he moved home and helped his parents run the family business. And he got married, had a family and never left. He claims he has no regrets he chose to move home to take care of his parents. He felt it was his duty and privilege to do so and be there every day. (They both passed away over ten years ago.)

We are very alike in many ways, and he expected I would do exactly what he did with his life. But I've gotten an urge to go somewhere new and see the world. I am almost 25 and I want more out of life than the family business and family farm. I went to the same college he did and graduated and had to move home a few months after due to being unable to find a job in my field. Now he wants me to carry on the business and use my skills in the business to make pretty good money, or start my own business. But that's not really what I want to do. Not right now, anyway. And I have no friends here. Just my dad and cousins and younger brother. (And the place he lives is 20-25 minutes by car to town. It's very isolated, but a beautiful place to call home.)

My mother and I are estranged, and she hasn't really been in the picture for half of my life. When she left us, he made a lot of sacrifices to take care of us as a single father. His whole life is focused around me and my brother. And he sees me as ungrateful for all he's done for me. He always tells us that the farm is ours when he is gone, and he's saved all of it for us, his children. But it feels like the price of his gift of raising me is living up to his expectations and the life as he's planned out for me.

I told him about the job, and he got really quiet and acted like I'd broken his heart and betrayed him. He knew that I was looking to move there, but I think he didn't expect it to happen. I am going against everything he raised me to be, and he believes I don't care about family like he does.

He also isn't ok with me moving to the city my boyfriend is living in, and staying with him. Our relationship is pretty serious, but we aren't engaged or anything. I think this is the right thing for my life, though, and I just wish he could be emotionally supportive. It's already a scary transition, having to make new friends and start over somewhere new. His negativity and complete disapproval of my choices makes it seem 10 times harder. I feel like I owe my dad so much for the good live he's given me, and I feel awful for hurting him.

**tl;dr** I am not living up to my dad's expectations of living on the family farm and working in his small town family business. I accepted a job offer in the city where my boyfriend is in grad school and he's very upset with me and I feel awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1pzfl0/my_dad_is_heartbroken_because_i_accepted_a_job/,19,"Yikes, yeah, that zero makes a big difference.

769,28gdjo,False,,5,I am an incredibly ungrateful child.,whatsbotheringyou,"So, I'm probably a terrible person. I'm 15, and I've been routinely stealing money for my parents, for no better reason other than 'I want sweets' and 'I just want money'. My mother found out, and she came and talked to me the most upset she's ever been. I'm extremely disrespectful to my parents; I ignore them and stay in my room when I come home from school, and I know that I am incredibly up myself in terms of I think I know everything. and the worst thing is, though their parental methods have maybe been a bit harsh (sometimes being gently hit, yelled at a lot), they don't really deserve it. They really do a lot for me, pay money for me to go to an expensive school and go on extra curricular programs and what-not even though my mother revealed that we are apparently not as well off as I believed. 

What I need to know is this:
a) How I can fix my relationship with my parents
b) Stop habitually stealing from them,
c) Generally fix above mentioned personality flaws.

It has around a 6% overall acceptance rate, so I was never terribly optimistic in the first place, but I really fell into the delusion that they would accept me. I'm honestly not upset about the decision itself, but rather I'm a bit angry with myself about how I'm at peace with this. The reality is that with this rejection I need to take the next two or three weeks to write the remainder of my college applications and do well on my finals, but it's just not sinking in quite yet. I know I need to finish this semester strong, but it's honestly hard, especially when I counted on my acceptance as almost insurance for the remainder of the year. I don't need to hear that I'm still a strong student, because I am proud of my standardized testing and the culmination of my four years of high school but I'm a bit at a loss for words right now.

895,2pvdqf,False,,3,Lost,whatsbotheringyou,"So I have been in a depressed state for over a year now, I'm 23 and and I recently just dropped out of college to try and get my life together. My girlfriend and I broke up a little over a year ago and I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything anymore. For the first time in my life I was able to be completely comfortable with someone and be myself, no reservations. We dated for close to 3 years and I admit I wasn't the best boyfriend. I became too comfortable with my position in life at the time and had started to take her and other things in my life for granted. So she graduated in the spring of this year and ended up moving back home, about a 14 ish hour drive. Even though we broke up a year ago and she graduated this spring, we had been talking every day and hooking up still but she was also talking to another guy back home. So of course she ends up dating this guy as soon as she moves back home and I feel like absolute shit. They broke up after only a couple months of dating and we have still been talking on and off while they were dating because we were very close and shared a real connection. She says she loves me but she is scared for what could happen to us because of the situation we were in before and how it negatively affected both of us. And although I can't argue with her on that point because we ended on a stupid fight that was my mistake, I know in my heart that this is the girl that I am supposed to marry and I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore for myself. Nothing seems worth the effort to me anymore, I don't find humor in anything and I am overall just filled with regret day after day for over a year now. I've hooked up with other girls and hung out with friends more and done all the moving on advice, I have even gone to therapy for about 7-8 months and took the pills they gave me but it didn't seem to do anything for me. I felt like an emotionless zombie while I was taking the pills and no matter what I did that day I would always be lying in bed for a few hours thinking what could have been and what should have been if I wasn't such a shitty person and took advantage of the great opportunity I had in front of me. Now I don't even care what happens to me. My uncle committed suicide nearly 25 years ago and I don't think I could do that to my family and my Dad after what they have been through with all of that. So I have been talking to this girl a lot recently over the past month or so and she just got back together with her new boyfriend after breaking up with him less than a month ago. She talks about moving back down here when she has the money saved up in a few months because she doesn't enjoy living back in her hometown. And part of me believes her because we talk so much and I know she doesn't like it there from her job to her situation at home with her stepdad. She tells me she doesn't know what she wants from her new relationship with her ex boyfriend now that they are dating again but I know if she were to give us and me another chance, I could be everything and more she has ever wanted. It's just if I am not her everything, I might as well be nothing. And I know it sounds sad to feel like your happiness is so dependent on another person but I really haven't been happy my whole life. I remember in high school before I ever met this girl in college I got so drunk over spring break and locked myself in a bathroom threatening to kill myself. Honestly I don't consciously remember doing that but I know that there was probably a reason behind it and that these suicidal thoughts and depression were something that was ingrained in me without myself really knowing they were there. I just feel that I could get my life on track and make myself and my significant other so happy if she would just give me the chance. I don't know what else I can say to her that I already haven't to try and prove to her how serious I am about us and our relationship. She even went as far to say recently, while she just got back with her boyfriend, that she wants me to be the father of her children and spend the rest of our lives together because it is something I know we both deeply want and have talked about multiple times while we dated for 3 years. I just feel so lost and do not know what to do with my life, I feel I have the wits and capabilities to do anything this world offers me but I could not care less unless I am sharing my life with her. I know things are supposed to get better with time but every single night for over a year I think about her and just fill myself with regret for what I let slip away. I feel I don't deserve to live anymore because I haven't done anything significant with my life and I haven't thoroughly enjoyed anything for multiple months. Right now I am at the point where I have realized that not everybody can live a happy life and I will just be floating on feeling like shit until I eventually die one way or another. When you know nothing else will make you happy but you can't get the one thing in the world that will make you feel like you are worth something, what are you supposed to do with the rest of your life?

483,1qyt38,False,,11,"My roommate is pregnant and in jail. Now I'm home alone with her boyfriend, who I hardly know.",whatsbotheringyou,"This is suuuuch a long story so there may be a wall of text. Bare with me.

So I'll start with this. My pregnant roommate is E and her boyfriend is A.

We met A when E and I first moved to Idaho from California. He was quiet, shy, but really cool. So fast forward until about two months ago. E and A start dating and he tells her that he had a malignant tumor removed from his testicles a couple years back, making it hard to produce children. E has ALWAYS wanted kids, but she accepted it and continued the relationship. So about 3 weeks ago, I went to go buy a pregnancy test for myself and she mentioned she hasn't gotten her period in over a month, but she wasn't even considering that she could be pregnant, given A's medical history. I bought a 2 pack. One for me and one for her. Hers came back positive, mine negative. Even though she wanted to be married first, she was ecstatic. How could she not be? The guy only had a 7% chance to make a baby, right?

He's sleeping as this is happening, so she goes to wake him up to tell him the amazing news! What does he do? Wakes up, acknowledges her, and goes right back to sleep. For someone that has that small of a chance to get someone pregnant, he sure seemed totally lax about it. 

Next day, he starts to seem more excited. Maybe he was just tired. Whatever. 

Recently, he's been giving E a lot of shit for staying in contact with her ex husband. Totally acceptable. She still talks to him for multiple reasons. He is the one person that knows her best in this world, and he has being seeing a therapist due to his military related PTSD and she wants to make sure he's doing okay. They don't talk often.

He has threatened to leave of she doesn't cut him out of her life. She tried explaining that she would like to ween herself off him, because he has always been her best friend. A has threatened to leave her, pregnant or not, multiple times. 

So today, I got a Facebook message from someone that has deleted their profile, so it just said ""Facebook User"" with no picture or anything. This is what it said:  

""Tell your friend. (E) to check her messages in the OTHER folder I sent her a very informing message.. or better yet you send it to her if you care about your friend.

Just to let you know [A] has a kid he prolly hasn't even mentioned to you.. he hadn't mentioned to me neither. He is a pathological liar and most of the things that comes out of his mouth are nothing but lies.. he is what? 30 now and has accomplished nothing and you seriously need to get Tested for Hep B and HPV im just letting you know for your babys sake or unless he lied about that too. He is a cheeter and lies to make himself look cool. He prolly even told you he wrote a song about you and its the same song that he sings to every girl.. wich he doesn't play well at all. You will see his true colors eventually girl im just giving you a heads up. All he does is live off of others and cause drama. He even slept with his brothers wife and prolly still does. I was only 17 when we were together and he was 29 but told me he was 22.. keep that in mind. you need to look in his facebook messages so you can see what he has been writing to me saying he is just with you because he doesn't want to be alone and other things... go check it out... His brother was the one who told me about his kid he doesn't even try to see so I contacted the girl and she told me he was running from child support and not once has he seen his daughter but yet he tells people he cant have kids because he has ball cancer wich is a total lie by the way! her name is lauren magby if you want to look her up and ask her about it. 


give her this message please!! thank you! (:""


So, naturally, I tell E about it. 

Long story short, they fought and he grabbed a knife and threatened to kill himself, blah blah, he trie to take her laptop from her so she pushed him. Then when she read Facebook messages of him blatantly flirting with other girls that were sent TODAY, she threw a styrofoam cup of coffee at him and now she's in fucking jail. He officially moved in about 2 weeks ago, so I just have to deal with him...and I can't believe a fucking word that comes out of his mouth now...  

Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have extreme confrontational anxiety. But when a knife became involved, I went in to where they were (in her bathroom) and said, ""Did I just hear there's a fucking knife involved now!?""

A: ""No""

E: ""Yes, he sitting on it!""

A: Wo cares, I'll only be hurting myself!""

Me: ""Are you seriously implying that killing yourself wouldn't hurt her!?!?""

A: ""She's going to leave me!""

Me: ""Anytime I've heard any mention of anyone leaving, it's been YOU threatening to leave HER! She is fucking pregnant! Man the fuck up!!!"" 
Then I left for work.

Sorry, needed to get this off my chest because I normally vent to E.

You choose the people in your life, if your concern is evicting him will cause him to be all dramatic you're probably right. So finding a safe way to take care of the situation but still removing him is probably a good path to go down.

61,g7fhoz,False,,9,I learned how to set boundaries and it made me realize how toxic and manipulative my friend/roommate has been towards me.,whatsbotheringyou," Hello,

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships.

Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. 

I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 1: Accused of stealing butter [https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4](https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4)

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years.

443,34iw04,False,,6,pregnant ex gf,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry it's long.  

Moved to a city with a girl about a year ago. Before moving, in the early stages of our relationship, I got her pregnant.  We were using, minimally and incorrectly, various forms of contraceptive...it was stupid and bound to happen. We talked about options and went with abortion.  It was a hard decision that neither of took lightly, on the contrary, it is a very heavy decision to make.   
So fast forward a few more months, we decide that we are the real deal and that our early tribulations are only a testament to our devotion, yada yada yada...moved across the country for a change of scenery and to kill time (i'm working on getting into professional school in the mean time).   
A few months in, our relationship heads south- the details do not really mean anything to this story, only that it's turned south for me meaning I am the one falling out of love, not her. I end up breaking up with her, but we still have a lease together and still really only ave each other in this new city. So to avoid breaking lease, which we couldn't afford, we just rode the lease out. Me sleeping on the couch a lot (we had a 600sq ft apt).  Now, there was no animosity or real contempt or anything. I just fell out of love with her and made it clear that once the lease is over, I'll be gone. She said she would rather spend this time with me doing fun things together than just to lose me now and possibly never see me again (i had plans to move back across country having gotten into my professional school) Under this pre-condition, we still spent lots of time together. We slept together once every couple of weeks, sometimes more sometimes less.  This went on for the months of february and march, I left in april.   
We haven't talked much since I've been home.  I've gotten over the relationship. It's harder for her.  We have mostly stopped talking. Until yesterday. She texts and calls. It was my birthday yesterday. I didn't want drama. I didn't respond. She sends a text this morning.  She is pregnant. She didn't want to tell me like that, but I didn't answer my phone when she called.  She sounded angry. Then she told me she is just angry at herself.  She had lied to me about taking her birth control for the month of march (even though I made a point to ask every time- sorry but she really sucked at taking the pill when she first started on it was necessary).  
I just can't even... why? It's so silly and so irresponsible.  She has told me not to worry about it. She is having another abortion in a couple days. She doesn't want my help, she says. She can do it on her own, she says.   It's all arranged.  I don't know what to do. I've made myself available to her (i told her this). If she needs anything I told her to let me know. Is this enough?  I know I share responsibility, but I'm angry that she lied to me about the birth control... i just don't, like why the fuck... it doesn't matter though. What's done is done. Happy birthday to me and my unborn children. fuck.

I absolutely see myself marrying him, raising a family with him, growing old and wrinkly and incontinent with him. The works. My family adores him, plans on him being an in-law, and I feel very welcomed and loved by his family as well. There are not enough good things I can say. 

That all being said, I have a nagging worry. When my BF first went off to college, he went to an exclusively engineering-centered college. Long story short, he hated it, got very depressed, and essentially flunked out. It probably didn't help that I'm going to a different school but am doing absolutely fantastic and love it. He's been nothing but supportive, but I can only imagine that it would be hard for him (I guess the mentality of, it seems so easy to her, why can't I do that?) 

Over the past year, he got back in touch with a great connection and is now pursuing a completely different degree. It won't be easy, but it plays into a part of his life he is very passionate about. Since being accepted and getting ready to leave (in just a few days!) he is acting similarly to the way he was when we first started dating. Very happy, more energy, even just a different look in his eye. This really helps me feel like he's in the right place, but I'm still scared. 

He says that what caused his downfall at the last school was that he'd either get bored with a class or confused or whatever and just stop showing up. He'd start gaming and just not go to class. He's got a lot more pressure now (everyone is keeping a closer eye on him, and not wanting to let the person down after they helped him get set up with the school), but I just hope that's enough.

I'm also afraid to tell him that there's a lot more at stake here than people being disappointed. He knows that my mom's ""blessing"" for us to marry is important to me...while she adores him, she has said in the past that if he can't, for lack of a nicer phrase, get his shit together, she personally feels that I shouldn't promise a future with him. I understand her reasoning, and while a marriage is so much more than a career or an income, her input has always been valuable and, honestly, spot on. 

Part of me doesn't want to talk to him about this because I don't want him to feel like we are anticipating him to fail or add more stress. But at the same time, I feel like this is a big deal and I kind of want reassurance from him. 

It's just been, you know, bothering me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3h9rdx/my_boyfriend_is_leaving_for_college_deep_down_im/,16,"Struggling with our own ambitions is an issue that can take a lifetime to tackle and even then many don't find it.

The only thing you can really do is be supportive and honest. If he's fucking around sometimes a helpful push back on track can be amazing. Just don't nag about it or anything if the problem arises instead just try to open his eyes and hope he makes the right choices.

I find there's nothing wrong with bringing it up, it opens up the channels of communication. Want to marry the dude someday? Get used to tough conversations. It's really important to have them and be open with each other cause the other roads a bad one.

He's probably anxious as shit about it too, talking might be therapeutic for both of you. It's all about how you approach it, hey I want to talk about stuff and see where your thoughts are is nice. HEY FUCK YOU DONT FUCK THIS UP THIS TIME CAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKUP is an extreme version but it's the same conversation in a very negative way.

He's gonna get bored and confused again, shit always happens. Hell instead of diligently working I'm posting this right now. It's very hard to stay on track for extended periods of time. He's gotta make sure he's tackling this in a new way or he'll fall into the same traps. It's a fair concern and nobody should be upset that their SO brings it up. (Nicely) ",2015-08-17 03:03:20

Last Monday, I woke up and had a pretty bad mood already, from the fact I had to do homeschool that day and I had quite the headache. My grandparents live across the street. I go look out the window to see my aunt’s massive Toyota van there. I was rather disgruntled, because my aunt is incredibly entitled. She hasn’t been following any of the measures meant to slow the spread of coronavirus. She hasn’t been wearing a mask in public, and she didn’t self-quarantine for the mandatory 14 days, and she both came from and showed in up hot spot states (Massachusetts and New York, respectively). Her local Walmart had 41 employees test positive for COVID-19, and she definitely didn’t wear a mask. This would’ve been just a coincidence, albeit a rather bad one, if not for the events I’m about to mention. My grandparents both came home from the hospital last weekend (grandfather for a urinary tract infection, and grandmother for rather extreme constipation). On Friday morning, an ambulance showed up over there. My mom went over there and found out why the ambulance was over there and also my entitled aunt mentioned that she had noticed a cough. As of right now, we aren’t sure if he has COVID, because he often coughs while eating and other times to clear his throat. And did I mention that he is a VERY high risk person, as he is going to be 87 in June, and relies on others for his most basic needs.

Have you tried understanding why you don't have any friends? It's maybe only because you're maybe shy. Be more outgoing, talk to people, especially the ones you have common interests with you. It'll be much easier to find friends that way. You could also spend more time on studying, and watching YouTube videos on topics you struggle might help you understand the topics better.

I always check on some of my close friends regularly after a week or so. Three weeks back I started working on a project and gaming in my free time. Today, I checked my cell phone after three weeks and I haven't received a single call or message from any of my friends or family. All my messages have been read but I never received a response from them. I know people are busy and not everyone is into texting. Even I'm not a fan of it. I realized that my conversations were always one sided. I was actually prying in their life and trying to ask about their well being. I saw their stories and posts, everyone is having a nice time with their family. I have lost the zeal to do anything more and keep myself sane. I tried going back to gaming but in the end it's still bothering me. Can someone provide some suggestions for coping with this loneliness?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/g4cdr7/all_my_friends_eventually_forgot_me/,31,"Got the same struggles, a thing I did was just spontanesouly visit them and force them to hang out with you for a while, maybe makes them realize the good times youre having together (text a few mins before or call) ",2020-04-19 18:11:43
750,2sjbrw,False,,3,I just wanted to tell a story to you guys.,whatsbotheringyou,"So on a throwaway, I had posted on this subreddit about some issues I was struggling with. I had first gone to family, friends, and church. At the time I had felt like I was interrupting people's days, and was just being selfish and petty. 

I have since gotten past the issues that I had originally posted. The responses that I received were just the encouragement that I needed to keep on trucking, and keep on moving forward. So to all of you responders, I wanted to say thank you. You're truly helping people. 

For those of you that are currently posting, keep posting! If it's important to you, it's important to us.

224,1j7ij1,False,,10,I attempted suicide today.,whatsbotheringyou,"And I feel I'll do it again shortly, the only thing stopping me today was that I was interrupted by an unexpected phonecall from someone who cares, but very little has changed about my situation.  
I'm twenty-two with two serious mental disorders, one is constantly stigmatized and portrayed everywhere as something dangerous and so I feel ashamed and scared to talk about it lest I hurt future employment opportunities, and the other only doctors accept is real, the public doesn't.  When you have an illness that affects every aspect of your personal life from who your friends can be, to your diet, when you can leave the house, what do you tell someone who asks about your employment when you know they'll brush you off as a lazy, incompetent youth who needs to suck it up?  What if I try and then am fired, over and over again for things not my fault, how would that look on employment records?  

Also I said something extremely rude indirectly to a friend and someone I deeply respect recently while I was intoxicated for a medication I'm on, and hearing how much it upset them today put me in so much shame that I couldn't bear it, and it was just a final straw to a very large pile that's been growing on me for a long time.  I feel even further shame that I almost killed myself without apologizing to them for being so rude, and still wouldn't hesitate to do so now.  I imagine I'll send them a suitable apology soon, god I hope they forgive me and that I haven't hurt them permanently.  Why was I such an idiot, I should have just turned the computer off after taking my pills.  And then I dragged someone into my own idiocy by accident, I'm sorry friend.  It was all my fault and I hope they aren't upset with you

The funny thing is, the incident that started my final step today?  Taking these fucking pills that turn my filters and smart functioning part of my brain off. I'm typing this all after having just taken one and so this will send me further into shit like these always do.  I hate them but I need them right now or I'm going to die... I just wish they would make my unconscious functioning brain not such a fucking asshole.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1j7ij1/i_attempted_suicide_today/,19,">attempted

253,1v84ds,False,,19,A close friend of mine wants me to 'get my act together' before he dates me.,whatsbotheringyou,"I'm not sure if I'm being illogical, so I wanted to ask the people of /r/whatsbotheringyou for advice.

Firstly, I'm a 21 year old college senior majoring in Psych. The first 3 years of my college career went quite well- I worked in two research labs, got a grant to do my own research, joined the McNair Scholars program, started an honors thesis, and a worked towards a bunch of other academic pursuits. It was stressful, but I was lucky enough to not need to work, so I could devote all of my time to my studies.  However, I burned myself out and got depressed towards the start of my third year in college. I ended up withdrawing from 2 semesters of classes, and I watched my dreams of going straight from my B.S. to a PhD program deteriorate. I'm doing far better now, but I still have a lot to work on. 


I have to pass the quantitative section of my GRE and get my apartment in order. (My depression pretty much confined me to my room, and the rest of my apt suffered for it). I also gained about 20 pounds due to eating takeout all the time. 


I have a close friend who has expressed a bit of interest in dating me, but I'm starting to get frustrated at the conditions he's decided to place. He told me that before we start any type of relationship he 'wants to see me get my act together'. He wants me to lose the 20 pounds, get my apartment in order, get  into a Master's program, and start wearing make-up again. I feel like he should be more patient- studying for the GRE is taking up most of my day, and I don't want to get involved in so many things that I fall apart again. 

His life isn't completely together, hell, he dropped out of college. I don't expect him to change anything. Is it wrong of me to feel like he only wants to date me if I'm perfect?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1v84ds/a_close_friend_of_mine_wants_me_to_get_my_act/,20,"I feel like this guy is trying to push you to do better. I could be completely wrong, but it just sounds like he's putting goals on you so you can get the things you want before you two start dating, that way he doesn't distract you from the things that were important to you in the first place. He might feel as if he would cause you to put everything else aside for him.
But like I said that could just be my idea. ",2014-01-14 22:16:44
622,a4o3fw,False,,4,"Broke up with my gf, got completely trashed at my works christmas Party and living alone for the first time...I think that’s my low point.",whatsbotheringyou,"I moved in with my gf of 3 years into a perfect apartment. We got very lucky with that. 
Everything’s was going well. 
I found a new job, was happily living with my gf until the last couple of months everything went to shit. 

She was completely focused on her job, working late every night and was the kind of person who didn’t love to take care of other people. 
We decided to break up. 
Her parents helped her move out like a week later and I was stuck in a half empty apartment until i found a new flat. 

It was really hard focussing on work during this time. 

Now last Friday was our big Christmas party and I (a student who works part time) was one of the last guests. I have a little blackout and don’t know how I behaved during this hour. 
I remember sitting right at the end with our young CEO (37) completely trashed, too and I was so dumb to say something like „haha, I guess „name“ is done, too. Perfect“. 
I felt super good and had good conversations with everybody, still I’m really worried what happened during this hour. 
I don’t know, if I passed out, fell, danced, had a good time or bad time. 
I think I’m getting fired for the first time tomorrow and I’m freaking out. 

The only thing im hoping for, is, that since I was there until the end, it couldn’t have been that bad. If I would‘ve been really rude or misbehaved, they would’ve asked me to leave.

733,9bdzhb,False,,16,I can't feel love.,whatsbotheringyou,"I don't think I'm capable of feeling love. What's it feel like? How do you know if someone loves you?

I'm not a mean person, I help others when I can, but because of what I went through as a kid (I'm 55 now) I think I stopped feeling love. I'm gay, and I've been through a lot just because of that. I truly love others, but I don't think I've *felt* love in 30 years or so.

I'm not saying ""nobody loves me."" They do. They say it to me. I just don't feel it. I'm numb. 

I've always had to take care of myself. My family has always been ""hot and cold"" toward me because of my gayness so I could never depend on them for solid support.

So, what does love feel like? How do I recognize it? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/9bdzhb/i_cant_feel_love/,11,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDJIFu\_WSaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDJIFu_WSaE) ,2018-08-29 22:33:05
