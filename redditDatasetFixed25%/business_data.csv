For example, the brand’s Pomegranate Blueberry Juice contains 61 grams of sugar, or 50 percent more sugar than a 12-ounce can of Pepsi, despite not having any sugar added.


I laughed hard at that, because only an idiot could misinterpret what ""no sugar added"" means. 

So you have apple juice, a fruit with a high level of natural sugars (fructose). Pepsi did not add any sugar to the juice, which is common practice, to sweeten the taste. So the claim of no sugar added is valid.  NOTE: the claim is not ""No sugar"", it's ""No sugar added"".

However, if this juice were not natural, they might have to synthesize the flavors, and that might require adding sugar to take the place of what the natural juice would provide.

This seems so utterly brain dead, it's hard to know where to start. ",2016-10-05 01:44:20

It came within 8 hours. Almost everything from Newegg came within 24 hours. Luckily I was able to resist getting things from them. 

Reliably getting things within usually 3 business days makes me pay a premium to a good extent for Newegg over other stores (it's usually 48 hours to where I currently live). When it was within 24 hours, even more of one. UPS ground usually is within 24 hours if you live within 6 hours worth of Interstate driving to your location. 

This is where I stopped using Amazon. Their free $25 saver is no longer fast. Most of my stuff arrives nowadays towards the end of their shipment estimate, which happens to be around 21 days. Their standard rate is, but I used to really love their free saver. So, if Newegg costs $5-8 more, I get it from them instead if it's not Egg Saver. Even Egg saver is quicker than Amazon Free Saver.

They counted people dying of unknown causes as corona virus victims. Therefore any deriving numbers and models from the death count is false.

The lockdown was suggested by the same people, who came up with the flawed models.

Are they talking about the kind of offices where all spaces are shared and you don't have desk assignments? Or are they simply talking about not having cubicles? 

Personally, I went from a company that did cubicles to a company with a more modern office where there's a short wall on one side and a cubby on the other so there's a little separation, but much more open. We still have our own desls. Then we moved into an even newer office and all cubicle walls were gone completely  because we were instead each given ""standing desks"" that have an electric motor so you can stand or sit. It doesn't really work well with cubicle walls because the desk height can change.

In the newest office, our standing desks were smaller than our older desks. So what they did is allotted the same amount of sq feet per person in real estate, and since our desk spaces were smaller they used the leftover space for a bunch of collab seating and lounges everywhere.

And I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit on this article. Our office is phenomenal and the workplace culture is a million times better than where I used to work, and even better compared to some team members we have in my current company that are in a 20 year old office up north that still uses the cubicles. They're a bunch of recluses who hate each other and do shit work because they don't learn to get better from each other. Most of them even have a mirror in their cubicle so they can see if anyone is behind them. Shady.  ",2018-08-21 15:53:17

The real issue is class action lawsuits, in which the consumer gets shafted and the lawyers make a killing.  
Real class action reform would not come in the form of favoring arbitration over lawsuits (or vice versa) but in requiring that attorneys’ fees in class action suits be paid in the same form as the payment to consumers and requiring that people opt-in to join a class, rather than having to actively opt-out.
Ending payment of attorneys’ fees in cash but consumers getting coupons (which are only good one buys more of the alleged wrong-doing firms’ products/services) would ensure consumers get a fair shake.  This would hurt the lawyer lobby, and thus most Democrats (and many Republicans) would never support it.
Requiring people to opt-in to class-action suits (rather than go through a long process of opting-out) would reduce the number of frivolous class action suits.  Again, this would hurt the lawyer lobby, and thus most of our politicians wouldn’t support it.
In short, it comes down to most Democrats favoring the lawyer lobby over the business lobby, and most Republicans favoring the opposite.
