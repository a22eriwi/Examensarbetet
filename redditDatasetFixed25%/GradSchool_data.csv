One is really tempting and the program seems really good but only issue that is keeping me from accepting the offer is that  it doesn’t have health insurance. I checked their website and they do not even have subsidized health insurance at all for any graduated students.

It's often out of the hands of the actual program. That's more of a university-level decision. 

Really, you have to consider the cost of living. If you are getting 30k and rent should be less thank 1k.... that's likely easy. If you are moving to a costly area ::cough:: UCLA ::cough::, well.... good luck. You would need additional reassurances to ensure the next 4-6 years are comfortable.

317,d7pjj3,False,Professional,1,Citation and Common Knowledge Advice,GradSchool,"Hello World!

I am working on a cumulative/ e-portfolio project and I am wanting to include some “research” or “detailed notes” excerpts from my archive into a section displaying some of my previous projects. 

The majority of what I want to display doesn’t include traditional references but are from a professional online “course/training” from work as an intern.  

Though they are notes, they are delivered in a way that is highly detailed and formatted including diagrams and drawings that differ slightly from the original source, but the information is the same. 

TLDR: 

What I am stumped on is that in the field this would be common knowledge and I don’t want to professionally put out work that isn’t “mine”. However, the information obtained from the source is very concise, and I don’t want to muddle the work to claim it as my own. 


Question: How do I go about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/d7pjj3/citation_and_common_knowledge_advice/,1,"Cite the original source, as well as the online training source, but do not present something that is not your work as yours. ",2019-09-22 12:05:57
256,d58brg,False,Professional,80,On a scale from Leslie Knope to Jean Ralphio...,GradSchool,How douchey do you think it is to have diplomas framed in your office?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/d58brg/on_a_scale_from_leslie_knope_to_jean_ralphio/,139,"I appreciate the humor in your OP and I like that people are encouraging you. Let me give you another opinion though from a Bourdieusian cultural sociologist: 

Nothing says ""I don't belong"" or ""I'm really educated!"" like preemptively proving that you belong or are highly educated. 

In other words, whether you should do this or not really depends on your field (in both senses) but the higher status the field you are in, the less you want to hang up your diploma. Briefly, putting up your diploma shows that you think of the diploma as a significant accomplishment. But for an ACTUALLY high status person (not just a nouveau riche, or equivalent) getting such a credential is no big deal at all. 

So, by hanging up your diploma, you are basically sabotaging your own symbolic capital - the capital/advantages that come along with 'looking the part' and acting as if succeeding in a given field was perfectly natural and unconsciously achieved. Hanging it up might impress people - but it will only likely impress people with LESS cultural and symbolic capital than you (and therefore the people who can benefit you the least) because everyone with more capital than you will likely have the same or better credential anyway. 

Your diploma does not distinguish you from people with more educational/cultural capital than you. Rather, it distinguishes you from people with less. However, the important point here is the GROUP THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN. 

(All of this is not completely unrelated to why people like Steve Jobs wore jeans and T shirt to investors meetings where gazillions would be discussed etc... 'all in a day's work for someone as comfortable with this status/world as I am.' It's the overdressed people who out themselves as uncomfortable, like they don't REALLY belong there.)

Of course, I am not saying all of this is NECESSARILY true (as different fields have different logics). But this is one answer that I didn't see in the comments and wanted to share - after all, you have an advanced degree now! 

In summary: I'd look to see what your role models and mentors do and follow them. ",2019-09-16 23:09:32

329,a8pbq0,False,Professional,8,"I will soon be the last remaining ""senior"" lab member, being pressured to stay after graduation as a post-doc. What would you do in my situation? Help!",GradSchool,"In short, due to coincidental timing, a **huge** portion (~2/3) of my lab will be moving on by the end of next year either due to graduation, retirement, or opportunities elsewhere. All of the departures are on good terms and I legitimately like all of my coworkers. However, this includes the PI of the lab who planning retirement. Due to my experience in the lab (4+ years here), I seem to be a candidate for eventually taking over the lab. Indeed, at this point, the PI has already taken two steps back and offloaded many responsibilities to me (even though I am still technically a graduate student).

However, a few considerations:

* I enjoy the work, but over the past few years I've come to discover that I do **not** enjoy journal writing. My original plan was to enter industry, not become a post-doc.
* Is it normal to be concerned about the future of the lab? Since the departure of two post-docs (who have gone to form their own labs), I seem to be left holding too many of the keys.
* The funding situation is excellent, with the next several years already secured.
* The pay differential is worth considering. Personally, I would take a lower paying job to have a better work-life balance, but my University seriously gives post-docs ""the shaft"". The cost of living in my area is insane, and industry in my area *easily* compensates over double to what my University offers.

On one hand, I sincerely want the work that my lab performs to continue. I think the work we do has legitimate value to society in terms of potentially impacting lives. On the other hand, there are some ""cons"" associated with staying. If I stayed, I would: assume a mountain of administration duties, have to rebuild infrastructure to replace lost personnel, manage the remaining students, potentially teach a class once my PI retires, and of course all this with a post-doc salary.

709,bjxt2t,False,Finance,13,Supporting two people on a grad student stipend: Does our budget seem reasonable?,GradSchool,"I originally posted this on r/personalfinance but figured you guys may have some useful insights as well. 

Hubby and I are moving to San Diego this fall where I’ll be starting a PhD program. It is fully funded with a $34k (pre-tax) stipend, and I also will have subsidized housing through the university. I have no debt but he has $35k in student loans at 4.2%. We expect he’ll be making decent money once we move there, entry level jobs in his field are around $50-60k and the area’s job market is quite strong. We also have $20k in savings.

Our plan is to basically live off of my stipend and put most or all of his income toward debt payoff and savings/investments (and maybe the occasional vacation once his loans are gone). Here is our proposed monthly budget based solely on my income:

Income: $2833

Taxes: $300 (estimated based on an online calculator; I will not have to pay SS)

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities/internet)

Groceries: $500

Eating out: $100

Car: $0 (paid off, though it’s pushing 150k miles so not sure how much longer it will last)

Car insurance: $150

Gas: $75 (I will commute by bike, he will likely drive)

Phone: $50

Gym: $45

Health insurance: $0 (I’m covered by my university, he’s on his parents’ plan for the next year and hopefully his future job will offer insurance)

Fun/misc expenses: $300

Total expenses: $2620

Based on this budget we should have enough to live on via my stipend, with a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. His loans have a $200 minimum payment so we can always tap into our savings if he ever loses his job for a while. 

I’m not local to the area, so I’d like to know whether our proposed budget has any flaws or things that I’m forgetting?

I’ve been kicking butt all year- fellowships, travel awards, research grants with 2 more large ones pending. I ‘thought’ I made strides towards my research agenda this year, until last week.

Presented the beginning stages of a paper and pretty much got roasted (so it felt). I’m not going to lie- the people who even took an interest are tops in their field and provided amazing feedback, but dang! I fully expected it to be brutal, but not THIS brutal. I left feeling that meeting like I’m the biggest loser in my department and not grad school material. More importantly like I’m an absolute waste of time on their end. It’s been about 5 days and still can’t bring myself to look at more than a sentence of the written feedback they gave me. Not even the notes I wrote down during the meeting. 

I’m sure it’s equal parts imposter syndrome and just graduate school burnout in general. 

What has helped you get your head back in the game?

****Edit: thanks all for your posts and comments, but I think the main question I’m asking is getting lost in the message so I’ll ask it again: What has helped you get your head back in the game? You know, self care tips that have worked for you?

- yes I know I need to ‘suck it up’ and grad school is tough and life is tough but this also doesn’t mean that I am expected to dismiss how I feel. Further, this isn’t my first bout of rejection. Like I said before- this is a combination of imposter syndrome mixed with just general grad school burnout that is making it hard for me to find the energy to push through. I know what has happened as a good thing, but it still doesn’t dismiss the fact that  I feel like garbage about it. That in itself is my issue at the moment. Techniques for limiting burnout/imposter syndrome. 

I don’t expect to have a hand holding session by my professors, either. Thankfully one of the reviewers has been amazing with constructive feedback, so this isn’t really a hazing issue. It’s 100% my issue. We have those hazing a*hole professors here too, and you learn quickly who to steer clear from.

569,fdul3t,False,Research,1,Keeping up with many projects or focus on one,GradSchool,"Hi everyone. I didn't know whether to use the Research or Admissions flair. Let me elaborate.

My background is CS and I'm conducting research on deep learning models (this is so common these days Inactually feel kind of weird saying it). Anyway, I told my advisor on Monday that I'm going to opt out of my integrated program and graduate with a master's, and also apply to PhD programs abroad this year.

He advised me that I should really try and get a publication with me as the first author out before applying, as it's not typically expected that master's students have their own publications (unless you're going for the ""top schools"") but that it would really help me make a difference, and even if the submission doesn't work out it'll be good experience.

Long story short, I'm currently involved in three research projects. I'm starting to think that focusing on one and dropping the other two will be a good idea so I can focus. The projects to be dropped I don't really see myself doing long term anyway. The submission date is less than two months away btw.

744,a1c5rb,False,Finance,0,"Free food etiquette, ""from the other side""",GradSchool,"I am also a grad student and I like to eat. I have attended events where free food was a big part of my motivation, and I often eat my fill. And I like providing people with food and hate food waste.

However, now that I have been helping my advisor organize a conference at our school, we unfortunately had to ""kick out"" a few people who came just for the food and did so in a stupid, arrogant and/or disruptive way. So I would like to give some guidelines to new students at my school, and generally everyone interested in free food, to increase chances of actually getting food and avoiding getting kicked out and awkward situations. Of course, this is open to discussion and criticism, but here's what I've come up with from this experience:

\- If the attendees are paying to attend the event (e.g., it's a not-only-internal conference), you most likely can't just enter and help yourself. Don't try to lie your way in, or at least not in a stupid way - don't say you are an organizer / an organizer's student, because these people asking you who you are at the entrance are likely to be the organizers' students themselves or to call and check. There may be a back door through which you still can enter...

\- In any case, if you intend to mix in with the attendees, dress appropriately so that you don't stand out too much: at least it needs to be clean, without visible holes, and fancier than old sweatpants+sweatshirt. The standards may be higher if there are important guests (e.g., professors) from countries with higher clothing standards, such as most of Europe and Southeast Asia, and some organizers care to not be embarrassed about that. \[I am in Israel, where this especially needs to be said, but this should also be an important notice for many students in/from some other countries such as the US.\]

\- Eat politely and moderately enough to not attract attention. If there is only a little food (compared to the number of people present), don't try to stuff yourself, but only take one serving (until the attendees have finished eating).

\- Don't say anything offensive or controversial; if someone tries to make small talk with you, usually the best strategy is to get them to talk about their work.

\- If it is a sort of a sit-down meal, if tables and chairs are provided especially for the event, most likely the chairs and cutlery are counted and extra people will be noticed, and a problem as some of the actual attendees won't get a sensible place to sit. I just sent such extra, unregistered students (and some registered students who brought them) to eat in the hallway, where there happened to be some more tables and chairs, as we had a plenty of food so the only problem was sitting space, but some organizers may be less accommodating.

\- Usually the safest, easiest and most reasonable strategy (especially if you can't dress and behave properly and/or are in a totally different field of studies) is coming right after the meal, i.e. right after the beginning of the following lecture, after the attendees entered the lecture hall, and helping yourself to the buffet leftovers. Politely asking the servers, cleaners and such staff about leftovers should also be fine (unless you are in a place where the local law forbids it). Obviously, don't try to fill leftovers containers while the attendees are still helping themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/a1c5rb/free_food_etiquette_from_the_other_side/,25,,2018-11-29 00:25:42

This would, of course, be dependent on me actually finding a lab job of some type- if I'm going to take a year off, I should at least gain some relevant skills.

My goal is to become a professor at a PUI, but that's feeling less and less realistic every day and I'm starting to feel like I'll never have a career that I am passionate about and where I feel valued in my workplace.

To handle this, you likely need to add a line in the introduction mentioning what others in the field have already found on this topic (and where the gap of knowledge is), and in your discussion where you compare your findings to other papers. Sometimes you confirm previous work and sometimes you contradict previous work. If you contradict someone else's paper, it is good to discuss why this may be (e.g. we used X instead of Y, changing the context of those findings). Even if your work agrees with previous findings the discussion allows you to highlight what your study adds to the field. ",2020-06-07 09:22:36

I’m leaving this here because it’s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. 

We need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!

I'm a grad student; I have an assignment I'm not clear on. The prompt is to take a significant event from a year my parents or grandparents were born. Then, explain the events using the same source material, from three different historiographical approaches.   
In class, we discussed Ranke, Foucault, E.P. Thompson, Hume, Marx, and The Annales School. Yet, I'm still kind of stuck. As for the event I'm using, it is when John Glenn orbited the earth in 1962.  I wanted to use Foucault, Thompson, and Ranke. But I'm having some difficulty understanding their work. Thanks in Advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ge4kjt/historiography_im_kind_of_confused/,3,"To make sure you have a good understanding of each approach, try first summarizing each in a sentence. Then, under each summary, add bullet point details that are important for elaborating. To really impress your prof (and this will likely be required in your papers at some point anyway), be sure to note how each school of thought responds to the others. Imagine Ranke and Braudel have a verbal battle to obscurity; how would each take the other down? Conversely, also note when schools agree on a certain value. Historiography in the Twentieth Century by Iggers was very helpful for this.

I can't tell you how to best go about this, since it's your project, but based on the event you chose, I don't get the sense that the approaches you chose will be easy/a good match--I do think it's possible, though. I bet Annales would work well: place this singular event in the context of varying lengths of time. Feel free to DM if you have specific questions about the varying schools of thought.

I'm an incoming immunology PhD student. I have about two and a half years of being in a lab under my belt, with about 60% of that during undergrad (so I only had one thing I was working on) and 40% of the rest spent as a post-bacc student. 

How normal is it to have multiple projects - and if you have more than one, are they in the same realm as your main one or are they in different areas? 

I had multiple projects assigned to me during this start of my post-bacc program and I was never fully invested in them besides the first one. I'm wondering if it was because they were in completely different areas (my main one studying in vivo autoimmune stuff and another being in in vrito allergy stuff) or if I was just at project management. If the latter is the case, is there anything that helped you with project management? 

While I'm here, does anyone have any good intro to computational immunology resources they'd like to recc to a newb? I know I can google this (which I fully intend to do), I just wanted to see if there was a jumping off point that anyone especially liked.

290,dl5yjd,False,Professional,3,Gap Year (pre-grad school) Employment,GradSchool,"First post, I hope this is allowed as I am not in grad school yet.

I have just completed my Bachelor's in Political Science in June, which I did really well in. I am hoping to pursue my Master's in polisci in September 2020. I'm currently taking a year in between, and I'm essentially wondering how important the work that I do in between that time is - for future employment as well as for grad school? In terms of title, job description, etc.? Or is this the period where I can just say screw it and take a job solely based on pay, not content?

I have been working at a tiny research-based NGO since July as a researcher. The NGO's mission is definitely interesting, but the pay, environment, and my manager is bad. I do nothing 95% of the time, it is extremely mismanaged. My title is great, job description is great, and it 100% looks good on my CV for the career I want (especially because prior to this, my experience has been mostly admin). It is also only a 30 minute commute (although I don't like working in the suburbs, it's convenient).

I was just offered a different position downtown, where the commute would be 1h30 each way (very long... but I'm also excited by the idea of working downtown). The company is what gets me though - fantastic environment and office, great perks and vacation, and it pays 10k more (which isn't a lot, but it's the difference in me being able to afford buying a car vs. not, for example). Right now I'm paid next to nothing.

Problem is, it's writing-based  which is sort of connected to my field, but has absolutely nothing to do with research. If anything, it's more on the comms and marketing side of things. It's definitely a step away from what my current job looks like on my CV (even if I don't *actually* do much - the description sounds like a really good first step for someone who does want to go into academia and research). The new position, although it has to do with writing, can't really be BS-ed into being connected to my field at all.

I appreciate any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/dl5yjd/gap_year_pregrad_school_employment/,1,I think the question may be if you need the grad degree to do what you want to do.

Just glad I have less than 2 months of that. ,2019-10-21 19:56:57

It's simply a willpower/motivation thing. If I put a gun to your head and tell you to work, you'll work for 24 hours straight. If you have facebook open, your phone on the table with whatsapp etc. then it's never going to work.

Procrastinators usually perform in ""sprints"" where they crunch before a deadline. That is not an effective strategy long-term. You need to learn to do it every (work) day.

Behaviorism is pretty useful here. Just like you were trained to poop in the toilet instead of in your pants and perhaps trained to brush your teeth, wash your hands etc. you can train yourself to do work. Consistency and establishing a routine is key. It's a lot easier to just stick to a daily routine than try to come up with some new behavior.

I went to the army and we woke up at 06:00 every morning, had 10 minutes to put some clothes on, use the toilet and be ready to move out for food. First week was chaotic and sucked, 11 months later we'd have time to chat and mess around and browse reddit on our phones. Things like making your bed, going to eat at specific times, cleaning your barracks every day, cleaning your gun etc. just became habits that you did and didn't feel terrible anymore. To the new recruits we seemed like gods of war because we could put up a tent in 15 minutes, get a fire going and fall asleep on a pile of logs and branches (better than cold uneven ground). It's just habit and having done it 100 times before.

Years later and I can't wake up at 06:00 to save my life, even a little bit of pressure from a hurry turns the whole morning into a chaotic mess and I haven't made my bed for a long time and I clean my apartment maybe once in a few months.

722,b1hg5t,False,Finance,3,Accepted to an M.A. but received almost no financial aid. Meeting w/ Director of Admissions next week to ask for more -- any tips for preparing for that conversation?,GradSchool,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I was recently accepted to a fantastic program that I'm so excited about (2-year M.A. in School Counseling). Unfortunately, I received little to no financial aid. My family and I are on OK footing financially, but with a baby and my impending loss of income, I was definitely hoping for more money than this.

&#x200B;

I have a meeting with my school's Director of Admissions next week. I'm willing to defer admission for a year if it comes to that, but I'd really like to start in Fall 2019 if possible.

&#x200B;

What are my options in terms of asking for more aid? Has anyone navigated this tough conversation successfully?

&#x200B;

Background info:

* I am a minority male who would be entering a field dominated by white women. I'm not exactly looking to throw down the race card though, yikes. Is there a way to tactfully highlight the value I bring to this profession?
* I do not have another acceptance letter to ""compare against"", though I don't even know if that's a thing for grad schools....
* School costs \~$36k per year including books, fees, tuition, etc. I received a $2,500/year award that's given to every person in this program. No aid beyond that, from the school or from the government.
* I plan on going part-time (< 20 hours/week) at my current job to help cover the costs of school. My job would pay more than any graduate assistantships on-campus.

589,duf6jr,False,Research,8,At what point do you decide that you've researched enough?,GradSchool,"I'm only in the first semester of my master's program, so I haven't gotten too heavy into research, but I do enjoy researching for my papers, even when it doesn't need to be that much

Creating the outline helped me figure out which areas I needed to know more about or in a more detailed way. That process helped a lot with breaking ""researching/writing"" down into much more manageable tasks. Like, instead of my to-do list saying ""read more papers about children's writing,"" I had a bunch of items that were like, ""find out when children have good enough motor skills to form letters"" and ""read more about the role of reading comprehension in early writing"". Sometimes when I sit down to write, I still get to a point where I needed to find a reference or two for a point I want to make mid-paragraph, but that felt much more manageable to me than just figuring out when I know ""enough"" to start writing.

192,egchz8,False,Academics,7,Information about Masters in CS/Visual Computing at Saarland University - I asked some questions I had in mind to a few students and thought I'd share their responses for other prospective students.,GradSchool,"I had got an admit for Visual Computing at Saarland, and I'd asked around about the university to a few current/past students. Just thought I'd share their answers for everyone who might be thinking of pursuing a Masters here. Note that some of the information is specific to CS/Visual Computing, and may not hold for other programs. I've numbered the answers, where each number corresponds to a specific student's answer. I've copied their answers verbatim, except fixing typos and removing personal details.

**Q1: As a Saarland student, do you have a chance of getting to work with  researchers from MPI and DFKI, while being a Masters student? For  instance, do a lot of students get to do their Masters theses at  MPI/DFKI/any other research cluster? What does this depend on, your  grades/the program you're attending/networking with profs?**

**A1**: Yes. As a master's student, I am involved with MPI-INF as a research  assistant (HiWi). Yes, there are plenty of masters students who do their  thesis with these institutes.

**A2**: Yes, you can get work there. I know countless people who started working at DFKI close to the start of their studies, even when they weren't good at coding yet. I also know people who worked at the Scheer Tower, CISPA, or others. It should be absolutely no problem to  find a small side job during your studies. For theses: usually, professors will openly suggest topics and you  talk about it to them OR you have a topic in mind, talk to a professor  about it and he will either connect you with people who know a lot about  the topic or do the supervision himself. It is mandatory that your  first supervisor is a professor (being a professor is something more  unique in Germany than in in the US, it doesn't just mean ""lecturer""). I  know people who did their theses at DFKI combined with their side job, I  know some who did it just with a professor and I personally did mine at  a company, working together with one professor. Lots of possibilities.

**A3**: Yes, for instance I am doing my master's thesis in MPI and I know of a lot of students who do it in either DFKI/MPI.

**A4**: Yes, grades matter but so does prior experience. It can help if you've taken a course with the prof. in question but isn't strictly necessary. If you're going to reach out to someone it's also important to write a nice motivation letter describing your research interests and to make connections to what research is being done in the department, i.e. send a targeted application and not a generic one.

**A5**: Yes - grades are important - how you performed in their classes - you can go talk to them.

&#x200B;

**Q2: What do most Saarland graduates end up doing? Do they go on to do a PhD  at one of the associated research institutes, or move to industry? I did try to learn this from LinkedIn but it seems skewed towards research.**

**A1**: Research. Masters students, for some reason, do not seem to be very  motivated to pursue positions in the industry. I am not one of them, and  I hope to go back to the industry as soon as I am done.

&#x200B;

**Q3: What's the student:prof ratio like, in Visual Computing (VC)? I mean, are profs usually responsive to individual queries/project discussions?**

**A1**: Not sure about ratios. Some lectures have a lot of students, some hardly  have 20 students attending them. Really depends on whether it's a core  course, whether the subject is easy e.t.c. Professors have office hours  during which you can approach them. As far as I have noticed, they encourage discussions.

**A2**: I don't know the exact ratio but it heavily depends on the courses.  There are courses with hundreds of people but also some with only 20-50.  It would be interesting to know where you're from. University here is  QUITE different to the UK/US. Brits and Americans have told me that in  their home countries, it's more like school, there are more resources  (because of the higher costs) which means you can go to the professor  any time you want and they will always be able to help you on the spot. In Germany, university expects you to be more independent, meaning  that you're expected to work through things yourself. Obviously you can  email your professor anytime and go to office hours and whatnot but I've  often heard complains from (especially) Americans that they felt like  they don't get enough support. The job of a professor in Germany is  research + teaching as opposed to only teaching, so they often have a  LOT on their schedule and are therefore more busy. But obviously, you  will find professors who are very communicative and some who are not. It  all depends.

**A3**: I don't know the exact number, you can check the visual computing page for the number of profs. Some professors are very helpful/responsive some aren't. Usually the ""in demand"" professors are less responsive especially if you send them unsolicited (also not very well drafted) emails asking for thesis/hiwi, etc. You can check online for general rules of emailing profs, there are some good posts on Quora/StackOverflow.

**A4**: As a general caveat, I completed the masters a few years ago and things have changed a little since then, mostly that more students are applying/getting accepted and the course selection/profs have changed a little. It depends on the course, but usually the ratio is OK and in any case all profs/tutors usually have a one-hour weekly slot for office hours and it shouldn't be tough to get an appointment to discuss whatever you need to.

**A5**: Depends - if you have a good profile - yes.

&#x200B;

**Q4: Do you happen to know anything about the courses and the quality of teaching in the VC program?**

**A1**: VC program has a lot of overlap with the computer science program, though VC is more restrictive in the sense that you *have*  to take some mandatory lectures. Quality of ""teaching"" depends really  on the professors. The courses, including the assignments, are usually  designed well, and the assignments will contain material not covered in  the lecture. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

**A2**: I do not. I would think that at least some of them would overlap with normal CS courses. For those I can say that some people say that CS courses at Saarland University are a little more theoretical than at  other universities. But CS here has an excellent reputation and I've never known a graduate who did not get a good job afterwards.

**A3**: Again, just like at any university the quality varies but there are some profs who are exceptionally good at teaching e.g. Prof. Weickert.

**A4**: The quality of the program and the courses are very good.

**A5**: I was in VC program - I changed to CS - it has a rigid structure and is quite math heavy.

&#x200B;

**Q5: It's stated on the VC program site that students can take core CS  courses and go on to get a Masters in CS. Do you happen to know people in CS who've done this successfully? I was wondering what the experience is like.**

**A1**: I know students who switched from VC to a CS degree, because they found  the bucketing system in VC (i.e, you have to complete x credits in topic  y) annoying. Computer Science do not have any mandatory courses, and  hence you are never forced to study a topic you do not like.

**A2**: I do not. It's not that uncommon to take courses from other specializations though. A friend of mine did a bachelors for both  ""Medieninformatik"" and normal ""Informatik"" (CS).

**A3**: I know some people who have switched halfway through, it isn't complicated. Some people do it because the course requirements are less rigid for CS and you need slightly less coursework because some credit points go towards your MSc thesis presentation. If you're asking about getting a double degree, you might have to take some additional courses and do a second thesis.

**A4**: As a VC student you can transfer to CS if your grades are good, the courses you can take as a CS student and a VC student are more or less the same.

&#x200B;

**Q6: In general, what's the work/life balance like? I understand different  people have different paces and lifestyles, but assuming that a student  doesn't slack off and doesn't party much, is the pace of teaching  manageable? For instance, do you see people in CS/VC struggling to keep up?**

**A1**: Depends on the quality of the student, and more importantly, the choice  of lectures. You would have an easy time coping up with HCI  (Human-Computer Interaction - it is a core course) if you decide to take  that course. But instead, if you are taking a mathy core course like  optimization, naturally you will find if a bit more challenging.  Personally, I think that the coursework is very manageable. If you are  having a hard time, there's no penalty associated with dropping out of a  course. And students tend to do this a lot - they usually sign up for a  lot of courses, realise later that a) they don't like it or b) they  like it but do not have time for it, and this is very normal behavior.  For instance, I attended machine learning lectures this semester (core, 9  credits), realised that I have too much on my plate and there's no way  I'll find time for all the things that I am doing. Also, the ML course  this semester was offered by the math department, and I am not a fan of  their notations and love for theorems. So I stopped attending ML  lectures, and signed up for an ""elements of statistical learning""  course. The topics are *very* similar to the ML course, but it is  just 5 credits (hence less work load) and they don't care much about  proofs. The point I am trying to make is, Saarland is very flexible. I'm  sure you will be able to find some combination of coursework that you  would be able to cope up with.

**A2**: Obviously extremely different from person to person. There are courses  that are known to be difficult and others that are known to be easier. I  think most people struggle with math the most, although this might be  more for the bachelor's than the master's degree. I think it should be  fine if you apply yourself a little bit. Semester breaks are long in  Germany (2-3 months twice a year, if you don't take seminars during that  time), so you always have some time to relax and cool down.

**A3**: Yes, it's manageable. Finding people to do assignments with helps. Often you are encouraged to hand them in in groups.

**A4**: Depends on the courses you take, but yes, people do struggle if they  take more difficult courses, it depends on your priorities, what type of  courses you want to take, how fast you want to finish, etc.

**A5**: I didn't have a work-life balance - especially during my thesis - it's all work - for me it was...but it's manageable.

&#x200B;

**Q7: For administrative tasks and filling paperwork, do you need to know fluent German?**

**A1**: Yes. You must know German. But I don't speak any German. I managed anyway. So will you ;)

**A2**: I'm gonna say no because of all my American friends surviving despite  not being close to fluent in the language. You should prepare yourself  for LOTS of annoying bureaucracy at the start though. In the first few  weeks, there's gonna be a LOT of annoying paperwork that has to be done.  But people are usually helpful enough and if you struggle too much,  Germans you will meet will help you out with translating.

**A3**: No. Although I was already fluent in German, so I can't speak to this much. Isn't a barrier as far as I can tell from friends.

**A4**: You can get by without knowing German, you can use Google translate and all but in some cases it may be difficult.

**A5**: No no, you will get help - so don't worry.

&#x200B;

**Q8: I read that Saarland dormitories have a long waiting list. Do you happen to know how far back you need to book a slot, to have a good chance of  getting it?**

**A1**: The waiting period is a semester. I ended up getting a one-room apartment (studio?) in the city.

**A2**: Yes, they are always at full capacity and especially during winter  times, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot if you don't apply  extremely early. The majority people live in so-called WGs  (Wohngemeinschaften) which just means shared flat with other people  (usually other students). This is the most cost-efficient option if you  don't generally dislike people (and also you will make friends much  easier).

**A3**: No idea, but it's tricky to get a place and it's best to start as early as possible.

**A5**: That's tough - don't rely on it.

&#x200B;

**Q9: Do you have any specific website recommendations for student apartments (shared housing) in Saarbrucken?**

**A1**: There are a lot of WGs (i.e shared apartments). I sort of wanted to live alone, and hence got my room [here](https://www.studentenwohnungen-saarbruecken.de/unsere-wohnangebote-fur-studenten-saarbruecken.html).

**A2**: The most common one by FAR is [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). The optimal places for students are St.Johann, Mitte or  Alt-Saarbrücken. St.Johann covers much of the city center and also  includes the ""Nauwieserviertel"" which is basically the student's quarter  full of pubs. Mitte is also in the city center but usually more  expensive and Alt-Saarbrücken is a little quieter, further away but  really cheap to live in. Dudweiler is also extremely close to the  university but it's VERY far away from the inner city and anything..  exciting. But they have a nice climbing gym at least.

&#x200B;

**Q10: Are there ample computing resources available to students at Saarland?  For instance, for deep learning experiments or rendering, one would need  access to GPU servers with high RAMs, often for a prolonged duration  (long-running experiments/simultaneous experiments). Are such resources  readily available to students?**

**A1**: Yes. I took a high-level computer vision course (offered by MPI) on my first semester and the course involved a project, and all students were given access to decent GPUs. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were P100s. Basically, you SSH into MPI/University resources through a VPN.

**A2**: We had this at the Computational Linguistics department to train language models etc. and our department is soooo much smaller. So I would definitely think: yes. But that's a question you could ask the Studienkoordinator.

**A3**: Not sure about this. The deep learning boom took off when was already a research assistant in the computer vision department.

**A5**: I would assume..

&#x200B;

**Q11: I've heard that the style of teaching math is rather ""dry"" in German  universities, with less emphasis on proof motivation and visualization,  and more on terse theorem-proof sessions. Would you say that is true to a  large extent, or is this dependent on individual profs?**

**A1**: That statement is true, but fortunately not so much in Saarland. But  then again, I avoid proof-heavy math courses like the plague, so I might  not be the best person to answer this. The assignments do sometimes ask  the students to prove something, and I sometimes do get get annoyed  with this.

**A2**: Yes, that's what I hear a lot too. Math can get rather dry. My math  courses were nothing like CS courses, so I cant compare them with mine.

**A3**: Depends on the professor, and I don't know what your reference point is here, but some do place a lot of emphasis on theorem proofs, and some don't.

**A5**: That's true - I think.

&#x200B;

**Q12: Is there any academic advantage/disadvantage in enrolling in one semester over another, for VC?**

**A1**: Nope.

**A2**: In my experience, the winter semester is the 'normal' one to start for  MOST pograms. That's when you have most of the introductory courses,  etc. But i can absolutely not say if this is the case for VC I'm afraid.

**A3**: Depends on the courses on offer, but one nice course for the first semester which I believe is offered in the summer is the Image Processing and Computer Vision course. Ultimately, I don't think it matters too much.

**A5**: Not really - not imo

&#x200B;

**Q13: How does the process of getting MPI to approve you doing your Masters  thesis there work? Is it like, you get good grades in a set of courses  related to the work of a researcher in MPI, contact him over email  asking for a RA position, then have an interview with them? Or do you  discuss your interests with one of the profs at Saarland, they recommend  your name over to a researcher at MPI, who then contacts you for an  interview?**

**A1**: In my case, I just went to the lecturer at the end of the course (i.e  the last lecture of the course) and straight up asked him ""Is there a  way I can contribute to your research, preferably as a HiWi?"". He said  yes. By this point, he was familiar with me (I was a regular in the  class), and my assignment grades were good. He asked me to email him,  and mention that we talked after the lecture, and that was it. He read  through my resume and offered me a HiWi. Usually, if the  professor/lecturer does not know you, you go through an interview - I  didn't have to since he knew me. Getting a masters thesis at MPI follows  a similar pattern - turn up for lectures offered by people from the  MPI, get okayish grades at least, and then walk up to the professor and  ask. If you seem motivated enough, the professor will usually be happy  to have you as a thesis student. *Some* departments, like D2 at  MPI-INF (Multimodal computing and machine learning) are quite in demand  (everyone and their grandmother wants to do a thesis in ML+CV) and thus  has a GPA cutoff - 1.5 or better. That's an unfairly high cutoff, since  unlike the US, Germany does not have grade inflation, and you have to be  really good at giving exams to maintain an overall GPA of 1.5 or  higher. However, regardless of your GPA, most departments will offer you a thesis if you do reasonably well in their particular course and show sufficient motivation.

&#x200B;

**Q14: How easy is it to make the switch from VC to CS (Do you need to maintain high grades?  Does it depend on CS student strength at the time?), and when can it be  done at the earliest?**

**A1**: It's quite easy. You just have to fill out an application form. Yes, you  must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and you can switch only after the  first semester. Getting 2.0 or higher shouldn't too difficult.

&#x200B;

**Q15: If I decide to take courses at a slow pace, can I stay and study beyond the normal duration of the program?**

**A1**: Yup. You have a whopping 6 semesters to complete your coursework (i.e 90  credits). And then you can take another semester to do your thesis, I  guess. There's some restriction - for example, you *must*  complete 9 credits by the end of your first semester, 30 by the end of  the second, and so on (I forgot the exact numbers). But yes, you can  take more than the normal duration of the program. Also, there's no  ""normal"" duration of the program. Most students I know take 5 semesters -  4 semesters for coursework + a semester for the thesis. But I took more  courses than recommended, and I'm set to complete my coursework by my  3rd semester. I'll probably do the thesis on my fourth semester and be  done with the whole thing, or skip my fourth semester altogether to do  an internship somewhere, though I don't have any internship offers as of  yet. But then again, I was fine with filling up all my free time with assignments and the HiWi job, and not working so hard for the exams. Long story short, how fast you  want to graduate depends all on you. If you go all in, and enroll for  courses during the semester breaks as well (yes, some courses are  offered during the break), then you *can* be done with your  coursework in almost two semesters, and move on to your thesis. That  puts the earliest graduation date as 3 semesters.

&#x200B;

**Q16: What is it like to do a HiWi job at MPI? I mean, what does your day to  day work look like? Do you actually get involved with the prof's  research and get to publish stuff?**

**A1**: This varies *wildly*. I think I won the HiWi lottery though. I  somewhat contribute to the research (i.e helped build a research  toolkit). I am not micro-managed, and my working hours are very flexible, and I'm on friendly terms with my advisor (we get a beer  together once every few weeks). But as far as I understand, what I have  is an exception and not the norm. An overwhelming majority of HiWi jobs are web dev stuff that  do not usually lead to a publication. However, if you do a good job,  you dramatically increase the chances of getting a thesis there, or in  any case, your advisor might be able to give you a recommendation letter  based on your HiWi.

&#x200B;

**Q17: Of the courses you've taken so far, what courses did you love? Also, are  there any courses that you'd blindly suggest to avoid (prof irregular,  teaching unclear with fast pace)? Of course, interests vary across  people, but I'm just trying to get a general idea of the department's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to teaching.**

**A1**: I'll give you a short summary of the courses I took last summer semester:

a. IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) - well structured, you  get a very good understanding of image analysis (sobel and gaussian  filters, fourier transforms, optical flow etc), and the lectures are interesting.

b. (HLCV) High Level Computer Vision - Offered by MPI. Lectures are *bad*  \- they're not boring but there are 200 slides per lecture and yet the  professor (Bernt Schiele) finishes early. I remember explicitly asking  him ""do I need a deep learning background for this course?"" and he  smiled and said, ""not necessarily, you should be able to pick things up  during the course"". I did pick things up, but only because my team put  in an insane amount of time on the assignments. HLCV basically drops you  at the deep end of the pool, and you either sink or you swim. But the  assignments and the project was worth it - I am quite confident with  pytorch now and the background I got really helped me with the other  courses. Once you go through HLCV, you can go through anything. Dr.  Schiele also explicitly mentioned that ""If you survive the first 2  assignments, you will survive the course"". I would heavily recommend  this course, but be prepared to slog.

c. AI (Artificial Intelligence). Waste of time. I took this only  because it was just algorithms, and it was a core course (9 credits).  This was supposed to be my ""easy course"", and though the assignments  were easy enough, the exam was a Kobayashi Maru. You are given 2 hours,  and until you write (and think) really fast, you can't complete the  exam. Given enough time, I could have scored a lot more. Makes me wonder  what they are trying to evaluate - my understanding of the subject or  how fast I can churn out algorithms? I ended up getting a 2.7 for this  easy subject, but I won't complain since I got my 9 credits without  working much for it.

d. TNIR (Topics in Neural Information Retrieval). My favorite course  last summer semester. The assignments involved reading actual research  papers and writing an essay comparing and contrasting them. Had a lot of  fun, and since you read a lot of research papers, you get a good idea  of the research field *and* a sense of accomplishment towards the  end of the course. But this can  be quite dry if you are not into NLP/IR.

e. German classes. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Q18: If you do an internship at a company in the last semester, whom would  you work with for your thesis? A prof from Saarland or a company person?**

**A1**: For doing your thesis with a company, you have to get a professor from  the university to co-supervise you. Not sure if professors like doing  this. In any case, you can do an internship without it being a thesis -  you get 6 credit points for doing a ""praktikum"" - i.e an industrial  internship. The main reason students would like an industry thesis is  that they get paid there, while no professor would pay a Masters thesis student at the University.

&#x200B;

**Q19: I hear Saarland has a gym (Uni-fit). Do you happen to know how much they charge students?**

**A1**: Oh yeah, I use the uni-gym. It's around 20 euros a month for the students.

&#x200B;

**Q20: Is there anything else you wish an international student knew before joining Saarland?**

**A2**: Travel! Saarland is basically in the heart of Europe, you can get to  so many places. Paris is only 2-3 hours away. There are lots of German  cities to visit, too. There is so much to see and you should take  advantage of living so centrally in Europe. All my international friends  said that they loved how easy it was to travel through all of Europe. About studying here generally: never stress too much about  university, there is so much other stuff in life. Take time for your  hobbies, relax and to make and meet friends.  I consider some  international friends I met as some of my best friends to this day.  Don't see studying abroad just a cheap option to study but also to  broaden your horizons.

I am not sure if my department administration will let me do this anyway, but before I even ask I just want to do a sanity check to see if this is something I necessarily want. In particular, I'm worried about:

1. Security of funding -- if the startup does not pay me and the work I do for them will contribute to my dissertation, will my fellowship funding be safe despite restrictions on ""outside work""? In particular, I'm currently on an NIH T32, have NSF GRFP on reserve, and hope to get an NIH F31 and/or F99 in the future.
2. Managing the collaboration -- I've generally been advised that it's not a good situation as a PhD student to be the ""glue"" of a collaboration. While my advisor has indicated interest in the topic and would be happy to advise me on the work I do with the startup in addition to what we're already working on, should I expect the typical drawbacks of ""gluing"" a collaboration?
3. Career prospects -- I am very firmly hoping to land a tenure-track academic position in the long run, but obviously understand that it would help to have industry relationships to fall back on.

I’m not far along at all. I should be most of the way through my research proposal and have my committee at least mostly established. Instead, I’m still trying to figure out what to do. I only have a vague idea of my project. I really get little to no support from my advisor, who is very busy and seems to expect me to be far more independent than any other advisors appear to expect from my peers. 

The worst of it is that despite this, I’d expect myself to be further along. I’m not farther along because I don’t care. My interests lie in marine and estuarine ecology, not freshwater, and turns out I’m not all that interested in doing research. Academia kind of just annoys me at this point?

I’ve already had some mental health issues the past year or two that are of course affecting this, but despite the fact that I’m doing better mentally and emotionally now with medication and healthy life habits, I’m as uninterested as ever. 

What I’m considering right now is switching from an MS to an MPS. There is an all coursework option, or a professional option where you do an internship and present a capstone on it at the end. The benefit of this would be 1. Doing something I’m more interested in obviously, and 2. Since it’s within the same school, most of my credits I’ve taken should apply easily. Otherwise I could apply to a different state school. Downside is many deadlines have passed so I would have to start in the spring, or narrow my options to those with later or rolling deadlines.

The major downside to this is losing my TA assistantship. I’m in state, and could take on some loans, but that doesn’t help my day to day situation. I’d have to find some sort of part time job to pay for rent, my car, etc. Or take out some extra loans to help fund that.

PI claims that funding situation is tight, with no room to budge or delay, so it must be done. “No mercy situation” PI says. “Stay safe, bye!” was the last thing PI said in our online meeting this morning. 

Moreover, PI applied for a special permit so that our group can continue to go to campus to perform experiments, as PI referred to them as so-called “critical operations”. Waiting to hear how that turns out. 

Stay safe, but also risk your health and possibly life by not staying at home for the sake of more research, because pressure from funding sources is a thing. What kind of dystopia is this?

I think how the university has handled this situation is very reflective of how the state as a whole has handled it. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has actually been very on top of everything and quite frankly has probably saved a ton of lives.

Getting to the questions:

* Did you feel any different getting your Masters and being in seminar, discussions?
* For those of with your Masters, do you identify as a professor, or still an instructor? I know some professors, faculty argue you can only be a professor with a Ph.D., so just curious how you handle it, or if it's an issue for any of you at all.

590,esbs0z,False,Research,1,Computer-based transcriptions: too good to be true?,GradSchool,"I am looking into options for transcribing and hopefully translating audio-recorded interviews. I was initially considering hiring someone but then learned about an alleged industry of computer-based transcription services.

I am wondering if this is too good to be true because the quoted costs are significantly lower than hiring a person.

Do any social scientists or other scholars have any experience with companies like Happy Scribe or their competitors? 

There are 2 languages in my interviews. Some are exclusively English, some are exclusively Tagalog and some are a mix of the 2 languages.

But I am still interested in English only services because maybe 40% of my interviews are exclusively English. If the service is real and still affordable with an option of English only, that means I could find an individual to help me with the remaining 60% that are in Tagalog. 

I had a translator for some of the interviews but their English is shaky. I got to the point where I was conducting interviews in Tagalog myself but that is after I memorized the questions and also groped my way through asking definitions of specific words as the interview unfolded. The point is, I will eventually need someone or some service to translate from Tagalog to English.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/esbs0z/computerbased_transcriptions_too_good_to_be_true/,3,"I've only used Transcribe, but my experience is that 1) it gives you a really good head start but 2) it's still going to need a lot of human work to fix it up. Services I've used probably saved me about half the time it would have taken to transcribe manually. Again, this is with cheap online apps, so YMMV. 

I would be skeptical of any service that claimed to accurate auto-translate Tagalog, but that's just speculation. ",2020-01-22 13:15:22

765,96a0pr,False,Finance,1,Grad School Fellowship Questions,GradSchool,"Hello all,

I recently subscribed to this community. I started a month ago a little early for a masters program in geology. I strongly feel as though I will want to pursue a PhD but was waiting to see how much I like research full time before then. I think I will decide maybe October or November. 

I am debating applying for fellowships whose deadlines are late this fall. However I am not sure it is worthwhile- I likely will not have published or presented by then (though will have some preliminary results and data, I hope to definitely present this spring). And, I am very new in the program. 

However I did present a little in undergraduate, was extremely involved in extra-curricular activities (a trend I plan on continuing), received several scholarships, graduated with honors *et cetera*. I know my project, and am really starting to focus in on my career and personal goals. 

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to take the time to really make a good application? And if I plan on getting a PhD, should I just wait till next year when I am more competitive since I'll still have a long time to go yet? I am already funded through an RA and full tuition waiver. 

Thanks all, hope to get some good feedback. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/96a0pr/grad_school_fellowship_questions/,1,"Unless you want to stay in your current lab for your PhD, you won't be competitive. I've certainly heard of students advancing to PhD from same masters program. You won't score well if your application can't demonstrate that your facilities are great (like you need to give details of square footage of bench space), your PI has funding with the ability to graduate students, your research plan is feasible and novel, and your training plan has an endpoint with writing/teaching/research goals.

Edit: Also they do ask about how far along in the program you are and everything. I just don't think it'll be worth it to try at this point. Maybe small scholarships, but not a fellowship for a future PhD. It'll probably end up not discussed. ",2018-08-10 19:26:46

351,9zfl73,False,Professional,5,Asking Professors for Multiple Academic References,GradSchool,"I’m a first year Masters student doing decently well in my classes but not really involved in things outside of that. Regularly, I come across opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) that I would be very interested in applying but all of them require 2-3 academic references (letters of recommendation). As a result, I have not applied to any of them because I am hesitant to ask my professors who have taught me for less than 4 months for references. I’m pretty sure they don’t know my interests outside of their classroom and would likely say no if I asked.  Plus, I don’t want to ask them every single time I come across an interesting opportunity and want to ‘save’ their references for those critical opportunities.

How do you go about asking professors with whom you don’t have a super established relationship with for academic references? What is the general norm in the academic world in terms of how many times you can ask a professor for a reference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/9zfl73/asking_professors_for_multiple_academic_references/,5,"A letter of reference doesn’t have to know you personally, they just need to be a testament of your professional life and work ethic.

If you’re in grad school, your courses should be relatively small and your professors will have seen you complete projects at a very advanced level. The professors you mentioned would be fine writing a letter.

If it helps, the best way to approach a letter writer is to explain what it is you want and why you believe you should be the one to have it. This will give your letter writers something to go off of.

Here’s an example 

“Hello, I’m XXX. I am really enjoying your course this semester and have found it interesting, challenging, and fun. The course has helped me grow as a [insert field here] scholar. In order to expand my horizons even more so, I am applying to [insert fellowship, internship, etc.] This opportunity is for students who blah blah blah. I am applying because I want to do/be/create XYZ. As someone who has seen me work in this area of study and are capable of giving an honest testimony of my professional work ethic, I would be really honored if you could write a letter of recommendation? Could you write this letter on my behalf? .....

Just let your professor know what it is you want, why you should get it and let them fill in the blanks! ",2018-11-22 16:37:21
0,gwuv29,False,Academics,43,I [Rant] I want to be completely candid about something I’ve been hesitant to admit to myself,GradSchool,"Edit: Thank you all for commiserating with me, sending me words of encouragement, and just generally engaging in this discussion. I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience. 

.


Complete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:

.



I love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don’t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I’m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. 

What I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can’t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit. 

I understand this may ruffle some feathers in a sub where a majority of its subscribers are hardworking individuals and high achievers who will probably end up in academia. But I’m done with it and I feel so liberated saying this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gwuv29/i_rant_i_want_to_be_completely_candid_about/,337,[deleted] ,2020-06-05 01:24:00
