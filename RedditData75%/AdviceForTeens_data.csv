330,7xv99i,False,,1,Moving too fast in my own life?,AdviceForTeens,"I'm a [19/f], currently a sophomore in college. For as long as i can remember, I've always wanted to skip this chunk of my life and get to a place where I can settle down and begin my life. People tell me all the time about missing out on the ""college experience"" and I just don't know if I'm really missing out on anything. I've gone through my phase of partying every weekend and drinking more than I ever imagined I would. That made me satisfied for a period of time, but now I'm back in a place that I wish I could just drop everything and move on. I hate this place of being at a stand-still, doing nothing but going to school and working a part-time job that leaves me feeling bored every day. I have so many ambitions and things I want to do with my life, and I wish I could enjoy things as they were now, but my mind is constantly stuck in the future. It doesn't bother me much, thinking ahead, but I feel that it holds me back from enjoying the moment.

I don't know what I can do to change my mind, I've thought this way for so much of my life. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and be excited about what I have to do, and I want to know how to make the best of the present.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/7xv99i/moving_too_fast_in_my_own_life/,3,"I get what ya mean about being in a standstill. Honestly I feel that besides drinking in excess (which is fun) college is also for meeting lots of new people and learning new skills. It doesn’t have to be school related either learn an instrument or language. If you feel bored try to do something you’d never have done before and see how you like it, college is a time to learn.

345,fclpgo,False,,2,I have two Options but I need help please help,AdviceForTeens,"So I’m in this pen pal program there’s two days of it, 30 kids from my school and 30 from other school. The first day past, as I was paired with a girl who is amazing and genuine(I’m a junior and she’s a senior). She had to follow my high school schedule from period 3 to 6. We had such a great time and became close friends, and we were excited for the second day, which is a month away, to see each other where I follow her schedule and meet new people. 

HOWEVER on that same day I have an Over-Night trip for my orchestra(This is the top orchestra in the high school) and I’m the most important one. I play bass and the other two bass players can’t go because they don’t want to. That day we’ll play for fun and professional would give us advice. Then we’ll go watch the New York philharmonics and visit Fredonia for a college tour. My good friend is going but she knows no one and really wants me to go on the trip(Btw I’m a guy). I don’t want her to be alone for the two days.

I don’t know what to do, picking one just gives me guilt towards the other. What do you guys think would be the best thing to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fclpgo/i_have_two_options_but_i_need_help_please_help/,2,"Ouch, that's a really tough situation to be in.

I keep reminding myself that i’d never have as much friends as the other people beside me, which just causes me to cry. I feel like it’s my fault that I did this to myself and never tried to change. I’m thinking about cutting myself. No, not the really open wound with so much blood spewing out. but just a mild cut that it doesn’t look like I did it intentionally. It feels so tempting, yet so shameful at the same time..",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ezo6pw/should_i_try_it/,5,"Dont do it. It's not worth it.

Please don't I fucked up my life this way went to a wilderness therapy program for three months DONT DO IT  I'm sorry to tell but don't if you do it will be a ride Awakening I'm gonna be honest ok it doesn't get better till something changes or happen wait as long as you can my dude please

Don't. as someone who has been self harming for years it really isn't worth it. Sure it can help or even feel good at the time but once you lose your cutters high your just left empty and worse than before, also even some of the smallest cuts can leave permanent scars. IT isn't worth it. it really isn't. I said that it would just be one when I started but then as a few weeks went past all I wanted to do was more and more and now I'm scared all over my body. Try art or other methods of distracting yourself. I find that writing down my feelings even poetry can really help. Also rock music... sounds weirdly specific but rock makes me want to kick ass and dance rather than cry and self harm. dms are open if you need to talk...

Scars are permanent. And can be especially noticeable.",2020-02-06 14:26:22

785,bonjde,False,,0,Why did no one warn me about the loneliness,AdviceForTeens,"Hi, First time poster here..
So in the UK we leave school at 16 and are forced to go to either college or an apprenticeship, I did ""okay"" in school so I ended up getting an apprenticeship in a warehouse on a 25 year olds wage. Since I started working, living an adults life, bills, rent, care insurance etc; I've felt extremely lonely. I wasn't the most popular kid in school, Wouldn't say badly bullied to the point of depression, but bullied as such, I mainly brushed it off. I left school with a couple friends, now I rarely even see my best friend, he's either with his girlfriend, in college or in bed, I've started smoking the herb to try to see life differently but that's just making it harder to do basic life functions, I'm trying to push my self to go out on walks alone (Not really for my fitness as I work out regularly, but besides the point). Does anyone have any tips on getting over this loneliness? Is it an age thing? Or is it one of those things you never got warned about?

Once she finds out she’ll probably un-enroll me so if you could offer advice on how to transition to a new school w. a very different atmosphere it would be helpful. This “new” school is much bigger, the kids are (generally) more hostile and im a socially awkward person who has a very difficult time making friends (I’ve been going to my current school which is very small for two years now and I havent made a single friend lol). It is also significantly more academic and I struggle greatly with academics...anyways thanks for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ek0u0o/failing_school/,2,"well I think that you should try to tell her that you tried your best if you did you should really just be honest with her and I know it might be hard but,you guys should make an agreement over something like a tutor if you can get one. You could try to ask friends or notes But, the best thing you can do is find something that excites you like for me notes don’t judge but, something like that you can find it and start to link it in with school. what ever you do don’t try to make matters worse with her if she gets mad or is trying to help you.

629,ex2q8v,False,,2,Homie broke the bro code,AdviceForTeens,"One of my good homies is trying to take the girl i want before i can get to her even though he has a girl.

We met her around the same time and he introduced her to me he told me it qould be good if we started talking maybe something could start between us. About five days ago him and her were chilling with her and her friend things were going good for me until he found out she smoked weed and wasn't as innocent as she was leading people on to belive. He started to get super flirty towards her which pissed me off

He the type of guy that puts hoes before bros and loves the attention girls give him. Whenever he arounda a girl or a group of girls he always switches up making himself seem more grand than he actually is which bothers me.

When they left i tapped him and asked him what he thought he was doing and he just told me ""maybe if you get better game and stop complaining so much girl will stop playing you"" which obviously pissed me off even more

The next day we were chilling at my house and i noticed they were snaping all day.

He broke the bro code and i dont know if i should try and take the girl by force or if shoukd just allow it and move on.

745,dk7ufg,False,,0,My entire life is toxic and I'm not too happy about it.,AdviceForTeens,"So hi, my name is Abby. I'm 16 turning 17 soon and I live with my parents. I'm pansexual. I knew I was pan in about 6th grade and thought I was bi for a long time (First female crush in 3rd grade).  Luckily throughout middle school my friends we're very supporting and nice. 

My parents on the other hand are not. My sister is bisexual (remember this) . My mom was raised Catholic so she's homophobic. Though I can't really blame her, she was practically forced to be. My dad on the other hand, is a known racist atheist. I am also an atheist.  My father and sister the other day had a whole conversation about how pansexuality didn't exist. Bisexuality is binary. Boys and Girls. Trans people is iffy. Pansexuality means that I don't base my attraction on gender identity. 

I'm so afraid of the reaction I'll get if I come out to my family. Afraid to the point where I'm tempted to wait until I move out to come out to them. My parents are also mentally abusive to my sister and I. Telling us both how useless and worthless we are all the time. My sister gets more than me since she's an adult (20) and they can threaten to kick her out on the street. My sister abuses me, but I don't blame her. She's doing a lot for the family and it all goes unnoticed and ignored. So even though we fight and I hate that she does this to me, I know that not all of her aggression is completely towards me. 

Getting past home life, one of my best friends is EXTREMELY homophobic. Even telling me that if I marry a female she won't come to our wedding because ""that's just dumb"".  I once tried to explain what Non binary and gender fluid meant and she again just said ""that's bullshit that makes no sense"" and ""there's only 2 genders. You're either born female or male and that's what you are"" so I can't even get support. To the point where whenever I have a girlfriend and I try to talk about her she fake gags and tells me that it's disgusting. 

How do I get rid of all of this toxicity in my life? Any help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/dk7ufg/my_entire_life_is_toxic_and_im_not_too_happy/,1,,2019-10-20 02:43:34

So, in class, I take all tough classes and I do band. The problem comes with not the classes themselves, but with the homework. It’s taking over my life, and it’s not even been a month. In class, I get stacks of homework. Stacks. But fine, lots of homework is manageable, I can deal with it. But I also have band. Now, our band is super rigorous. We go to after school practice every day for 3 hours - about. And let me tell you, three hours is a lot. But then I have homework to do, my stacks of homework. By the end of the day, it’s 2:00 AM and I’ve finally finished everything I need to do and I can sleep. But... it’s so hard. I can’t do anything other than school.

My weekends can be just as saturated with homework, AND IT SUCKS.

Abort it.

Get an abortion. You have no business being a mother at your age. 

On the plus side, when your kid turns 18 and moves out, you will be 32. 

I would definitely say give it up for adoption, a lot of teen moms get caught up in the emotional aspect of children. ""but I love him/her too much!"" that's understandable, but if you really loved your kid you would let it have the best life possible and, no offense to you, a 14 year old single mother is not the best home with the best opportunities.

Adoption or abortion (depending on how far along you are) is my opinion; you need to think about the quality of life for you and your child. 

No.. :'(

I'm considering adoption. Nobody knows. Pregnancy test? & 2 Months.. Please give me some good advice.

Have you thought about adoption?

Maybe bring in a paper w a fake signature?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/cuzhzb/septum_piercing_advice_needed/,1,"okay 1, you should not post where you want it done at online because this is a international form and people might be able to figure out where you live. And 2 most places have to have your parent actually there for you to get the piercing and they watch you and them fill out the paper work so you can't just ""fake"" the signature. I would wait until you are 18 if a place offers to do it without parent permission that place is doing something majorly illegal. If a place is willing to break the law like that they are most likely a unsanitary and unsafe place to get a piercing done.

579,f91uoi,False,,8,Extra aggravating crush,AdviceForTeens,"I am freshly 18, and ive never ever been interested in someone more than a year younger than me before, but now im interested in a 14 year old who i think is also interested in me.

I thought he was 16ish, not 14, when we started talking, he kept making sexual comments to only me, no one else in our group. Me and him have similar interests and sense of humor, he acts and looks like hes just a year or two younger than me, not 3 and a half... I feel like an awful person for feeling this way but i thought he was older when it developed and the crush has stuck.

Opinions on this and what to do :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f91uoi/extra_aggravating_crush/,1,"Age gap is a bit big now and strange, but you should be good. From all I have read you guys are cute as hell, don't be bothered by what people say. Love is love, and if it is true and honest, it has no boundaries. Just don't pressure him to do anything because that would make you look like a predator. Good luck to you guys, all the best.

Hey! You’re definitely not a bad person for feeling this way, I am 17 gonna be 18 this year and I personally wouldn’t date someone that’s years that much younger than me for the logistics of legality but also you’re probably a senior or gonna graduate soon and he’s a freshmen. 
You won’t be able to keep having this relationship (probably) and you’re also probably a bit more mature than him and you might start noticing that if you decide to date him (could be an issue if fighting or anything like that stats happening). You should talk to him about your feelings. He’s gonna want to do it anyway bc seniors or older people are hot as fuck to lil freshies but keep in mind where he’s at. Do you know why he likes you? Do you have the same goals? Would you be fulfilled without feeling guilty? If your friend were to be dating a person that age, how would you feel about the situation? Do you have siblings that are of similar ages? 

Morally, you’re both in high-school. It’s pretty wholesome right now and you’re not a bad person at all. Feelings are feelings and we can’t help them! And nobody would get hurt if anything happened between you two. You could probably just keep it cute and flirty without putting a label on it, or you could try making it work now. When you’re an older adult in your mid 20’s 4 years age doesn’t matter that much. Jsut try to separate prejudice that society gives us and you’re true personal feelings about it before making a decision.

Check up on your state’s Romeo and Juliet laws. This could be the difference between an illegal and legal relationship (y’all sound like you too would be a great couple tho best of luck)

Thank you for solid advice. I feel like the school thing is tumultuous for me because I havent been in school for years.. im a drop out, we know each other through church. I think that hes honestly really mature in a lot of ways, and me and my sister have a similar age gap and it wouldnt have bothered me if she had dated a 16 year old when i was 16 as long as the conditions were right, yknow? 

Its easy to judge these situations till youre in them because i honestly see him on a similar or same level as me, i dont see him as anything different than me when were talking and together. Its afterwards where i get concerned.. i dont wanna come across as predatory when i really just see him as another teenager, not a child

What would you guys do? Do you like him enough to wait? Do you think he’d look back at this and feel assaulted? If no then I say go with it! I feel not being in it so not understanding. Honestly, if you too are vibing and there’s truly no bad intentions in you then go for it. If he makes you happy and you make him happy than why not. Plus church is a hella wholesome place to meet haha

I think normal dating things just not sex, i like him enough to wait for that stuff, i dont want to rush him into anything and i wouldnt initiate sexual stuff at all with him, thats his choice. 

Like i think snuggling and normal kissing (not fullon making out) and handholding would be okay but anything past that i wouldnt be comfortable doing until he was at least 16.. 

Church is a really nice place to meet and im glad that we met there instead of a school setting to be honest because we have a more authentic friendship rather than just one based off of seeing each other at school. His parents dont force him to come to anything, he chooses to. 

I think im going to see how it goes from this point foreward. Im not comfortable making moves towards him or anything either, i dont wanna pressure him.

I’m really glad! I hope you are happy with him! Y’all sound cute as fuck and you sound super sincere so I hope you find what you’re looking for 😁😁😁

69,ejy6hq,False,,28,I don’t know how to help my girlfriend,AdviceForTeens,"Using a throwaway for this one. 

So my whole friend group (13 year olds) are like depressed, out of the four of us 2 are diagnosed with depression  and stuff, I see a therapist and have gotten out of my depressive state by myself and my girlfriend struggles with depression-like stuff. 

The thing is, I’ve recently started not caring about anything suicidal my friends say. I fucking hate it when people make suicidal jokes and stuff because it kinda triggers me? I don’t know honestly but it annoys me, especially when my girlfriend makes them and I’m like “well you should see someone” and she just makes reasons why she can’t ask her parents to see someone and other shit that makes me think that she doesn’t want help. I’m not spilling the tea on her about “how she’s faking depression” or anything.

Another thing which I need help with is that (we’re both female) she’s really worried about people thinking or knowing we’re dating??? And she goes on a whole rant about why I can’t hold her hand or hug her in public or I can’t even rest my head on her shoulder. I completely understand that she isn’t ready to come out to her parents and stuff but the thing I try to tell her is that most people will just think that we’re good friends or something. It’s like if we weren’t dating it would be completely different if I try to lean on her.

So the thing that I need help with is how to get her help when she just won’t let me try to help, and also how I can tell her she’s overreacting with how cautious she is when it comes to contact.

I really really like her so much but I’ve thought about breaking up, but I can’t because I’m scared she’ll hurt herself or kill herself if I break up with her. Please help me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ejy6hq/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_girlfriend/,6,"YOU need to tell an adult and if you’re not happy end the relationship you have to put yourself first

I’ve been there, but with a group of best friends. Please drop that group and move on. if not now, when you go to high school. When I dropped my friend group like this, I swear to god, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. My life got exponentially better.

while you want to help her, be aware that people use that stuff to manipulate the other person into staying in the relationship and from what you’ve written that’s the vibe I’ve got.

sorta but oh well that’s life

We are in the same age, and I have social anxiety and I am depressed too but I think it has do something with the puberty and I am also in a relationship with a girl (i am a girl too) my mom knows we are dating and when have no problem of being seen in public like you said, people will think u two are besties anyway. You should really make your girlfriend understand and make sure that she understands you, but can i know how long you two have been together?

Thanks, but I don’t know how I’d tell an adult like who would I tell, and what would my gf say? Also your name is perfect

Vine check failed?

Since the 26th of June

the name is my boyfriend’s (i kinda hate it😂😂) but anyone at your school an adult you trust and your “girlfriend” doesn’t treat you well evidently enough

that’s what you think now.  a friendship or friend group defined by its bad mental health does not leave room for growth. when our conversations constantly revolves around staying home and watching anime and shit for hours on end and our terrible lives, it made it so we were all dedicated to non-recovery. we all based our friendship on our depression, and that’s what sent my friend group crumbling. a lot of them are still together, but me and my best friend dipped and started talking to new people, which worked out really well. I got my first real romantic relationships and actual fun friend activities with the new people, who were basically just my acquaintances before then. these next couple years can be really awesome if you surround yourself with people who actually care about you and don’t just brush you off, and when you’re actually able to recover. it doesn’t happen immediately, but it’s super satisfying. 

do what you think is right. I hope things work out for you <3

I’ve told her about it like 3 times already but I might talk to her about it again. She just keeps saying “I overreact everything” and “everyone knows me so they’ll just tell my mum” so I’m lost

Thank you for your advice man, maybe I’ll talk to my friends about how instead of being depressed we can get help and not just be sad and say “same” or “mood” when someone’s like “hey I feel sad today”

Damn that hurts, thanks dude

Lmao what

Ok, thank you. And congratulations for 1.5 years!

honestly? you’re making an effort and she’s dismissing you entirely and you’re still young but that still ain’t a relationship

good :)

Don't forget to ask your girlfriend but when she gets angry or like...sad say ""I love you"" or when you say something aggressive say ""I think you're actions are stupid baby, honey, darling"" probably it'll make her less angry/sad

I have two great online friends. I've known them for a good five years and we've called and texted each other a lot, so naturally I trust them. 
Problem is, my mom doesn't. 
She caught me texting them one night, and the following morning she woke up early, took my phone, and read our conversations. (she does not allow passwords)
She didn't like a lot of things about them, nor did she like the conversations which we had (to be fair, we did use a bit of profanity) Next thing I know, I'm cutting every single contact I have with them. I wasn't even able to tell them what happened, she just wanted them gone and out of my life. 
It's been a while since then, but I've been very sad. They helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, and I had plans to meet them in a few years as well, so it's been very hard to let go. 

Should I continue to let go of them, or should I convince my mom that they're both nice people? I really want to talk to them again, since they were basically there when I had nobody else.

My mom has got a new partner. He has 3 kids: 2 girls and 1 boy. The ""boy"" is already like 20 years old. Youngest sister is 14, oldest is 16. I'm 16 too. Now when my mom and her new partner started to take the relationship seriously, I went to their house, and they came over to ours. I got kinda close to the oldest sister. We told eachother that we wanted to kiss. One night, I don't remember why, the oldest sister was spending the night at my moms. Only my mom, the oldest sister and me were home. We were watching some netflix and my mom got tired so she went upstairs. We kinda sticked around a little longer than my mom told us too, and we kissed. We went upstairs only for her to come into my room (she had her own room and own bed to sleep in) and lay on my bed. I put myself next to her, we lied there for 5 mins when we started kissing again. (I'm thinking about it now and it's really fucked up, I kissed my stepsister basically) It was awkward when we saw eachother again the day after, and a week later when I saw her again, we basically said nothing to eachother. I asked her what was going on. She bluntly said:""There's nothing between us. ""I'm there sitting in my couch, staring at my phone and I'm like: what?""

With some time and distractions such as any hobbies you have you can try and forget about this and try to form a better friendship with her. Also try and refrain from telling her to fuck off, that will just result in more bad memories to erase from your mind.

Hey man, thanks for helping and giving your advice. I told her we shouldn't do it anymore and she didn't agree. She wants to be fwb. I told her no.

Thanks mate it's just  that I am really confused when it comes to crushes. I am not really good at expressing my emotions, I am a very introverted person. Also I am quite shy and even tho my friends keep pushing me I don't think I have the guts to do it.

I'm exactly the same. If you want you could have a friend tell him. That's how my last crush found out.

Yep I was thinking about telling one of my best friends to ask him, but she's pretty crazy and she's gonna mess everythin up. I am gonna keep it to myself I guess until the feelings go away. Even though its pretty hard because I get to see him everyday.

I liked a girl for about 2 and a half years. The first year, nobody knew. I told my best friend and in about half a year, everybody knew. The last year my feelings kinda died down and I think it was better after people knew because I wasn't bottling feelings up inside.

Hmm that's exactly what I am trying to avoid. About you tho, 2 and a half years mate? That's a pretty long time. The longest crush I've ever had was about 6 months and it wasn't the best experience not because he did something wrong but because I am shy as I mentioned earlier and whenever I got the chance to talk him my tongue would stumble and fall

^^^^downvote ^^^^to ^^^^delete

Yes it was a very long time. I wasn't too into her for the last 6 months to a year though, it was just I had nobody else to have a crush on and I didn't have a reason to not like her and I didn't lose all interest. The only reason I stopped liking her is because I moved away. Don't know if I would still like her or not

I see, everything happens for a reason tho mate.

U moved out huh? Was it easy for u man?

No. Second time moving states in my life. I was like 8 or 9 the first time so that on wasn't too hard. This time is. I went to an amazing school and my new school is shit. At the same time I messed up my life by not doing all of my homework. Now I'm on break and supposed to be doing make up work but I just can't find the motivation. I'll stare at it for a little bit and write a little but I just can't do much or get very far on anything. I was getting A's and B's and now I'm prolly gonna finish the semester with 2 C's. For some reason I just stopped caring. After I left my anxiety went way up and now I'm super self-conscious and hate myself. Borderline depressed. All I want is to go back home. It's only been about three months, which felt like a year, but hopefully it will get better.

I see how it is. Well I dont know if my opinion matters but I'll say it anyways. Do u know what the word human stands for mate? In ancient greek ""άνθρωπος = human"" means looking up, trying to touch the sky. There's this latin phrase ""Dum Spiro Spero"" that stands for ""While I breathe, I hope"". Hope is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence. Mate we come from a dark abyss and end to an dark abyss the in between bright part call it life.

When it comes to school and studying walk towards the toughest path and one day u ll arrive.

Thanks

You're very welcome mate",2019-11-26 21:23:40

Dude you're in 7th grade, you're not going to be 4""10 forever (hopefully). Stick with it a but longer and wait till high school maybe, then if you still hate it then quit. If you quit now, you might regret it in the future.

I had a kid who was similar in height and was one of the best on the basketball team in middle school. He had to work harder because the only way he could shoot was if he juked out the guy who was covering him. Just work hard on ball control and make a good fake move.

Isaiah Thomas (not the former pistons player) is like 5'6 and was an mvp candidate like 3 yrs ago and he was more than double your age. Keep at it bro

From what you are describing I think she might use a keylogger (google it) to get your passwords. The savest  way to remove those is to factory reset every device you use to log into those accounts and then change the passwords. When you change the passwords, start with the email account that you use to reset the passwords. If you need more advice ask.

My best friend got in his first serious relationship and I do not like the girl. She has talked lots of crap about me in the past and told everyone that she would take my best friend away from me. Even with that I tried to be nice.... she denied me every single time. Later I decided to have a Christmas party and since she hadn’t been talking to me I didn’t invite her, I even asked my best fiend if that’s okay and he said it’s fine. She got pissed and decided to throw a party the same day. I apologized many times and I decided to cancel my party for her. I was close to a lot of her friends but I never told them how I felt because I didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Later we all found out that she has been talking crap about all of us and she ditched her other friends so they are kinda on my side. We recently we went on a trip for school and we decided not to talk to there group because she gets very jealous when girls talk to my best friend and we didn’t want to deal with the shit talking. They blamed us and started telling people that we were talking shit about them.

Can’t u just get it and hide it from her

I would suggest the same as the previous person. Ask a friend to share an account. Unfortunately I don't see any other way that works in your favor without you getting caught. I'm sorry your mom is that controlling and manipulative. I have a mom that's the same exact way so I've been there. Keep hanging in there

My parents are the same. After they got divorced things got a little easier on me. One thing I failed to realize was they secretly downloaded an app on their phone that connects to mine to show all my search history it literally sends an alert to them if I search up something explicit. I searched up porn hub one time cause I wanted to see what Alabama hotpocket was but it sent an alert to them that I searched it, they didn’t talk to me about it but the way I saw that they see this was I looked at my mail app and it showed that I searched porn hub. It’s called change.org or something. I search up really explicit things cause I’m a curious teenager (it’s nothing super bad, it’s life like sex Ed stuff that I should’ve learned awhile ago but they failed to teach me). It’s really upsetting that they can’t trust me with anything. I have life 360 on my phone to and I’m not allowed out of the house. I’m 15 I feel like I should get treated better but I don’t. I just want to live normal lives like all the other kids.

If you have a friend who doesnt have a parent who monitors their phone just make an account on their phone or do tiktok with them

I don’t see this as being controlling or manipulative. To me it just seems like they’re trying to protect their child but going about it the wrong way.

The fact that any parent puts spyware on their child's phone is controlling and is an invasion of their privacy. Privacy is NOT a privilege it's a RIGHT same as any other human being. There's way to protect your child without putting tracking and spyware on their electronics. At least let your child have the apps and then protect them. Keeping them from being able to communicate with people whether online or otherwise is detrimental to their social well being and is quite frankly inhumane.

Oh xD

113,ekuwcp,False,,2,"Wanting to move out, can’t yet",AdviceForTeens,"I’ve wanted to move out for a while now but the straw that broke the camel’s back is that currently, my very conservative mother has realized that I(17M) like most teens I’m assuming, masturbate and watch porn, and has put parental controls and censorship on all my devices. It’s not the end of the world but it’s irritating. I’ve found ways around them but it’s tough having them constrict what I deem “appropriate”.  They also control my life in a bunch of other, smaller ways. I realize they are trying to keep me safe but it’s becoming too much when I want my own freedom

I’ve gained a bit of perspective of what it costs to live on your own. From what I understand, I would have to take 2 full time jobs which I would be willing to do in order to have my own freedom. But the problem is, I still have to finish my senior year of high school, which I can’t finish and have time for 2 full time jobs(I already have a part time job as well which I could make full time). Finishing high school would obviously open up more job opportunities but I hate having to wait for that. I would go straight into college after but my family wouldn’t be able to afford it, and I don’t want to have to pay off student loan debt for years after, so I’m trying to look into ways to fully pay off my tuition(thinking of saving for few years once I’m living on my own then going back to be a programmer) 
My parents tell me that as long that I live under their roof, I have to obey their rules. I want to move out to avoid that but I can’t. I’m turning 18 in 2 months and am gonna try to make some big steps to change this then but right now I don’t know if there is anything I can really do other then just finish school. I’m sure there will be plenty of things along the way that I haven’t accounted for in my planning or things that will happen that are out of my control, but I am doing my best to plan out my future, atleast financially. 
TL:DR 17yo teen wants to move out from restrictive parents, but wouldn’t be able to afford it having to finish high school.

I unfortunately don’t have much of a choice to be honest. Closest family is my grandma on my moms side who is 3 counties away and would just bring me right back. I’m an introvert and don’t have any friends that would let me live with them. Even if I did run away to live with someone else, I already know my parents would flip and call cops, put out searches etc. I live in a relatively small town so I don’t think I could hide anywhere for long, and when I’m taken back I may be locked up forever. Idk exactly what would happen but it wouldn’t be an improvement. Sadly all we can both do it seems it to wait it out. Best of luck to whatever your situation is as well.",2020-01-06 22:34:44
815,audwgp,False,,1,"i’m so tired of my friend, what do i do?",AdviceForTeens,"i’ve known this friend for like 5ish years, and she’s seriously starting to annoy me. i don’t know exactly what she did but i’m literally around her 24/7, from being in the same friend group as her to being on the same team as her, there’s literally 1 day out of the week i don’t see her, and i’m so annoyed. i sit with her at lunch with our 2 other friends, i have a class with her almost everyday with one of our other friends, and like i mentioned i’m on the same team as her, and at most i’m with said team 4/7 days of the week. 

like i said i’ve known her for so long but we’re not even that close. i tell her some things, like minor problems in my life but i just feel so uncomfortable telling her anymore than that, and she doesn’t bring them up either. but, since i’m always around her (because i’m not THAT close with my other friends in our friend group/on our team) it’s normal for my other friends to leave me alone with her if that makes sense. i just feel like people associate us with each other in a way, since she’s always around me, and i don’t like that for some reason.

i like my other friends better, i feel so much more comfortable around my other friends than i do around her. yesterday we were at another school for a competition with my team. she accidentally got split from us and i was alone with the other 2 girls and it was so relieving to not be around her and as soon as she came back it was like.....stuffy. 

i guess it’s because i’m around her all the time that i feel this way but i just genuinely don’t want to be around her at all anymore. unfortunately for me, i have another 4 day week with my team, 3 days of school with her, and she basically invited herself over to spend the night at my house this weekend because her family’s gonna be out of town. i would tell my mom or one of my other friends i feel this way but i feel like they’d be so surprised because it’s out of the blue, since i normally act like everything’s ok. however, i sometimes am just a dick to her, not on purpose really it just happens. 

i don’t even know why i’m friends with her? we have the same sense of humor but that’s literally it. we don’t watch any of the same shows, like any of the same music, all we have in common is our friends, our sense of humor (a bit), and being on the same team. that’s it. i have so much more in common with my other friends, but this friend in particular has talked shit about the music/shows my other friends watch/listen to, to me, and i don’t really talk about music or shows i like with her a lot cause it’s just not what we talk about so it kinda made me feel bad in a way. 

i genuinely don’t know what to do, because like i said i like my other friends more but i can’t just randomly cut ties with this friend because everyone around me would think it’s weird. i just hate being around her all the time. i don’t really like being around people in general, i get too overwhelmed. i prefer to be alone most of the time so this is a really unfortunate situation for me to be in. i don’t know what to do at all, and i feel like i can’t talk to anybody about it, what should i do?

also, i would sit with the other girls from our team however, one of them is homeschooled and only comes to the school for practices and such, and one has her own friend group (i’m referring to the two girls i mentioned earlier) and i’m just not close with the other people on my team like that. just those 2. and even then, this friend is also friends with them too since we were all hanging out yesterday at our competition so she’d most likely follow me to sit with them. 

EDIT: also i said earlier it wasn’t anything she did but yeah nvm it is, she always asks me to buy her food and tells me to buy new clothes when for example my shoes are dirty and i guess you could say my family kinda struggles financially? and she comes from a rich family so she obviously doesn’t understand but i feel like by now she should. i tell her no because she’ll stand there saying “buy me _____” like 500 times when i’m standing in the lunch line and she won’t shut up and yeah whatever it is isn’t expensive but she always forces me into buying it for her when it’s her fault she never brings food to school/doesn’t buy lunch for herself. and she makes me feel bad about my clothing and always tells me my food looks gross? idk it’s not that big of a deal but it’s genuinely so annoying. and currently she’s spamming my phone because i won’t answer her texts so.....",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/audwgp/im_so_tired_of_my_friend_what_do_i_do/,1,"This happened to me, I slowly drifted off by saying this that he/she hates and then she will slowly detach because of interests.",2019-02-25 07:10:51

That's awesome you do journalling! Anything counts in my book, as long as you're able to get out the feelings sometimes you can't say in words. Really excited for you, sounds like a great opportunity to do all of that stuff. Motivation is definitely the hardest part of anything and I would say just try to create little goals and focus on one at a time until you complete it. Good luck, you've got this.

769,caos7o,False,,5,sibling stress,AdviceForTeens,"I have a younger brother who has trouble controlling his emotions, he has recently been diagnosed with dyspraxia and fine motor skills. Being extremely sensitive this effects me. Whenever I do the smallest thing that doesn’t involve him he starts crying, blames it on me or has a tantrum. He’s only 10. My mum tells me to go away and leave him alone, but when he calls me names and attacks me it’s real difficult to just walk away and let him win. I don’t want him when he’s older to think if he does something he’ll win and get away from it. But him doing all of this makes me stressed and anxious. From this I usually break down and start crying. The other day my mum called me a disappointment which really hit hard. I don’t know what to do and how to deal with when I get stressed, or how to cope with walking away. Any advice or anything please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/caos7o/sibling_stress/,1,"I would recommend to talk to something like a school counselor about this it always made it a lot easier to talk and explain this stuff to someone that is not in the situation but is nearby i wish you the best

EDIT: spelling

So I first want to say that I’m really sorry your mom said that to you. That’s unacceptable to say to any kid let alone your own. But in terms of your brother, I’d suggest talking to your mom/dad about what your brother does and ask for guidance as to what to do and how to handle it. Another route you could take would be to talk to whoever diagnosed your brother and ask about what you should or shouldn’t do with him and also ask them for guidance. It’s hard not knowing what to do and even harder when there’s someone around who isn’t just “normal”. Best of luck to you.

212,fa1e6l,False,,3,Should I feel like I am in the wrong?,AdviceForTeens,"This is my first post so sorry if I do anything wrong.

&#x200B;

So I live with my grandparents and they are Jehovah's Witnesses. After growing up with their religion I have chosen to not be in it. I am the only child in the whole family still ""in the religion"" and they have called me their only hope which puts pressure on me that I don't want. I have tried before to tell them I don't want to be a part of their religion but when I did they said I was disappointing them after all they have done for me (if i didn't go to when them when I was a year old then i would have gone to my mothers grandparents who i don't know.) and my grandma even cried. Before confessing this I have indiscreetly asked what they would do if I didn't want to be a witness and they said that as long as I am under their house they would take me to church if i wanted to go or not. Growing up in the ""truth"" I know for a fact that Jehovah's Witnesses believe that no one should be forced into their religion.  I was planning on leaving the religion and getting a job at 16 to save up money to be able to live after 18 as they will probably kick me out. But after confessing the first time and seeing their sadness I begun thinking that me wanting to do my own thing is wrong and that I should just suck it up and be unhappy but make them happy which is what I have been doing. Also if I continue to go after becoming inactive people would look at me with disappointment which would hurt me emotionally. I seriously don't know what to think about this so any advice at all is happily welcomed and worshiped.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fa1e6l/should_i_feel_like_i_am_in_the_wrong/,3,"You're not in the wrong, your grandparents are. Freedom of religion is a human right. It's absolutely despicable that they expect another autonomous human being to conform to their religion. To me anyone who believes in religion so much as to do that to others is batshit insane and not worth my time.

You may love your grandparents now, but probably over time you'll see they're full of shit. I thought my grandparents were the world because they practically raised me and were nicer than my toxic parents. But then I realised they are just as toxic and full of shit.

If I was you I would stick with their religion, that means a lot to them, and you'd be supported. But I don't believe in religion, it's all one big bullshit, but if you do and it matters a lot to you, you gotta say it. Although it wouldn't be the best thing you can do, you need to think for yourself.

Thanks for the comfort bro. Honestly still being in contact with my dad has been helping because he has giving me advice and i can always turn to him for help. I use to think my grandparents were amazing but they pushed me so much that it felt like a burden and then some things in the religion separates me from my friends so i just wanted to know if i was wrong.",2020-02-27 06:16:06
353,f8h24k,False,,2,The guy I used to like and maybe still do,AdviceForTeens,"

It was autumn, october, everything was new for me expect my best friend, at least I had her among those people I didn’t know. 

I really wasn’t planning on starting to like someone, to have a crush on someone. Mainly because the guy i liked for years hurted me to the point I never want to feel love again. 

One day my best friend told me about this guy( lets call him John). Now my best friend knew John as a really nice and shy guy. She thought it’d be really good if I started to like someone who’s worth it and wouldn’t be like the past guy.

In the beginning I wasn’t interested in him at all, I began to see him every day, every time I would go out and slowly without noticing I had fallen for him. (Also just to put it out there, we were never friends and still are not.)

Now I told my best friend that I started to like him and she was happy because she had hopes that he’s a good person, I also told two other friend about him. Now lets name this other two friends Lola and Laura. 

Me and Lola would kinda be goofy around him because that’s just how I was around my friends and I didn’t want to act different just because I liked John or to impress him( being goofy sometimes around him also doesn’t mean that I was goofing around laughing loudly or talking loudly, basically doing something to get his attention). When I would get jealous Lola would go to John and just look at him angry, also she would call my name every time she saw him. 

In the other side my cousin had a friend who knew John so I immediately told my cousin to ask her friend what kind of person was John,(lets name my cousins friend Pete). 

Pete told my cousin that John wasn’t a good person he was kind of an asshole and very selfish, and that I wouldn’t be his type mainly because I’m not the type of girl to dress those fancy dresses and go to the club every friday. The description that Pete gave my cousin was very very different from what my best friend thought John was, and that was immediately a turn off lets say for me. 
I tried to forget him because I wasn’t prepared to be hurt more just like the last time. 

Now a year has past and John never looked at me last year, maybe sometimes. Now everytime we run into each-other he just stares at me, also we have sport class together, and he always looks at me, my friends always catch him staring at me. 

My question is: Why is he looking at me ?Is it because of the things my friend would do in front of him or he just stares at me without a reason? I know this was long but I wanted an advice from someone who might maybe know the real answer and can help me so I don’t have to haunt my self with those thoughts anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8h24k/the_guy_i_used_to_like_and_maybe_still_do/,2,"It's possible that he likes you. It's also possible that he wonders why you suddenly stopped hanging out with him.

Best way to find out is ask him directly. I know it seems super nerve-wracking to just go up and basically ask ""So I've noticed you looking at me sometimes...What gives?"", But most guys, especially at that age when they're all awkward, would really appreciate you being upfront about it.

Thank you for your advice I wish I had the courage to talk to him. We actually never talked, my best friend knew him from family but they never didn’t talk much, they only talk a little like if they see each other to a family gathering, since he’s very shy with family members.",2020-02-24 06:26:05
0,fcpbui,False,,13,Can't have sex the same,AdviceForTeens,"I'm in a relationship of 2 years, naturally being together for so long we decided last year to start having sex. Always wore a condom, and naturally figured eachother and ourselves out and grew closer. But we had a scare. She felt nauseous and threw up. Scared the hell out of me so we got a pregnancy test. This isn't the first time we've tested before. She's on birth control but I was still scared shitless. The test came out negative fortunately but every time we have sex I get wordied about the condom and pregnancy and I completely lose my sex drive and ability to keep going. 

What do I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fcpbui/cant_have_sex_the_same/,24,"Have you tried trying your hardest to just continue going after you lose motivation?

Maybe start small to build it back up again. Just touching and things like that until you work your way up to having sex. She has to understand how you feel and that would be pretty stupid if not. You could also use this as an opportunity to do other things and just enjoy spending time together without sex. Either way just do what you feel is right after getting more input. Maybe you could try talking to her as well.

The nausea is most likely due to sex not setting well with her the previous night. I would monitor the way she acts as she might be getting sick with the common cold or allergies as mine will cause me to throw up sometimes

I’m sorry

I have, but I don't want to get her to get me going every time. It's embarrassing so I resort to throwing my clothes back on and calling it without making it worse for myself. Thought about enhancements to help me out but I don't want to ge to the point where I can't have sex without them

We talked about it. She didn't have a lot to say just that it's okay and not to worry. She feels like it's her fault and I don't want that at all. Just trying to find ways to not worry so much.

She has a lot of genetic issues that make her feel sick. Since this post we talked about it and she was very understanding. But I still find myself getting worried for maybe half a second and my entire body losing sexual drive because of my concern. It's more of a mental roadblock which is why this issue is discouraging for me

Next time when you do have the motivation try and just focus in on the moment, maybe close your eyes for a few seconds and just embrace the details and focus to try and draw your mind off of other thoughts.

Granted I would kinda blame myself as well so I totally understand that. Maybe if she’s on a more effective birth control method it would help. IUDs are one of the most effective at over 99% for up to 3 years (Skyla). Maybe she’d be open to that.

Definetly don't want to make her put that up there because of my issue. She's mainly on BC to help with cramps due to her mom having shit genes and passing them onto her. It's a pretty tough situation to help myself out of but I just completely lost my sex drive and don't find myself to be as aroused as I was before this all happened

That’s exactly why I got my IUD. Couldn’t deal with the cramps anymore. And I know it seems like a rather large step for her to get one but they really do help with a ton of stuff. Whatever is going on I hope you figure it all out!

Thank you for the help, much appreciated

I wish you the best",2020-03-03 12:39:21

Even though I don't know exactly when you dropped out, that still leaves 3-8 years, so where you just doing nothing for all that time?

Then again, if you were really depressed and anxious to the point of not being able to do anything, why weren't your parents taking you to therapists or putting you on medication?

Now, I was always a boy, who was sensitive, weak but enjoying the books. My father managed to send me to the USA at the age of 15 to come back with a bachelor’s in robotics. This is sort of background. I totally differ from teenagers in my homecountry and think differently than most of the people home in terms of dietary guidelines, political views, tolerance opinions and religious points.

We’ve been talking since, but one thing to note is she has a boyfriend. This dude barely gives her any attention, (even though it may be unintentional), barely hangs out with her, and hasn’t been there for her much– on the other hand, here I’ve been, trying to show how much I care, respect her, and support her. She says she “needs” to be with him. She said it herself though, we talk more than she does with him.
    So last night was this play-thing I went to to support her, because she never said anything about her boyfriend being there— (we had already talked about this happening weeks im advance), and so as I’m chilling at the table waiting for it to start, her boyfriend walks in and sits right near me. Keep in mind, he barely knows I exist. 
    As you can tell things weren’t about to go smoothly, because she knew I liked her & that she had slight feelings for me as well. After the play, she comes off the stage and hugs her boyfriend right in front of me, since I was literally right there. Something hit me at that moment and I realized I liked her more than I thought because I pretty much bawled my eyes out afterwards. So I had to walk out of the school without even getting to congratulate her. I didn’t because I didn’t want to make anything suspicious / out of respect for him & her.
   The same night at around 8:00pm, she texts and asked if I was alright. I was blunt and told her no, and she responded with a ton of empathetic & meaningful I’m so sorrys— she didn’t know he would be there. But I had to tell her how I felt, so I said it. “Maybe we should pump the breaks. I’m really into you, and I’d rather not be the one lurking behind you & him for months at a time as y’all keep getting closer, and then get too attached. I honestly care for you a lot, and I want to be with you. Just let me know how you feel.” — she responds with something along the lines of “I want to be him but I also want to be with you, idk it’s just really confusing.” I told her to give it time, but honestly I don’t know if I can wait much longer knowing they’re in a relationship right now.

The thing is, she said she felt the same, but never showed as much as me and sometimes I felt like I was the only one trying to make our relationship work. We had great moments together and sometimes I could see in her eyes she loved me.

We were going through a strange week, we didn't have much to talk about and at the end of that week she told me she was confused about us, that wasn't the first time she said that. I asked if it was a phase and what she wanted to do, she answered ""I don't know"" to both questions. I said I didn't want to be with someone that wasn't sure she wanted to be with me, she just apologize and we say goodbye. 

She tried to reach me two days later saying how much she missed me and how much she loves me, I was heartbroken and told her how much she hurt me, with all her confusion and everything else she did, like blowing me off and how she didn't seem to like me as much as I liked her. She apologized once again and said she wouldn't ""bother me anymore"". My last messages were:
-you don't bother me
-I wish we could solved this
-but I don't know how.

I can't stop thinking about her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ezhs9a/did_i_rush_myself/,3,"Well first of all saying I love you shouldn’t take like 6 months or whatever. If you both are ready to tell each other you love them then it’s fine. I’ve dated people for like 2 weeks and started saying I love you. Also no I don’t think you rushed the break up. Maybe. It seems like the relationship got boring. You maybe stopped giving her love and affection, or maybe she stopped giving you love and affection so eventually it got boring. That’s normal. I personally think it was a good idea to break up with her. If she was questioning the relationship she probably would have caused you problems too in the long run if the relationship kept going. I’d work on yourself for awhile and just not date until you’re absolutely sure you want to again. That’s just my point of view. But you do you. Trust your gut I guess.

Holy fuck i relate to this. Dont have any advice as im still trying to get over it months later.

Yeah I guess I need some me time. 
My gut tells me to go after her and try to get back together, but I don't think I should do that, it's just... I feel this emptiness in my chest.
Maybe she got bored of me, I don't know.
I'll try to give time to time and maybe someday I'll know what to do.
Thanks for the comment, I really needed a outsider's view.

Yeah I feel you. I've been trying to feel my kind with other things to try to get over her, but I just can't. I think it's because deep inside I hope we will still work things out. 
I just had this ideia, that I'll wait a few days to put in practice. I'm writing down my feelings, trying to be honest to her and mostly to myself. I wanna know after these days what she thinks about all of this. Maybe she'll be sure about her feelings then. If she likes me we might try again or else this will be the ending of this chapter and I can finally move on.
Are going through that as well? Do you still believe things between u can work out someday?

The problem is, unlike you, she broke up with me bc she didnt want anything serious, while i wanted to fucking marry her someday. Our classes are over and we changed schools, and she was with another guy when i said that i didnt want to see her face anymore. But i was wrong, here i am, 4 months later, wishing i never said those words and missing her so much. I will only get to see her once more in a 15 yo party that will happen in 02/15, but thats it, ill never see her anymore. I just wanted her to come at me and say like “hey, i think i was wrong and i want to date you again, this time lets work things out”, but this is impossible as she don’t care about anything. I have no hope. I mean, she didnt say that she hated me or anything like that, she wanted us to still be friends, but i couldnt handle it. Maybe we can get back together one day, but we will only meet once and for the last time and i dont think she wants another relationship with me.

You could start telling her you're sorry about what you said. In the end you might not be with her and find someone else you love way more, but the feeling of ""what could've been?"" It's horrible. Just text her, u never know, she might miss u just as much.

She dont, i actually did not say this to her, some friends of mine said that she made up with another random guy and i told my friends i never wanted to see her again. And she doesn’t miss me because she is the kind of person who dont give a shit about things. If my girl friend asked her what she thought about me now, knowing her, she’d probably say “oh, that guy? Never thought of him anymore” I should probably text her though, just like you said

Fuck I know that type of girl. But that's it, u never know. Go ahead, I hope you the best.

Thanks, my friend said she have been feeling lonely bc she havent talked to anyone from my old class lately and maybe she will regret this. I think you should wait a little and then ask her what is on her mind, then depending on what happens u can try to get together again",2020-02-06 06:28:58

Advice

I  became friends with someone about 6 months ago and I thought everything has been going fine. We have shared some really personal stuff. But for the past couple of weeks I’ve started to notice something. I’m the one that always swipes up first on snap if he posts about something that he’s hurt about and etc, but never swipes up if I posted something I was hurt about. If we are on break from school, we could go 3 weeks without texting each other. He’s also very popular and has very close friends (like they have been friends since 3rd grade and are bonded through Christ) and I’ve been thinking that he’s using me for emotional support because I don’t know of any other reason that he would want to be friends me (just for the record, I’m a really good person and all). What should I do? I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m crazy or anything lol. Another thing, I honestly don’t know if he even cares about me, but I feel like I care more about him. I don’t want to waste my time on someone that doesn’t care about me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erclfh/i_need_some_advice_please/,6,"hmm i think thats ur relationship with him are just friends like for example i have friends that share secrets with me and i also do it to them.although during holidays we even hardly talk to each other.for close friends it will be different.  at least this is what i do. i am sry i could not help u much

hmm idk much but maybe he just wanted to socialize more and make more friends? idrk tho

462,deli1u,False,,3,I want to be my old self again,AdviceForTeens,"Hi! I'm 17 years old and don't know what's happening with me. I want to be my old self again. 

When I was in elementary, I was a really good student (please, I'm not bragging). I was always at the top in our class. I get high scores and grades. When I graduated elementary, I was the one who has most medals. When I took an entrance exam for a science high school, I was in rank 27.5 out of 200+. Yeah, I think I was doing great as a student.

Not until I reach high school tho. That was the time I started to lose my grip in acads. I started to have lower grades (but still passing) and I struggle in acads especially exams and quizzes and recitations. Still, I managed to pass and have a with Honor Award until the end of junior high (Grade 10). 

As I reached grade 11, Senior high, this is where I get worse. I can't focus and concentrate anymore. I struggle learning and listening in our class and discussions because my mind is always blank or always easily distracted. I daydream a lot. Whenever I review for our quizzes, I find it so difficult to review because the information I read doesn't retain in my head and i suck at memorizing now, unlike before, I was really good at memorizing. 

There was a time, I reviewed and studied for our quiz but at the time and moment of answering the quiz, my mind was blank! All the information I studied and reviewed was totally gone! I do not remember anything at all! I failed the quiz and I only got a score of 16 out of 45. I only got 16 because I managed to copy my classmate's answers. 

I was very frustrated. I'm not being lazy or anything. I can't seem to focus anymore. I am so unmotivated and I don't know why. I want to be the ""good"" student again. 

Now, I have realizations and thinking about the past. When I was 11 years old, grade 5, that was the time I  started to struggle more often in acads. And that was the time too when my dad's illness became worse and he started to become more really weak and thin. That was the time too when I started doing self harm and suicidal thoughts (but not much). I thought they were normal and I have this thinking before of harming other people like torturing them or something but that kind of thinking was eventually gone when I reached grade 6 (but self harming and suicidal thoughts did not stop). I don't cut myself, but I do punch or hit myself with something like bottles or hammer. 

Since grade 5, I did not saw my dad smile again and I was really studying hard for him. When I was in grade 6, I thought that in our graduation, I'll see him smile. I told him that he'll be the one who will be on the stage with me so he'll put my medals on me. Unfortunately, 12 days before our graduation, he died, and I witnessed how he died. The day before his death, he called me and I saw him lying in his bed, very weak that he can't even open his eyes. I went near him and he was raising his hand, so I held it. He told me the words that hurt me so much, he said to me, ""I'm sorry, I cannot attend your graduation anymore."" And that was his last words to me.

Grade 7, 13 years old, the time where my suicidal thoughts became worse and the start of me being so unmotivated in school and struggling on focusing. At that time, I searched on the internet about my suicidal thinking and there appeared about mental illness and depression. But I don't want to self diagnose lol

My ""depression"" became worse when I was in Grade 8. Everyday, I always think how I'll kill myself. I also had this situation wherein Everytime I'll sleep, I'll dream! I have this condition since I was in grade 7. I thought it was cool since dreaming in sleep makes me feel like I'm in another world or something but then eventually I found it very annoying and tiring! I wake up very tired because of dreaming and I feel like it's making me insane! In about 1 and a half years, there was no single sleep where I'm not dreaming. 

Thankfully, I managed to get rid of ""depression"" when I started writing in a diary/journal when I started to have interest in stationeries.

Another thing about me is that I daydream too much and I have characters. I started doing this when I was 5 years old but I think that is normal. The thing is, up until now, I daydream like a kid and it's worse. Why? Because it distracts me so much and I cannot focus with the things I do because of it. There is so many triggers of my daydreams. 

Addition, I do not like being with my friends often because I wanted to be alone because if I'm alone, I can daydream more and I can have moments more with my characters. The urge is too much. 

I have a best friend character named Coco and I like being with him. I don't like him romantically. He is my best friend so yeah, it's fun being with him.

I'm emotionally numb too, unless I am with my ""characters"" or daydreaming. There were times that my classmates were emotional but I was confused because why am I not feeling anything. Sometimes I fake to have emotions which results to me doing inappropriate emotions or expressions in some situations. 

Another thing is that I often find it hard to sleep because I am daydreaming. Even though I am really sleepy, my brain keeps on daydreaming which makes me struggle to sleep. 

I know that all of this looks like now making any sense but I haven't shared this to anyone. I want to know what is with me. I want my old self back. I want to be the person again who can focus and concentrate in her studies and have good grades. I want to be the motivated student again. I want my old self. Please give me advice, please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/deli1u/i_want_to_be_my_old_self_again/,2,"I daydream a lot too,I think a lot of people do,maybe it’s just part of who you are,think on the bright side, maybe you are somehow a good writer,maybe try to write again,studies don’t mean everything,but that doesn’t mean you should drop it, maybe try to sit down and sort everything out yourself,if you daydream again,you can write and get it out of your brain. It’s different for everyone on how they are able to concentrate,for me I usually listen to music or even watch a YouTube video while also studying,it actually helps me concentrate better. Find your own way to just ya know,concentrate. If it still doesn’t work,this is the world trying to say taht thsi is who you are now,maybe you are a good writer or something else you are good at.

Thank you, this helped me. I don't have any experience on writing stories and such. If I try to write my daydreams, I feel like I'm wasting my time to it because I'll be really into writing it hehe. Music is great, I'm a pianist and a violinist, but studying with music is not helping me because it will trigger my daydreams and music is the most trigger. I listen to relaxing music or like rain, wind, etc. sounds while studying too but sometimes I avoid them as well because they make me sleepy. Yes, I'm trying to find ways that'll help me on studying and concentrating but for now, I still can't find the right one lol. 
Thank you, again! And also, what is your problem? I'm willing to know and help you 😊

Thank you! This helped me. I'll try to search about tulpa. Actually, I've never heard of it and thank you for telling me! 
Not sure if Coco is acting on his free will tho...

I don't know how to finish or end the chapter if I daydream but I'm trying to learn how. Also most of my daydreams is that I'm with my characters the whole day and then at the end of the day, I'll sleep or sometimes we sleep together in a room and if I daydream the sleeping part, it makes me sleepy.

Yeah I daydream a lot and Coco is just really distracting me most of the time 😅, not only Coco, they are many! But there are only 4 characters who have names, the others don't have names yet. Just this day, when I was in a vehicle, I was daydreaming too much and then we passed my destination! So I had to walk back to my destination lol 😅 

Anyways, thank you for your advice! I'll keep it in my mind and heart",2019-10-08 00:05:14

They say they were there for me when it came to my passions and interests but they never actually were. I’ve missed out on a lot of my life because of myself and also because of their discouragement. Until recently I never thought I was capable of learning the things I wanted to learn or doing the things I wanted to do; I was isolated and in online school with no friends or socialization. I’m in public school now and I’m finding it difficult being happy for other people especially my friends. I’m accidentally envious towards them and I don’t mean to be, how can I change this behavior tho? For example, a lot of them are really into music. I am too, I’m a sound engineer but I don’t know how to play any instruments and when they talk about playing and performing I get really upset even if I try to stop myself from getting upset. It still upsets me, I think it’s because I wish I had that skill and I’m working on it, but it’s not something I’m capable of doing in the same way right now. Any advice? It’s just jealousy in general, like they’ve all known each other since they were little and I’m just kind of here. It’s getting better but it’s also getting worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/elws5s/how_can_i_be_happy_for_other_people/,2,"I would suggest taking it until you actually feel less jealous. Like when someone says how they love performing, say ""you're great at it too."" And if you keep saying positive things to people, you will start to believe them too. 
If you others success start to weigh down on you, remember what you enjoy, what you do, and if you think you're not measuring up use that to propel yourself into success.
Basically, fake positivity until you are positive. With others and yourself. 
I hope this helps.

I do that already, but if it’s helping it’s very slow. Like last time my friends performed I made sure to support and encourage them and talk to them after their performance just sucks that I’m not at that point yet with certain things. Everyone progresses different ig and I gotta understand that thanks tho.",2020-01-09 02:38:05

And to add on as of yesterday his best friend who touched me is now dating his younger sister. 

Update: 

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails and then the whole friend group turned on me even this girl named Sam who I was friends with and told the day after it happened

I have no clue what to do anymore I hate my body. I hate myself I can’t even have sex anymore because of how disgusting I feel all my anxiety and panic attacks came back that’s been gone for years and now I just destroyed his whole family and friend group and I also lost all my friends and no one believes me and I didn’t even want to tell my boyfriend because I felt this would happened and now I’m just so scared and sad",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eb7m17/my_boyfriends_best_friend_touched_me_during_a/,2,"that is not ok and you definitely need to tell him, especially since he started dating your bfs younger sister.

Best thing to do is tell your boyfriend what has happened. R u scared that it’ll cause drama? If so, please don’t be. Especially looking out for the younger sisters best well being you will need to tell your boyfriend what happened so that the same thing doesn’t happen to her.

If they're genuinely harassing you then... that's time to get the police involved. I'm sorry this is so so scary for you! But it's not going to fix itself by hiding under a blanket :(

That’s absolutely awful! I’m so sorry for you, I hope you’re okay. I feel you should definitely tell your boyfriend especially for the safety of his sister. I experienced something similar of a much lower degree and I was very conflicted and upset, but I told my boyfriend in the end and two years later I feel it was definitely the right call. I really hope things work out better for you soon.

Tell your boyfriend, eventually his sister his parents your parents, documents. Tell him to stay tf away from you. I'm so sorry sweetie. Text me if you ever need to talk I was sexually assulted by my best friend about a year ago too. It's okay, you're gonna be okay you need to tell people

Tell your parents as well as screenshot and record any of those messages they’re sending you. What he did is not ok neither is what his family doing to you now. You are not at fault for what’s happened he is, he took advantage of you and that is not ok. The decision is yours but you can go to the police, or your schools guidance counselor as well and tell them the situation.

Here's my question what's your boyfriend doing about hugs mom and sister

You should probably talk too someone or go to therapy, block his family, If he doesn't want to talk to his mom and sister then leave him. The abuse from them won't end

I’m so sorry this happened to you. Stay strong ❤️

don’t have sex if you can’t right now. it’s not your fault. fuck the people not listening to you.

police now, probably 💚

I just told my boyfriend who told his sister and now his sister and mom are sending me threatening text messages and calling me a liar and they are non stop calling me and leaving very rude and harsh text messages and voicemails

So I’m in a WhatsApp group chat with me, Rachel and our 2 other friends (I’ll call them Ellen and Jessi) and Ellen is also bisexual so I renamed the group chat as a joke to “Bisexuh0es” and then Rachel changed it to “Bisexuh0es and Jessi” and I said 

“wait? Rachel are you bi?” 

And she said

“Yeah I am”

And then I said without thinking

“Wow I used to have a crush on you but I thought you were straight” 

And she was like “I had a crush on you too” 

So then I messaged we privately after that and asked her to be my girlfriend and such etc etc. So this was on the 16/1/20 and we had a school trip on the 19th-23rd and we were sharing a room with our friends throughout the trip and we were hugging in the rooms and holding hands and such and yeah 😂☺️. I know that the relationship is moving quite fast but, it’s been fine that way so far and I kind of want to kiss her (that sounds so weird but) and I don’t know how to go about doing it I mean with Valentines Day coming up I might do it then but I’m just nervous on what to say.

Haha that's awesome! I just realized I clicked on your notification of following me, and then I must have clicked on one of your posts. I thought this was recent... embarrassing hahaa

Actually, you probably should ask if she's comfortable with kissing you before doing it. Consent is always important and she may not be okay with you just going straight for a kiss if she's not comfortable with that. 👍

Thanks George! I’ll take your advice. Please add me on snapchat @jagkanhetahana

Laughing in class is wayy better than burping

636,esduq6,False,,2,2 years of this is too long...help,AdviceForTeens,"Alright so here’s the thing. I’m a (F) in highschool and my best friend is also a (F) in highschool. We’ve been close for a few years but in 8th grade, I started to question my true feelings for her. I thought nothing of it really at first but when we went roller skating with our friends, that’s when I realized she may mean something more to me. We did the couples skate because that was the last skate of the night and we didn’t want to stop skating. We had to hold hands the whole time because that was the rule to do the final skate. I felt really nervous for “some reason” but again, didn’t think much of it. In 9th grade, things got interesting. She shared some really personal stuff with me, one thing being that she was confused about her sexuality and everything. She even said that she thought she liked one of our friends (F). That night, I did something bravely stupid. I almost kissed her. I got closer and closer but I ended up not going through with it cause I didn’t want to ruin our friendship or anything. At this point, she thought I was straight which confused her even more. After that night, she texted me as soon as I left saying that she missed me and everything, we also shared overnight phone calls moving on after that. Long story short, things were revealed and she implied that she might feel the same way that I thought I felt about her. This little flirtatious and leading on stage went on for a few weeks. All changed after she “talked to a school counselor” and revealed that they said she was just confused. She told me this of course after I fully confessed how I really felt which took a lot. She sent me really long paragraphs basically praising me and saying that she needs me in her life basically. After that, she started acting a little differently towards me and I noticed right away. She wasn’t as touchy and she just treated me very differently overall. It made me really sad. We had a sleepover with our other friend and we had a 4am “confession” time and she revealed that she doesn’t wanna be gay but she doesn’t know her sexuality. She also revealed that she thinks or thought she liked this one guy in her class. After our friend fell asleep, I started blabbering and talked about that night and basically revealed that that night was messing me up and I’ve been feeling a certain way ever since. She acted like she was asleep for a while but after I put a blanket over her, she said very sleepily, “you should’ve just done it” of course I was shocked and like so confused. That all messed me up even more. She started acting so distant after that confession night and she ended up taking a break from me and our other friend all summer. The WHOLE summer. No contact with us at all. It was later revealed when she came back into my life that it was partly because of me and everything that happened. A guy friend of ours that just recently came into our lives (whom she had feeling for apparently) helped us kinda get closure from that whole situation but I’m still left sad. Ever since she’s been back, she’s been acting more like how it used to be. Overnight calls every night, she wants to hang out all the time, engages with me, all touchy and stuff. I feel like there’s no way she doesn’t at least feel the same even a little bit. Not with everything we’ve been through and everything we continue to go through. I’m still confused on my feelings for her constantly but I know that I love her. I don’t know if it’s in a different way than a best friend but it’s a strong feeling. I get jealous and upset and sometimes mad at her for no reason which I feel really bad about...what do I do and what does this all mean??",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/esduq6/2_years_of_this_is_too_longhelp/,1,"So do you know if you like her, in like a more relationship way? Or is that what your asking, like your not sure if you have feelings for her or not? Because if you do I would say talk to her about it see what’s going on see if she has feelings for you, which actually sounds really hard thinking about it because I know I couldn’t Do that if I tried, but maybe when she said that you should’ve just done it, maybe this is your second chance to do it, not many of those happen like this. If you got one take it, They don’t happen too often.

I’m just totally confused on where she stands in all of this. She’s giving such mixed signals when I’m trying to be pretty clear or I have been. Yes, she did say that I should’ve just done it and then after that is when the whole situation came into play where we got “closure” from that night when I almost kissed her. She told him that she doesn’t feel the same way and she feels really bad about it but there are so many reasons why I don’t think that’s true, even if it’s just a little shred of feeling or confusion or whatever. The fact that she’s confused is confusing me and making me question where I stand and everything.",2020-01-22 23:50:46

No problem. Be safe! Condoms plus birth control will save you from life-long regrets. Many people don't show any signs of an STD infection, even when they can still pass the infection to you. Many women who have fertility problems can atribute it to scarring from and STD that they never knew they had. If you're having sex, condoms are the best way to decrease your chances of getting an STD. If buying them in person is too much to deal with, remember you can buy them online! And in most towns there will be at least one clinic that can hook you up with free birth control!",2020-03-01 12:19:44

Socialize and have barbeques. If you have a car, take them out to fun stuff. Keep texting your friends, and whenever they invite you to parties, become a social butterfly.

For example, this is the worse he's done to me,  it might not sound like much but it really hit close to home.  When I would be hanging with my friends after school, he would never tag along even after we ALL begged and begged he LITERALLY said he'd rather play games 😒. So I left him.

When we started dating, the very next day D.H went up to me and told me not to date F.D and to be with him instead.  I WAS SHOOK. And at that time,  I still had feelings for D. H because the reason we broke up in the first place was because he didn't act like we really loved me when I knew for a fact that I did.  So,  I broke up with F.D and went with D.H to give him another chance. He was a better person but I started to hang out with F.D again and.... cheated.

589,f5lgr3,False,,0,Bashed by ex friend for something I didn’t do.,AdviceForTeens,"Sorry if this is a bit long, I barely post on Reddit.

So today, at school, I was bashed by my 
problematic ex friend on the basis of the statement that I supposedly shit talked all my friends. Which I didn’t, besides one, the girl who bashed me, and it was more like criticism because she has been doing lots of bad stuff recently, and all the others had been talking about her too. But I didn’t talk about the others.

On Sunday I get a dm from my best friend, saying that I shit talked her according to problematic friend, not to deny it because she know what I had said, how I better be careful what I do next and how it really hurt. I thought back to see if I remember doing so, which I didn’t. Got a bit mad and explained I had not done so, which didn’t garner a response. 

I send the dm to my other best friend, who said she believes that problematic friend is trying to both kick her and I out of the friend group, and I agree. However she comes back with a dm from the previous friend explaining that I had also shit talked about her?? Which I also knew I hadn’t. Confused. I said that yet again, I didn’t, and I get left on seen, twice. So then I asked the problematic friend nicely at first whether she had said that I shit talked my friends to them. She denied, and instantly said “I don’t need your bullshit, fix this yourself” and stuff like that, even though first friend explicitly said that problematic girl says this.


I leave it be, and announce how I’m leaving the group as I had other friends that treated me better, and I didn’t need toxicity and how they didn’t listen to me. No response either. Whatever, I guess. Then today came, and problematic girl told my boyfriend that I was to be bashed. She sees me, and starts yelling obscurities, and I told her to piss off. She comes up to me, and I try to de-escalate by saying how I didn’t want to fight, and how I wouldn’t hit her, and we could talk about this normally, to no avail, she threw a punch to which I blocked. However I’m a really really weak fighter, so I lost, she threw me to the ground and I just shielded myself as she threw punches at me and kicked and pushes, left school after that with all the kids laughing and filming.


I know I’m not in the wrong. The situation they brought up where I supposedly talked shit was misunderstood by a metric fuck ton. 
I went to get books from my locker, friends ditched me, and I was too tired to look for them. So I found problematic girl and her friend, sat with them for a bit. I brought up how I was ditched, but I didn’t really care and how I thought they were mad at me or something, and they must of taken this as shit talking. But I know I didn’t, I have no reason to, and I loved these friends. 

My question now is, what the fuck do I do? I’m thinking of moving schools, because I have no other friends, my bf is possibly going to break up with me after this, and getting those friends back is not an option sadly.

My mom just came downstairs to have a ""chat"" about the relationship between my sisters and I. My sisters both go the university while I'm still stuck in high-school. I usually can not get a conversation going with my mom because she thinks I have a bad attitude and don't try to make friends. I get really pissed off everytime my mom tells to change and make some friends at school. It's not like I don't try to make friends, but the girls in my grade are very materialistic and really enjoy gossiping. I'm not that type of person to go around and start spreading rumours. Therefore, I'm only acquaintances with the girls. I'm more better off talking to boys cause they're chill and fine with the jokes I make. After all, the guys don't take the things I say to heart. On the other hand, my mom doesn't like the idea of me having friends that are boys because they are guys. I have a cousin and that's like the closest friend I've got. However, I don't tell him my secrets because it's highly likely that he'll tell my sisters. My sisters are always busy cause they're in university. Sometimes they're not as busy, so we try to sit down and try to talk. Once I start talking another talks over me and completely ignores me. My mom always tells me to be nice and listen to others, but they don't do the same and take advantage of it. What can I do, can anyone tell me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f66qkf/i_dont_know_what_to_do_now/,3,"For the first part, I think you need to be more open about the girls around you. Unless you're in a super small high school, it's not possible for every single girl to be like you described. When I was in high school, I easily found people that are not like you described. Maybe it's just where I went, but I promise theres a group out there for you :) I'm not trying to sound like your mother, because I understand how pushy parents can be sometimes. What are your interests? Would you be willing trying out clubs or sports or other school activities? Do you like anime, drawing, singing? 

I felt the same way as you when I first started high school. But honestly, in the long run, the people you make friends with in high school almost never make it into your adult life. So dont stress much about it. 

With the second part, and your sisters... unfortunately since you're the youngest it's going to be hard to earn respect from them. Try your best to stand up for yourself and let them know how upset it makes you. If you have a decent relationship with them, they should try to understand.  Good luck with everything, I wish you well

Try and talk to your mom about how the girls at school are and why you socialize with guys better, don’t let her control your social life like that and just keep being yourself. As for interacting with your sisters, just ask them to respect your turn when you are speaking and not to talk over you. If they continue then in my opinion it’s not worth trying to talk with them if they just keep talking over you.

I've told my mom about what the girls are like in my grade and school, but she doesn't trust me. Thanks for suggesting what I should do with my sisters tho!

Doesn’t trust you as in she doesn’t believe you?

399,erpwhj,False,,1,Love... its complicated,AdviceForTeens,"So me and this guy met through a friend. Lesta call my friend Maria and let's name him John. Maria and a couple of girlfriend were going out, when a big part of the canceled plans. So Maria and me decided to postpone it, when later she called me telling me that she would be going out with a couple of her friends, and invited me. 

I agreed and off we went. I was introduced to John. MAN DID I FALL FOR HIM. As cliche as it might sound, we clearly made a click. He is just so sweet and attentive and just wow. By the time, he had something going one with this other girl, lesta call her anne, but stuff want working for them and they were breaking it off. 

So we met and it was nice, we chatted for hours like if we had been friends for years. We exchanged numbers and everything was great.  Me being me, I decided to make my move when I thought Anne and him were over, a couple of weeks passed and he hadn't talked about her, so I assumed they were over. 

We CLEARLY flirted back and forth, he started calling me sweet names and became veeery sweet with me, I obviously showed the affection back. And so a couple of days ago, we were talking on the phone when I asked him about Anne. 

Well, little did I know that THEY HAD BEEN DATING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS FROM THEN and he didnt tell me! Like, he knew we had something going on, and like I wouldn't be mad to keep him as a friend. 

I like him so much, that i would gladly accept friendship, I care about his happiness. And since we flirted, we opened up to each other and stuff, it did hurt a little when I got the news. Well, he now knows that I know about their relationship. 

When out of nowhere, he sent me something about being me really hot and stuff, complimenting me and I dont even know now. 

I'm in a weird position at the moment, I dont know how to feel or do. Like I said, I dont mind him as a friend, I just want to be in his life (not force myself into it obviously) but I just want his happiness. 

Maria (our friend) decided to invite me to go out with another guy friend and another girl friend, when out of the boom she is like ""oh, and John is comming"" when I already accepted the invitation. 

I really want to see my friends but my feelings are mixed about him. We will be going out on Sunday, so I've got this week. 

What should i do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erpwhj/love_its_complicated/,2,I mean things won’t be awkward unless you make it awkward.

219,f76904,False,,5,Am I ever gonna be a normal happy teenager?,AdviceForTeens,"I posted here a few days ago and since then things have gotten worse. 

My thoughts have lead me to wanting weed and to run away over the past few days. Nothing unordinary has happened so I don’t understand what is wrong with me. 

My mood just switches so quickly, for example: earlier today my mum and I were watching tv and I lashed out because she started talking over the program. I wasnt even that invested in the program so I don’t understand why?

This night too (it’s currently 5:15am as im writing this) my mentality hasnt been the greatest. I’ve had thoughts about becoming annorexic or bullimic and each thought that has consumed me tonight has lead me to suicide. 

You’d think I’d be happy that I have group therapy sessions to go to over easter, or that I have a 1-2-1 therapy session coming up (Im on a 6 month waiting list for that). You’d think I’d be happy that I’ve come in contact with an old friend. You’d think i’d be happy that I have everything I’ve always wanted such as a puppy, a cat, a computer, a big room. But none of this stuff makes me happy at all and I don’t understand why. Why don’t I feel happy or privileged that these things are happening in my life? I really don’t understand. 

The only reason I think I’m unhappy is because of me, I’m me. Im fat, vile, disgusting. Im horrible to everyone, rude to everyone I meet. I dont listen to people, I dont listen to instructions. I zone out and get clouded with my thoughts then when I zone back in I feel terrible for missing what people say and I zone out again and tell myself “Im so stupid” or “Just f**king listen to them”. But I cant zone back in and its often too late when I do. Its the same with people giving advice. I can’t take it. I try to, I try so hard to but instead go back to old habbits that I cant seem to change. 

I’ve tried getting help from an online friend but he doesn’t seem to understand anymore, not like he used to. He helped me with issues with my ex, he calmed me down when my ex spoke about killing himself, he calmed me down when I thought this other girl was trying to get with my ex and he liked her too. But I lost everything with him because my anxiety spiraled out of control. No one knew how much I cried the five months I was so scared of losing my ex. I cried atleast twice a week. Two of the months I cried so much over him but he never cared. He’d just disappear and make me wonder again. He’d make me think he’d killed himself, or that he hated me. 

When we ended things, he proved how much he hated me. I was high when we officially brokeup but he’d hinted that he wanted that for weeks and I didn’t notice until I was stoned out of my mind and happy for the first time in so long. And its weird because I stayed happy for a few days after. The day we ended things he said he’d “found someone else” and said “she helped him when he was going through things”. And now I look back at that, I wish I was that person, I wish he loved me back and trusted me too. 

The past month I’ve been feeling what I didn’t when we brokeup. I’ve wanted to message him, show him how much I loved him. But was it really love? He didn’t love me back? So was it just an attachment? 

I get attached easily, I trust easily too. Thats something else thats wrong with me. I should know I can’t trust people when they’ve already given me a reason not to, but I just dive into the deepend and trust them all over again, I dont just dip my toe in to see if I can, I keep diving in and drowning all over again. Sometimes its the same people, sometimes its new people. But I let go of the anxiety for a moment then realise I’ve done this wrong again and it’s going to go terrible. 

Thats something I think about alot. I think about this when it starts to get dark, I think about how I cant get myself into college, I think about how much I weigh, I think about how ugly I look, I think about the scars on my arms, my stomach and legs. I think about everything. And then I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep until I pass out. 

Its a loop that is like a neverending tournado that I cant escape and Im stuck in going around and around. I cant sleep, so I can’t get myself to college. I cant get to college, so I cant see friends and people that make me happy. I cant see these people, so I get sad and selfharm. I selfharm and start eating to try and feel bettwr. Then I cant sleep because I ate at the wrong time. 

And I don’t know when its going to end. Maybe it’ll end when my sleep schedule becomes normal again? Maybe it’ll end when I learn to grow up? Maybe it’ll end when Im dead? 

To growup I need to be happy though right? To be dead i’d have to not be scared of killing myself? To fix my schedule.. I dont know. Im lost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f76904/am_i_ever_gonna_be_a_normal_happy_teenager/,3,"It will deffinatly get better when you're older, it's just puberty, cause it sucks. 
Start by doing small things that give you satisfaction, such as helping people or whatever. When you get older and begin to start a life it will be completly differentnas you will see things in a different light 
Also, try to set small goals that give you satisfaction as it will also take your mind off things

You could also try things like exercise, a healthy diet, read more and a better sleeping pattern, as these have been know to release serotonin and just improve ones standard of living. Try to force yourself to not self harm (I would also reccomend seeing a doctor or telling someone about that) and try to keep your diet and sleep at the correct times, you could set alarms through the day to tell you when to eat and when not to. To try and not self harm try to spend the night with someone who's supportive and will help,  and please seek more help, whether it be a professional or simply a teacher or family member. Also, remember that you matter so much.

In my opinion, a supportive friend group is a key factor in helping you be more happy.
It may seem like a lot of work but it will deffinatly help.

Try to force yourselves into situations you don't enjoy, whether it be social interactions or speaking to people, as this will increase your confidence and decrease anxiety in the long run. Try to force yourself to college and please PLEASE speak to somebody about this, there's always people to help you and to get you through a tough time.
Try to stay positive, when something bad happens try to be optimistic about it and remember that people will.not care if you fu** something up, and please remember that you matter, you matter more than you think, there are people in this world who will help you and want to help you.

Hang in there, it will only get better and you're not alone In this situations, and remember, You Matter❤❤

Unfortunately some people do not have happy teenhoods. Some people will never have much happiness in life period. But many people can work towards happiness. Lots of people only started to grow and feel good in their 20s, and only because they came from a toxic environment and worked hard for their happiness.

I don't think you're the problem. It's clear you're trying very hard to be nice to people, but you're experiencing a mental block. Are you diagnosed with anything? You should talk about this mental block you're experiencing in your therapy.

This stuff doesnt work. Ive been trying to do these things since I was 10 and keep breaking down instead. Each time it gets worse and worse. 

But thankyou for trying to give advice.

I don’t have the therapy for another few months due to a waiting list. I havent been diagnosed with anything either.

Also, post this into many other reddit servers aswell to get the most advice possible. There are mental health ones.

Do it for yourself though and not any other person or people in general.

Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder and I know that sounds cliche but it is very true. Someone will look at your nose and see beauty in it while others may see it the way you do and honestly that is okay and overall your own self value is the most important thing. Physical appearance is temporary. Someday we are all gonna look like wrinkly prunes lmao and we are gonna realize that the beautiful people around us aren’t beautiful solely based on their appearance and much more because of their heart, maybe their goofy sense of humor, and also their mind or a million other little things that make them special.

23,f6qk96,False,,5,I am a 15 year old girl and haven't been feeling great since October (details below),AdviceForTeens," Hi. as stated, I an fifteen and in my tenth year of school.

In October my family put our old dog down

In late November my Opa died, last week my family's other old dog was put down.

I used to feel so confident in my relationship with my friends and my academic achievement. Now I feel that my friends no longer need me and that I am not as smart as I used to be.

My Oma died along time ago and with my Opa dying and my old dog dying (gift from my Oma) I feel like I've lost all connection to my extended family, not that there was much to begin with. I am beginning to fake smiles a lot more at school and feel that I have to put on an act for my friends.

to add to this I have been seeing my abusive father around town (he still lives close to my family) and feel that there are certain places I used to love that I can't visit anymore due to fear that he would try to talk to me.

Due to all these things and my own depleting self-esteem I have begun to force myself to throw up. I don't to it to much to be worrying but when someone makes a offhand comment about what I eat (it's not their fault. I'm overreacting) I run to the bathroom and try to make myself throw-up. It doesn't always work and that makes me feel worse.

can someone please tell me how to feel better",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f6qk96/i_am_a_15_year_old_girl_and_havent_been_feeling/,7,"Ok well let’s start with not making yourself throw up, that’s just unhealthy to do all the time. Why is it that you feel you aren’t as smart anymore or aren’t as wanted by your friends? Is there a reason to this? And are you still struggling with dealing with your losses? As for your abusive father all I can say is to avoid the parts of town you think you may find him in.

I relate to this as I’m currently struggling but you’re perfect the way you are (that was awful advice, sorry).

Please don’t force yourself to throw up - it’s not good at all. Maybe try joining a club at school or become active. Possibly speak to your friends about how you feel?? If you ever want someone to talk to, my PM is open.

Are you perhaps Dutch? Opa en oma is Dutch for grandpa and grandma but I am not sure other countries use it aswell. I might know a group that can support you online.

sorry, no. it's just the names my family use

Make her feel special. A lot of us go through this and I feel like all of us need some extra attention when this happens. So just make her feel beautiful, special, and appreciated. I’ve been through this exact thing. This online friend that I had said he was gonna kill himself. He really only wanted attention.

You may not know where she lives but the police can track her phone from the messages

I think they will they should at least refer you to someone who can

Ok, thank you. She's done this to me before where she says she's going to do it and not respond for a week, and then messages me like nothing happened.

I was unsure whether the police would be able to help or not, but I will try and do so. Thank you.

638,erhfk5,False,,2,My crush is touching me even though he has a girlfriend,AdviceForTeens,"Okay so the boy I like has a girlfriend. His girlfriend is in another school, so they only see each other in their free time. The thing is, when I’m at school, he touches and leans against me A LOT. I don’t know if these are signs, or what those are. Some things that he does are:

When we are sitting on the ground or next to each other, he tends to lean his thigh agains mine so they touch. He often puts his hand behind me, so he is closer to me. I move away from him and he follows.

When I walk by him, he sometimes rubs his hand against my thigh. He does it discreetly, but I see it. Also he sometimes just grabs or *gently* slaps my thigh.

We don’t really talk too much anymore, but he has asked me and said that we are friends with benefits to me, and quickly brushes it off my saying “I’m kidding”. Once he asked if I was a virgin (yes) and if I wanted to wait until I was 16 (also yes) and he said to me “I’ll wait for you”. 

It’s not like I get uncomfortable from these things, I mean he is my crush. I just don’t understand if he is doing it on purpose, or if he is doing it without realizing. I want him and his girlfriend to break up, but I also don’t want to break them up, if that makes sense. I just need advice; is there a possibility that he is doing that on purpose?

My tip? Leave them alone if they want. That doesn't mean you can't propose to stay all 3, but if they go alone, leave them be. They maybe are in love and want to be ""intimate"" (not in a sexual way). 

When I ask my friend who has a girlfriend if he wants to hang out with the boys and he has plans he says no. I understand him, so should you.

Try to find another friends, but still keep contact with the couple. If they keep ignoring you or stop hanging with you, try to slowly leave them. It isn't hard to initiate a discussion and trust me you will be thankful for having friends from more backgrounds.

You can't be always with them, because if you keep intervening in their alone time you will become annoying. Try to find a moment when they are separated and hang out with them separately or be the one who comes with the hanging out idea with both of them.

And his parents adore me. They invited me to his family only birthday party and they even invited me to their family summer vacation. They love me and they’re great people! The problem is that I feel like my parents don’t trust me or him. I’m never allowed to go to his house if someone isn’t home and god forbid I go in his room with him with the door closed. It’s just stressful. He’s such a great guy and he would never do anything like rape me or try to convince me to have sex. And I don’t want to have sex either. No thanks. Not at this age (16).

351,f966id,False,,4,toxic friend???,AdviceForTeens,"so i have this friend and i think our friendship is toxic but i’m not 100% sure. Here’s our history: 
we went to elementary school together but we weren’t really friends because she was very quiet. However she was best friends with one of my good friends so we were friendly with eachother. We went to different middle schools and I had a huge group of friends and i was very social. I found out that she was transferring to my middle school for seventh grade and i decided to be nice and show her the ropes of the school and walk her to her classes and introduce her to people and let her eat lunch with my friends and i. I remember telling my friends that she would eventually get comfortable and make her own friends. but that never happened, she followed me around for weeks and slowly overtime because a part of our friend group. She wasn’t really friends with any of the other girl’s though, she was just always with me. we got really close and i really liked her, we were very alike and i was glad that i finally got to know her. Near the end of seventh grade however i realized something. She didn’t have 1 single friend that i hadn’t introduced her to, she never disagreed with me, and i never hung out with anyone without her anymore. Even my friends that didn’t go to our school she would follow me to hang out with them and eventually it just became expected that we came as a pair. Skip 4 years later to sophomore year of high school. My social circle has shrunk immensely and i’ve lost the vast majority of my friends. I have about 5 friends but every one of them is friends with this girl too. We are still very very close friends, and she still follows me everywhere, texts me all the time (a bit obsessively) and inserts herself into any relationship i make. Most people at our school will only hang out with both of us not just one of us because we are always together. One of my friends won’t talk to me anymore because we used to be really close but after this girl convinced our guidance counselor to switch her into all my classes my whole life was consumed by her and i didn’t talk to that friend as much. I don’t get lunch with other people because once i did and she texted me long paragraphs about how she felt like i didn’t want to have lunch with her and like i was excluding her. She didn’t have any friends that she had made on her own until this year. Now she has a few friends that she did make on her own and that i’m not super good friends with and i’m grateful for that but now i’m stuck because i don’t have a life outside of her and when i think about my life before she came to my school compared to my life now i am so isolated. She encourages all of my bad descions and still has never once disagreed with anything i have said. she invited herself to everytbing i do and follows me and it’s like i can’t have a conversation with someone without her barging in or just standing there listening. I am scared that i will eventually not even have shared friends with her and i will have 0 friends except for her. What do i do? How do i make real friendships with people that aren’t a three way friendship including her? how do i become less close with her so my whole life isn’t consumed by her",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f966id/toxic_friend/,2,"Tell her what’s one your mind honestly even if your friendship might be at risk that way , pretending to be okay with it won’t do you any good now and make new friends without her you don’t have to tell her where you are and what you are doing 24/7 , just start making new friends and try to get in touch with your old ones and tell her clearly that you don’t like what’s happening

Oof, I'm sure most people have experienced a clingy friend like that. Clearly in this friendship, she likes you a lot more than you like her. This is going to sound easier said than done, but you can either have 2 options.

Option A) You genuinely tell her how you feel in a calm, civilised and NICE way. You want to keep being friends with her, just not always around her, you don't want to lose her. Unless you genuinely don't want to have anything to do with her anymore -that's a different approach.

Don't talk to her about your feelings on text. That's a NO. Communicating through text is the worst way to do so, there will be misunderstandings definitely and most likely won't resolve anything. Perhaps she's the type of person who's too awkward and uncomfortable to talk about her feelings to your face? But you're just going to have to try.

Sit her down, someplace private, keep cool. Speak in a calm voice (don't raise your voice AT ALL- this will just instigate a fight) and explain how you feel. Just say, something along these points. 

-Your still my friend and I love you to death. But, I just want to branch out sometimes and hang out with my own friends but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate or neglect our friendship.

- I promise I am trying not to exclude you, it's at times, I want to get to know other people better too, and as a three it might not feel like that.

You'll figure it out.




Option B) You can play the long game and just distance yourself. I don't mean instantly cold turkey, and completely blank her. 

Create a strict schedule for yourself, slowly and slowly drift yourself apart. But if you don't want to end on bad terms, if you see her in the halls, smile and wave. Or occasionally text her here and there.

But start off, by limiting the amount of texts between you. If you text everyday, start texting her around 5x a week and slowly and slowly stop. Or only a couple of exchanges of texts here and there. 

You know what I mean.

Anyway..I hope this might have helped. Give us an update!

thank you! I tried option 2 for awhile but eventually gave up on distancing myself because it was so hard when she would just follow me everywhere and text me 24/7 :(

Don't reply to her messages all the time. When you talk to her, make it seem like you are doing her a favour for not hanging around with you all the time. ""I think it would be really good for you to hang around with other people ________ seems nice. Doesn't he/she?""",2020-02-25 14:43:42
616,f1syr6,False,,0,He's fucking with my head and it sucks. Pls help,AdviceForTeens,"F(17yo)
So...context. This starts with a crush on an exchange guy, he also liked me at the start of the school year but I wasn't aware of it. 
I don't know how to process feelings, I just don't realize I like someone until it's too late, so ofc even though I smiled every time I saw him and all  that cheesy shit I just wasn't aware.
Enter other guy, this one was making his move, he was shooting his shot with me and wasn't afraid to be obvious so I went with it cause, ""yeah, why not? it's easy ik he likes me and I'm sort of attracted to him, yh sure let's do it. "" BAD IDEA ( turns out he's an asshole I ended it quick). This made the 1stguy who I actually wanted, give up on me and start talking to some girl, a week or so later they're dating... yay. 

Fast foward 2months later, 1st guy and me are at a party, his girlfriend isn't there we're a little tipsy and he pulls me away from the rest and tells me he had a big crush on me at the start of the school year. WHY WOULD U TELL ME THAT?!?! WHAT'S THE POINT?!? THAT'S JUST SELFISH. But anyway, that night we talked about the whole thing until we fell asleep... in each others arms, we basically cuddled and then something happened but, we didn't kiss or make out we just kind of touched eachother, he was incredibly cute about it he was asking me if I was okay or comfortable etc. After that we didn't even mention it, well just casually said  we remembered everything between 3am and 7am which is when all that happened. 

A month or so later there's another party, and again we cuddled and we danced and he pulled me in by the waist etc. Next day all he does is talk about his ""ex-girlfriend"" (they broke up but they still talk and they're pretty much still together) TO ME AND IN FRONT OF ME.

When she's there he completely ignores me, but ofc at a party without anyone that knows her it's all good WTF. IM SO CONFUSED AND I HATE SEEING THEM TOGETHER. 

My questions, 
Am I being played?
Should I completely stop talking to him?
What tf is going on?

Use an online translator to translate what you would like to ask him. Ask him things like ""how would you like to be involved in the project? There are this, this and role, what would you like to do?""

Tbh I am tired of her always complaining to me about how her life sucks and how she wants to die and how She wants help. Then the breaking point for me,Ellie has this guy she likes,let’s call him....Ben,so Ben is kinda already knew but wasn’t sure if Ellie actually liked him, I heard a conversation taht ben had with my classmates and they were trying it get him to spit out who he liked, I joined in and they said this girls name and he said “no and it’s not Ellie either”,Ellie is one of these types who get sad and angry at the boy they like when they talk with other girls,she said to me once how she hated him for talking to other girls and not her I replied with “well since he kinda already knows that you like him,it’s probably awkward for him.” She didn’t listen. So she saw me talking with them and asked me what we Were talking about,I told her everything,she started crying and said she couldn’t do anything anymore,I then suggested the counselor again,another no. After school we went to our dance club and after that,I quote her “I just want to scream my lungs out and until my throat starts bleeding and kill myself” I said not to do that,and told her if the consequences of killing herself. I actually told her to confirm everything with ben awhile ago but she declined, and I told her before if she didn’t do it this type of situation will happen,and told her to just either confess and clear things up or keep it in and either forget about him and try to move on or be in this situation. Now after I told her about the consequences of her dying,She again said she didn’t care and thinks that we will be fine after a few months. I had enough at that point. Ellie is a sweet Girl and I want to be her friend but I can’t take this anymore, she complains to me about dying and her depression but she declines my help and continues complaining to me,so I simply said “well it’s either you forget about him or do whatever the hell you are doing now,if you continue to whine to me all the time and keep refusing my help, you might as well suffer until some doctor comes and save you which isn’t anytime soon,move on from him,he’s just one guy you met in your 15 years of life,you have so many more chances in life later on.

215,f8ohlp,False,,2,Why am I so conflicted?,AdviceForTeens,"Um, I'm not very good at starting posts, so I'll just start talking about my problem.

So, I'm new to being a teen (turned 13 a while ago) but I can tell I already want to be different. So many of the people at my school are the same. You have the nice people, the 6th graders, the sporty ones, and the ones that don't really fit anywhere else, but, from the looks of things, I'm the only one who is excessively concerned about my future. For the past five years, I've been trying to get noticed, prepare for that big day when I finish the project, but I've gotten almost nowhere. I'm not even half done with it, and I want to do it, but I can't stop procrastinating! Heck, managing to revise what I had made me happier than I had been for the last three months.

Now, for the conflicts, I'll just list them out:

•I don't want to fall in love or anything, but I keep falling for fictional characters

•I constantly daydream and lie about working on things in my head, but I spend weeks (even months) perfecting every detail, even when I daydream about real-life situations

•I like working, but all I do is procrastinate

•I stay up all night so I can work, but I continue to procrastinate, because I don't remember my dreams anymore, and I find sleep pointless, but I like the sleeping experience

•As soon as I try working on one thing, I immediately begin to work on a new project

So, uh, I'm causing myself a lot of stress for almost no reason whatsoever, and I can't seem to stop.

Anybody have advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8ohlp/why_am_i_so_conflicted/,3,"i rlly suggest you talk to a therapist, this sounds like a lot of overthinking but i’m not rlly sure tbh. i overthink excessively, i won’t lie. i just think if you talk to a therapist maybe she/he can point you in the right way for something like that. i’m sorry i wasn’t any help!

Another person suggested a therapist. While that could be useful, I don't think it's necessary. You have all the tools needed to solve these things on your own.

For starters it's good that you're concerned about your future. But at 13 there isn't much to think about or do about it. At 15/16 some big decisions may come, but for now all you have to do is focus on doing your best in school and pass exams.

Only you can stop your procrastinating. Try breaking up your project into small chunks and set deadlines. While doing any work, you can spend for example 30-50 minutes working and then take a 10 minute break. I literally take little breaks every 15-30 minutes because my attention span is so bad. But I still managed to get things done and it has worked for years.

Falling for fictional characters aside, it sounds like you're filling your procrastination with fantasising about fiction. You need to get your procrastination under control. Maybe a way to deal with your fantasies can be actually getting them out in the form of a book or fanfiction.",2020-02-24 16:49:37

If your friend doesn’t see a problem and wants to stay with him then I’m afraid there’s not much you can do as reporting him would probably get your friend mad at you. As for your safety if you are a few states away I wouldn’t be concerned with him going after you unless he’s just that crazy.

He is that crazy also religious wise as well cause we both believe in the same thing and he will probably wish death upon me and my friend told me that the people he wish death upon have died and like I stated I live in the United States of America and here since the dude is between 20-26 and him dating my friend who’s 16 is illegal and if he gets caught will be classify as a predator and I am afraid for my friends safety cause she has told me a few times like I say less than 5 times I say that she is afraid for her safety

They say they really love me and don’t want anything to happen to me one day, but the next they just treat me like I’m being a bother. I’m scared to make a mistake around them because if I do they’ll snap and start yelling at me. I remember the last time I made a huge mistake they told me to get out of their house and live on the streets... They said that I’m nothing without their support... I’m scared to talk to them, to ask them for anything... I feel like I’m just being so selfish. It’s not like they’ve ever hit me or anything, and I’m lucky to not be in that kind of situation, but I still don’t know if I can handle being treated like a monster... I know, it’s selfish and I’m being ungrateful but I just wanted to let this out... 

They always see me on my computer ( usually doing productive things like art, homework,etc. but they don’t know that...) and begin yelling at me for it and saying I’m a lazy, spoiled brat. they’re not wrong I suppose... but I still get hurt by their words... I know I shouldn’t, and I should just stay quiet and be doing things like study and homework, but I’ve already finished those things... so when I go onto my computer after finishing, they just yell at me and say I’m addicted... they say I’m gonna to get brain damage and I’m gonna end up stupid.

My older sister... She gets along so well with them... They love her so much and I’m so glad that they do! I really am! I love my sister as well, and she’s the most amazing person I know. I don’t want to tell her how I feel about how they treat me, she’s already so stressed from high school and I can’t push her to do more...  My parents always yell at me for small things like dropping small bits of food and such. And I completely understand this (I should never waste food) but sometimes I can’t take their constant yelling... and I end up crying. I try to cover my tears, but when they see me cry they just get madder and say that I’m so manipulative for trying to make others feel bad... they’re probably right, I don’t even want to let them know how I feel, because if I do they’ll say I’m being ungrateful and spoiled.

Even if I did tel, them, it wouldn’t matter to them I suppose... I once broke into tears and began crying when they said I was retarded and that I’m horrible. ( I was fairly young at the time, about 9 I suppose ) At the time I was young and immature and I thought it was okay to cry... I locked myself into a closet and started crying loudly... when they came up, they told me to be quiet. I cracked a little, and began pouring out all my thoughts... I told them I was a disappointment, a failure, other depressing things I really don’t want to talk about... What they told me next was something I’ll never forget, 
“Why are you like this? Only god can help you, you sick freak...”
I guess this was when I learned to not cry or show my feelings in front of them... I suppose they were right though... I’m a freak... I’m ungrateful, spoiled, and insane... I feel so bad... why did they have to end up with me? Why did they end up with a freak? I just... don’t know how much more I’ll be able to take... I feel like I’m going to break someday... I’m scared! I’m scared of the day when I finally can’t take it and break apart...

53,ezzlzd,False,,5,Is my dad abusive or am I over reacting?,AdviceForTeens,"So I'm a f14 living with my dad and brother.

About a year ago my mother split leaving me and my brother with my dad and she moved in with her friend. So at first it was sort of ok just really a shock and I think I may have been in a bit of denial. before my mother left she worked in some mines and was never really here (gone two weeks back 1) two of her days were spent driving and 2 were spent sleeping because its a physically tolling job. When she was home and awake she would spend all day sitting in her chair eating and spending al her time on her phone. She would often criticize how messy our house was and would argue with me constantly. I was dealing with a lot of secret mental health issues and didn't really socialise very well but she certainly didn't even try. This was how it was for a good few years. Then my mother had a cancer scare and sort of went through a midlife crisis. I knew things weren't going well in my parents marriage for quite a while and my mum has some really bad depression. My mum had a really bad time at work because people are bitches so he decided to do something nice for her ( flowers on the bed sort of stuff... it was also her birthday.) So she comes home and tells us shed thought about committing suicide and she needs extra help to get better. I was really worried and sort of took it easy on my hormonal teenage bullshit then the next day I got home from school to find my dad already home and distressed so I ran home and found nothing but a note saying 'sorry I ant anymore' on the table from my mum. I honestly thought shed committed suicide but I found shed taken clothes and calmed down. now things got worse between us, for the first few months she didn't even bother to call or anything and neither did any of her family (my dads side did). when she finally did it was because shed gotten a new boyfriend she wanted us to meet (they started dating 3 weeks after it all happened) I said no, hell no. Then another month past and she hadn't called bcuz my dad and her were sorting out bills and shit. IT was sort of ok for a while, shed take us out shopping or to swim and it was all fun but then she started criticizing my clothing and friends. she actually told me I scrape at the bottom of the barrel for friends bcuz im a loser (in nicer words) and I snapped and told her my friends were scraping for me and that I am a loser with a fucked up family. Then shed managed to clear out all her shit from our house and taken a lot of ours. now this whole time my dads been trying to push me to have a relationship with her and trying to 'stay neutral' while also bad mouthing her. Things got worse and worse until the point I was really depressed and suicidal thinking about or trying to commit suicide. She'd take things that belonged to me for her boyfriends kid without really asking me but I was too anxious to really put up a fight. I eventually found out she was telling people our house was disguisting and that my dad was mentally abusive to her. My dad started drinking again (he was a bit of an alcoholc when I was younger and e isn't particularly nice0 eventhough he had screwed his liver or kidney bcuz of It. He got really mean bcuz of it and started screaming at me and my brother all the time, even throwing a chair at the door and shattering it bcuz I started arguing with my brother. He threatened to hit my brother and me all the time saying we shouldn't start shit until were big enough to fight him, he never actually hit us. Hed thrown me out of the hous for a couple minutes but after each fight hed come back and say he hates fighting with us and that hes sorry but it all felt kind of manipulative. at this point id basically stopped talking to my mum all out but she offered to get an apartment so I could go live with her wich I said no but we started talking again and then we stopped again an dtsarted again and stopped again. anytime I said no to an activity or we got in an argument she wuldnt talk to me for a fww weeks as a sort of punishment. Then Christmas came around and she hadn't talked to me in months and we got into it again bcuz she didnnt talk to me for so long and I asked her how my dad wa so abusive and why she would leave us with him if he was really so bad and she refused to tell me bcuz I was too young but im almost 15. I told her not to talk to me and she hasn't tried to talk with me but now im kind of regretting it. I feel like my dad might be the one manipulating me bcuz ive said things about her that ive heard my dad say and I am rally confused. I want to talk to her but I don't want my dad to find out. What should I do and am I being manipulated? I need to know if telling her to not speak with me was a good idea and should I speak with her again? I'm thinking about taking her up on the apartment offer.

Im not. i live in a rural town an hour away from the nearest place i could find a therapist and talking to a therapist would mean asking my dad to take me. we also don't have the money for therapy.

100,eveqpb,False,,1,How do I forget a crush,AdviceForTeens,"I grew up going to a v small catholic school w about 25 kids in each grade (nursery-8th). Since sixth grade, I kinda like this one kid and he kinda liked me but I was always quiet so nothing ever rlly happened. We went to the same high school and we both found a friend group and basically grew up, but when we had classes tg we would always sit and laugh and joke and j generally have a good time. Last year he would always snap me, dm me, try to start convos, uk. Then we talked a little over the summer but again, I’m pretty quiet, so not all the time. I always knew I liked him deep down but was always afraid to say it and I was pretty sure he liked me too, bc that’s what all my friends said. When this year started, we still talked for a little, but as the months went on, he found a new friend group full of toxic people and girls who are all over him. We barely talk anymore and even tho I sometimes see him trying to talk to me in the hallway, he’s just a completely different person-the attention has gotten to his head and he usually acts like a total asshole now. At the beginning of the year, I was considering telling him I liked him bc, hey we’re about to graduate after going to school tg since nursery so what do I have to lose? But now I wanna stop having feelings for him bc he’s just not the same.

Ask the guy out while you have the chance

Now I have to be completely honest. Unless this guy gets a lot of girls and goes into relationships easily he will probably say yes if you ask him out yourself. If you are ugly af or really annoying he probably won’t say yes but if you are only annoying there is still a chance he’ll say yes. I doubt you are ugly and annoying, being clingy is ok, the only people who will be bothered are his friends.

Now I must warn you this is how relationships are around where I live. I know many other places where guys are different. Some places are full of people just sleeping around, some places relationships are looked for.",2018-11-12 02:38:38

He was the first boy I ever kissed and seriously liked. We started dating like a week after we first kissed and we’ve been together since and that was 2 years ago. I used to be so excited to see texts from him and to meet up with him but it feels like all that magic has been fading recently. We used to never run out of things to talk about but lately I feel like I’ve been having much less fun around him and I feel like I don’t have anything interesting to say. It just doesn’t feel right anymore. However, he is such a nice guy and I don’t want to lose him. He has no idea I feel this way and is constantly telling me how perfect for him I am and how much he loves me but it just doesn’t feel true when I say I love you back. He is so good to me and I’m so so lucky to have him but I feel like it’s not fair to stay with him when I’m not invested in this relationship anymore. It scares me how he’s so committed too. He’s openly told me that he can see a real future with me and that without me his life would be meaningless and he would have no one. I told him at the time this was crazy and he is valued by so many people, but I know that breaking up with him would shatter him. Like really break him. He’s not super close to many other people but we’re sort of in the same friend group so it’ll be awkward for us to break up. To be honest i feel stuck. If I don’t break up with him then I won’t be happy and I’ll just think about this all the time, but if I do then he will take it really badly and I’m so afraid of being lonely. I’ve known him for about 3 years altogether and I feel as though I’m too used to having him/I’m reliant on him. I’m terrified of being lonely and regretting it if I break up with him. Being with him is all I’ve known for so long and I think losing him would feel like such a hole in my life. I value having him around and he’s so supportive when I’m down.

Sometimes I can’t fall asleep until 4am but I’d have to get up around 6:00 am so I wouldn’t get much sleep. I found that it’s harder for me to get up when I’ve gotten more sleep. So when I get less I’m normally in a better mood but as the day goes on I start getting moody. So sleeping more in the long run is better than sleeping less. Sleep is important for growth especially when you’re 13 and still growing. I suggest talking to a doctor. I have bad insurance and was out with a really terrible children’s doctor that told me to “just put my down.” Play instrumental music if you want to fall asleep faster, and focus on it. I find that it helps.

Its normal for your age, but its not healthy for you

Everyone having to move on and start living their own lives. Everything just seems to be falling apart and changing. I’m probably very childish for wanting to keep this sense of familiarity but these people made me feel loved and appreciated and I have this strong sense of love for these people as well.

And it’s not childish to want to stay in a familiar place with the people you love and feel safe around! However, try to look at the bright side of things as well. After high school is a whole new chapter with new people that will become your best friends. It’s true everything is changing and it’s hard, but think about all the new things you will get to try in the future. Think about how you will tell your kids these high school memories and be proud of them. Good luck!

Middle school isn’t important at all. It literally does nothing. It barely prepares you for highschool. But anyways, it’s just drama that will be forgotten in no time. I think you should try to talk to her(the weeb) and try to explain things. Also she shouldn’t be in a relationship with him. He sounds super toxic. Everyone in middle school always follows the popular people. So once you explain yourself things will get figured out. Ignore the people that don’t believe you, they’re just ignorant for no reason and they won’t get anywhere in life. If nothing works out in the end I suggest just working on yourself. Making yourself more mature. And I promise highschool gets better once you find your friends.

Like DaddiestGracie said talk to the “weeb” and find a way for it to be forgotten. But if worst comes down to worst you will probably get in a fight(physical). and that is why you should be prepared for an altercation, because from what I understand he sounds the type to start a fight.  But by any means try to diffusing and clear things up. If he is unwilling you might have to get help from an adult, which right now it sounds like that is the best course for action. 
So in short I’m saying try to diffuse the situation, if that don’t work get an adult, (by adult I mean someone who will walk into the school or wherever and raise hell for you). Now I’m no expert but this all the advice I can give hope I am a bit of help.

Okay so, there’s about 7 people in our friend group. 6 girls and 1 boy. Though he doesn’t sit with us at lunch. Now I’m dating one of the girls in our group. I am also a female. Let’s name her Sarah. Me and Sarah have been dating since Saturday. I don’t really know if I like her or not I’m still figuring that out. Our relationship was a heat of the moment thing. I thought I did but I don’t know. I’m terrible I know. 

Anyways, I told the group about this on Monday. Sarah wasn’t at school. Now I had just figured out that me friend was pan (I’m bi btw..). This was a surprise for me. My impression on the group was privileged, white, straight, Christian girls. I was shocked. 

So, I started to ask her who she liked. She wouldn’t tell me at first and had me ask questions and stuff. So I did. And all of them lead to it being me. So I asked her. On paper. And turns out she does. 

Now I don’t really know what to do. I feel like it’s gonna be awkward. And I kinda like her which I told her so I feel like it’s gonna be weird. Plus me her and Sarah were planning to go to a play and the mall together on Saturday. Help.

It would be so much worse if it goes on like this, the sooner the better. She'll be ok, maybe it'll take few days but she'll be ok

I did. She seemed pretty upset but when me and another friend were talking she said she seemed mad.

You are probably feeling like it's your fault, maybe not but if you feel like this, if you can't like her it's not your fault, you did the right thing, I'm so proud of you sis

158,ethd1w,False,,6,(M14) I think I might be transgender.,AdviceForTeens,"(This is copied from my other posts about this since I don't know a better way to phrase it.)

I am a 14 year old boy. I feel like I could *possibly* be transgender, and have some questions. 

1: is it normal for teenagers to feel like they might identify as the other gender?

A few years ago, a friend was using the opposite pronouns and using a name of the opposite gender (not telling too much so people I know don't realize it's me) .  (also, people were being assholes to people who didn't use the pronouns/name they wanted, and I kept forgetting, so I almost lost a friend because of people being assholes, but back to the main point. Sorry I'm not staying focused) they eventually stopped and said they *thought* they were transgender but aren't. Could that be the same for me?

2. How do I know if I'm transgender?

3. If anyone reading this is transgender, how did you realize that you were?

Hopefully this post makes sense",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ethd1w/m14_i_think_i_might_be_transgender/,4,"Well I am trans and the thing is I never really went by that term until a couple of years ago( I haven’t told anyone except a few people, but I’ve accepted myself.) So some things I’ve kinda struggled with is Dysphoria, if you don’t know what that is, it is where you compare yourself to the opposite gender you were assigned. You also want to have that genders body. Also if your confused don’t worry, some of my friends thought that they were trans but they were just curious and confused (god I hate this sentence so much). But don’t immediately think that, and don’t let anyone influence you and say your just confused, just try stuff from the opposite genders side and see if it makes you happy. Hopefully this helps you.

Being transgender isn’t a choice. I’m not trans so I can’t speak for them and how they feel or how they knew they weren’t their biological gender. But anyways it’s completely normal to question your gender or sexuality. Society is very cruel. But the most important thing in the whole world, is you. Just you. And the most important thing in the world to me, is me. Please don’t stress over this. You have your whole life to figure things out. You don’t need to figure it all out in one day. Just take your time. If you really feel like you’re not the right gender then I’d research a bit or talk to a trans person and ask how they knew they were trans.

What things would u suggest trying from the opposite genders side?

Thanks

Thanks

You can try on the clothes from the other genders side. Another thing you can do is go to Starbucks and order a drink with a name from the opposite gender and see how it makes you feel. Also just think about yourself and wonder if there were other signs the you might be trans,(like comparing yourself to the other gender or wanting to be the other gender.) actually here is a website I found that might help you, I thought it was okay so I recommend you to research a bit more.

Well, me being a previous junior last school year myself having studied for the June SAT, I would think she has general interest in you. Which is enough to be able to determine whether or not she would really like to have more with you :) 

Contact her, now that it is summer, and hang out with her! She has no reason to deny you (unless she is taking summer classes/camps/trips) and if she does genuinely like you, it should be evident. (Otherwise, you can ask me for help, a fellow female creature who can interpret well the ambiguous meaning of actions done by other female human creatures.) 

So contact her, hang out with her, and develop the friendship from there :) If she doesn't hang out with you, and gives you constant reasons as to why she can't, she probably doesn't want much more than a friendship with you.

I am just barely on the spectrum.
Backstory: I’ve written about my mother before. She’s always so calm and fun, but the moment something small goes wrong she’s in a mood. I don’t know if I’m too close to see it or something, but some people have told me she’s gone way too far and not the best parent. 

I’m now in a Brain Balance program, started two weeks ago to help me. I have focus and listening problems, and can never actually think about the choices I make. I’ve gotten better, but this is a three month program that’s barely started. The gist of it is at home I have a set of exercises to do every day, and I do them even though it makes no sense to me. 

Here’s what led up to this problem- last night, in one of my not-thought out responses, I decided I didn’t want to do two out of seven chores. So I just didn’t. And who tells their parent “hey I don’t wanna do this so I’m just gonna walk away” no, everyone covers their tracks. Apparently because I didn’t fold sheets and do the dishes, mother was tipped over the edge.

She woke me up roughly this morning, and yelled at me that I’m doing everything right in front of her for now on, including moving my working station to right next to hers (she works from home and I’m homeschooled now). I could never work well while others were watching me in school, and now she wants to glare at my computer screen all day and judge each step I take to complete my work.

I can’t post pictures on mobile as far as I can see, but these texts happened this morning.

Me: I don’t mean to be rude, but I earned the ability to work in my room and chose to save it. Why am I being forced to work right next to you, just because I decided I didn’t want to do some chores? You know I’m bad at making decisions and thinking things through, that’s why I’m in a class. I’m trying to fix things but 6 days of brain balance won’t fix everything.

Her: We can discuss this in person.

Me: I’d rather do it over text, you know how bad I am at communicating my thoughts in person...

Her: Improving your in-person communicating skills is part of the goal.



I don’t post often to reddit at all, but I really need help here. What should I do?

Edit: we had a “talk”. She had her voice raised the whole time about how I had 5 ———— days to do work last week (It’s the same every week, why is last week special?) and how the chores just broke the camel’s back. Every time I asked for one day to make things up or actually spoke up (being in the spectrum, I have a really hard time saying what I want to), she would full on yell at me. She ended with “go cry into a pillow or whatever but this is how it’s gonna work. It’s called tough love... nevermind, not going to go there, it’s just offensive and will make you ugly cry more.”

The other day I was doing my homework. Mind you I always have a lot of homework due to the fact that I’m in high school and take many advanced classes. Anyways across the hall to my room is my brothers room. He is 14 and games. He was non stop talking very loudly to his friends on the mic and periodically yelling. I don’t have a door and neither does he so, I could here everything clear. I had asked him nicely to stop 2 or three times. He ignored I even said anything. Then I yelled for him to be quiet. My mother heard me yell and starting yelling at me to stop from downstairs to stop and that I was breeching her peace and to be quiet. I explained I was trying to do my homework and my brother wasn’t being quiet at all. She said he can play the Xbox whenever he wants and told me not to do my homework the last minute. She was aggressively telling me this. I was not doing my homework last min. I was doing it at the end of break because I wanted to enjoy my Christmas break. Doing it the last two days of my break gave me enough time to do my homework therefore it was not last minute. I said that is crazy and unfair. She then came upstairs and continued to yell at me saying she would call the cops on me. I said the cops would call her stupid for calling about me yelling at my brother to stop yelling. She said “NO YOUR BREECHING MY PEACE THATS A FELONY” I said you insane let me do my work leave me alone. She continued to yell saying he can play when he wants. She was mad at me for doing my homework while he was playing. I said he can play but I want him to be quiet. She continued to say he can play whenever. She said I’ve had 2 weeks to do my homework. I said he’s had 2 weeks to play the game. She replied yelling “NO no your doing it last minute he can play whenever he wants this is your fault.

I have young siblings as well when they are wasting time they don't go trouble but when we grow older it's like they  don't care about our opinion because they think they are in control of our lives which they are but what I am trying to say is try to put up with it until she doesn't a crap anymore.

641,eqy6zu,False,,2,I think my friend is being abused,AdviceForTeens,"Okay I’ll try to not reveal too much info.  So I have a good friend, she comes from a a strict religious family. Her parents are not her real parents keep in mind.  

The children there have a  certain age and requirement to have a phone which is fine. It’s 16+ and you have to have a job to pay for phone bills. That’s fine by my standards. 

However, my friend had turned that age and she has a job at a local store. So she does have the funds to pay their phone bill and they have do WiFi at home. She was finally given her phone and we were able to text easily.  

Texting is easier than having to physically walk over to the place (which is a mile away) and see if she’s home.  

Age had their phone for a while until it was taken away for no reason. They didn’t misbehave or anything (this is isnt the first time something like that this happened I’ll explain further). They had came over to my house, their sibling comes with her every time they come over.  Which is strange because there’s no one around their age to play with any of my siblings.  It’s really weird.  My two younger brothers are two young to play with the sibling while my two older siblings are older.  

I had asked about her phone and they said it was taken away for no reason. I asked if she had misbehaved possibly and she said no.  She said her parents decided to take away her phone despite meeting their requirements of the ability to have a phone.  

Then I asked what if there’s like an emergency and you need a phone (they drives alone to work late at night around 10 in a rural ghetto sorta neighborhood.) she had stated that her parents told her if it happened she should knock on every door to get help which is totally unsafe for a 16 year old girl to go to strangers houses let alone at around 10 PM.  However the houses are like at least a mile apart in this area.   

She then told me another story where her headlights had once gone out.  She didn’t have a flashlight or a phone for that matter, she had to drive on the pitch black.  

Another case where I suspect abuse is once I was over at her house, one of their kids (who has a problem) had wet their pants.  They began to scream at them for wetting his pants and told him to wash up. However I read that like screaming at young children for wetting their pants is bad. However this kid is slightly older. 

Another was I invited her to see a Disney movie. Her parents agreed to let her go the day before.  She was excited since she had wanted to see the movie. 
Next day we go to pick her up and she has tears in her eyes saying she couldn’t go at all. Later a few days ago I went to her house and asked about the movie.  She stated she didn’t get in trouble and her parents decided to not let her see the movie. 


So basically having a phone is good for safety. What if she got into a car crash? She couldn’t call for help. Even a. Flip up phone could be used but she doesn’t have that. I wouldn’t want my future 16 year old daughter walk at night all alone or drive at night alone with creepy people who are out there in the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eqy6zu/i_think_my_friend_is_being_abused/,1,"I know that this is hard to say. So well done for coming foreword.
Honestly, if you think that there is abuse going on you need to call the police. If your friend is ima situation where you don’t think she is safe then you need to call the police or local authorities.

It’s hard to see these things happen, and I know that you want to help, but the only thing you can really do is get authorities involved. I have a friend, and her uncle has a problem with self harm. His child was being raised in a very poor environment so cps got involved. That’s the best you can do. Tell authorities. Report it and let them know what’s going on.

But if you do, make sure your friend is ok with it. Don’t do anything she wouldn’t want you to. 

If you need advice message me and I can help you more.

Someone who steals people’s possessions off of their person. So if you pulled someone’s wallet out of their pocket and took it then you would be a “pickpocket”.

you should most definitely be fine. i’m also in a long distance relationship and honestly phone sex isn’t a huge problem unless you/her were 18 and the other being 13-14. plus you’re both close in age so it would be ignored. same thing happened with me & my bf. i suggest if you’re trying to stay quiet and not get caught (family) to maybe do video chats. it’s quick simple and quiet.

we are also in a very small house so that’s kind of hard, and my gf doesn’t want to ruin our relationship either and she does want to wait for it because of it

is kind of hard to when we were quiet when we did it the first and second time but still got caught

can’t really do that since she’s 6 hours away

She said she understood and we acted like nothing happened. We are best friends so I told her that I can’t just act like I don’t like her for long. So yesterday she told me that she had mixed feelings over the school year and that she likes me. I got happy so I told me friend about it. In the last class of the day I had asked her out, she rejected me because she said that she doesn’t think she’s ready for another relationship and her past ones stressed her out. Of course I didn’t feel right so I had my friend say that he was the one that typed that when I was in the restroom, he told her that he was just playing and she got pissed. I didn’t feel right with him technically asking her out so I did it again. I asked her out again and she said “can we talk in person”, I agreed and at the end of school I walked with her and asked her what she wanted to talk about. I didn’t tell her about the previous situation . This time she said something about how we couldn’t date because of her parents. I did stuff that her parents didn’t like, which where cussing in text, and saying the n word in text. I tried to say that I could change and stop doing that stuff but other friends kept intervening.

And I'm scared of having no one next year",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f7ogpd/second_guessing_my_friendships/,3,"Sometimes, friends stay only a while in our lives so it's normal among teenagers. Even adults go through that! As for your situation, give it a try on making new friends this year and I'm sure you'll find someone who will accept you just the way you are. 

What I learned from life is that we shouldn't rely on people that much, because one day they just get bored of you. It's not our fault, but theirs.  Because we think we can feel better just by putting our problems on others. We need first to learn how to love ourselves and then make relationships, whether it's a romantic relationship, or just a simple friendship

I know I'm not the best person to give friendship advice, I've been quite isolated my whole life. But friends naturally grow apart as they grow themselves, and it's not really anybody's fault. Many friends bonded when they were kids or tweens, at that age you bond over mutual kindness and what shows and music you like. As you grow older you start to value deeper things like attitude towards life, how people treat others, how mature they are, moral and political affiliations. 

So it's only natural that you grow apart from your friends. Even one year can make a lot of difference and send you down two completely different paths. Sometimes people become friends because there are limited options, you're in one school for years on end, you live in a small town. And frequently people settle, and once they get out into the big world they leave their old friends in search of new ones who they can relate to more.

Don’t be. I’m in HS and I am in your situation right now. It’s not improving buddy. So yk what just completely vibe your senior year and when u get out make new friends

Damn wow they just get bored of you? Even tho u didn’t do a single thing?

But is it like totally normal to be the odd one out in your whole grade? I'm always alone now and it sucks

Yeah that's normal.",2020-02-22 13:53:00
596,f4guxv,False,,2,Long story but 15 and need advice?,AdviceForTeens,"Pretty much theres one guy who at least to me seems amazing. He is really funny, nice, has the same music taste as me, makes amazing music, plays instruments (including saxophone like ahh i love sax so much its so preeetty), apparently has a really great family, has some of the same friends as me, is v cute oops, gave me butterflies for the first time (i thought that was a made up thing wtf), and more. So after posting on my spam account that I didnt want to like him anymore because im too awkward, one of mine and his friends said that i should do something because he wont be in my school next year. SO  I did probably the most brave thing ive ever done (im not brave if you couldnt tell ahha) and went up to him in person in front of all of his friends and spoke to him i was so nervous lmao; the full palms sweaty moms spaghetti. I then spoke to him after and he was so nice to me and ah. Its just that we havent spoken since and its too awkward to talk in person (he literally said to me ""sorry if it was awkward"" so, well...). So if you couldnt tell by now im 1.a naturally nervous person 2.someone whos never been in a relationship or anything like that. I dont know what to do now. We dont sit next to each other in class, and ive been told i give off a very shy vibe but then when you get to know me im surprisingly talkative (just dunno how to get to the point where he knows that because he makes me 10x more nervous than I already would be). Its weird because I always think to myself that nothing could ever happen between us but then there will be times where ill see him looking at me and that one time he spoke to me he was giving me loads of compliments (things that friends do too so i should stfu ahah) but like honestly id be just as happy just being his friend he seems like a great friend. Do you have any advice on how to actually talk to him properly in person and not just every once in a while over dms?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f4guxv/long_story_but_15_and_need_advice/,1,"You should probably start by trying to be his friend- geniunely try. A little flirting is okay, but try not to get so absorbed in the idea of a potential relationship that you can't treat him normally. Remember, at the end of the day, he's just a person- don't let the pressure get to you.

Second- Go out of your way to talk to him! If you share a lunch period, that's a great way to get to know someone. Otherwise, try to meet up with him before school. 

Ask him to hang out outside of school- this can be nerve-wracking, but it's not actually such a big deal. Just say, ""hey, are you free after school today/ tomorrow/ Friday?"" And if the answer is yes, invite him to go with you somewhere- to the park, to a fast food place, an ice cream store, a GoodWill, anything within walking distance that sounds fun. 

Try to be yourself, but also go out of your way to ask questions about him, and do your best to keep a conversation going.

And DEFINITELY text him often! Don't spam the guy, but send him messages regularly. Memes and ""what's up"" are good icebreakers, but try to look for things that could start a conversation. Maybe it's a piece of art you saw, maybe it's a video game you started playing, maybe something wierd and funny happened to you, maybe you learned a fun fact about a crazy waterfall or something. 

Good luck :)

Knowing those things, we move onto the actual problem
I like this boy, he's not the best at social skills and he mainly conveys his conversations with memes and jokes. But when he is genuinely seriously he can have a pretty serious conversation, and he is so smart on so many things. And I want to talk to him, I want to ask him so many questions but I get such a block. And I feel like it's because of his mental illness, no its not that I'm unable to look past it or something before someone says it lol. I love and care about every piece of him, but no feel like no topic is good enough to catch his attention or will not make him freak. I just don't know what to do, what to ask, how to learn about him!

I sincerely just want to ask him things that he won't find stupid and small, I want a serious conversation something that can drive us closer or something. I'm trying to see if I can somehow get him alone in person? Maybe he's just a bad texter idk but I'm just super anxious. Àny opinions?

First of all my mom is really weird about the house being clean and tidy. She works full time and I can understand that coming home to a clean house is something that is appealing to her. I am the only person in the house who doesn’t work also so I understand where her expectations come from. I mostly stay with my boyfriend over night every night at his and then come back to mine in the morning to walk my dog and just have some time to myself. Normally I WILL tidy up all of the dishes that her, my brother and my dad used in the morning and just around the kitchen and the living room. Cool whatever. However today I generally just forgot to clean their dishes and I sh* t you not there was literally one plate a few forks and knives a cup and a grater. I came home at 11 am walked my dog and started painting. I love painting and I was really excited this new painting ive been doing so naturally I spent a good few hours on it. She came home and started shouting at me because I never did the dishes. Honestly if you were a third person watching the way my mum behaves sometimes you would think she was just joking. She just get so engulfed with rage when the house isn’t perfect and tidy and clean and its really affecting me now because the only time she ever opens her mouth it is to complain or shout. No one else thinks the house is messy its just her. And whenever I do do something for her there is no acknowledgement there she just expects it from me.Im so sick and tired of it I was having such a good day and then as soon as she walks in the door the nice energy in the room just disappears and its just poisoned with her constant nagging and negativity. After listening to her getting all up in my face telling me how lazy and selfish I am I try to explain to her the way she makes me feel and the way she behaves and she will just shut me down, walk away or slam a door in my face. She’s always the victim in everything and Im always the selfish lazy bitch of a daughter who doesn’t think of anyone else ever. The only reason I’m spending more time at home is because she told me to. She said I was spending too much time with my boyfriend and that she barely got to see me which honestly is probably for the best. She will go nuts if there are fingerprints on the fridge... I dont know but I feel thats a bit extreme. Im so done with it its just getting old and she only seems to be getting worse as time goes on. Usually I avoid confrontations with her and just do as she expects of me but its days like this where I slip up that literally make me want to run away so far from this house. My boyfriends mom is so chill and her daughter has cystic fibrosis so she is a stay at home mom. She is always so calm and her energy is amazing, im sure the last thing thats on her mind when she goes to sleep at night is if there are any dishes left in the sink and whos getting it in the morning....
I wish my mum could realize how much life she is WASTING by moaning all the time over such miniscule things, and how much it affects our family. No one wants to be around her when shes like that, but its just the way she is.
I know its a terrible thing for me to compare my mom to my bf’s but she’s just so much nicer to be around in a house environment.  Is there any way for me to just accept the way my mom is and for me to block out whenever she’s being difficult?

Throughout my high school experience I have been a relatively quiet and reserved person who kinda hung out on the edge of the ""main bubble"" of people at my school. For the entirety of my 4 years I have kept pretty much the exact same friends that I have been hanging out with since middle school and I absolutely love them and would do anything for them. However recently, a couple of my friends from my group have really found themselves a lot deeper in the main  bubble and have begun talking to other people and even have gotten girlfriends as a result. Personally I could not feel happier for them and find enjoyment just talking with them about there experiences and such. I feel like it's important to note I am not scared of them moving away from me as a friend so that is not my problem. Due to seeing two of my best friends have this entire other life it seems like it has begun to make me feel quite lonely and left out. I want to try and get into the bubble somehow or just a bubble, but I feel as a senior it is kinda hard to move my way in as the friendships seem to have been found and developed already. I have talked to my two friends about this and it feels like there is not much I can do. The reason they got into the bubble comes from them being invited to a couple of get togethers    
a person or two that were in the bubble already. I feel like for some reason I have not been able to get that kind of opportunity, most likely due to something I have done or haven't done. My friends have told me that they feel I have begun to change personality wise and have started to become more social as a result which is good. I just want to be able to make my last semester of highschool great and maybe have the opportunity to take someone to prom. I also want to break my cycle of waking up, going to school, going to extracurricular, going home, playing video games/homework and sleeping. I was thinking about asking my two friends that are in the bubble to maybe try and invite me to a couple get together opportunities and see if I could Integrate myself in and become a part of the group but I feel like that is too much to ask and if they wanted me there they would have already invited me. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about what I  should do and how they would try and deal with my situation if they were me.

How do i even start getting over the panic attacks?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eangjo/help/,1,"I deal with anxiety. I’d do 4x4 respiration’s. You breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds and exhale for 4 seconds and do all that 4 times. I flex any muscles. Also describe random stuff you see

I think for the short term it might help to remember that the most time you can remain in an anxious state - having a panic attack - in a anxiety inducing situation (provided circumstances continue to be the same) is 90 minutes, but usually a panic attack lasts much less time than that. 

Anyway, I also avoid things socially, rn im not going to a restaurant with my parents because of it, and im fortunate enough that they just let me not do things that will just make me uncomfortable. You arent just being silly. 

TBH i dont know how you can 'get over' anxiety because i gave up CBT last week myself, i think all you can do is perhaps try and see a proffesional about coping mechanisms and for now try to make clear to your parents that its not worth forcing you into church for the time being. Can you just pray at home instead?

Sorry i cant give a definitive answer but I just thought its potentially more helpful  than just scrolling past, although my ex-therapist told me avoidance behaviour was not good, but i dont believe causing yourself to have full blown anxiety attacks helps either, its probably just a process of building confidence in your ability to handle stress incrementally. good luck.",2019-12-15 02:41:11

So I’m a high school M, and for over a year now I’ve liked this guy, let’s call him Pat. Now, Pat is the first guy I’ve liked seriously, and I didn’t tell anyone about it at first. I’ve never been super private about who I’ve liked with my friends, but something felt different this time. I didn’t talk with him that much, and we didn’t have too many common friends, but even if he paid me a few seconds of attention, let’s just say my day was made. He’s funny and smart and just flat out attractive.

A few weeks into liking him, I found out my (F) friend liked him to. I didn’t know what to think or how to respond to her, so I kept quiet. Turns out Pat liked her too, and a few weeks later they were dating. 

Eventually I told my friends, excluding the one dating Pat, about my feelings for him, and it kindve became a running joke in my group. Over the course of them dating, I came to terms with my feelings. I still liked him, a lot, but I realized that I would never date him, and just wanted him to be happy.

They broke up a few months into the relationship, but it didn’t change the way I felt about him. Throughout the rest of the year, he dated one or two other girls, and my group kindve forgot about my problem. It didn’t really matter, nothing had changed. It was weird because even though I knew we would never be together, I couldn’t move on. I didn’t like anyone else, and I felt strangely fine just liking him without him feeling the same way.

Fast foreword to this year. My feelings remained strong over the summer. I still liked him, but finally things and changed. I was no longer content just liking him. I know he wouldn’t date me, and I just want to move on.

Along with this development, I met another guy. He’s also straight so it doesn’t matter that much, but I guess it’s a sign I’m moving on? But I still feel just as if not more strongly about Pat.

i have always try my best to not burst into tear in school. it has always worked but the depress feelings are still there. then one of my friend privately ask me what happened. i burst into tear and told her how bad i’ve felt for the past week. at least for me it was a relief when some ask what happened because it showed that someone care about you.

Question - do you know this friend’s parents? If you think you can trust them, you should definitely try to tell them what’s going on with your friend so that they can get the help that they need. In the meantime (or if there isn’t a safe adult you can trust), I think the best thing you can do is respect your friend’s privacy (meaning I think you’re right for not prying!) but also let them know that they should feel safe telling you what’s happening in their life (whenever they feel comfortable enough to) if they think it would make them feel better to get it off their chest.

Best of luck! You got this!

Sounds like some shape or form of disassociation, it happens alot throughout teenage years it's just your body and mind just expanding and grasping reality 

this happens to me a lot, it’s been happening to me since i got diagnosed with anxiety last year. it sounds like to me you’re experiencing depersonalization, which is common in association to anxiety & depression, among other things. i don’t know you personally obviously but i’d talk to your parents, and you mentioned they got you a doctor’s appointment so that’s good. i hope everything’s good for you now. :) 

Thank you! I'll try it.",2019-02-07 07:52:41

I’m crying almost every day since I remember. It can be caused by anything and often happens in public. It can be a bad mark, someone being mean or even someone raising their voice. Everyone thinks I’m weird because I cry so easily. I cried maybe 3 times watching movies, but when it comes to situations including me I’m in tears much more often. I can’t really control it. I also often cry at home usually because I’m overwhelmed by everything and I feel like I’m failing in every possible way. I had a few panic attacks in my life, but they don’t happen often. Are you able to help me somehow? I’m tired of being like this.

Sorry for bad English",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fahjwi/why_do_i_cry_all_the_the_time/,10,"Can’t really give out any advice as I am not a therapist, but I do suggest you try talking to people about the things that are stressing you out

Sweetie I'm no professional but your description reminds me of myself growing up. It could be a result of Childhood Emotional Neglect (CEN) if you had a hard time expressing yourself to others as a child, or if others never made you feel welcome to say how you felt. 

You could also be a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) which means that you feel the emotions of other people much easier and feel rejection much easier when other people are irritated. If you feel overwhelmed in busy places, that could also make you feel upset. 

It takes a lot of work and time but if you don't want to see a doctor or can't find one, you can try  some things by yourself. What I find helpful is writing down what you are feeling every chance you can. If you can think about your feelings and look at them on paper, it makes it a little easier to understand that they are temporary. If you are okay with reading English, try reading Creative Visualization"", written by Shakti Gawain. It is a helpful book for accepting your emotions and focusing on good things. 

Always rememer that you are a special and unique person! I'm sorry you have not had the best of luck with friends, but you will find them! It is okay to focus on your hobbies and spend some time by yourself to accept who you are and where your emotions come from.

Edit: feel free to dm me if you would like to talk about anything!

378,f0851r,False,,3,"Don't know what to do from here, HELP!!!!",AdviceForTeens,"Ever since I was little like 4ish years old I felt like my parents were starting to abuse my sister and I. Like it was only from time to time and it was also during a time where my father was becoming successful. As years went on I found that my parents would shake, hit, and yell at my sister and I whenever we made small mistakes. We would sometimes get bigger punishments if we made bigger mistakes. I remember one situation when I was about 5-6, my sister forgot a iPad in an airplane and we realized this when we were home. My dad said he would pick it up but he was angry. The next day during breakfast I forgot what was going on because I was focused on counting the cereal in my bowl but my mom kicked one of the legs on my sisters chair causing her to fall backwards. She stood up and started screaming at me. I immedientley froze, my vision blurred, and the words she was screaming just sounded muffled. However, I was scared to death. We went to school and when our mom picked us up she apologized. The same behavior went on and then when I reached 2nd grade everything changed. My parents got a divorce. I remember my dad walked into my room and asked me, ""Would you be mad if I left for a little bit came back?"" I figured that if he left for a little bit that meant it would just be a couple hours, I thought he was just gonna go to work. He left the room, packed his bags, and I didn't see him for a couple months. After a couple days, I decided that my dad had went on a trip. During those days my mom would forget to feed my sister and I. We kind of just sat in our room and watched minecraft videos or whatever. After, more days passed we would hear our mom crying. Sometimes she would get up storm into our room and yell at us saying that the divorce was our fault. When I finally saw my dad he took us to a party. It was somewhere in Beverly Hills. Full of rich Hollywood people with 20 year old wives. He had got his own too, a girlfriend who was about 13 years younger than him. It upset me that my dad moved on so fast and at first he didn't even tell me that he was dating her. Until like 5 months later when I asked if they were dating. He never even told me they got married. For the next couple of years my mom would talk about how my dad is going to abandon my sister and I and start another family. I heard those words constantly and my mom saying she was the only one who we actually had. When we did visit our dad, every other weekend. It would usually be him talking about how our mom was crazy and him just yelling at us at the top of his lungs. He even showed us his divorce records and whatever and told us our mom said he was physically and emotionally abusive. He told us she lied, I didn't believe it though. My dad has always been a violent person. Last year, I kind of got fed up with my dad and the way he treated me and lied, so I called CPS. I stayed at my mom's house. My mom is a caring person but she sometimes confuses me. Whenever I make a mistake she tells me she's going to drive me straight to my dad's house and drop me off there, she yells insults saying I'm a liar, terrible daughter, a bad kid, how she sometimes wished I was dead, and etc. She occasionally will physically abuse me and when she does it can get pretty scary. I got diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety and I have kind of used drugs to help me escape, which I know is unhealthy. I have an amazing social life and friends I love, but my mom rarely lets me have plans. I feel so alone, I have zero trust for any of my parents. I trust my sister but she's usually on her computer or at my dad's. I've had suicidal thoughts but I know I wouldn't do that, the thought of what happens after scares me. Staying at my mom's house is really tiring but I'd much rather stay here than my dad's. Me staying at my mom's means I get blamed for everything, go through constant emotional and mental abuse, and will sometimes be physically abused. My mom doesn't realise her mistakes, refuses to admit her abusive behavior, and we always get in fights. I don't know what to do, I've considered running away but I don't know if it's worth it. I love all my friends and I do still care about my mom. I won't ever forgive her or forget what she did and still does do but she has helped me in so many ways. She helped me find a place to stay after I called CPS on my dad and had nowhere to stay since she was in NY for a bit with my sister. She cares about my health and everything. I just don't really know how I feel about her. I just know the place I'm at right now just makes me miserable. I've tried antidepressants and therapy and both didn't work. I just keep feeling like I'm getting worse. I know I have a good life, I have a good education, a roof over my head, clothes, food, and other basic needs. I just feel like hearing all those words and insults at a super young age really traumatized me and whenever I hear it again from my mom or Dad I freak out. Whenever I look at my mom I just feel unsafe and mad. Both of my parents didn't really make an effort to be emotionally here for my sister and I and both didn't really want to help us with making food or teaching us important life lessons. I kind of grew up feeling like I was more independent than a lot of other people that I personally know my age. I was always kind of jealous of people who could depend on their parents. I've tried talking about how I feel with my mom and she just yells at me and tries to convince me that I'm crazy and how I should be normal. I feel like I can't keep living the way I do. I have no one to talk to and I am so depressed.

Just from the beginning with the ""Overboard with the partying"" I think you are probably fine. Trying going to parties in the new place you live because thats where you feel comfortable.

Well, finding work is a start. Once you find work and talk to the people there, maybe you can try going to the gym (if you're into that sort of thing) and try chatting to some people there as well. Just do as many things as you can that involve being OUT and around people, you should be fine.

the problem with that is i don't know anyone who lives here so i am not really sure how i would go about finding out about parties and all that up here once i meet a few guys at one party it ended up just spiraling from there into getting invites every Friday and Saturday night.

Ok so this started back in early December on Snapchat when I added my crush and started talking to her. Context we’re both 17 and I met her at my old school 3 years ago before I moved 2 years ago, we weren’t very close but we kinda knew each other. But anyways this convo started out when I asked her if she remembered me she said no. (Red flag 1) but my dumb self didn’t think about that. But we talked for a little bit after that and she eventually said she remembered who I was after hearing about some of the classes we were in together and other stuff and after that we talked some more. About 3 days later when I was over at a friends party drunk and high off my ass I decided it was a good idea with my drunk self to confess how I felt since freshman year. And how did that go. Awkwardly as fuck. She said I don’t know you which with my drunk self I didn’t think was a no but I was drunk so I started asking other questions like if she already had a bf or if she was interested in one or why not. Ps she said no she didn’t have a bf, that she really just felt like doing her own thing and just because she didn’t feel like it. But when I woke up sober the next morning I texted her a apology and didn’t get a response so I kinda just went on about my day. After that day though for like the last 2 weeks I decided I was going to give up on being her bf and just try to be her friend. I tried a way too often to try and start conversations by saying things like hi or what’s up or stuff like that and sending streaks or sending good morning or goodnight. But either way this went on for about 2 weeks without any responses until yesterday where she unfriended me on snap but still let me follow her on Instagram.  So I sent a paragraph long apology on Instagram and now I’m waiting to see if she’ll look at it or not. I’m emotionally confused, is there anything I can do to fix this situation or is it just done if you read thanks and please if you can leave honest feedback.

I'm currently looking for advice after four years of dealing with a manipulative and possessive ""friend"". I'm really sorry that this post is quite long...

We are currently in our last year of school and I look forward to cutting him from my life after I leave. I know I can block him but I'm still worried that he could find ways to contact me, and I know if he does harass me then I can contact the police but I've never done so before and unsure how it would be handled? It makes me anxious not knowing what could happen. My plan was the month we leave to just block him and change my usernames on the accounts I use / open new ones so that he wouldn't  know it's me? I'm very unsure of how to handle this abe probably sound very silly but honestly I need some direction, I dont know who I could talk to who would take the situation seriously. 

I dont want to have any contact at all with this person as for the last four years he has literally been a plague in my life and has forced me away from my group of friends (one of which I am still very close with but Toxic Friend has threatened us both in the attempt to try and stop us from being close.) And has demanded my immediate attention every single day, even through preliminary exams and actual examinations. My main reason for not blocking him currently is that he will yell abuse at me throughout the day and between classes like he has down previously in the last years that I've tried to block him, and simply being his ""friend"" is the only way to stop him from doing this. 

I'm sorry for being such a bother but can anyone advise me on the best way to get him out of my life? Additionally is there any precautions I can take online to keep him away, and offline too?

Hopefully you can still read this, sorry!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ertfoj/how_can_i_cut_a_toxic_friend_out_from_my_life/,5,"I think before you leave you should try steering clear of him. I know it's really hard to do as I myself also have a toxic friend who does whatever she can to have me around her at all times. If this is the case with you, consider joining some activities and getting yourself busy and away from him. Give excuses like you need to study for something and if he asks if you can hangout on the weekend make excuses about family and find time away from him. You could try talking to a school counsellor or a therapist about it if possible. If there are any family members who've gone through similar situations consider asking them about how they dealt with it and how you could deal with it. As for blocking him on social media, I think you should start off by blocking him and changing your account to a private account if you haven't already. Do be cautious of any people he has relations to that are following you. If he somehow reaches your account, create a new one. When going to places do consider whether it would be likely of him to be there. If it is, bring a friend or someone you trust along with you incase something happens. Anyways, I don't know if any of this will help but this is just some advice from someone who currently still has a toxic 'bestfriend' (and is in a very similar situation to yours, weirdly).

Okay, some things happened, i discovered that in the end (at least with relationships matter) i am really careful and loving, and we ended up dating. So, everything was going fine, after some time she started acting a little strange, and after 2 months she broke up with me.

I just broke down, i didn't know what to think or what to do. Did I do something wrong? She was the one with problems? and i'm a very, very sentimental person, so this was really hard for me to accept as she literally was my world. 

Some time passed since then, and now's the real problem: I fear that I might end up living alone the rest of my life. Some time ago I started to think a little, and this is a little hard for me to explain, but I feel like I will never find someone for me. It feels like i'm a little disappointed with people today. Everyone's feelings seem so superficial, like everybody just wants to ""fuck""/ have sexual experiences, I know a lot of people and I dont know anyone who isn't like that.

I just want someone who really loves me as much as I loved her, but for some reason that seems impossible to find. Every person i see on the streets seem at the same time ""mean"" and ""superficial"" in that way I described. Maybe i'm just delusional and nobody is like that. I mean, I obviously want to have these kinds of things, i'm human too, but i feel like nobody have true feelings for other people. Maybe I am right, and people are not the way I expected them to be, and unfortunately, that seems even more true in the country I live, as people here are really ""sexualized"". Maybe people have true feelings but i'm just a boring person, despite my efforts to be someone fun and ""great"" to be with.

I don't know why, but at the same time I feel like it will be really hard for me to fall for someone again as I look down on people that much. 

Summarizing, I feel like the kind of people I like (people just like me, really caring and care-needing) do not exist anymore, and I will never fall/have interest for anyone for the rest of my life, and me being this really sentimental person I am, living the rest of my life like that is impossible. I know that i'm too young for this but it feels like, in the sense of relationships, I'm a really mature person, in the sense that I want a really serious relation.

Also, that girl showed me a part of life I never knew, she kind of remembered me how feeling happy is, because I haven't felt that kind of happiness that you can physically feel in years. In fact, I haven't felt any kind of happiness for a really long time, and know that she is gone, there is something missing.

TL;DR : I basically think i will spend the rest of my life alone because I will never have any kind of interest in people as I think people today are not the kind of people i really like, which are really caring and loving people. As I am a really sentimental person that loves that feeling of real love, not any crush, it is impossible for me to live alone after my ex-gf, someone i loved more than the whole world left me, leaving some kind of ""void"". 

I hope to find someone that feels the same as me or either is someone like me in the sense of being both really care-needing and care-giving, so that I know I'm not correctly hopeless. I know that this issue may seem really kind of ""dumb"" for most people, but it is destroying me as I need someone in order to live happily. Thanks for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erwnh7/need_help_with_lifelove/,2,"If i didn't explain correctly, i kind of want someone who really loves me, stays be my side when i need and give me care, just like i do with the people i love, but i dont feel like anyone is like that these days. As simple as that

I also had that feeling of not being able to find anyone else or not being able to get the same feelings for a girl maybe ever. It might not be the answer you hoped for but stop looking for a girl. It might be hard to not know if/when you're going to meet the right girl for you, but you will. You're still young you shouldn't be worried about things like this.

 I find it hard to explain things in english so sorry if its a little hard understanding.

it’s a struggle when that sort of thing happens. my boyfriend broke up with me a while back and everything about me plummeted. 

getting over someone is hard but to move on you need to let go else you’ll be holding onto nothing (that sounds like it came from pinterest).

if you ever wanna talk, my pm is open.

Yeah, I thought like that, but it is hard

Yeah, those things are hard, but i feel like the problem doesnt really have to do with her, i just feel hopeless, i think",2020-01-22 00:07:13

I feel you. I'm going to tell you two things which are very important.

First: unwind. I **never** do homework right after school. Give yourself some time off right after school until dinner. Go talk to people, meet some girls, etc. Just, don't think about school until dinner. You need *some* time to relax, and I feel that letting yourself unwind from a day of work is always a great idea.

Second: Meet some people! They can be online, even (if you want to go that route and you're nerdy, check our this thing called IRC; it's full of nerds :). If you have some people that will let you vent, it helps. Trust me, if you're playing basketball or some other sport outside with them, you completely forget about school for a few hours.

That's my advice, and I wish you the best of luck!

Thanks

No problem at all! Hope I can help you out :)

Also, you may have better luck posting to r/teenagers (just don't forget to flair your post, or it'll get removed :)

Honestly, homework won't do you much good, listen in class, work in class, then just skip the rest. 
Depending on what country you live in it might be less/more accepted.

Giving out homework truly does not help anyone achieve academic greatness

 I'm curious because all the females I like do this to me. When I am by myself they love chilling with me but when I try to hang with them they are busy. It frustrates me a lot because it's a waste of time. But I am curious on why does it happen. 

Like I figured they just want to ""be friends"" but if that's the case why do they pretty much abandon me when I try to hang out?

This cycle has been happening since I was in middle school and now I'm going to collage. 

The theories I have on why it happens is because I could just be ""eye candy"" to them because I am a pretty handsome guy as my mom tells me. Lol. But it can't just be that right. Like, I don't think people would interact with me if I were just eye candy.

If you’re so curious why don’t you just be straight forward with them. Girls are like normal people they all have different reasons. I would say it seems like if you guys vibe really well with each other maybe they’re just a little bit shy about it. Surprise girls can get nervous like guys too.

What do you mean by straightforward? As in telling them I like them because in that case I do be straightforward. About the eye candy thing, I didn't know what other word to use other than eye candy lol. I rarely use words with that meaning. Also I know girls get nervous but when I tell them I like them and they smile and still hang out amd talk to me. I feel like we're dating or something close until I ask to hang out and they seem to avoid me at all cost.

This might be tmi but for example I once had I girl tell me on how she wanna ride me. She was looking into the window of my soul and starting demonstrating on how actually she was going to do it. I start doing a smile/laugh thing I typically do and said ""Welp. (laughed) I can't turn a offer like that down."" But then she replied ""No silly I'm just joking.""

I have one last tip. You may not have personality disorders... 

 I don't want to downplay your worries because they are very real problems, but many of this issues you described are just the crappy part of being a teen & growing up. People suck. Parents suck. School sucks. Friends turn out to not be friends, but they are jerks instead. Right now it might seem like everything is at its worst because being a teenager is a constant existential crisis but it gets better. We all have to go through these really shitty parts of evolving into an awesome adult, other things that frustrate you and challenge you will be the things that help you grow as a person, and how you deal with it personally will also be a part of that resilience and strength that you acquire by making it through these crappy teenage years.",2020-01-18 04:00:06

Hi, I am a male high schooler going through a rough time, and I would like. At school, I used to be much more extroverted but because of this classmate, let's just call him ""E,"" I have become much more introverted. E kinda pushed me away from my friends because he insulted me for being myself and has called me hurtful names in the past (I understand that other people have been through much worse, but I would appreciate it if you would just give advice instead of a comparison). I asked E to stop it because it hurt my feelings and he has stopped, but he did it so much that I adapted to not do things that I feel like I need to watch everything I do so he wouldn't insult me again (he called me ""retard"" once for being clumsy) when I am at school and now I feel the need to do it when I am at home even though he is not here.

How do I move on and stop obsessing over what E thinks of me and forget that he was mean to me?

start insulting  him back

Hi I went through something similar with my old friends. Is E your ""friend""?
What worked for me is taking a break from my ""friends"" who kept making me feel bad. For me it was over the summer I barely talked to her, then came back and we both changed a little bit and are good friends now. I know it may be kind of hard to do that now since its the middle of winter, but if you can find a way its an option. 
Also, if you can, finding other people who have nothing to do with E who make you feel good. If you're always surrounded by him its going to be harder to get over it, but if you surround yourself with better people it'll be easier to realize that he's just one asshole and not everyone thinks that. Hopefully it'll get better if he stops making comments, too.
Feel free to pm me if ya want, sorry it was long but good luck and i hope the best to you :)

I went through something similar, so let me give you my advice: you could get stronger, and every time he calls you retarded or if he calls you weak, you can offer to fight (it's fine to fight if there are rules in place and both sides agree, for example boxing.)


You could do what I did: pick up a hobby you enjoy so away from school you have something to give you confidence and distract you (I chose writing if that helps) and come up with/google some awesome comebacks. I was known as ""the scorcher"" for how badly I roasted some of the cooler kids.


(Pro tip: if they ask you how long it took you to think of that, instantly snap back with ""about as long as it took me to get into your mum's pants: no more than two seconds"". You will literally KILL them. If you need help, contact me, I'll help the best I csn)

Some context — I’m a middle class person of color (15M) who lives in the United States. I go to a super preppy, expensive as hell, private school (got in on a partial scholarship). You can probably expect that there’s not that much diversity, which is where my first problem arises. I’ve heard a lot of people talk about this before where they ‘find their people’ but there is not a single other person in my grade who looks or talks like me. I don’t feel in place at all.
 On top of that, school has been really stressful recently. I haven’t been doing poorly, but it’s super stressful. It seems like these things are temporary problems but I feel like the reality is that it continues throughout high school if I don’t address it, and maybe it might chase me for the rest of my life. 

Oh, and on top of all that, I have some serious problems at home on both sides of my family. My sister is super spoiled (goes to the same school, but has been there for longer) and she has lost all respect for our parents who sent her there. She’s just plain nasty to them and it hurts me. Also, my uncle on my mom’s side is struggling with obesity and had a heart issue recently (he’s in the hospital rn), and my uncle on my dad’s side is an extreme alcoholic who’s had liver failure and probably gonna die before his parents.

Last week i started to like one of my classmates(of course a girl),and i just tried to speak to her , we talked the whole weekend on YM about different stuff. On Sunday she told me that she really likes me,i said the same thing...On Monday when i got to school she was considering me her boyfriend(i was so fullfilled with that). Sometimes we were hugging and talking and stuff.But in the same exact day an asshole noticed our ""relationship"" and started to chat & flirt with her. I let him do his episode being sure that she won't give a fuck and that she would remain confident...but i guess i made a mistake letting him flirt with her. I realised she was not as nice as i thought after she speaked with that guy for the whole day! In that evening we chatted ,aswell on YM, and she was talking with him...I asked her ""What kind of friends are we?"" and she said ""Very good friends."" I understood,she rejected me...I couldn't sleep that night and the next day i was fucked up!
Now she doesn't even speak to me...
No happy end here...  :'(

One semester of 'bad grades' shouldn't be TOO bad, honestly. Every year, I've had that one class that i've done terrible (for my standards) in. As long as he sorta gets back in gear and starts doing a bit better in school, he should be fine. Colleges like to see improvement in grades over time.

Like what bodnast said, it depends on how ""bad"" these grades are and where your boyfriend is in school. Bad grades 1st semester freshman year isn't that big a deal. Failing out of all but one class 2nd semester junior year looks a little worse. In addition, schools will sometimes overlook a period of bad grades if you offer an explanation. For example, one of my friends didn't do so well 2nd semester sophomore year because she was having family problems at home, but the admissions officers understood when she explained the consequences. 


Scholarships aren't based solely on grades, either. A lot of them involve an essay portion where people explain their passions and their achievements. That essay can make or break a scholarship application, in my opinion. ",2012-12-16 03:46:20

However I never developed an attraction to girls nor facial hair(I also stopped growing but that might be normal I'm 5 foot 10). During the summer a few things happened: first I began to grow facial hair, second after my emotions going a tad haywire(bouncing between depression and hyperactivity for almost a month) I started to realize that I'm now finding girls attractive, Despite having stopped growing while I was 12 recently my shoulders are becoming wider and my arms longer, I also have been told that my face has started to become narrower and that I appear to be losing weight(I'm quite healthy in regards to weight but suddenly my apatite is bigger and I'm told I'm losing weight) This seems similar to what I experienced before I had my growth spurt as a kid.

We’re both 16 and are Juniors in high school. As we got older (end of freshmen year / sophomore year) it came to the attention that we were both in love with each other. We tried to have a relationship in sophomore year but it never ended up working out. (We also go to different schools but live about 10 min away from each other) We still remained close friends and we got back together for one week during the beginning of our Junior year, but the thing is that she was talking to Senior at the time. She ended things with me that week because she wanted to “live her teenage years fully” because she always told me that we would get married and have children together when we’re older. They later ended up getting into a relationship that lasted 2 months before she ended things with him because “she was in love with someone else” (indirectly talking about me). But when she told me that, we still never talked as much as we did when we were best friends. (We weren’t “best friends” because she had a boyfriend if that makes sense). I later found out from her friend about a month after she broke up with him that they were back together and she never told me. Even after talking so much shit about him when they broke up. And i really am in love with this girl and never felt about this way about any other girl i’ve ever tried to have a relationship with and i’m not sure what to do. Would it be wrong to ghost her for a little while or should i still text her every so often.

Hi OP, I would say try ghosting or minimal texting from what it seems she may just be playing multiple people and likes it. Maybe she loves you but is it worth it if she intentionally hides it from you? At least if you ghost and she cares she will try something and if not then you will know. Other choice is be upfront about it. At least confront her or ghost I see those as the 2 main options you should choose between.

Problem is everybody saw us getting out of the bush, and now everyone knows something that I resent myself for. The reason I resent myself, is because I always looked down on people who did it at parties, and I always wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.

U can’t change the past so don’t try. And don’t worry about the fact u guys were both drunk. It’s pretty common to say “I’m waiting for someone special” and then lose your virginity when you’re drunk. However, at least here in the US that’s usually in your 20s when you’re at least close to legal drinking age. With all the technology today u can’t really do much damage control. It’ll seem like it’s ruining your life right now but within a few weeks Becky from engineering class (this is just a common name and class around me, Im not saying  a Becky you may know has done this) is gonna fuck a teacher or something and no one will care about your story anymore. To move on, u can go a few different ways. 1) if u actually like the girl u can try dating her. 2) if you don’t want to date at all, find something new and entraining to do like pick up a new sport, get more intense into a sport you already play, pick a topic and learn as much about it as possible this summer, go to the movies, bowling, etc. with friends, or anything like that. 3) if you don’t like the girl but are interested in dating, find a girl, start dating her and then down the line, maybe you’ll “re-lose” your virginity. Some of the kids I know who lost their virginity in ways like you do something, such as go to church confession or just go to church and sing hymns and say they have “found their virginity through God” because God forgives you for any sin you commit if you’re truly sorry. This is just an example, pretty much everyone near me is catholic. If you aren’t Catholic or religious at all, u can either pray to whoever you believe in or do “soul searching” and forgive yourself.

I recently started talking to her again and I can feel that she still likes me and I want to go for it but... she lives across the country and my current gf threatens suicide so I just cant decide anymore.

Don’t ever get back with an ex. That’s literally the most idiotic thing you can do

You clearly don't like anymore your current gf. I know you are in a difficult situation but if you really watch into yourself youll know that she won't be your soulmate. If she won't, your destiny is to break up with her.
I got in similar situation: i fistly breaked up with my boyfriend but then i really missed him and i decided to hear about him again. That was my first error. If in the first place my boyfriend seemed the right one, in the end the same problems returned in the surface in a stronger way. I could not leave him because he really loved me, but i knew it was right to let him go. I stopped loving him long time ago before breaking up because i realized that i  stayed with him because he became an habitude. I cried for days for my lost but i knew a friend who was my crush some years back that ""comfort"" me. So i litelly replaced him and that was my second and bigger error. But that's another story. The truth is that if you don't love someone (and if you realized it, you're so advanced) you ve got to tell to your partner, for your and his/her wealth. It's not worth it to lose more time because it is so precious. My advise is: break up with her even if she will suffer a lot, now or then it will happen. Try to stay in touch with her and let her know that you're so sorry. Then you'll realize that it's impossibile to help her because she will be the only one to give herself strength. Don't go straight to Rose, think about what happen and let you digest everything. Then you will start a new chapter and that will be delightful. Good luck :)

Well first-time dates are nerve-wrecking, and I can understand where you're coming from! 

You don't have to talk about anything specific during the date. What really engages a girl is if you show her you're generally interested in her. Ask her a bunch of questions about herself. Girls *really* like to talk, and they can talk to no ends about themselves and their interests. During a first-time date, depending on how she's acting and how comfortable she is around you, hold hands if you have the courage to. If you want to give her a little kiss, that'd be fine as well. You shouldn't make out or anything further on the first date, because you're still getting to know her better. You two have not yet become completely comfortable around each other. You two just know that you guys like each other and enjoy each other's company, so making out when you're just getting to know each other better is a no-no. 

Talk to her about anything that you two might have in common. Like, parents....teachers....mutual friends....sports (if she does sports and you do sports)....games...movies....etc. Remember that you two are getting to know each other. 

Good luck! :) ",2012-07-06 11:41:26
216,f8lema,False,,12,i like a guy but i cant help being mean to him,AdviceForTeens,"Hi everybody

im kinda new to using reddit so any general advice is appreciated, i just need to write this all down somewhere because i feel like im gonna go crazy if i dont

theres a guy(17) in my class who was new to the school this year, and during the first couple days of school i felt something i cant rlly describe when i'd look/think about him, but i shrugged it off and never made much of it

and slowly as the year's been going by i took to being super mean to him, swearing at him and spraying water at him, scribbling on his papers, and whipping chalk or shoes or whatever else at him... and its always me who starts acting nasty first, but he doesnt hesitate to reciprocate, although hes really shy and not too talkative

and i dont hate him and ive never hated him,,i actually really like him and ive begun to notice it more and more the past few weeks

i cant get myself to throw stuff at him anymore, or destroy his papers, but now when i see him i dont know what to do if it isn't something nasty, i genuinely just dont know what to say to him

he isn't one to initiate conversations but i really wanna restart with him and get closer to him because hes really sweet, i found a way to partner up with him during class once and i made it look like it was random, but i got to work with him and talk a bit and hes super chill, plus when im nice to him hes nice to me back, he sorta just reciprocates my energy

but outside of that class i cant find words to tell him that arent mean, i just get snappy and defensive for no reason to him even though inside i feel rlly warm n fuzzy being around him, and ive realized that im obviously attracted to him,i think about him all the time,

except i dont know how to interact with him in a way which conveys my interest in him, especially given everyhting ive already done to him

im already horrible when it comes to the whole flirting situation, and i have no clue how to switch from being a bully to a person that is pleasant to be around

idk how to reflect my interest towards him through my words/actions heLP

TLDR: im mean asf to the guy i like and idk how to change my behaviour around him, i wanna show interest but i never know what to say or do ,, where do i start?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8lema/i_like_a_guy_but_i_cant_help_being_mean_to_him/,3,"I feel like we’ve all been a bit shitty to somebody we like to throw them off so they don’t suspect us of liking them, however this is usually when you’re 12, is 17 not a bit old to be acting like this? being mean to one specific person for no good reason usually makes it incredibly obvious that you like them. Destroying his papers and all the other weird shit you’ve done could potentially make him really dislike you though...
My advice is to just stop being a cunt. It’s not that hard. In fact it’s a lot easier to NOT treat somebody like shit than it is to go out of your way to purposely bully them for their attention. If I were you I wouldn’t bother talking to him until I could actually BE nice, because the shittier you are the more likely he is to not like you.
Start off small, do normal shit like say hi to him, ask him how he is, and if you’re compatible the conversation should flow nicely. Being a bitch is not the way to go. Hey, if you can do all that crazy shit to him surely you can have a pleasant conversation with him. Talk to him the way you would talk to a friend. I hate to tell you this but being ‘mean’ and doing the things you’re describing is incredibly embarrassing.

OK, so I've been in a similar situation, 17 years old male here. There were these girls in my school, they still are, and they used to cut my hair, throw stuff at me, throw water on at me, yell on me.... Later we slept together, it was a way for them to show me some kind of attention. Anyway, that is probably why you acted that way, you didn't know how to initiate conversation. If you think he's shy and you don't know what to talk to him about, just massage him on social media. Every one is easier to talk to online, that way you have what to talk about. You'll make him your friend, and than who knows maybe something more. When you fell the time is right you should tell him what you think about him, and you'll be set. Good luck gal, and be kind to him, that's 100x hotter believe me.

yea ik that by being mean im makin it worse n if eel like ur right, starting off small is probably the best way to go 

i kinda just say mean stuff out of not knowing what else to say, but i rlly have to take it down a notch ur right it is embarrassing, its definitely a habit that i took up in middle school to try to 'flirt' but i havent been able to shake it off and at this point at my age it doesnt seem like im flirting, im just coming off as an annoying piece of shit

i might start by just saying hi and then let him lead the conversation instead of me with my swearing n paper ripping n stuff

yea what those girls did sounds like the type of stuff im doing to him lol :)  i definitely dunno how to initiate conversation/get his attention so i kinda just act out of impulse in the moment and do the first thing that pops into my head which is usually to steal his shit or whatever

i tried to just have a normal interaction w him today in person by sitting near him in class, n we ended up talkin for a while during class till the teacher told us to stop talkin, n im rlly happy that i was able to hold a good conversation without doing something dumb

however hes actually barely active on any social medias :(  he kinda goes on them but doesnt rlly text on them, my friends have asked ab homework n stuff n he just doesnt check his messages, so i might just continue trying to interact w him more and more irl till a friendship starts to form n stuff

Yes!! what you said in that last sentence is exactly what you need to do. At least you’re aware that what you’re doing isn’t really acceptable, and that’s the first step to bettering yourself. Letting him lead the conversation is a good bet. Sometimes I like to say something about myself and it gets the conversation flowing, for instance- I’ll say what I did that weekend, or how my days been so far, or what my favourite movie is, literally anything. This way the conversation can be about something I actually want it to be about which makes it a lot easier to continue talking

That works to, just be friendly and don't act like a bitch. Go to him and say hi, check how is he and so on... You should be fine, as long you are fine to him. I wish you luck, and again don't act stupid.

yea those r all good ideas! im definitely gonna b using em

today at school i talked with him for way longer than usual without being bitchy at all n it honestly made me feel rlly happy that i was able to sustain a convo without being dumb and acting mean towards him,

n i was actually way more successful in getting his attention without being a piece of shit to him which means if i continue that'll only b a good thing

hearin another perspective, especially from a boys pov rlly helped tbh, so thank u aa

That’s so lovely to hear! I hope it works out well for you x

No problem. And remember acting that way is immature, and he can pretty much start hating you. You need to change his opinion about you, the best way to do it is to talk to him, be friendly and positive. Smile at him, say hi and show him affection  and he'll be literally on his knees. Whish you luck.

I used to care and give all my passion and love to someone. Someone that became very special to me. Last year, this person started treating me very badly. Losing this person was like losing what I wanted and strived to be. Now it feels like I gave everything away. There's nothing left inside except sorrow and desperation. My body has become useless and my soul is scarred. The mind itself is contemplating scenarios to fix something that can no longer be fixed or helped. That person gave up, they don't care. Why am I still waiting around for them? Why is there still hope inside of my heart? I don't understand why I still have these dreams. I just constantly dream and fantasize. I need to stop this obsession. Giving and caring is what I want to be. Yet, I just work for him. I just wait for him.

What should I do to help myself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fcqgrj/i_feel_alone_in_this_situation_not_a_good_start/,3,"I had similar problem before, I think you just have to keep going on until you find someone else. When you find someone else you will slowly lose feelings for the other person you liked.

I have suffered from a similar situation: I am putting my emotions and my needs second to someone else’s because I care about them so much. I came to find out they did not care about me as much as I did them, and they were also treating me poorly.

Those kinds of people are NOT your friends. Your friends reciprocate actions and do things for you as you do things for them. I completely understand why you are so upset and why you continue to put your emotions and mental health on the line, but you will get through this.

Just stick your head up and know that you are worth more, and you deserve better. You need someone who will reciprocate actions and emotions, not someone who gives nothing in return.

This has happened to me before with a guy i dated and as soon as he broke up with me he tried to make me feel bad for wanting to talk to him, but only in front of other people. He is really tall (5”8 at 13) but he’s super like SUPER skinny and scrawny so its hard to take him seriously so when he dumped me i just wanted to talk to him but he started treating me poorly and i didn’t know why i was still waiting for them. It’s still hard to understand and i thought i would never get over them, i thought we could still be friends or be a couple and at one point i was depressed and had more anxiety than ever. I didn’t let myself believe i could let go so i didn’t. Once i let myself feel happy and be more happy i started to let go, so yes, it will take a long long time to get over that person. But no you will not keep wanting to be there for them after a certain amount of time. You will get over that person

It's not really the person itself but how you felt when u were around that person and memories that you guys shared together. Here is my advice dont lose yourself to find her/him, find you to start/create something new. When one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us.

424,ego420,False,,1,I just need advice,AdviceForTeens,"okay I'm not sure how to start this off  but I'll give you a background. I've been feeling off lately. Back around the end of 2017 like in mid September and through august of 2018 I was in an episode of sadness. (Im not going to call it a depressive episode because I was not diagnosed with depression or anything of the sort.) I didn't recieve any help throughout the time and just bottled up everything and covered it up with a goofy personality I created. I tried to discuss it with adults in my life but they shook it off saying I was going through a phase and that it will go away as time goes. Now Ive been realizing changes that I haven't noticed that began around july of this year. I've been unmotivated to do anything, All the love and passion I had for certain activities went away. It's hard for me to remember any joy or pleasure I had. Through the small period of August of 2018 till July of 2019 I had burst of high energy (like in small episode 1-2 weeks every other week). And at this point I'm just confused. 

I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about this problem if I do I just have an underlying concern or worry that they'll contact CPS. (we've had trouble in the past with them but it wasn't anything major but it was scary.) I'm just confused on what to do next.

p.s. I haven't talked to anyone indepth about what I went through. I don't think I can trust my friends about my struggles and prefer to keep them out of my problem to not bother them.

But I would reccomend to stay away from talking about depression or suicidal thoughts.

But that's only if you aren't feeling extremely suicidal or way too sad. Talk to a doctor about what you just said and see what happens from there. You wouldn't want to be sent to a psyche ward if your doctors ask if you're suicidal  and you say kinda or mabye,2019-12-28 15:54:45
773,c544h5,False,,0,Bestfriend Problems; R's Doubts,AdviceForTeens,"I don't think anyone will see this but I'm writing it anyway.
My best friend and I have been friends for awhile now. She's really kind and caring for me. She supports me when I need it which I tend to cause I struggle often with my family. We can all her R.
R is a busy person. They do lots of sports and training that she no longer enjoys but can't get out of. Her mother has her under a similar system of life 360 and put her in therapy after discovering R was self harming. R often jokes about razors and cutting. At the beginning of our friendship she'd get scared I'd stop being her friend and would say things like "" if you'd ever leave I'd start cutting"". That later stopped and things seemed normal. She doesn't tend to have a filter in public. And doesn't enjoy talking about her feelings.
She was recently diagnosed with minor depression.  She told me she doesn't talk to her therapist and doesn't want to. I suggested getting a new therapist but she said no. I suggested talking to the social worker at our school cause R enjoyed their company but she declined once more. It's gotten to the extent where if I suggest talking she refuses and says she'd rather bottle it up than talk about it. Very recently she texted me telling me she wanted to commit suicide and after several attempts of convincing her not to she stopped responding so I texted her mother and told my own. I then called her mother only for R to answer herself with the words ""skeet skeet"". At that moment I was shaking and crying and sweating and hearing her normal humorous voice make a joke I immediately hung up. She then texted me saying her phone died with laughing emojis. I was upset and told her not to joke about it. I then asked if she was serious and she replied with yes. I then told her I would not hesitate to tell an adult if that situation happened again. She then left me on read after saying her phone was gonna die.
I feel like R will not accept help and gets upset if I try to tell someone. To be completely honest for a few other reasons I've recently doubted our friendship. I'm not at all in a good mental state and A knows that. Frankly I don't know what to do.

I was suppose to leave on a trip with my family after I got off work. They scheduled the trip around the time I got off so I wouldn’t get left behind. 


So I called the Gm in a panic because it wasn’t my day to close and no one let me know ahead of time to ask if it was going to be OK with me. I felt bad for my family because they specifically planned the trip around my time. 


After I called the GM he told me that the reason he called in was because the closing manager’s grandma is in the hospital having surgery. 


The manager who was suppose to close had a family emergency so they resorted to me closing because I was already there.


In the end, they got the other guy to come in and finish the shift, like he was suppose to do. He was upset at me for not closing for him. 


But we each have our own individual lives. No one asked me if I had anything going on to see if I was okay with closing. So now I’m on my way to the visit my family up north.

Yeah I understand. But what made me more upset and had me in tears. Literal tears at work was when I called my GM to tell him I can’t close. He didn’t even care about my plans. He did not sound sincere about not telling me or anything. Oh I didn’t even mention that I had a break down at work trying to decide to close the restaurant or to go with my family.

338,xtcss,False,,2,Need Advice on Dating with Hobbies,AdviceForTeens,"Hello everyone. I've been lurking reddit for a while, and so many stories have inspired me to start posting on here, so here goes.


I'm 17/M, and I have an admitted history of being overly shy when it comes to talking to girls. I have, however worked on this and have mostly overcome this, with a combination of maturing and having supportive friends.


I've started to get serious with a few girls before, but have stopped short from dating, mostly because they cut me off before I had a chance to really ask them out, and they would end up dating several guys which have ended up in disaster.


Now, I'm a pretty well rounded guy who is both nice and fun, and, not to sound self righteous, I have been told I'm good looking as well. On the flip side though, I take part in rather geeky hobbies, such as gaming, Warhammer 40k table top, and Magic: the gathering, just to name a few. While this hasn't presented itself to be a problem yet, I'm a bit nervous for any future relationships I may get in to. More times than not when I meet a girl, they see the nice, fun, party side of me. However, there is a geeky side to me as well, and I fear that when a girl sees that side, she will no longer be interested in me. 


In such a case, I'm probably better off, but on the other hand, this is likely to become a repetitive cycle, seeing as the girls I meet are at social events with friends. I pretty much just want advice on how to handle this sort of situation, if anyone has experience with this sort of thing. 


To those who read all of this, you are truly awesome and deserve a cookie. Thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/xtcss/need_advice_on_dating_with_hobbies/,5,"Find someone thats right for you  that is a gamer and that is well a friend those are the ones you can go serious with

First. Never. Everrr. Give up what you love / like for a girl. If I played Minecraft alot & it made me happy don't give it up. Most likely she wont care. & what seems to happen for me is if I find a girl who I really like & we have like a connection.. We can just natually talk to eachother.. This might now be for you but if its awkward it wont last so don't try. Be with a girl that likes the same stuff as you & its an easy wway to talk to her. Just talk about magic the gathering & then ask for her # etc. :P & trust me. There are girls who like games like that. & can still be pretty (: i hope that helps!

Okay. So, coming from a girl who is a geek as well (myself) I don't mind the ""geekiness"" whatsoever. This is just my own point of view, but I find geeks attractive. *I like smart guys.* I'd prefer to have a smart guy that knows what he's talking about than someone who throws YOLO around expecting to sound smart. 

Let me tell you all geeks that THERE ARE GIRLS OUT THERE WHO DO LIKE GEEKS. I am a geek myself. I'm pretty sure geeks rule the world too. So don't ever think that your geeky side will deter every single girl you try to start a relationship with. Because there are girls who WILL have their own geek side to them. For example, I LOVE SCIENCE, and MATH (Believe it or not Ripley!) and I love Naruto, I love KPOP, and I like programming.

The reason that I’ve decided to join this site is because I have some issues that I don’t want to bother friends or family with because I don’t want them to worry. Recently I’ve been having some issues socially and quite frankly I’m lonely. I’m usually generally a happy person but being on my own brings me down very low and right now I do feel as though I’m completely on my own and detached from the rest of the world. From a young age I have had problems with fitting in and making friends. These problems have came and went over the years but I always felt as though as I got older these issues would fade and I would find myself some how. I have now reached the age of 19 and I still have very little confidence and I feel as though I am missing out on things that other people my age are enjoying. I constantly beat myself up for not putting myself out there and making friends but I simply don’t know how to. I always have this anxiety around people not liking me and preferring it if I wasn’t there. I feel as though my lack of confidence puts people off being around me and makes them feel uncomfortable but this thought once again just makes me even less confident. It’s starting to really piss me off tbh just taking about it now. I just wanna get on with my life and enjoy it how I should be but I just don’t know how to. Any advice or anything just to make me feel less alone with this would be very helpful! :),https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/bvodqw/i_need_a_little_help/,2,"Well you could start by making a few online friends. A good way to do that is playing games.

I know it may sound corny but antidepressants may help a little bit. They dont make you junking off the walls happy, but they can help out more than you expect.

I know that you have heard the lush push yourself out of your comfort zone but they are completely right! It helps a ton. Idk if this was very helpful but I hope you can get better!

Thank you for the advice! but I’ve never really been into playing games, I’m more of an outdoor sort of person!x

Perhaps that would, this is something that’s been suggested to me by family members. I’ve never struggled with depression though and I’ve always managed to pick myself up in difficult times. I now feel as though I’ve lost that energy that I once had from trying so hard for so many years. It also scares me that I would become reliant on antidepressants.

Well just do stuff you like and you'll more than likely make friends doing it.

In my experience I dont rely on antidepressants. If you are not depressed then simply dont take them, sorry for assuming. Its great that you are able to pick yourself up in difficult times. It shows that you're headstrong. When you say you lost energy, what do you mean exactly?",2019-06-02 03:15:10

do they force the religion onto you?
a lot of religious parents do and i think its just so wrong

it wasnt your choice to be bisexual or trans thats how people are born 

i dont know whats religious people's problem

They probably just want best for you, and it's obvious that they don't understand you. You need to talk to them and you need  to be clear, if they love really love you they'll accept you. You just start doing something for yourself, start earning money, it should help. Show them that you are independent, but not in a bad way. Build up your relationship with your siblings, you'll need them. Christians are weird, especially Catholics, I know,but just be yourself. Christ won't hate you for being yourself.

They’re catholic Christians and yeah, I was raised that way but grew to resent the faith as I got older and discovered who I was when it was always being shoved down my throat from my parents and the church. And yeah I have no clue

I’m not religious and I can’t with my siblings, my sister has a wicked case of clinical narcissism and my brother tried to have sex with me and her, I have a job and they know I’m highly independent, I always have been.

sorry if anything i say hurts you btw
im not good at helping people..
im sorry

Fuck, they are weird, no offense. What about your mom, what up with her?

No it doesn’t, you’re good :)

Oh she has her head up Jesus Christ himself’s ass

do you want to be friends

Pretty much in the same situation here mate, just know you can always message me if you need help ^_^

I don't understand that kind of people, I am Christian, but not a fanatic. At least your dad's alright. He should support you, have him on your side.

And also don't get angry at your friends, they'll talk to you as you wish when you completely change.

Sure, dm me with your snap or smth

nice name btw

He still doesn’t support me...

Yeah I know i don’t get mad at them unless they cause it haha

i dont have snap 
just discord and reddit
and this is a shared account between a lot of people some are trolls too so

Thank you!

They expect you to act like a girl, but they can't make you do anything you don't want to do. Be yourself, talk to a professional if it is needed to make them belive you are for real. They had a daughter, and they'll get a son. Talk to them, and be totally open. The best thing to do is to go with them to a Psychologist.

Also, you shouldn't smoke pot, it won't solve anything.

I have discord I’ll dm you with a link

Ok haha

Oki thx

192,9xa4ao,False,,2,I don't know if I should tell my therapist or not.,AdviceForTeens,"I think a lot about my past looking for reasons as to why I'm the anxious, depressed, and emotional person I am. I used to be incredibly aggressive as well as a child but now I don't even like to yell. Any sort of aggression around me throws me into this frightened panic mode and i begin to frantically search for a way out of the situation. I say I think about my past because... as a kid, I was highly aggressive and threw lots of tantrums even at the age of 13. My mom would discipline me severely and that's all I  thought it was. Discipline. I only began to question it after I turned 17 and am still uncertain of it now at the age of 19. As a child I was diagnosed with RAD (Reactive Attachment Disorder) and I'm not sure if I still have it or if it's gone. I'm also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When my mom spoke to my therapists, she wouldn't hesitate to tell them every single thing I did, whether it be acting out or having no remorse, though she never told them what she did in response and I didn't tell my therapist about what happened at home either. I was afraid of more discipline or my mom getting in trouble resulting in even worse discipline. My mom, to this day, guilt trips me for my behavior as a kid. Asking where she went wrong and if she was a bad parent and why did God give her such misbehaving children. Sorry for the rant, I just want for anyone able to answer to get a vague understanding of my past as a kid before I ask. One of these days where I was incredibly angry and wanted to be left alone, my mother persisted on bothering me and further agitating me when i just wanted to be left alone to calm down and I stated so. This was when I was 12. She ignored my plea/request and continued to yell at me and it got to the point where her boyfriend came upstairs to see what was up. I heatedly kept telling them to please just leave me alone and tried to fight my way past them since they were making no moves to leave. My mom, already in a defensive mood, got more angry and started to wrestle with me and hold me down. I tried to get away but she told her boyfriend to hold me down and he helped her in doing so.  He held my wrists with my arms outstretched above my head and she had her entire body weight on my legs. Mind you, I was merely 12... I'm sure none of this was necessary but at the same time... anyways, my mom kept repeating the question ""Are you going to calm down?"" Over and over as i cried splayed in that position because it's what I was trying to do in the first place. I was held there on the floor by my bed for 3 hours. Before the three hour mark, my mom force fed me Tylenol to ""calm me down"" even though I had already given up on trying to move.  When she asked her question ""Are you going to calm down?"" Again, I answered ""Yes"" weakly and defeatedly so I could get some feeling back into my hands and legs. When they let go and I was finally able to move, I stayed on the floor and curled into a ball and cried because my arms and legs hurt when I moved them after being stuck that  way for so long. They went back downstairs and I passed out either from crying, or all the tylenol she gave me. So my question to the answerer is, Does that count as abuse? My mom has been extremely disciplinary my whole life. I'm not sure anymore though. I only began questioning it 3 years ago. I just don't know for sure and I don't want to talk to my therapist about it incase it's nothing.  I just really want to get to the bottom of my mental and emotional issues so I can have a long lasting and healthy relationship because trusting and speaking out to my significant other is very difficult and he's very patient but the way I am is unhealthy and I know that. I don't want my relationship or future relationships with friends and family  to be ruined because of my fears and inability to address my feelings.

I probably have depression, but last time I went to check out if I did was two years ago, and I was told I didn't have it.  now I'm pretty sure I do.  my mom doesn't want me getting anti-depressants because she ""doesn't want me to rely on medication my whole life"" (she's in an essential oil MLM so that probably influences her opinion on me getting meds)

Even though it looks like you're crying for no reason, there might be unconscious thoughts that are causing you to be depressed when you should be having fun. Assess your environment; are there some people that are toxic or abusive to you?

I know it’s off-putting and kind of dark but I have a really deep respect for it and it’s the only job I can see myself liking. My mom wants me to go to college, I do too I guess, but more importantly I want to go to mortuary school. I want so badly to go to mortuary school. The high school I go to right now has an internship program and I had one all set up to work with a funeral home! I was going to be allowed to see the bodies and help with simple embalming tasks, I was so excited I couldn’t believe it. My mom came very close to signing the permission slip but decided against it for a few reasons. Embalming fluids (such as formaldehyde) can cause brain cancer after a long exposure, and drug using can be a bit of an issue in the mortuary community due to the numbness the job can make you feel, or not feel. She said she doesn’t want me doing the internship and she said if I want to go to mortuary school it would be disrespectful to her wishes, which I understand, but she knows how much I want to do this and how long I’ve wanted to do this. She also said she wouldn’t help with the cost and if I decided to go, I wouldn’t be allowed to live with her. For a little background, my dad died of brain cancer.

I had a similar problem. Is there blood when you wipe it?

I see how this can easily be missinterpreted as trolling, but I'm unfortunatly not. It really hurts.

Only once I had a little blood there but it never happened again. I don't want to scare you but you should get that checked out if it happens multiple times, it could be something you should take serious.

You also made a post that you wanted to shave your ass. Is it for cosmetic purposes or this problem you're facing?

That happened because of the excessive workout, it is fine now. You should just clean it up real nice, shower after shipping,also applying cream helps, and whatever you do do not shave your God damn ass... Better option is to trim it. Shaved ass causes itchiness.

I think they're related. It's not cosmetic, I just don't want that much hair down there. I never knew I had so much down there

It's pretty normal to have a lot of hair down there. If you're female you might have an excess of hair as a symptom of some other condition. But if you're male there's pretty much no limit to the hair unless you have that werewolf syndrome. Trimming your hair is recommended if you're having these problems (be careful though). But shaving can definitely result in cutting yourself or rash.

I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about, people can get little flareups around the anus area for a number of reasons including friction and hair. The solution is to use water to clean after using the bathroom. In Italy they have bidets. They're pretty useful for the elderly, little children and people who get problems down there because water causes less friction than toilet paper.

In the likelyhood that you don't have a bidet, hop into the shower and clean yourself that way. Probably whatever you have will heal itself.

I heard the shower one but isn't that just way to much work? I've also had the opportunity to use toilets with water, which in my opinion is a great invention.
I'm male btw

What would you rather have? Pain while cleaning and possibly getting not entirely clean? Or spending a few seconds more in the bathroom?

True, I'll try it next time but I'm sure it's gonna take more then some seconds.

I should add that at first try to get some stuff off with the toilet paper so you don't end up clogging the shower drain.

The thing is... I’m not sure if I want to do tkd anymore. I used to love it and have a passion for it but now I dread Tuesdays and fridays (when I have it). One of my instructors works at a gym as a personal trainer, so we spend majority of the session doing really hard and tiring exercises, bare in mind that I’m 14, and one of the older ones. But I’ve been doing tkd for years, my sister does it and I’ve competed and won stuff. I feel like it’s a big part of my identity and what makes me me. I just don’t enjoy it anymore. My black belt grading is soon, (2 months) so I can’t miss any sessions.

Also I now don’t like competitions. Back in February 2019 I broke both bones in my wrist fighting someone at training. Since then, I’ve kind of been scared that I’m gonna get injured and I’ve moved up a category too (lightweight to middleweight). The girls in this category are a lot bigger than me so this makes me even more scared.

So all of this in account, idk if I wanna do it anymore. If I stopped I would feel like I’m betraying my instructor and all my friends there (basically family). But I really want to start dance. My friend would join it too because she is free but I am obviously not. Also, I’ve never really done dance before (unless u count baby ballet) and if I joined a different club all by myself I’d be really behind and lonely. I JUST DON’T KNOW! 

I guess I could quit tkd after I make black belt, but that would feel wrong as it would look like I’m only in it to get a black belt. 
Please help! I need advice! I’m aware that this is a lot to read and probably doesn’t make sense but I will take any advice I can get.
Thanks x",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/et0wc6/should_i_quit_a_club_ive_done_for_so_long_it/,3,"I just quit a club cause it was stressful and I didn’t need the extra stress in my life.

Does he go above and beyond for you? What does he do to qualm you’re insecurities. 
Imagine if your best friend came to you about this and told you every detail about him. Would you support it? Lots of angles can change our perspective. Right now you’re looking at it from a love struck angle (while also considering he dated your friend), so looking at it from different perspectives could give you an interesting insight! Also think about what you would do for someone and if you expect the same. How would you treat him in a relationship and if he would satisfy you romantic desires (friendships and how friends treat you is a good tell of how they are to their lover to an extent). 

He sounds great and honestly rn I’m in love too and unsure as fuck. Love is confusing and there’s no real way for a stranger to give you  advice about  stuff you know in your heart. There’s probably gonna be a tiny voice in the back of your mind that’s the leader of your feelings. How you truly feel. And then there’s all the other thoughts that are doubting. Only listen to your gut feeling and you’ll start realizing what the right answer is.

And honestly. If there’s no doubt, and you jsut wanna go all in. Date the shit out of him. Depending on how close the friend is to you that dated him, you may need to talk to them about it and tell them you want to date because you have really intense feelings for him and don’t want to hurt them. But besides that? You’re golden. A true friend would support you and want you to be happy. It’s hard not being selfish sometimes but you should start surrounding yourself with people who have your best interests at heart anyway. Jsut go with your gut.

She decided it was best if we break things off yesterday, which didn’t surprise me, but hurts nonetheless.  I told her that I would be here for her always.

I’m in a relationship currently and it’s my longest lol for a 1.8 years now. I really suggest communication is key but also the amount of participation from both parties.

I recently finished taking an important exam which majority of 17 year old students have to take. People said that our future is depending on the exam. We'll get good jobs if our results is good. But that is not my concern yet. My concern is that the result will be out around 3 or 4 months after the exam and those months are usually the time when students who took the exam search part time jobs. I would like to experience a part time job myself but my parents are against it. When I asked why, I don't really get a satisfactory response. Some reasons that they mention was how am I going to work everyday (transportation) and I won't even get that much money from working a part time job. They said it's better for me to look for something that I like and build skills from that. For example taking classes, etc. The thing is, those classes require fees and I feel bad to keep asking money from my family. Everytime I want something, I have to ask money from my father or mostly my brother. Of course they'll give it to me but I just can't help but to feel bad for them. The reason why I want to work is because I want to have at least some pocket money that I earned by myself. Maybe in a few months, I will continue my studies in a university and I can't expect my father to pay for all of my expenses. I do think that taking extra class would be nice, I do like arts and I want to learn how to paint but those classes mostly cost a fortune.

it's almost become a cat and mouse game like this, and i'm so tired of it. i tried talking to her about it but she dismissed it and keeps doing it. 

what should i do??",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/el8mkw/how_do_i_tell_my_mom_to_stop_asking_about_times/,2,"My mum is the same!!

This way you’re not completely disregarding your mums questions about the time, while also you could be challenging yourself to get the work done in a quicker time frame perhaps.

It was just me and the other two friends. Everything was going great my ex bsf and me became closer over the summer but that soon came to an end on October she found out we had made a group chat without her so one of my other friends made a group chat including her and everything was fine until a few days later she got all mad and ignored us for 2 weeks and even unfollowed all of us. I decided to confront her about it and she ended up saying that she was mad because we added her to a group chat after we realized that she wasn’t in the other one. It’s been almost three months since that happened we haven’t actually texted since. We’ve invited her to a few events but she never showed up. she said she needs time to think but it has been almost three months should i just move or do i try one more time or should I just wait and see if she ever has an answer?

If you still want to be friends with her I would say sorry once. That way you won’t regret it in the future! But if you say sorry once and she keeps ignoring you then give up because it isn’t right to you to hold on when it’s hurting you. If she wants to come back to you she will! If you guys are meant to be friends the event will sort out and she will acknowledge that you were doing what she asked you too. You aren’t in the wrong.",2020-01-01 03:58:29

Make it something related to the subbreddit. Its your choice. 

Why did you take out the background quote thing and when you hover over submit it changes.. those weren't ugly..

The bottom of the page.

yeah...

the quote was good, but didn't have anything to do with the theme of the subreddit (teen advice) and it just looked bad IMO. you can ask for the community's opinon on the hover over submit and background and if people liked it i'll put it back

Never mind, its gone

If anything I try REALLY hard NOT to come off that way, to the point where I don’t even try. Sometimes I even feel like I don’t look good enough and I feel like I have to look a certain way just for people to like me. Whenever I ask someone for advice they tell me to be myself but I have no idea what that means because I’m already being myself. I have anxiety and I tend to overthink certain things.

The whole confidence-trying-to-find-out-who-you-are thing took me ages. But may take you less, so here's what I'll say in hope that I'll be somewhat helpful. I did the whole thing where you tried hard to get friends, then you get friends, hang out and then find out you don't actually have anything in common with them. It was painful for me because one of my biggest fears was not having any friends. But fast forward to uni and I'm surrounded by a great bunch. I didn't try at all. I was just me and apparently that attracts people who have the same values/interests as you. I just let things happen and then i started talking to ppl, they soon became friends and my confidence is much better because I didn't try to impress anyone. Don't know if that was helpful but I'd say dgaf about what people think. Be you, in the truest way you can be. If people aren't interested then that's fine, your crowd will come. Just takes time.

You’re always enough. If you feel really uncomfortable at this school, I’d say either try to transfer to another school if possible, or talk to your parents.

You are always enough even if people don’t see that there is no reason you should try to be something you are not, if you was are really worried about your appearance there are many workout apps and stuff like that that give work out lessons which could help, I use full fitness it’s an app on iOS idk about android but it lets you log workouts gives you videos and pictures on how to do it and has workouts for everything you can use like machines, free weights, and body weight.

90,f4jq32,False,,0,Frustrated with friend,AdviceForTeens,"Hello! I’m a 14F. (and new to reddit!) I have a big issue in school that has been going on for about 2 years now with my friend. My friend (aka ‘C’) is a very shy and reserved person whilst I’m outgoing and confident, so we are very different. Since the summer of 2017, she has been getting clingier and clinger to me as I begin to talk to more and more people. I don’t usually have a problem with this, but it first turned into silence when I tried to involve her in a conversation (which I can understand if she’s nervous) to whenever I talk to someone that isn’t her, let alone look at them for more than 5 minutes, she gets angry and storms off looking like a tomato. 

There was an issue back in the summer (2017) when we met a girl who moved into our tutor, but it was the usual school drama - trying to act cool, etc. She was very involved in out friendship circle, but ever since she left, C has been a broken mess that only keeps going downhill as time flows by. At first, I tried being understanding, considering this is C that I am talking about, she might’ve told something private to the new girl. I patiently dealt with her mini temper tantrums for a good while, when eventually all of her wailing and crying turned into loads of messages every. day. I’m not actually very good with texting, so I’d try my hardest to type back, but, as bad as this makes me sound, it wasn’t fun or anything. It was just questions after questions, literally as if she typed up “how to have a conversation over text!” There was even a time when I actually picked up one of her hundreds of calls after school and when i tried actually talking to her, I would just get cut off by more weird questions like:
“What colour is your room?”
“How many sketchbooks do you have?” (I like drawing, so this isn’t too odd I suppose)
“Can you send me a picture of that?”

I know it sounds odd. It makes me feel really bad when I look back at it. But eventually I just stopped picking up or responding - they were boring and repetitive. Eventually, I met some more people. (who I now am very close with) When we talk, she just stands somewhere behind me and stays quiet, and when we try to include her, she just says “I’m fine.”

Recently, I’ve also had another one of my friends (M) try to turn on me by spreading rumours. (I’m likely to post about that later!) I can say I’ve dealt with that confidently, but C and M keep trying to make fun of me behind my back. M keeps trying to say snarky things whenever I say something and C just backbites and spams me with texts. Whenever C texts me now, I just immediately go angry. I’m being patient with them and continuing like normal, but I don’t know how I could make this stop or even just deal with this.

I had 2 sessions when i was 14 but quit, due to her(therapist) trying to make me seem insane or blame my family. Maybe it’s because i’m born into a muslim family that most females(bosses, teachers etc) try to look for an excuse to blame my family for everything, in short i learned to bullshit with every female authority that’s not family - so i thought why not try a male this time?

Any experiences with male therapists? Is it a good idea if you want to talk about anxiety, past sexual abuse etc? Or should i try again with a female?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/c4y21q/as_a_21_year_old_f_would_it_be_better_to_see_a/,2,"It depends on what you’re seeing the therapist for. If it’s because your mom was emotionally abusive or you have PTSD from something non-sexual there’s no problem with seeing a male therapist. If it’s something you don’t want to share with a guy, so people who have been sexually abused will not talk to a therapist or police officer that is of the gender of their abusers, then obviously don’t see a guy psychologist. Sometimes you don’t even need to talk to a licensed psychologist. I have helped some of my friends through a couple things including helping them realize why their parents were so overprotective or abusive. Sometimes it’s best just to open up to a friend or colleague or classmate who you trust and think will give you good advice.

I actually found I got along with male therapists better tbh. You can talk about anything you want with the male therapists just like you can do the same with the female ones. They are both equally qualified and have the same job.",2019-06-25 07:25:16

Obviously you broke the code here, but I think it can be fixed. Talk to him and se how he responds, offer him to go out and buy some drinks and talk about what happened. If your friendship was worth it, he most likely agree and try to put things back together.

433,ebwgwb,False,,2,Advice,AdviceForTeens,"Some background about me I’m a 19yo Male. I recently moved from the city to the suburbs of Chicago. I’m a introvert and I’ve been told by numerous people that I’m very mature for my age. I’m a virgin not because I’m saving myself for marriage but because I can’t bring myself to just have sex with randoms or manipulate to get in too someone’s pants. I’ve also never been in a full real relationship but you probably figured that by now. 

When it comes to women I try not to be picky. No one is perfect especially me, but I do look for woman that are mainly introverted, sweet, and focused. These personalities seem to not be very common. No offense to others but the social media type women just aren’t my type which is fine because I’m most likely not there type but it seems that every girl is like that and it’s becoming difficult to not adjustment my standards because I do want a relationship. I also over think things a little which can be hindering me to an extent.

645,epg0uj,False,,1,Help me decide if I should spend money on a new tooth or not!,AdviceForTeens,"Ok the title is pretty funny ngl but I actually need your guy’s opinion on this serious matter.

Background: i am a senior in high school and i just got my braces taken off a few months ago after having them for like 6 years. I also do not have my upper left incisor tooth (the one right next to your front tooth) because my mouth was too small and it had to get pulled. 

So when I got my braces off, I had to get a retainer with a bar across the front of my teeth with a tooth attached (so It looked like I still have all my teeth).  I didn’t mind the retainer too much bc I figured i could live with the bar across my teeth for a month for so. Then, my doctor just told me that I will have to wait until the end of April to get my actual implant so I will have to keep the retainer with the bar across the front until then.

I hate to smile with my teeth and I am very self conscious about having my retainer in all the time. I realize this sounds stupid but I just feel like the only person in the world that has to wear a retainer and that doesn’t have a perfect, metal free mouth. And again, I know it might sound dumb but this retainer really impacts my self confidence. I thought that when I got my braces off, my hatred for my smile would stop, but now that I am supposed to wear this for longer makes me want to cry.

Although, my doctor gave me the option of keeping the retainer with the bar across the  front of the teeth for the next 3 months OR getting a retainer without a bear across the front with a tooth still attached but for $250

I do have the money (my parents aren’t paying for it) but I worry that I’m spending a lot of money on something that I will use for 3 months only. BUT I am going to a trip to London and Paris in the beginning of April and I really really do not want to go there looking and feeling like this.

So, I need to decide if I should keep my retainer with the bar across the teeth OR buy the $250 one without the bar?

Pls tell me what you would do!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/epg0uj/help_me_decide_if_i_should_spend_money_on_a_new/,1,"Its better to build your confidence than thinking to buy the new tooth.

Overall its your decision to pick which is most helpful to you, this is my opinion and i think it helps me a lot too.",2020-01-16 15:22:59

shoot up the school. Please reply.",AdviceForTeens,My friend told me he was. But if I tell he will shoot me.. is there any way I could talk him down..,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/xqoxb/my_friend_in_saying_hes_going_to_shoot_up_the/,4,"Report him. You have to. Look, if he's serious, then you've saved some people. If he's not, then great. Nothing happened. You have to tell the authorities. This is no joke.

Oh my goodness. Do not even try to handle this on your own. Tell your parents immediately. 


There may be lots of kids who say this who ultimately don't.

However, the ones that actually go through with it all made these kinds of signs and threats beforehand.  Everyone who heard them sure wished they took them seriously before.

As mrlr asks, one key question is: how developed a plan does this person have?  The more detailed, the more likely they are to do it.

All that said, you should *not* feel responsible for diagnosing or figuring out how serious this person is.  Your responsibility is to report it and let professionals find out how serious he was.

Sorry, it's a tough situation but if he turns out not to have been serious about shooting others, he isn't going to shoot you too.  On the other hand, if you think he's serious enough to shoot you, it's just as likely he's serious about shooting others.

You've got to tell someone, just be sure you're in a safe place to do so.

Good luck, and I hope you'll let us know what happened afterwards.

PS.  If you want to read more about why kids end up doing this, there's a decent article here:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/29/aurora-shooting-what-does-a-killer-think.html

Report him. My school recently had a bomb threat. If a brave kid had'nt had reported the kid who made the threat, part of the cafeteria and the lives of at least 20 kids would be gone.   

You absolutely have to report it. If you don't, I will since we went to the same high school.

Do you think he's serious about it?  Has he told you when and where he's going to do it or is he just in a really shitty mood and is blowing off steam?

Is there someone you can talk to about it?  Parents, teachers, a school counsellor?

Edit: I hope you don't mind but I put a link to this in AskReddit to get more advice.  It's at http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xqy08/my_friend_is_saying_hes_going_to_shoot_up_the/


He is pretty serious.. He knows when & who hes going to shoot. Its awile from now since we are still in summer here but I don't want to tell authoritys even tho its probably the best thing to do.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa6c3OTr6yA

Definitely report him to the school authorities and police, seeing as this is a credible threat. Not only will you be helping the people in your school, but you will also be helping him, as he'll probably be admitted into some sort of therapy in which he can vent all of his negative feelings to someone who can help him. Also, when you report him, don't forget to mention the threat he made to you, it is important that you protect yourself as well.

Just do the one thing you CAN do that will come out with a GOOD result: 
CALL THE POLICE!

This^ when people threaten to do shit like this, or commit suicide... you have to take it seriously

Did they actually find a bomb..

Please don't.. What will the school do to him if I tell.. Will he know it was me..

Well, it's one of those things you have to do even though you don't want to do it.


They found bomb making parts at his home.

What the hell do you think they will do? Come on dude, act your age now. This isn't something to joke around with. If he seriously said something, you absolutely need to speak to the police.

It doesn't matter who reports him. Odds are, police will take him into custody and have him evaluated by a psychologist or psychiatrist.

I need advice, I'm desperate because I had never had such a situation before... And I sincerely would appreciate someone who could tell me what to do in this scenario. It may sound childish, but it's a deep wound for me.
Backstory: on October last year I started going out with this girl (who was a friend of mine, and my reduced circle of friends) and I had a great time. Things were fun for me, and I got to spend lots of good memories with her. I was happy enough, but noticed some discomfort in her behavior when trying to be a couple with her. She always excused herself in the ""I don't know how to express my emotions"" scheme, and I bought it. I must admit that at this time I had some depression and was toxic to her at times, but tried always to correct myself from that. And also, she dumped her problems with me, to which I tried my best to help her, as I thought that is what a good couple does. Time passed and she became more cold with me, until she broke up with me on December. I was really disheartened because of my low self esteem, thinking that it was my fault for not being enough for her. Yet, we remained as friends.
Later, in a friendly talk (I remained interested in her, despite knowing she might not) she explicitly told me that the reason she broke up with me was because she was interested in another guy (I don't know who, maybe one of her old friends) and that she was really confused at the time, so she decided to break up to clarify her mind. I reacted surprised and upset at this, but decided to still give a shot to the girl as I profoundly wanted to be with her.
This lead to us coming back on February, now with a more mature me knowing more about her attitude and what I didn't like. The first days came good, but as soon as we reached the first week she went back to her old shitty attitude. I still liked her but craved for attention and affection. One day she told me in one of the ""she dumps her shit on me"" talks we had, that she had manipulated one of her close friends deliberately, and kind of non regretful. This was kind of a red flag, but I couldn't or didn't pay attention at the time.
Later on I got fed up with our relationship, but decided I could still give it a shot if we were willing to change. So, I told her about what was I uncomfortable with, and what I needed, and so did she. Not even one day passed before she texted me asking to explain myself, because appearently my talk wasn't clear enough for her, even though I tried to make it the clearest possible. Just two days after that she came back with a response saying that ""she understands, but doesn't know what to do"" thing. I just said that it would be fine as long as she did something. Which happened. For a day. Just one day.
And, at this point my heart was stabbed. It had happened not just once, nor twice, but THREE TIMES. I ended our lovers relationship, but said that we should continue friendship (as I have a limited group of friends, losing one is devastating).
This last part happened over a month ago.
Oh, I forgot to mention that we also had talks where she would start talking toxically, and this time I was more severe and just told her what I considered the truth, but in a harsh way.
The story: during this month I have found out a lot of things about the relationship, about myself and I grew to like another girl (one of our mutual friends). I thought of my ex mature enough to understand that we would just be friends. So I told her that I started liking someone (I didn't tell her who, not to hurt her... This recoiled later). And... After some days, she texted me telling me that she wanted not to be friends with me anymore. She didn't state why, but I accepted it. I asked if it was because I told her I liked someone else, and she immediately went berserk on me. She jumped on my throat, telling me all my flaws, calling me a motherfucker for having played with her feelings, and treating her badly. To which I exploded and told her all I felt. All the resentment I had, I spoiled it all over her face. She told me that she still liked me, and I couldn't buy it at all... And then... She gave me a very hard blow. She stated that this was the end of all forms of relationship with me, and said that it will be my fault what will happen to our friends... And, as they're the only ones I have... I fear that I might be left alone again. And I'm scared of that, and I feel guilty for it... Can someone tell me what to do in this scenario? I can't bear with it",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/bnubv2/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,2,"Toxic exs' are some of the worst gremlins to deal with, you can't feed them without getting more grief, they are basically the creepers of irl, ticking before they blow.

They key to a successful relationship is communication. Your intuition may be correct, or you may just be letting your insecurities get the best of you; it's hard for someone who doesn't know you to say. However, you can find out by simply confronting your girlfriend about it. 

Don't acuse her; simply confess that you have insecurities, and that you are worried that she may be hiding something, and that you know that they're probably unfounded byt they are still worrying. Maybe make it seem more like it's your fault than hers, even if you don't really believe that.

I’ve been in two online relationships that have both failed and can’t seem to get over either boy 100% and wish they could both still be in my life. The thought of not having my most recent ex (M18) seems to bother me so much more than it did when I broke up with the first boy, and I don’t understand why? Was that actually love? Was I just attached? Is love just an attachment and have I ever felt real love? 

I feel asthough Im an idiot for caring about these two boys that I met through a game so much, like I care about them more than I care about myself even now that neither are in my life. Todays the first time since the begining of the year that I’ve really felt alone and I think its because valentines day just passed but even then, I shouldn’t feel so unhappy in my own company on a normal Saturday. 

My life consists of: 
- being alone in my room
- listening to music 
- smoking weed 
- writing stupid stories on my computer
None of these things have particularly helped with my mood swings, how uphappy i am or my social anxiety and probably never will. But it stops me from thinking sometimes which is nice. I stop thinking about my exes. I stop thinking of how much of a disappointment I am (for example today I over slept and missed my job interview). I stop thinking about wanting to be dead so Im not in anyones shot at happiness. And thats how I’ve always been. 

I saw CAMHs the other week which didn’t help at all (I went about 3 years ago after attempting suicide but that time was much worse, I couldnt get a word in). Since then I haven’t gone to college because honestly I dont know. 
I feel asthough my friends are disappointed in me for not coming in and asking to link. I feel asthough my family’s disappointed in me because I cant get to college, because I over sleep, because I cant sleep at night. 

All I want to do is be happy and the only time Im happy is when Im with someone. I rely on someone to make me happy and I dont know how to get out of that. Before its too late and I’m completely lost and gone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f4hkb5/why_do_i_f16_find_it_difficult_to_be_happy/,4,"Okay so we literally have the same life lol. Although I prefer online dating because people judge you on your personality first rather than your looks. But of course once I start dating them I want to meet them in person right away or later when we’re both ready. But anyways I’m only ever happy with my boyfriend or when I’m alone. I was diagnosed with mild depression. It helps to talk to people about it. I’m still having trouble talking to people or finding a therapist.

It's tempting to let yourself wallow in sadness. When things aren't going our way, we try to spite the world by being miserable, by refusing to enjoy life- even in our happy moments, we let ourselves get bogged down by the fact that things could be better. We tell ourselves that, once we have a boyfriend or girlfriend, once it's summer time, once we can finally move out, we'll finally obtain happiness. Happiness actually begins when you realize that you've been lying to yourself.

Everything that you need to be happy, you already have. Just LET yourself enjoy things. Learn to recognize the beauty in everything. You might be walking to school in the cold, but it sure is beautiful watching it go from nighttime to dawn. You might not have a boyfriend, but hey, the girl sitting next to you in Spanish class seems pretty open to conversation, and it felt pretty awesome when she laughed at that stupid joke you muttered under your breath after the teacher went on a rant about something dumb. You said you listen to music? Branch out, allow yourself to find music that RESONATES with you, that makes you feel something, and make that the soundtrack of your life. Never not be listening to music.  You said you write stupid stories; but they aren't stupid, you enjoy them. Work on them, commit to a bigger project. Put a limit to how much time in any given day you can 'waste' (browsing YouTube, tik-tok, Reddit...). Instead, use that time to read, or learn, or write, or start taking walks or learn art of some kind.

Buy a journal and write all the good things that happen to you each day. If you can't stand to be alone, become an extrovert. Be as nice to possible to everyone, even if they're a little fake. Go out of your way to start conversations with strangers at school. Text people first. Join online chats. Ask people to hang out even if you don't know them super well-being don't just say ""wow, we should hang out sometime!"" and never follow up. Say ""we should hangout sometime!"" and if they say ""Yeah, we should"", say ""okay, how about we head to Canes/ GoodWill/ Starbucks/The mall/ The movies/ the ice cream store/ The park after school?""

I know it feels like life is horrible. I know what it's like to be alone and desperate to connect with someone. But I started using these startegies in November, and let me tell you, my life has quadropled in quality. More than anything else, the key is positive thinking- even if things truly are bad, with the right attitude, you can still find happiness.

I saw CAMHs and they’re going to try get me to see a sleep therapist and into an anxiety group (from what was said at the meeting anyway) but the closer I get with people the less Im able to talk about things and get help? so im scared that thats going to happen if that is whats going to happen.",2020-02-16 07:16:36
271,ehfing,False,,1,I need help with life,AdviceForTeens,I’m a high school freshman and I need help. I don’t want to come off as being whiny but I’m having struggles with school and family. At school I’m commonly referred or grouped with the edgy or emo kids. I don’t want to be in this group of people. I like the color black and I guess that is a problem for most others not sure why. I have a crush on this girl but I know she doesn’t like me back. The only times she has acknowledged me is just to say hi because she has to be my partner. The problem with my home life is that I was expected to even as little kid to be the saving grace of my family. I was supposed to be the smart one and pass all of school work with flying colors. My dad and mom are divorced and constantly trying to dish out dirt on each other. Another problem is that I have a very big anger problem it’s not uncontrollable it’s just that if I get mad enough I’ll start yelling and crying and punch shit until I calm down. My family thinks poorly of me because of it and my mother has told that one day when they were talking (my parents) my dad said that he was worried I was going to be a school shooter. I cried over that because I thought I knew my dad but I know he said that for a damn fact even if it was from my mom. I depresses me thinking about the different possibilities as to why people don’t like me or acknowledge me. My brother also hated my guts when we were kids and would constantly bully me and try to make me look bad in front of everyone that we knew. These things have gotten to me so much that the main reason I think people even try to be nice to me is because they think I’m going to shoot up the school and they don’t to be target caught in the crosshairs. Thank you if you read till the end I really need some help if you have anything that could help please let me know.,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ehfing/i_need_help_with_life/,3,"I would try going to some clubs or events so that you could meet people similar to you, they could understand you and you could make new friends. Conserving the girl, I would go after her if you really like and think she is worth it. Or try to move on if you think that it won’t work out and is a waste of time. (You’ll have other crushes, and crushes on people who like you back so I would let that bug you too much). I would try mindfulness or meditation for the anger because it might help. Or you could find a sort of thing that helps you feel better when you feel like that. For example if chocolate makes you feel better carry  some chocolate on you. If you have a favourite song sing that. I do it with ‘Another Love’ Tom Odell and it works. As for your family I would try talking to them and giving them a chance to understand you. I would try being more you around them so that they got to know the real you! Be confident with who you are in these situations.

122,c72z5q,False,,6,Help! My parents are always on my crazy little brother’s side,AdviceForTeens,"Here is a little background: I am 14 and have straight a’s. I have a little brother who is only 5 and has temper problems. He gets mad on the slightest things I do. For example, today, I was eating my breakfast and my little brother was watching a video on a laptop. He then said “Wow this is my favorite episode” in Armenian. I looked over to see a glimpse of what his favorite episode was and then he started screaming and closed the laptop really hard. He quickly ran to my mom who saw everything and started telling her about how I peered at his laptop. My dad quickly came and picked him up and said “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR BROTHER CRY?!” My baby brother was still yelling and crying in frustration and my mom was also very disappointed at me and said to my dad to take me to my Granparents house. I started telling them that I did not do anything bad and that my brother was screaming for no reason. They did not listen to me and my dad said “ok, if you are going to be like this for the whole summer, we will take you to summer school!” And then I said “if you do that, I will fail every class.” Then he got mad and I went to my bedroom in frustration. See, this happens every day and I am done with it. Please give me advice on how to solve this problem and why my parents are always on my brothers side.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/c72z5q/help_my_parents_are_always_on_my_crazy_little/,5,"I think the best way to solve this is by talking to your parents. Tell them how you feel that they are never on your side. You can also try to explain your side better. They might not see that you are doing nothing wrong, so if you explain it then maybe they will understand better. 
I’m not very good at typing things out so my advice might sound weird but I hope this helps.

this is similar to me. My brother has been diagnosed with dyspraxia and fine motor skills. He’s REALLY sensitive and does exactly the same thing. If I retaliate I always get the blame. What I would do is just walk away. If your brother suddenly cries just say “I did nothing” and walk away to a quiet place and let your parents deal with it. I recommend you go and see someone if he has trouble controlling his anger. My brother had random fits and rages too, he’s 10 and I’m 13 so it’s quite an awkward age.. . Yeah advice up here.

Ok thanks 👌

Thank you very much! I will try this the next time he gets mad and see if it works. My parents think he is too young to go to a physiologist and they think that the reason he gets mad is because he can’t put his frustration into words. However, he does talk and he talks well. It might also be the age, but he threw things all over the floor when he was 2, 3 and 4 years old. Thanks anyway, and I will definitely try what you said.

yeah it can be quite difficult but the best thing is just to walk away. :))

So me and this guy met on Twitter, we had a shared interest in the same band so we started talking and it was going well. We talked about our favourite songs and general stuff about the band and other interests. We got onto the topic of where we lived and we realised we were somewhat close to each other, so we decided to meet up. 

So we met up and all was well, we talked about a bunch of things, walked around etc, eventually we got to this secluded place and just had a deep conversation and then things got pretty intimate pretty fast and the next thing you know we were having sex. 

Afterwards i walked him back to the bus stop and as we where going through where i lived he commented about how it looked like a military base, he then talked about how he was going to Uni and then going to join the military or something. I was kind of internally freaking out at that point because i thought he was around my age (15-16) and not 18+.

Yeah. That seems like a better option but how do I forget someone whose smile can brighten my whole day up..

Dude, you really have a crush on her....

Anyway, I think that you need to be reliable ON YOURSELF, because its times like these that our ability of being resilient enough comes into effect. I'm an introvert too. But in my case, I fucking shit myself when I talk to a girl. Over the years I have learned that, in the end, it just comes down to you and a handful of loyal people from your life. But I think the main lesson is to be prepared for this type of shit. Prepared of being abandoned/seperated from your freinds and prepared of being self-reliable or alone. This world is full of scumbags and assholes, I realized this much later in my life. But enough about me, you need to forget her. You just mentioned it, that she is more intimate with her boyfriend than with you. There are plenty of other girls, why can't  you just accept the truth and move on??? Find yourself another girl.

Can you ask her out while being alone with her (eg. At the time of a break, in your class when your and her friend aren't there)?

If you can't, does your friend know you like her? Is he a total douche? Is he your best friend? If he is, tell him you want to ask her out and ask him to let you and a girl you like to be alone (but don't ask him to do that in front of her of course :) )


Do not ask her out via messages, except if you have to.

All the partys I go to play shit music, even though I'm not shunned for what I like, I am still frowned upon when I mention it. For example, I love old video games and nintendo. Everyone in my school always talks about the new games that are coming out and when I mention A game such as sonic generations, they all just laugh and say things like ""why don't you go suck sonics dick?0"" I usually reply with another insult and we get into a friendly insult fight. I also don't listen to mainstream music, Infact the only ""real"" band I listen to is the beatles. Most of the time I listen to video game music. Which again I am frowned upon for. I am not really one to get depressed but whenever I think about this I start to get abit sad. Anyone else feel this way? Also, any advice on how to deal with this decaying culture?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/vwjyh/im_sick_of_this_culture/,5,"I love the beatles and all oldie type of bands all the way into the 40's but I dislike almost everything now

I completly agree. The music & video games we play now a days are complete shit. The music is just awful. Rap, Dubstep. I mean theres the occaional good rap and or dubstep song but those are rare & dont end up going mainsteam. & I agree with you with the video games. I LOVE Legend Of Zelda Ocarina Of Time. Best video game ever. Now kids just play cod & fight over stupid stuff. The community is so mean I cant have fun. I really wish our culture took a different turn.

I know right. I hate Eminem and ymcmb. I wish that everyone would brighten up a bit. I don't want a world full of geniuses or nothing interesting ever happening, but u don't hav 2 talk lik this. 

I always think of it this way. No matter what year you look at there was always bad things. Go back to when the beatles were popular. There were other bands who were higher on charts than the beatles. There are good things about these days just as there are bad things. Focus on the good! Use what you connect to as a passion for your future. If you love something pursue!

Wow, I was expecting tons of hate from this! Thanks for all the support guys!

You aren't obligated to enjoy something just because it's mainstream.  Someone's choice of music or video games is completely subjective. You can't complain about someone else's tastes, because you aren't forced to be around them. Find new friends who enjoy the same things you do!

You've probably found a lot of friends who don't frown on you just for liking different things :) Just immerse yourself around people who don't mind the things you like. Never think that you're alone.... It may just be most of those around you enjoy a lot of mainstream culture. Look around in different cities, states even, and you'll find a lot of people like you! 

we had a trivia contest and a few things happened:
1)The teacher did not know when WW2 started (he thought the War started in 1942 when it started in 1939) but i guess that's American ignorance
2)People didn't know who the vice president is. But as soon as the question came up ""Who got kicked off Jersey Shore in Season 2?"" people answered within one second

I also feel like my partner is doing things to spite me to make me feel like shit, he knows I’m up and down I’ve spoke to him and asked him to bare with me whilst I try to deal with how up and down I am. He says he’ll support me but when it comes to it he screams at me calls me a brat, an idiot, a bitch and I honestly just feel like I’m on my own. Can someone give me recommendations to try to manage my emotions please? Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eh6hps/why_do_i_feel_like_this/,4,"Obviously somethings wrong so I’d say to just take it one thing at a time. Try to clear your head first. For me, I do that by working out and playing sports. If that’s not your kind of thing, learn something new. Then, I’d personally suggest breaking up with your SO. If that’s how they’re treating you now, they won’t treat you any better when your happy and definitely not when you’re sad. Other than that, just do some self care. Talk with friends, go out for a girls night out or go to brunch with friends or something like that. NO DRINKING. Alcohol is a depressant and will make you feel worse. Get outside. If you have a dog, take them for a walk. If there’s something within reasonable distance to you, go for a hike, ride a bike or go camping with friends, build a fire and have fun, living in the moment. You can worry about stuff in the long life you have ahead of you.

i’m not too sure how to help you manage your emotions better, but i can for sure say that your significant other is not being supportive whatsoever and that is a deal breaker. As you SO your mental health should be a big concern to them and if your struggling and they’re making that struggle even harder, you better off without them. I’m not saying break up right away, but if they continue to scream at you after you tell them it’s an issue it should become an option you start thinking about. You and your mental health should always come first in your life

I bet you would feel a lot better right away if you dump your abusive boyfriend. The way that he talks to you and those names that he calls you are abusive and wrong. there's nothing wrong with being emotional, we are humans and we all have emotions. It's how our body communicates with us to tell us something is wrong. I think in this instance the first thing you can do is dump that boyfriend.

Wow I didn’t expect a response but your reply blew me away. Thank you. You are spot on!! I’ve not been to the gym at all in the last 6 months and been finding any excuse to just ‘have a lazy day’ which is good sometimes but shows I’ve lost motivation to want to go to the gym. I will definitely start up again because I do remember how good I felt when I used to exercise frequently. It’s crazy because it’s obvious on how to try and feel better but becomes so hard to see any way out of this bit of darkness at the moment. Regarding the S/O, we’ve been together 3 years and generally he’s amazing. Maybe if I do start doing my own things again and getting myself back on track, I’ll be able to see more clearly if he is actually part of the problem. He’s a pain in my ass but I love him but if it’s the case he’s feeling low, I do everything I can to make his life easier and show him he’s loved and appreciated, just wish he was more evident with it to me.

You didn’t do anything wrong. You can’t help how you feel about someone.

You could try talking to him and letting him know that just because you don’t like him in that way doesn’t mean you don’t care about him. Tell him that you really do value your guys’ friendship.

He’ll come around eventually. He probably just has to process how he’s been feeling. I’d suggest maybe giving him some space for a few days; and then I’d reach out if you don’t hear anything from him.

His mom probably said to him to get away from you, or he feels rejected. Either way you should massage him to see how's he doing. Clear things up and invite him for a round of COD, y'all will be fine.

He was most likely being friendly to you hoping to be in a relationship. Men are not really interested in friendships with women. Pretty much the only time they approach women is to date them. It sucks but that's how the world works. I'm not saying there aren't exceptions, but it's good to know this. I say don't try to approach him, because it will do no good when he's clearly not interested in friendship.

Thank you for replying :) I’ve tried talking to him, but he just gives me weird looks and makes an excuse to walk away. I’ll try giving him some space. It’s kind of hard though, because he’s in 4 of my classes ._.",2020-02-27 23:15:05
434,ebjl09,False,,8,How do u overcome self hate?,AdviceForTeens,I have almost no interest in living In almost 16 and I feel like a loser. I can’t even be around people my age. I’ve been treated really bad by class mates since the 3rd grade. I was a really happy kid. I feel like a complete disappointment. I don’t have talents. I’m probably the most average person. I haven’t been to school in 2 months I went to a psychiatric hospital. I feel so alone. I’m more scared of life than I am of death. I feel so worth less,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ebjl09/how_do_u_overcome_self_hate/,2,"hey bb i just turned 17 today and trust me i have been there and back and then there again and back again probably 5 times and ive helped a lot of people through similar situations ig so im gonna try to address this the best i can. 

1) with the whole problem finding people u feel comfortable around, i get it. honestly for most of my life i felt like i didnt have anyone at all to trust or talk to but you have to wait it out and trust in allah or the universe or satan or whatever you believe in is gonna send good friends ur way eventually. this is hard and sometimes it feels impossible to look into the future and see urself having a good support group but you’ve gotta hang in there and trust that it will happen.

2) this is kinda two parted addressing talent. first of all, theres nothing wrong with being “average”. its certainly better than being below average. its okay to not be outrageously talented at anything. that doesnt make you a disappointment. that doesnt make you worthless or undeserving or bad. talent is not the price you have to pay to exist in this world. you are you and that is good enough. also, whats stopping you from becoming talented? go out there, put on some running shoes, pick up a skateboard or paintbrush or guitar. you dont have to be the best at something but i promise that anything you put your mind to and practice you will become pretty damn good at, its 10% talent and 90% determination that will make someone good.

3) its okay to not have hope or believe that it will get better. ive been in that place in life (tbh im in one of those places now) where its so hard to see the future getting better and you just want to lay in bed and never wake up. but you gotta get out of bed and allow it the chance to get better. you dont have to be optimistic for the future, bc that shits hard and sometimes straight up impossible. just be mildly curious about what happens next and keep letting it happen, i promise you eventually it will get better and completely overpower the bad memories, even if u dont believe it rn.

you are most definitely not worthless. there are people in this world who care about you and admire you, whether you know it or not. it could be parents or friends yah, or it could be a teacher at school who notices your talent for their subject even if u dont see it, a girl at the grocery store who saw u and thought u were cute but didnt say anything, it could be people on reddit reading your posts and empathizing with you and caring about you and worrying. you probably dont have hope right now, but you are so young and you do have time. give things time and the opportunity to get better, for friends to come into your life, for talents to develop. just keep pushing.

I really appreciate this thank you. I hope u achieve your dreams.

Also happy birthday hope it’s going well or went well depends when u read this

of course :)) you probably get this a lot but im here if you need to talk, i have helped so many people (friends and strangers) through stuff like what youre going through and it wont be the first time ive met someone through the internet and just talked about heavy shit with them so dw.

But you can just be a very feminine society puts genders on clothes, toys, etc. So here is a couple of questions you can ask yourself, well these were the kinda questions I asked myself except for a guy instead of a girl. 
Do I compare myself to females around me? 
Can I imagine myself being a girl and happy? 
I feel like you should search up more about transgender because the internet has way more information then me.

One of the trans women I know said when she was a kid, she would pray every night that she'd wake up and that ""thing"" would be gone from between her legs, because it shouldn't be there.

I think if you're uncomfortable with having a penis that's a pretty good indication.  It's also possible that you're just non-binary or gender-fluid.

Ok thank you for this its been abit confusing

Its fine ive figured it out that im transgender

Don’t worry about it, emotions can get confusing at times. All you got to do it try your best to understand them.

541,8ef8yo,False,,2,I hate my dad?,AdviceForTeens,"I really hate my dad. Its more like i have grown to not like him?

I'm the only female and middle child to an asian family. I have two brothers one older and one younger as well as half siblings (they dont live with us). My parents are still together.

My dad isnt entirely bad. he works full time to provide me with as much stuff as possible and take us on holidays and helps us learn about our asian cultures as well as other cultures. He shows that he tries and everything.

It kinda started around the start of secondary school when I realised how I felt. My dad has always been extremely controlling, he doesnt like to take anything from anyone, and hes always been strict. 

It first started off with little things, like for example, i was never allowed skirts, make up, a phone (i did for a while but not now), a boyfriend all the usual things. he used to jokingly make jokes about the not having a boyfriend when i was younger.

The thing is as i grew older I started seeking a little bit more independance, like wanting to go out with my friends without having to constantly check in like every 30 mins or being able to be trustworthy of things. By the time, I realised that my dad was already used to me being controlled in a sense? i never used to talk back to him or go against him or anything.

One example of him being controlling was my first boyfriend. i mean i realise he was stupid now, and i appreciate the concern and stuff, but the intent he had i was bothers me. a few months ago i was in a relationship with him and i intended to tell my parents. Back then i thought he was a genuinely nice guy and my parents could probably like him.

when my dad found out he immediately made me break up with him over text and smashed my phone. he blocked him on every social media and stopped me from attending the youth group that we met in. he threatened that if i didnt, he would go over there and smash his face in. it had turned out that my dad had spoken shit about me to his parents so that they would enforce this too.

obviously i was terrified and in tears, so i did as he said and i missed out about 4 months if this group and it absolutely killed me. i loved this group and the friends i made in it and all. i was so angry, but he kept explaining that its for the best, its his job to be protective and that we're in an asian house then whatever he says goes.

that was the first time that i ever said i hated him. not because of the boyfriend but because of how he handled everything.

another time was when my brother refused to go to university cause he wanted to pursue a piloting career. he made mistakes along the way but my dad was always there to shove his morale underground. he would always say shit like how he is going the wrong way and that he will never make it and things like that.

ive never accepted anyone making my brothers upset so i snapped.

i shouted how its not fair for him to be like that and he took it out on my and immediately cut off everything like internet and youth groups because i said something against his opinion

it came to the point where i packed my bags and threated (i was going to go through with it) and run away to stay at a nearby friend's house. he threated to call the police and put me into shit so i didnt go.

when it comes to arguements, he refuses to let anyone else talk. it always has to be 'his opinion is law'. ive never had freedom and its so hard to be the only kid who's never had outings with their friends, or the person whos limited on what they can wear, who they can be with and what they see.

its made me someone who is genuinely scared to let out my feelings and its so fucking shit. what do i do? am i supposed to feel this way? am i doing something wrong?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/8ef8yo/i_hate_my_dad/,2,"I don’t think you’re doing anything wrong, to be honest if feel the same as you...

13,el57eq,False,,8,How do I make existing worth it?,AdviceForTeens,"I feel unmotivated in life right now and I’m not sure if existing is even really worth it. I don’t want to die and disappoint my friends and family, I love my friends dearly. But I’m not satisfied with my life or how it’s looking to turn out. I’m not interested in marrying or having kids. Anyone have any ideas on how to make it all worthwhile?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/el57eq/how_do_i_make_existing_worth_it/,11,"Get a hobby, get good at it, and, enjoy it.

First, I'll say that you just have to keep living. Being alive and breathing when you're uninterested in anything at all is just a normal part of life. We stay alive so that we don't hurt the people who love us. I've been depressive off & on for almost my whole life but I consider sticking around in this big crappy world to be a sacrifice that I have to make to live for the people who love me. 

Second, it's important to tell you though, If you're a teen & you still live at your parents house or haven't graduated high school... you haven't even lived yet. It's much too soon for you to even be considering ending anything.

Everything you're experiencing now is a big nothing burger. Focus on growing into being a good person and just exist and evolve. It's just what you have to do to get to be an adult and do whatever you want. Focus on doing whatever makes you happiest for now. Art, sports, whatever. 

Ask yourself what you're the most afraid of trying. Like stand up comedy or something. Whatever you're the most afraid of, try it. Pick one thing that you think is awesome and then try to be an expert and get so good at it that you can be a big jerk about it if you want. It's great to be really good at something.

And honestly I know you don't want to hear this but focus and do a really good job in school. And make good grades so you can get into a great University. People get real stupid out here really fast in adultland. I mean honestly it's like disgusting how fast people become stupid after they stop going to college. 

In the end, You want to be the one who was better & smarter then everyone who was lazy and stupid. 

Also being an adult who gets to do whatever you want later will be really fun and really awesome and you can travel the world and you can meet people and you can kiss beautiful attractive people. And then you forget about all the bad feelings because you feel alive! That is the goal, it's not just to be alive it's to feel alive! 

What kind of things do you want to do that will make you feel alive?

find a passion and try to be the best person you can be. 
i struggled with the same thing and i tried being someone others enjoy having around, this meant that others essentially relied on my being alive and not isolated (like i really wanted to be)

One way is to better yourself and others. Even if you don’t want to put energy into a marriage or children, helping build yourself and others up is very fulfilling and makes it worth it, in my opinion.

I’m in the same predicament as OP (except my goal in life is to create and support a family of my own), I feel like a burden to the people I care about, and it feels as if my life is headed in a direction not worth living. I’ve been trying to decide what to do for college since freshman year of high school, now I’ve graduated and haven’t yet found out which path to pick, and it terrifies me. Could I ever achieve my dream, the ability to hold a family on the shoulders of a man who lives in a society where a college degree is the determining factor in whether or not I’m worthy of a decent job, yet not be able decide which definite path to pour more money than I’ve ever seen into, and be certain that this path that the rest of my life will ride on is one that I can sustain any joy in life under.
  I don’t really have a passion anymore, I feel alone, and I kinda just don’t want to be around anymore. I’m just kinda waiting to be hit by a truck one day while I’m walking so my parents don’t feel guilty about me making the decision to end it.
  I just think my ultimate goal is unattainable, because what woman would ever be so desperate as to care about a repulsive loser with shitty social skills, who hates himself, whose lost in life, like me.

Fox, Okay, this is going to sound crazy to you. But the way that you feel as completely normal. You're at a crossroads in your life and it's easy to get lost when you don't know which path to take. I bet that if you brought up the subject with many of your peers that you would discover that deep down they're all in the same place. They don't feel good enough. They feel like failures. They hate themselves. Very few people have it together at the stage. l have these types of fears and anxiety. You're not alone, so many people do, but it is very confusing because it feels like you're alone all the time even when you're around other people. You feel isolated and angry. It's really hard, but you really are not alone. And it really is normal for us humans to feel this way when we are going through moments of change in our life. It feels like constant inner turmoil. I felt it at 18, 25, 32. Its total crap, I won't lie but you push through. That's how we get to the next part. 

It sounds like you also have some serious anxiety, which could be serious enough that you would want to talk to a psychologist. In your circumstances, it's not unusual for anxiety and depression come together. These compounding factors can be overwhelming. The depression voice in your head is telling you how worthless you are and how life sucks, and the anxiety is amplifying everything you feel and making it worse.

I call mine ""anticipation anxiety"" or ""impending doom anxiety"" - I'm always worried about the next thing or I'm obsessing over the details of everything that could go wrong. I worry and obsess so much that I don't get anything done now because I'm worried about what might happen later. I know that sounds crazy. 
My boyfriend has a kind of anxiety that you describe too. He has shitty social skills too but I love him a lot! If you talk to someone, work on yourself and trying to figure out why you feel this way, it will definitely improve your outlook and you'll learn coping mechanisms to help.

Women are really different from men in the way they choose partners. Try not to make any assumptions about what other people would think of you before you take the risk. Life is also about getting back up. Because you're constantly going to be falling down. But that's just what it is and you are supposed to learn from it, I guess lol. people don't even know that I have such extreme anxiety because I'm really good at faking looking confident. You know that phrase ""you got to fake it to make it?

There are a lot of girls out there who want to be a wife & raise kids. I'm sure that you'll find one. Maybe spend this time focusing on your education so that you can get a good job to take care of your family on? This way you're still always working on the goal, and you'll actually be prepared when you meet her.

Do me a favor and try this exercise. When you go out and about, start holding your head up high when you walk down the street. Try to look people in the eyes sometimes and give really confident handshakes. Try to do it as long as you can and see if you feel different. Each day try a little more.

I appreciate the outlook and advice. Your perspective makes sense, and I never really thought of myself as having anxiety, but it makes sense and is true, but I never really thought of it. I feels better to have a name for way I feel. I will try and incorporate your advice into my life and mindset, thank you!

I'm glad. I wish you the best.",2020-01-07 11:02:49
304,c2wumy,False,,2,Fat shamed by someone you just occassionaly meet,AdviceForTeens,"So, this happened today. I know this guy but not as close that we can be labeled as friends just constantly fat shamed me in my face in front of some acquaintances and friends. So what I did was just ignore him the first few minutes but then I figured out it did not stop him from insulting me saying things like my face is so round and fat and that my sister is way more prettier than me and etc. And i felt so frustrated that I want to just slap him in the face. 

Then I just snapped and jokingly say I don't need his presence and walk away. It stopped him for a while, thanks to my friends who knew that I was getting frustrated they took his attention away from me. 

Reflecting, on what I did earlier made me realize that I should've handled it with respect since he triples my age but acts like a child.

What should I say the next time this happens?

213,f95fag,False,,2,Help I’m becoming an incel,AdviceForTeens,"I am 16 in junior year and it’s happening, I realize I am becoming a simp and an incel. I have come a long way though. In the last 3 years I have gone from a tiny twig to a big muscular powerlifter. I did this because I was bullied and found an outlet. But my self loathing and anxiety has all but shrunk. I have gotten nowhere romantically despite being attractive and pretty jacked. I have no confidence in myself and every time I’m not in the gym and I’m in class I feel like myself from 3 years ago, tiny and scrawny. I notice that I am starting to have simp and incel tendencies badly and my friends notice too. Everyone in my friend group is no longer a virgin. I have done literally nothing. I have discovered the “red pill” idea of being alpha but doesn’t get me anywhere, I just have what they call “red pill rage” I don’t know what parts of my behavior to change to get people to take interest in me. I want to get to know girls and see where that takes me but I cannot have conversations with them because I’m scared. Anyone who has gone through this and made it out, how did you do it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f95fag/help_im_becoming_an_incel/,3,"You might not necessarily be an incel. Incels and redpillers follow a very specific philosophy. Incels/redpillers/MGTOWs would insists they're all different but they're very much the same in that their core ideology is hating women for rejecting them and destroying society apparently, with the least number of women-haters in the redpillers, though it's about 60%.

They also tend to force their ideology on men who do not identify as such. It's crazy how much this happens, they sometimes go on random subs to 'educate' men about the nature of women. And many times the conversation goes like this:

A: ""You're an incel/redpiller/MGTOW. Come join our sub.""

B: ""But I'm not"".

A: ""Yes you are you fit the profile"".

B: ""I don't fit your profile entirely and I don't identify that way.""

A: ""Then identify that way goddamit""

Yeah they operate exactly like a cult, they don't allow fellow men to have their own opinions or feel happy. So stay away from said cult.

&#x200B;

Realise that you are not entitled to anyone's love or attention be it man or woman, and women don't reject you to make you feel bad. Realise that most people are crap. They're either too busy, too ignorant or too mean to care about you. Realise that many women who reject you wouldn't have matched with you anyway because of conflicting values. And for Christ's sake please don't hop on the 'men have it worse than women' bandwagon. That's going to drive away any woman feminist or not. Men and women are both equally oppressed and equally privileged in the Western world, and in the non-Western world, men are the privileged ones oppressing women.

Also, you can be very good-looking but girls will be put off by your personality. I have the same problem with men and people in general because I am a very anxious autistic. In fact a lot of autistics and mentally ill people don't have a dating life whatsoever. I've read many stories of these people (I guess you could call them mentalcels), who are good-looking and may go to a gym, and they get approached by people and romantic interests, but as soon as they start talking the other person is put-off because of their terrible social skills.

It's not something a lot of people can fix unfortunately. All you can do is try to improve but accept your fate.

Girls can sense insecurity and a lack of confidence. Rage isn’t attractive either. Work on your inner self before being emotionally involved with other people. Also, 16 is still very young in retrospect, there’s no need to rush your sexuality. Just enjoy the ease of being young. Also maybe read up on feminist texts, women are people too with emotions, troubles and multidimensional lives. They’re not objects or sex dolls. Treat them with respect and kindness and they’ll do the same. No one appreciates a women abuser. It’s disgusting.",2020-02-25 13:35:21

When I do she tells me she is going to take my phone away from me. When I ask her she just tells me the classic ""Because I said so."". Anyone experienced something like this or knows why she does it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f8yo3t/my_mom_wont_let_me_post_pictures_of_myself/,1,"She's probably concerned about your safety. I have a mom like this who won't let me do anything that includes talking to other people online.

Honestly, parents are really protective. It’s annoying as hell but they have experience in the world and think we can’t possibly understand anything even if they try to explain it. She’ll say because I said so because she thinks you won’t understand. It’s frustrating as hell but it be like that. If you were to sit her down and have a one on one about why she wants this, why she feels the need to pyrotechnics you from things that aren’t as scary as they seem. 

Tell her the Internet is a wide platform and that comes with harassment. It’s shitty but it’s true, but platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook know this and try their best to make it safe for all users. That’s why there are private accounts and ways to block people. But you’re growing and gonna be an adult in 3 years. It’s understandable for your parents to want to protect you, and maybe this isn’t the right time to be fighting them, but you will experience harassment of some form in this world. On the Internet is honestly the safest way because you can black and seclude yourself. I’m a 17 girl and am not nearly as much harassed as I thought I would be (or as much as my parents thought I would be). In this world harassment is normalized, especially for girls. I’m probably desensitized to an extent. They know it’s a scary world and don’t know who or what can talk to you on social media. You live in their home and go to school and stuff, so the real world is less scary to let you go in. Or it’s more scary and they are finding in outlet for a sense of control through the Internet bc they have no idea how to control the real world haha. Either way, Jsut tell them you are growing and care about your safety as much as they do, and value their wisdom about it because they do have experience, but also let them know that censoring use of the internet does nothing but frustrate you and wanna rebel more to an extent. You jsut want to naturally explore the world in a healthy way. A couple selfies ain’t going to hurt and if it is they need to set up a safe environment for you to be able to talk to them about anything that happens that is confusing. If they wait until you’re way older or out of the house you won’t have experience and won’t talk to them and that’s not what they want. 

Jsut play it by ear. You know your parents best, jsut talk to them rationally and reassure them that you care about their feelings and recognize she’s trynna protect you. But that you are trying to be a teenager in the most wholesome ways. Also, she’s shouldn’t be making you feel ashamed about yourself. Showing skin or posting selfies does not constitute harassment and telling you not to even do the most harmless things puts the responsibility on you and not the harasser. Tell her you want safe ways to be on the internet while also living your life and being happy.

Your mum sounds like a good mum. I wouldn't let my underage daughter post pics of her face or body on social media (except facebook) and I'm not even a parent. It's not the end of the world. Just stick it out until you're 18. Even then I'd still advise you not to post pics of your face anywhere other than facebook.

Well you can do what you want but she’s just being protective without explaining it well. She’s overprotective. Tbh I find people who post pictures of themselves annoying cause they all seem like they seek attention, but that’s just me. You do you.

Once you post something on social media, it can be on the internet forever.

Your mum is just looking out for you, but I completely am understanding of how irritating that would be.

Try to negotiate- tell your mum (for eg, if it was Instagram) that you'll keep all your accounts private and only people you genuinely know or trust can access them.

Mhmm....but the thing that infuriates me is that goddamn ""Because I said so."".  Also nice username.

But what do I do if she doesn't even want to talk about it. She just threatens me with taking my phone away. I lack confidence and when I take a good pic and I wanna put it on my pfp she tells me to take it down and put a quote or something. One time a put a part of the lyrics of 'She Will Be Loved' by Maroon 5 and she told me to take it down because it made me look lesbian.  






Thanks for explaining all of that btw

But the thing is I just want to add a pic of myself to my pfp.

Same for you mate

She seems really problematic in general to be honest. If she’s not willing to hear you out and is saying some homophobic stuff, sometimes they jsut don’t wanna listen. They can try their best to control you but you are living your own life and their supposed to be guiding you. From what I can see she’s jsut coming for a weird prejudice point of view. The only thing you can do is be safe and if you feel bad lying or sneaking jsut go with it until you can move out. Or if you want, buy your own phone and post it on your own time. Only thing she can take away is the plan and if you can get a job, jsut buy that too. Parents are kinda weird sometimes haha. Tbh is just sneak around. Get another account or smth 

Hope things go well for you!!

Thanks! Also one last thing. You said buy my own phone but she says that as long as i live under her roof any and everything is hers. Not even if I buy it with my own money. She can and she will take something away from me if she wants to.

Yeah that sounds controlling as fuck. Not the way to go for parents bc it doesn’t work. Jsut makes your kids not feel comfy wi Th bayou and feel like they have to hide things. I’m sorry bro! Not saying you should hide shit from your parents and lie and sneak but I kinda am 😋",2020-02-25 05:36:53
221,f6f366,False,,1,Should I or Should I Not Go on a Potentially Amazing Trip,AdviceForTeens,"Okay. I'm honestly extremely stressed out so please help me.

So every year my school goes on a trip, and I was able to attend last year's but this year's is extremely expensive -- $1,500 expensive.

The entire year I thought I wouldn't go, but my friends continued to talk about how much they wanted to go and ask why I'm not going so it started to pester me a bit.

There is an opportunity for me to hop in on the payments now, but the date is next month, and I'd have to earn it all in a month basically, instead gradually over an entire year.

There are fundraisers that we have, but it's hard to make real profit off of them. We have boxes of chocolate, but it takes a while to sell since there's 60 to a box, one box only gives $30 towards my account.

This whole trip thing stressed my mom out before we decided I wouldn't go, and now I'm bringing it up again so I feel like I'm making things worse.

I don't know how I'll be able to sell enough to really make a dent when I only earn $30 at a time, and I only have until the 22nd of next month! I went on the trip last year, and I have been where we are going now so the only new thing will be that I'm there with friends.

Can someone please tell me if this is all worth it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f6f366/should_i_or_should_i_not_go_on_a_potentially/,3,"What exactly will you be doing on this trip? How long is this trip? Are you in high school or college? Life is pretty expensive, so unless your family is upper-middle/upper class, think long and hard about the expenses.

In college and university, you'll get the opportunity to go on scholarships or study for a few months or a year abroad. It's pretty worth it because you get to spend at least 3 months abroad and you might get a stipend to cover a bit of the expenses. Plus you'd be living on your own without adults telling you what to do (cause you'll be an adult), so that means you'll feel freer, and will come back much more mature. And of course in your free time you'll be partying at clubs and pubs, going sightseeing and hanging out with friends. And you'll probably want to take a lot of pictures too and suddenly take an interest in photography.

456,do3aoy,False,,0,Is she toxic ? How do I get out of this relationship without hurting anyone ? :(,AdviceForTeens,"so I have been friends with this girl ( Y ) for quite some time . But lately our friendship has been going down the drain , It's just a buildup of some things that have been happening and have happened that I can't turn a blind eye to it anymore . Just recently it was her birthday and we wished her a happy bday but didn't buy her a cake . She did get a cake from her other friends in the next class so that night she called us out indirectly on IG saying how she would spend all of our bday and that she was naive to think that she even had a spot in our heart , she later proceeded to say she was stupid to think this friendship is real & she doesn't matter to us . She has a tendency to call people out on her social media when they're being ""unfair"" or not nice to her . From my viewpoint , I think just because we're friends doesn't mean  we're not obliged to buy her cake and she usually doesn't even split the bill when we have birthday cakes .

Another thing that really sets me off are her comments whenever I go hang out with other people than her. For example she would ask me where I'm going after school and I would reply "" oh I have plans with B ""  (my other friend) then she would say & I quote "" you bitch why do you hang out with B , you're always hanging out with ugly people . "" end quote .  Sometimes Y would say how I'm leaving her for B and how I don't care about Y anymore :( I just feel like Y expects me to be there for her 24/7 and it equals to ignoring her if i decide to hang out with my other friends . Our whole class thinks dealing with Y is a hassle and some have even told me to ignore her but it's just that she is a nice to me and we do have some good memories together but now it's too much for me to handle and sometimes I just want my own space and I can't even get that without seeing another of her post on her social media of how her friends are leaving her  . Just this week she got admitted to the hospital and she pm me saying "" just wanted to tell you i won't come to school tomorrow but never mind you don't care anyways ""

She was also asking on her social media that if she died would we have anything to tell her . When me & my other friend ( O ) paired up for an activity , Y tells me she's disappointed in me that I chose to pair up with O . These are just some of things that i'm talking about as they're more recent and the ones that really put me off . I'm just tired of all this and sometimes I do like an a\*\*hole for choosing to hang out with my other friends . I literally have no idea what to do , I somehow feel like i'm stuck in the middle with her and my other friends with no exit .",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/do3aoy/is_she_toxic_how_do_i_get_out_of_this/,2,,2019-10-28 11:10:41
254,eqra65,False,,2,I don’t know how to get out of a 3 year toxic friendship,AdviceForTeens,"So I’ve had this insanely toxic friend for about 2-3 years and I have no idea how to get out of this friendship. For safety reasons, we’ll just call her Ella. When I first became friends with Ella she was this super sweet, funny and witty girl whom I just really liked. But as I spent more time with her I started noticing how she’d get annoyed whenever I was hang out with other people. She’d make it obvious that she was angry at us whenever we hung out with someone else or whenever I hung out with the other girl in our friend group (let’s call her Anne) and the next day Ella would act mad at us. It’s like everytime I make a a new friend she find something she can pick at so I’ll stop being friends with that person. Ella always talks about how she’s the ‘most disliked person of the friend group’ when Anne and I really do everything we can to please her and keep her happy. Ella talks so openly about how much she hated me and how dumb she thought I was and how boring I am and acts like it’s all funny. I auditioned to go to my dream school and told her how excited I was, the only thing she could talk about is how if I got in I would be leaving her a few months before she moved and how I was ‘abandoning’ her for some other school. She was so happy when she heard I didn’t get in the school. Ella would point out things she hated that people did and then state how I did it. I tried to leave the friendship once and just hung out with other people for a day while she was giving me death stares and she started crying so the counsellor had to get involved and I had to lie about why I was hanging out with other people and say I was just hanging out with other people rather than I was trying to get out of this toxic friendship. She brings that up all the time and talks about how she’ll never forgive me for that when she’s hurt me so many more times and I just pretend it never happened and that I’m completely fine. Every fight we’ve had she’s started, every fight is always about how she’s dissatisfied with me and I always apologise for it and tell her I won’t hang out with that person again and I’ll make sure to not sit or hang out with other people at lunch. Ever since I’ve been friends with her every time I hang out with someone else (despite asking her if she wants to come along to) we have a fight every time from her thinking I prefer them over her. I only sit with her and Anne at lunch now. It’s mentally draining being friends with her and being her ‘therapist’, having be there for her 24/7 and having to listen to her talk bad about me to my face and apologising to her. Every time we hang outside of school I’m always upset. My family is so tired for me and just wants me to leave the friendship. They’ve tried telling me what I can do but nothing really works, I can’t speak to them about her anymore because they just don’t want to hear about her. And it’s so confusing because she can be so sweet and funny and happy and I think about how I could ever want to leave this friendship but then the next day she just starts a fight with me for no reason. I want to go to the school counsellor but I’m scared the counsellor’s gonna confront Ella about it and Ella’s gonna spread lies and make everyone hate me. So for right now, I’m just waiting till she leaves this school. She’s leaving in about 4-5 months.

231,f0c2iv,False,,2,I’m reluctant to talk with my parents about personal matters,AdviceForTeens,"Female in high school from asian family. I have complicated feelings towards my parents. The way they parent and speak to me I find really harsh. But I’m always so unsure of myself and I can’t distinguish wether it’s actually them or I’m actually stupid and they’re right. But that’s not the main problem I’m coming to reddit for.. I’ll give some background info first...

They would always say things along the lines of: “Are you even going to graduate?” “Why would you take an AP class it’s too hard for you” or stuff where I’m trying to have a normal conversation and they always turn it into how I need to just focus on school. I wish they’d trust me and realize that their choice of words is not encouraging, I find it rather insulting. This is something that I’ve brought up many times before but it’s like they hear me, but don’t listen to how hurt I feel. My mom in particular gets somewhat offended when I get sad or depressed. When I’m sad or depressed she gives me this disdainful look like “Really?“ And she tells me just to be happy and it’s all in my head. And somehow manages to make it about herself like “it’s always my fault” and “no matter what we do you’ll always be unhappy so what’s the point in trying anymore”

There was a particular moment in middle school in which my grades weren’t particularly good but they definitely weren’t close to failing. My mom came into my room at night while I was sleeping and was screaming at me and scolding me for having such bad grades. I was sobbing and kept telling her to get out and she wouldn’t for what was probably like 20 minutes but it felt like forever. Ever since then I’ve always locked my door and I refuse to let anyone into my room. That moment is always something that really messed with my head, until this day.

I was trying to express to my dad how depressed I was feeling and my mom came downstairs. I was crying and shaking and when I get like that I want to throw up. I didn’t want to talk to her because of the way she speaks to me. I brought up the time she came into my room just to express how stupid I’m being and she claims she doesn’t remember. I tell her it’s not something I would ever make up and she just interrupted me saying that she would never do something like that. That memory is so vividly engraved in my head and it’s honestly so frustrating.

Asking for advice on how to deal with this? I’m really struggling to figure out what to do about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f0c2iv/im_reluctant_to_talk_with_my_parents_about/,3,"My mom is the exact same way.

I'm related to a nationwide known politician, who was recently accused of fraudulent money handling, and while there's no hard evidence that shows this (atleast according to the court proceeding), my classmates have started bullying me thinking that I've benefited from corruption. 

What scares me even more is that people think that my accomplishments (ie. high grades, math competition wins etc.) are due to systemic nepotism done by my relative. It seems like it bars me from taking pride in any of my accomplishments.

Even though I try to bring up my case in defense of my relative, they scoff and think that I'm just biased. It's like that one accusation had already made it seem like it happened. 

The thing is, it's like I'm being blamed for something my relative ALLEGEDLY did. And what even scares me the most is if the accusations are true (which is possible but improbable).

Preface:

My friend has had a very troubled life. I've known him a long time. 

To be honest we're just friendly acquaintances but we went to the same elementary school, and ended up in the same middle school and high school (there's a lottery to get in). 


He has a really shitty family life, and he's a closeted gay person who also pimps himself out to old guys for money. The counselor and a few other people know about it. He says some kids at school said something about him to the principal and it could ruin his life. If it does, he says he might kill those people and then himself.

He would also kill himself if I reported him.

I'm not really sure where to go from here. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/6eqz38/friend_talking_about_shooting_school/,3,"Call the police. This is bigger than you should be dealing with. Please. 

Thats definitely information to tell the police so they know how to handle the situation. The police are trained to deal with scenarios like this. If you don't and he does something, you will regret it and others will suffer.

Speaking out is a cry for help and if you are not in a position to help your friend which at your age you are not fully equipped to do (based on the magnitude of the situation) then it is best to report this to the authorities so that your friend gets the help that they need. Your friend is putting you in a position where no matter what you do, the decision will affect someone else or other people in a big way and that is difficult. However, if you do not act and something happens anyway, the repercussions will be far reaching.....

I've decided to schedule an appointment with my school counselor tomorrow.

His mind is in a seriously bad place... help him focus... tell him that he's always welcome to vent talking to you & when the kettle is boiling he should give ya a call... be open for his crazy thoughts but tell him openly he shouldn't accept those thoughts and neither should you! Tell him to pimp himself out to decent guys for money ;) Lol... im not kidding, if he's going to do it, tell him it shouldn't be sleazebags who he's pimping himself to. It'll get him to be the most notorious ho of the neighborhood and get lots of respect!

a) not okay for someone to push you to have sex. ever. under any circumstances.

b) not okay to use someones emotional distress like if you see theyre crying or upset its not okay to use that to manipulate them into giving you what you want

im sorry but these are red flag behaviors and she needs to break up with him. she probably wont until she sees for herself just how bad it is and itll probably get 10x worse than you think it should before she sees it but the best thing you can do for her is to be there as a friend and make sure she knows shes supported by you and youll be there for her in case she ever *cough* needs it. also try your best to show her that that kind of behavior is not okay and she deserves better treatment, but again she probably wont listen and in that case do the first thing i suggested.

Happened to my current girlfriend a while ago by her ex. This kind of manipulative behavior is unacceptable and i would classify this incident as rape.
I would urge her to end the relationship because it typically evolves into physical and sexual abuse on a regular basis. In the end the beat thing for her will be if you lay out the facts for her and tell her your opinion and let her come to a conclusion herself. This will most likely help her move on quicker and give her closure.",2019-12-17 23:52:57
686,eh2nnm,False,,1,My “best” friend has been ignoring me.,AdviceForTeens,"My “best” friend has been ignoring me

Me and my best friend have been friends for 4 years, we took her to see a concert for Panic At The Disco for her 16th birthday. She was my friend when I stopped seeing my father and has been there for me. Over the summer I took her to counseling (which my mom payed for) because she was self harming and super depressed. That was in June. 

She moved away to Baltimore and has been doing A LOT better, she’s not depressed, not self harming and recovering from an eating disorder. 

In August we got into a HEATED argument over what I’m going to tell you today. And we stopped talking for two months. 

Recently she hasn’t been texting me. She’s been ignoring me and leaving me on read, she doesn’t text me unless she has something to talk about. Any time I have something to talk about it’s always “that’s nice/cool/good” or if I’m sad “I’m sorry” and then change the subject. When SHE is having problems I try to come up with solutions to her problems and when she’s excited about something I try to act excited also. 

She’s stopped referring to me as her best friend and only her friend whereas I call her my best friend. 

Last night I texted her this: 
“i love you and I know you probably don’t but I do and I don’t want to ever lose you again so I’m gonna keep fighting to keep you in my life even if you don’t want to be in my life anymore I’ll still fight to keep you in it because I love you so much and you’re my best friend even if I’m not yours” (I copied and pasted it) and she left me on read and hasn’t answered me. But she’s been sending me Tik toks all day through the app. 

I know people can grow apart, it just hurts so much when you’ve done so much for someone, spend hundreds on them (she used to spend weekends with us because her parents kicked her out and we’d take her out to eat a lot. Which my mom couldn’t afford any ways.) and it feels like it’s all thrown away. 

Please help me. What do I do? I don’t want to loose her. I’m just scared of confronting her about it because I know she’ll get mad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eh2nnm/my_best_friend_has_been_ignoring_me/,1,"I would give her time reply, maybe she say but was just busy? I know it’s not nice to grow apart so you could try texting first instead. FaceTiming could work even better because then you wouldn’t have that awkward feeling when there is nothing left to say , conversations would flow better that way. I would keel fighting if you want her in your life (you did right by sending her that text). But remember you shouldn’t hold on if it hurts too much, there are many people who would value you better as a friend! It’s fine to keep fighting but don’t let this consume you! You need to remember to respect your self. Try to find common bonds between you two if you want to rekindle. But if that won’t work mourn : Pinterest, chick flicks , sad movies and chocolate are a good part of that. And then move on if it is making your heart hurt to much. Make room for more people to enter you heart. Talk to her fully explain everything that you feel to her so that you wouldn’t have regrets in the future! Regretting not explaining your emotions fully to her will feel even worse!!!",2019-12-29 14:24:38
166,en0sp4,False,,4,i cant do this anymore,AdviceForTeens,"
i got a crush on a girl from my class. Yeah we are friends but i can get better at talking more

anyways.. i am thinking of telling her that i love her. (we have been in the same class since August and i have loved her since the first look at her)

But im so afraid of losing her. What is she talks less to me after that? That question actually keeps me up every night so i lose sleep.

if i tell her, i would say it around 30th of January or early February. i dont wanna do it the day before winter break cause i cant deal with all the thoughts while being home.

SO LISTEN FROM HERE PLEASE: (important)

i might be leaving the school in June if i choose to be a hairdresser/barber.

i CAN stay if i choose interior designer.

That job choice will be taken March 1st. and thats when we have winter break. So im really confused what to do.

Thats also the reason i wanna confess before the winter break so if it goes bad i can just choose to leave...

But i wanna become her close friend, what if she gets a boyfriend?

	⁃	if she actually says YES, im still not allowed by my parents to go outside after school or come home late... is that ok? But she most likely will say no.
Okay we can stay as friends but she might talk less to me.

When i think about it.. relationships are stress anyways.. i have given her HINTS like giving her christmas gift and stuff

BUT I GOTTA talk more i guess, the question still comes back though, do i ever confess?

She is single... its 1 am i hope you can help",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/en0sp4/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,3,"I think that you should just go for it, even if she says no, it’d be better if she knew how you felt than you just bottling it up to yourself because that way you’re both getting somewhat hurt.

EDIT: sorry for the late reply 😅😅

i have thought about it for 15 hours

and you are RIGHT

thats exactly the decision i came to

Agreed never bottle it up I’ve dealt with the same thing you have to tell her how you feel or if you don’t you will regret it for the rest of your life I missed my opportunity before and I regret it every second of every day and I’m still single and always tell the person how you feel because any second something bad could happen and you may never see the people you love again. Life is short and sometimes it’s just dumb luck you find the girl of your dreams and you can’t miss this opportunity and when you ask say” I hope this doesn’t affect anything if you say no because I really like being around you. “Good luck with everything because I always hope people find love because life is way better if you can experience it with someone

643,eq9nn9,False,,0,To Teenagers in a Toxic Relationship,AdviceForTeens,"Hi. I would like to share my story of my toxic relationship. I am creating this post to inspire people who know deep down they need to leave a relationship but think they don't have the courage, or think they will regret it. 

I currently will be turning 20 next month (I'm female). when I was 17, I started dating this guy. I was really into him. 

Soon enough, he began telling me things to make me jealous. he would tell me when he thought girls were attractive, he told me there was a cute girl in his class that he considered being with instead, and that there was a girl in another class who would always stare at him and that he began to have feelings for her but was ""fighting it off."" he told me I had to be more enthusiastic over text, or else he would start having feelings for other girls. once he even told me he ""would be tempted to hang out with other girls"" if I went to visit my friend at college. He told me he was having feelings of breaking up with me, but was trying to fight them off, putting the burden on me to help him figure it out. He has made me cry COUNTLESS times. each time I did bring it up, and he would start crying and tell me he was sorry and that he did care for me, and that he was tempted to harm himself if I broke up with him. I KNEW deep down that I should break it off, but I didn't want to. It was my very first relationship and I thought I might regret it if I broke up with him. I really thought this was the person I was going to end up with. Hell was I wrong. 

Every terrible thing he has told me, he would say, ""I promise I didn't say it to make you jealous"" and then after a while, he would confess and say he did, indeed, say it for that reason. He would tell me I need to show more physical affection, and that because of this, he is tempted to date others. That's fine, that he wants someone who shows more physical affection, but it's a shitty thing to do to put the burden on me and making me feel like I need to fix that part of myself. It was things like this that made me feel bad about who I was. I was incredibly stressed out over these things he constantly told me. I lost sleep, and I stopped caring about pretty much everything else. all I wanted was for him to accept me as I was, but instead he was constantly putting me down and making me feel absolutely worthless. 

My dad was my hero with this. We went to a target parking lot and I cried and he comforted me. 

From this shit show of a relationship, I have trust issues, a heightened anxiety, and overall regret and frustration. I am so angry that I let him do all that to me, and this is why I am posting this. if you are experiencing a similar thing, PLEASE FOLLOW YOUR GUT. The entire time, my gut was telling me ""end this now. End this now. End this now."" but I didn't listen. It was my first relationship, and I truly thought we would last forever, even though my gut told me I was not doing the smart thing. I KNEW this was a bad idea to continue on with this person. I KNEW no one should treat me this way. 

And last thing. Let me tell you. Now, looking back on it, it is INSANE to realize how differently I feel. I am so secure with my decision. Once I left him, it was like a breath of fresh air. It took some time, of course; it took a few weeks, but once I truly realized it, it's like I can't believe I ever wanted to stay with him. When you're in the stage of ""I am infatuated with this person; I want to work it out with them"" you really do not realize how much better it will feel letting them go. But when you're out of that stage for a while, after breaking it off, you truly realize what a wonderful decision you've made. Never again will I let someone treat me this way. This was definitely a learning lesson in my life. So once again, please, if you're experiencing something similar, PLEASE follow what your gut says and if you're being treated wrongly like I was, END IT NOW. I promise, you will NOT regret it.

Honestly classic friendzone case, like I’ve even in the friendzone for ages I’m just a nice guy so happens all the time but idk I usually meet someone else but just hurts sm when it happens. I’d probably give him some space tbh, like coz when I’m with that girl that fz me just slowly chips away at my heart

Omg I’m in the exact same situation! I’m so lost at what to do because I don’t want to send the wrong signals but I cherish him as a friend. I found that learning balance helps a bit. I use to see a boy almost every day of the week now I only try to see him in my lessons, everything seems a lot better now. I also try avoid texting him as I always find that over text things can be read wrong and misinterpreted. Don’t feel like you have to change because of his feelings though, if you want to hang out with him still do just create strict boundaries. Hope this helps, good luck x",2019-07-15 17:45:37

I think alot of us have had this problem btw. Youll be fine (:

Okay. Tips for dating.... 

I would say, a good, *unique* first date would be fantastic. Well, since girls are complicated creatures, most of us would want the guy to initiate the date. You pick the date, time, and activity. 

(A rule for dating - KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. IT LOOKS VERY BAD IF YOU HAVE A FIRST DATE AND ASK HER: ""Hey, so yeah.... Whuddya wanna do?"") 

Dating is simple :) When you two are dating, there is a difference between dating and being bf and gf. Being bf and gf means that you have finally made it ""official"". Dating is just ""We're getting there, we'll see if we'll make it 'official'."" 
Body language is important. Stick close with her, and if you feel like you two are close enough to hold hands, hold hands! 
Obvious affection and enjoyment should be present. You should show her you're enjoying her company *a lot* and that you're trying to make her smile and brighten up her day :) 

Any more dating questions, ask me if you would like to. Bonne chance!

But I'm completely clueless about the dating thing.

Is it her first date too..

Just be nice around her! She likes you for a reason & if you do something stupid she will probably just think its cute.

yeah I think so

The main problem is I don't see her much because or the end of school.

Just go out to a movie then! If its her first date too then you guys should be in the same position! Have you had your first kiss.

Broke up with my ex 2 years ago, still miss our intimacy and love

Broke up with my ex, but miss the times we had

About 2 years ago I dated a girl in my senior year of high school. I had met her in a wood shop class and we really hit it off. I am a very shy person so dating and being a couple wasn’t my thing really. We got together and instantly everyone started looking at me different because I had gotten with her. Like I said, I was very shy and wasn’t “up” on the drama around the school. She had apparently been the biggest slut in school and had dated and had slept with a lot of guys.

But I didn’t see this at all, maybe because I was so in love for the first time in my life or that I didn’t want to believe it but I don’t know. Our relationship lasted about 4 months and in that time we had sex and she took my virginity. Eventually, the talks around school about me and what I was doing got to me. I was very insecure about going out with her and slowly I decided to break up with her. The way I did it was kind of shitty but I didn’t know how to properly break up with a girl seeing as this was my first serious relationship. She had gotten me upset about something and instead of forgive and forget like I usually would have I made a big deal out of it and stayed mad at her for a few days, thought because she wasn’t around me but I was still with her that people would look at me different but that’s not wha happened. Everyone still treated me the same until I cut her off and blocked on everything.

2 years later, I haven’t spoken to her and I am in a relationship. I still think back to our times together and how that relationship felt different than this one. Me and my ex were much more sexual and physically in love than my current. Don’t get me wrong , me and my current girlfriend do get touchy, but it’s not as often and not as passionate as with my ex. 

My question is, is this bad to be feeling this way? My current girlfriend knows of my ex and has told me multiple times how much of a slut she was, but I can’t help feeling that i saw a different side of her when it was just me and her either out and about doing things or having sex, it was something I couldn’t describe. The things she did were true and there was evidence for what she did, but for some reason it didn’t matter to me.

TL:DR: broke up with my ex because of how I was looked at with her, and miss our physical love.


Edit : me and my girlfriend broke up a few months ago and I’ve been single since. Few girls here and there but no relationships.

I shower, brush my teeth, use deodorant, wear clean clothes, etc. Nobody at school ever tells me directly in my face that I smell, but sometimes people who sit behind me lean back in their seat, and I can’t tell if it’s because I do in fact smell or that they’re just getting comfortable. Sometimes people would cover the side of their face/nose/mouth with the sleeves of their sweater. There’s this one particular guy who sits behind me in one of my classes who I know is super sensitive to smells. He talks to people who sit close by and he was whispering about how something was “disgusting” (I couldn’t hear him that well) and it turns out he had been talking about something from a magezine in class we were reading. He also said something that sounded like “it stinks” to one of his friends but I couldn’t hear him that well so I’m not sure. He doesn’t lean back in his chair away from me or anything, he actually sits pretty close to my back.

I’m a guy so some stuff should be taken with a grain of salt but here it goes... 
1) if you only want a boyfriend to feel wanted don’t get a boyfriend. It will only end badly. If you want a boyfriend because you want someone to share stories with, who you want to be with and want that experience of having a boyfriend, have at it. 
2) if guys aren’t noticing you, don’t make them. Guys can tell when a girl is totally changing who she is just to get a boyfriend and we don’t like it. So just be yourself. 
3) honestly, don’t be afraid to go talk to a guy YOU like. Honestly, not much bad can come from this. They either say yes which is great! Or they say no which isn’t a problem. If you like someone else too ask them. And even if they say no, I promise word will get around that you’re looking for a boyfriend and that may be the tipping point of a guy who’s wanted to talk to u but didn’t want to be rejected bc I guarantee u that same guys have noticed u but just haven’t made it obvious they have. And tbh it’s honestly really nice to have a girl talk to u first when you’re a guy because it lets you feel like they’re not compromising for u and you just get this odd confidence. Best of luck!

771,c7pzlo,False,,1,"I [17M] want to reinvest into my life early, where to start/tips?",AdviceForTeens,"I’m 17 years old, and over the last 5-6 years of my life, I’ve felt like I’m losing grip on what I know when it comes to how I’m going to live my life. I’m not the same anymore- better in some ways, but for the most part, I feel like I’m not on top of much concerning myself for my age. 

For example, I was supposed to start drivers ed at 14 1/2 y/o. I remember being excited about it yesterday. I remember being excited to get a job, and now I do nothing and am self aware of my own leeching habits of those around me due to their ability to drive, pay for food, etc. I’ve abused it, albeit subconsciously, but nonetheless I have. Another example is that I’ve got a very serious relationship that I’ve had going on a while. When I was younger, a year or so back, I took her on genuinely decent dates to nice places, but my parents paid because I did chores and was young and lucky enough. Now, we just hit our year and a half, and I didn’t even take her to dinner, and barely gave a present for her birthday. 

There are worse things to do, but I’m not proud of who I’ve become and what I’m doing with my life as of this point. I’m not dumb, I know I’m not, because I would’ve been shit out of luck years ago, yet I lack the work ethic or motivation. 

The worst part of it is my health. I’m a pothead, I’ve smoked daily for 3 years straight now, with the obvious breaks sometimes. But it’s bad, and so is my sleep schedule. My physical health was also way better a long time ago, so mentally and physically I’m just not me anymore. It’s not even about looks, it’s about not feeling under the weather or groggy or irritable. 

To everyone reading, it may seem like pandering to compliments or support, but that’s not my goal here. I’m just kind of trying to explain my perspective, so please bear with me if you will. 

Generally, the only things keeping me going are my girlfriend, family, friends and drugs. I don’t have much to say for myself. I haven’t done anything to proud of recently except make it this far.  I suppose I wrote this post because, like I said, I’m not entirely stupid, just kind of lost and don’t know what to do to even get myself the strength to get out of bed anymore. School counselors say I have depression and anxiety, and parents/close friends say I’m always stressed, so I’m clearly not me. 

The point is, I’m lost, and I’m not happy. I know I can be, but I’m not. Not like I was- I remember it. I need help. I could ask a sum of questions but it’d be too long. So, to shorten it: To any adults, or wiser people out there, how do I get back on track? How do I even start? Is there anything I can do get myself back on my feet before I make bigger steps? Is there any habits or small things I can start changing now?

Your girlfriend wise I’m sure she doesn’t mind that you haven’t got her a birthday present or that you haven’t taken her out in a while.

43,fbhn89,False,,4,Tips on having fun?,AdviceForTeens,"My teen years are almost over and I feel like I wasted it all doing nothing. It makes me feel a little sad when I think about it cause it felt like everyone lived their best life

So how did you have fun during your teen years",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fbhn89/tips_on_having_fun/,5,"Tbh I feel the same way. I can’t offer any advice unfortunately but Im just letting you know that there are people who feel the same. As a kid I said no to Disneyland trips or something like that because I was always told “if you go to school and try hard you’ll succeed” or whatever whatever. Well, now I feel like I’ve missed so many opportunities and I have few memories that aren’t homework. My point is that you’re not alone. What I tell myself is to see friends, go to the movies, or take the opportunities when they come up. If they don’t, go make them. Be the person to invite others to lunch. If your friends say no then maybe make new ones.

I'm kinda in the same position. I'm also through with Junior year and I've kinda missed-out on stuff. I struggled with girls all throughout High School. I finally had one this year who lived a town away from me, but she left after a month and a half. I hang-out with friends but I didn't go to parties, which I am okay with because I'd ratger stay away from drugs/alcohol. You may feel like everyone else is having a great time, but realize that this shit won't matter after High School ends. This will change into college and later in life. Most of these people who are considered ""cool"" or ""popular"" will be on the same level as you after High School. Many of them peak in High School and become nobodies later in life; later on it might be your time to shine. We just gotta stick through with this shit and things will be better, trust me. I'm an attractive guy with good qualities but I feel like girls at this point in their lives aren't mature enough to realize what's good rn, but later I'll be the one getting all the girls because I have a stable job and take good care of myself. Shit will change in your favor if you put in the work so don't worry, you only go to school with these people because you live in their proximity, it doesn't matter what they think of you in this moment.

I was gonna say something, but the other comments pretty much summed it up. All I can say is maybe get in good with the popular kids and you’ll be more likely to get invited to parties if that’s what you want, even though parties are generally the same and you’ll only have as good of a time as you make it. I know there’s a lot of pressure to be out doing stuff all the time living your best life, but everyone isn’t doing cool shit 24/7 that’s just what we see on social media, most teens feel the same way you do don’t stress about it.

Play an instrument! Meeting new people and bonding in instrumental communities is always fun to me atleast. It keeps me occupied and having fun every second of my life.",2020-03-01 03:27:59

208,fbxz2s,False,,1,I need your help- Just boredom and a loss of will,AdviceForTeens,"I'm sure that my friends at school have similar problems because we talk about it a lot, but I was wondering if its an epidemic problem for other teenagers across the world, or just for my school.

I'm turning 17 in around a month and have noticed a huge, for me anyway, problem that has occurred for around 1-2 years. I'm just incredibly bored.

My other friends watch anime all day, watch Netflix, draw, read or whatever and everything just seems incredibly boring to do. I lost my 3 main friends after finishing my GCSE exams as they all parted to either jobs or other colleges, and have been trying to fit in with another group of friends, which is realistically going pretty well, but have only been friends with them for around 6 months. I ask to play video games, go to the movies or go around each other houses but they say that its boring, and frankly, i agree with them. Everything that used to give me joy now seems boring and gives me a feeling of nothingness, a feeling that can only be descirbed as nothing/boring/pointless. I really want to do things to make me happy again, but it feels like ive lost all feelings within my body, my friends have a similar feeling, it also doesnt help that most of the exiting stuff is also pretty expensive. The main problem is that most of the other friend groups at school seem to have a similar a problem as i speak of it regularly to them.

Is this a normal feeling or do i have a craving for affection from friends. I ask ""do i have a craving for affection from friends"" as the recent break from school, lasting for 1 week, i was INCREDIBLY bored, and by the 4th day i couldnt bear it, and just wanted to curl into a ball, lay there silently and wait until this feeling went away. I found that my eating habits went to sh!T, eating only 1 meal per day and just silently wallowing in my own sorrow for the remaining 5 days. I found that even a message from friends was enough to satisfy me for another few hours, but then these feeling would begin to come back and i would just crave for another message/interaction/notifiation from my friends.

I know these are symptoms of mental health problems, but my main quesiton is, Why do these feeling go away from simple messages/talking to my friends or even random strangers on the internet? Is it me being clingy to my friends? is this completly normal? do i have a form of a mental problem?

The important thing to remember is 1) you only have 1 year until you can escape 2) today, there’s less societal pressure to not see a psychologist. Coinciding and psychologists can be great, they can help you get stuff off your chest and help to change your thought process of you get and sort of PTSD or similar problem. They can also help you to learn how to live on your own so when the time comes you’re ready to leave home. 3) don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself. I don’t know about your national, state and local laws but where I am we have amnesty from “exergent circumstances” (I’m sure I misspelled that) where basically, if you can save your self from abuse or save others, you’re allowed to break the law to get yourself out of the situation so for example, if you’re physically being abused, you can punch, kick, spit, scream, all the way up to stab or shoot, do anything you need to to get away and be safe. For example, in Texas, there was a mass shooting and a former Marine stole a truck and sped back and forth to a local hospital picking up the wounded, saving some lives. It doesn’t need to be that extreme, for example, in Georgia, “fighting words” justify a simple assault so, to my understanding, if someone says “I’m going to kill you” or “I’m going to beat you up” that justifies you physically assaulting them to get away from the situation and you will not be charged with a crime. Find what you can and can’t do and know it just Incase you need it. And keep in mind, if the police are called which they maybe, stay calm, and explain the situation truthfully and respect the officer.",2019-06-21 11:24:08

It's okay to buy condoms at any age, go to a store that isn't a local one. (like a pharmacy other than CVS and Walgreen's) Any national gas station, drugstore, or grocery/retail store (like Walmart or Kmart) should sell them. It's just like old people buying diapers or women buying tampons, it's embarrassing at first but the cashier has probably seen it a 100 times.

I can see myself with her yes, but being bipolar and having panic attacks because of her really makes it hard for me to decide if I should drop her or not

Depends, is this a woman you could see yourself spending a long time with? If so then yes, if not, I'm not too sure about the waiting

I got school at 7:15 in the morning I get up at 6:32 but every night I try to go to bed by 9 pm so I get 9 and 1/2 hours sleep. But every time I get in bed at 9 I can’t fall asleep and I look into the blackness for hours untill it’s 3 then I fall asleep. I’m so tired and miserable every morning even though I’ve been trying to set back my internal clock I’m trying to train my body to sleep at 9. I don’t drink caffeine or any stimulants that would keep me up.
I do smoke  weed  and when I don’t could that be a reason why I’m not sleeping. I really just want advice cause I try so hard to sleep so I can be clear headed and function the next morning and so my muscles can heal and not be sore but my body is like nope you don’t need sleep and then I feel like really bad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/elrxzg/help_please_idk_what_to_do/,1,"Probably what you don’t want to hear but maybe try and quit the weed. At least try for a solid 2 weeks, the first week will probably be super hard but the second might not. It’s all trial and error. Maybe along with that improve your diet if it needs improving, try reading before bed, hours before you actually go to sleep ensure the lighting is darker, the smell of lavender might help too or try running a warm bath or hot shower. Hope some of these help

I’ve dealt with insomnia since I was 13, I’m 16 too. Not much helps but things I’ve found help are things that take my mind off my thoughts such as having a show or video or music playing in the background (something that relaxes you). I watch ASMR and it helps a lot but I know that it’s not everyone, but it may be worth a try. I also take melatonin which helps and use essential oils (which also aren’t for everyone I know maybe it’s just placebo but it helps me). White noise is good too, I listen to rain and fan sounds. Also red lights help your brain get tired. Just a few suggestions. Trust me I know it’s hard. If it get really bad, I would recommend going to a doctor for actual sleeping medicine.

Thank you for the motivation after 2 days of horrible sleep I came home and I was like I to tired to go to the gym and I past out till 6 and it’s bad because I’m trying to set my sleep schedule to 9.

My diet is fine I eat really healthy. I gotta get a certain amount of protein fat and carbs a day. I have been trying to quit weed but I literally can’t sleep with or without so idk what it is. But it’s really frustrating that I gotta go through this whole week of no sleep because I just did because I was taking Tylenol pms every week and would up the dosage because it wouldn’t work. But I quit those and went threw a whole week of horrible sleep. Now I’m off those. This was probably about a month ago. But now I’m trying to go to bed at 9 and i can’t fall asleep. I gotta go through another week of no sleep and be miserable I guess and quit weed but I’m gonna do it.

I’m sorry you’re going through that, sounds really terrible getting no sleep. Coming from me I’ll probs die with no sleep, I’d be so grumpy and miserable. You can do this!!",2020-01-08 20:15:14

I haven’t spoken to her for over a year and she called me the other day to see if we could see each other. I felt alarmed and made time for it but then she cancelled so we called instead and I found out she was miserable and it was pretty apparent she was having suicidal thoughts.

6,f26nht,False,,6,Golden advice that can help you,AdviceForTeens,"1. If you waste time, you waste life. Time is ticking, don’t waste your life - literally. Do things that truly matter to you.
2. Change what you can, accept what you cannot. This may sound discouraging, but it’s actually liberating. Since you can’t control everything, working on the right things is all you have to do.
3. You’re living in the real world, not a fantasy land. The real world is far from ideal. Be bold, be practical.
4. You could be heavily disadvantaged. You could be born in a poor family or born with disability. Maybe your hard-earned money was cheated. But don’t ever give up. Be resilient and keep moving.
5. Blaming kills you. When you blame your government, parents and friends for your current situation, you don’t solve anything. Instead, you become bitter and get killed from the inside.
6. You are responsible for all your emotions. Good or bad, emotions are generated by you, not radiated to you by the external circumstances. Master your emotions.
7. Most people don’t care about you. They’re more concerned about their lives than yours, and that’s perfectly normal.
8. Love could harm you. Many people are actually harmed, rather than nourished by love. Many harmful actions are done under the name of love.
9. Your parents are getting older. They can’t protect you anymore. it’s your turn to protect them now. Grow up.
10. You may lose health. It’s tempting to sacrifice health for wealth. That’s putting the cart before the horse. Don’t make the mistake - health always comes first.
11. You are going to die. This is a fact, not a curse. Appreciate the person in front of your mirror and live your life to the fullest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f26nht/golden_advice_that_can_help_you/,14,"a lot of people should see this...

My parents did the exact same thing for a while. Maybe like 6-8 months or so. Maybe even longer (it was 2 years ago so I don’t remember the exact amount of time). After a while it starts to fade and they won’t need you to text them as much except for longer distances. Just my experience and I’ve always thought to have very strict parents. So if you play along with it for now, it’ll get better faster. Best of luck to you!

I completely get you. But at the same time like you said, it's for their peace of mind. Just slowly gain their trust by longing this process of telling them where you are to prove you're responsible and trustworthy. After a couple of months or so, things may change.

Same, its so fucked

I was in your position for the better part of my teens, and don't take this too close to heart but my way of moving forward was this:
I got my head out of my ass and looked around... Nobody has that movie-like love. And you don't really want someone to say what it's like to be loved(you can do that by reading romance novels and watching chick flicks), you want someone to say how to proceed with your life and not obsess with romance. I'll tell you how... you need to come to terms with reality. 1 Everybody is insecure from time to time. You will realize this when you empty your energy on to something useful- like exercise and then don't have anything to feed your ' anxiety' anymore. (More 'happy' phases of life will suddenly appear) 2 Nobody is the person they want to be. Simply because the opposite is stupid. Your life consists of constantly taking actions to improve yourself, your job, grades or whatever you have. You're allowed to be satisfied with yourself in the late 50ties. But don't interpret this wrongly: YOU NEED TO HAVE SELF CONFIDENCE (You can achieve this with coming up with decisions and telling yourself that it's going to be okay and it's not the end of the world) Only when you come to terms with who you are and who you want to be are you going to find peace. If you find a partner while in this unstable moping state, it's not going to go well. Romance will come. You'll fall in love, have a meet cute story and be in a relationship. Everything will come in time, so don't worry. One more thing: these years of evaluating yourself while in semi-depression are WAY more important for your character development than you think, so don't feel guilty for ' wasting'  your time on crying and overthinking because, that's what most famous writers and philosophers did, and they are considered the wisest men to ever exist.

At the beginning of the last school year, my junior year, I asked a friend, who I've known since kindergarten and the couple years before started to have feelings for, out to a concert, not on a date, but with a group. First of all, she texted me later and said no. It kinda hurt, but that wasn't really the problem. All school year she was friendly once and awhile, but usually tried to ignore me. I even asked her if I had done something wrong, and she couldn't even look at me as she no and ran off. Long story short, we're not as close and I got over it. 

Now, a year later, there's one other girl who just graduated that I know and really like. We've talked a few times, we go to the same church/youth group, like the same stuff/hobbies, but while everyone I've talked to said the first time want my fault, I'm afraid of I try to talk to her or anything I'll ruin it as soon as she figures it out.

Okay this is a roller coaster of emotions. So i grew up spoiled. Yes i acknowledge that. Everything I got I wanted. But recently I dont even know anymore

So i recently moved back in with my parents after 6 years in boarding school. I thought after not seeing them since the age of 12 I thought it would be a nice chance to reconnect. Boy was I wrong. 

I just feel like i guest and Its like my parents cant seem to acknowledge anything i do and am i wrong for wanting acknowledgement? For instance i finished AP chemistry with a 99.8% and all i got was okay so what and a god shut up im busy. I got elected student council president and all they said was resign because theyll just use you as an errand girl. But someone my sister getting a 75 is worth going to dinner and cake?!!?!?!?! I just want something and like sometimes ill complain about the work i have to do and they just say stop complaining you chose to do this or why are you complaining we never forced you to do any of this. Which was right but i just wanted a hey its going to be okay

Im just tired of everything. Im tired that my mother cant seem to bring herself to care to remember anything about me. For instance we had this fight about curtains. My mother had asked me and my sisters what colour curtains we would like for our room. i had said white, and no orange ma cause I hate the colour orange. Next thing I know, im getting orange curtains whilst my sisters get the colours they wanted and when confronted she turned it on to me saying she didn’t intentionally do it she just didn’t remember mine and that I was being spoiled and should just be grateful that i got curtains in the first place. Another instance was when I had been telling my family i no longer eat pork for health reasons. I said this repeatedly, made a point to avoid pork, and just made the extra mile to ensure I never ingested pork. I come home and dinner is pork belly. I told my mom I couldnt eat this and I was just going to order take out and she flipped out calling me a brat and ungrateful and saying she kept saying how was she supposed to know what I liked and I just wanted to scream and yell at her telling her that she seemed to remember my sisters preferences just fine

So let me start of the beginning, i’m a junior in high school and well my main classes are with people that i’m not really friends with. but with time i met 3 girls in my class and became friends  , ( let’s say Candice , Clara and Jane )the 3 aren’t friends.. , anyways. with time we really started  having fun together in every single class even outside of school / we go out and do projects together and even created a groupchat for the 4 of us.. and we got pretty close that  we literally tell each other our secrets ( you know the type of stuff you tell someone when you’re pretty confortable & close with them). Anyways , something happened a few days ago that made me confused? upset? idk honestly.. something really serious happened to Jane and her ex crush, and she told us the evening that something happened, and when we were waiting for her to tell us she literally turned to me and said : ‘Sorry but i’m not telling you’ , I was like ‘What why’ but she said that she’s kidding, i brushed it off anyways. That night in the group chat jane said : come on candice i’m gonna tell’you what happened cuz you need to know but candice said that she’s not home so she can’t really talk , then she asked clara if she’s available to talk, clara was outside too, I was LITERALLY waiting for her to tell me but she didn’t even mention my name. so i texted the group ‘hey what abt me? am I inexistant or what?’ so she said : ‘lol just kidding’ and the convo stopped  there. 
The next day, Jane didn’t come to school, and i literally heard the other two : candice and clara talking about that ‘secret’ and she was like ‘what do you think?’ when i heard that i immediately knew that jane told them and not me, i didn’t even bother to ask them. So i went to jane’s best friend (whom i’m friends with too) and i asked her if she told you about the matter , her best friend said yes she told me and i was like wow she didn’t even tell me and told candice and clara, why do you think she didn’t tell me? so her best friend literally said : its something really personal , candice and clara are really close so ofc she told them but you and her are just simple friends so ofc she won’t tell you . Those words shocked the F outta me . How the hell are we ´simple’ friends ??? was she considering me a ‘simple’ friend after all? why does she consider the other 2 closer than me since we literally became friends at the same time. like we didn’t know each other before junior year. I felt disappointment and a little bit of sadness.. That night she (jane) texted the groupchat :’how did you react when you saw him guys’ and she was literally talking to the other 2 girls.  Anyways after that , i found out about something else : that the other one (candice) told something to the other 2 and not me. 
I felt that i was hella excluded from the circle and i shed some tears that night
i had so many questions like : Why are they hiding stuff from me , why aren’t they treating me like they’re treating each other. We literally became ( the 4 of us ) friends at the same period of time so why is it so unfair.

I second the club suggestion. Also, don't let mean girls or mean behaviour get you sad. Your worth isn't determined by the people you meet, but by the kindness of your heart - so leave them be with a smile and do what pleases you most, what helps you grow and find yourself.

571,fa03ok,False,,3,Should I quit softball?,AdviceForTeens,"This season is coming up and starting in 3 weeks. I still don’t know if I’m playing and I’ve been thinking for the past 3 months and been unable to decide. I am in desperate need of some help

Summary of my situation:
I’m a sophomore this year and I was the only pitcher on my team last year. I was overworked and got an injury near the end of last season from repetitive motion in my shoulder. I went to PT all fall/winter and still can’t pitch or throw without pain. Anyway, last year I was miserable and was under so much pressure to constantly perform perfectly. The coach was also mean. I started to lose interest in softball, the sport I’ve been playing for 10 years. A lot of my friends are on the team too and I don’t want to let them down. I’ve talked to my coach and there most likely aren’t any other positions for me on the team, other than bench, since I can’t really pitch. 


I need to decide wether or not to play this season. I honestly can’t make a decision and nobody is really helping me. I am being persuaded to play by everyone I talk to (including my parents). My parents keep telling me to do it and sit on the sidelines all season and be a “team player.” I get how this is important, but it seems like such a waste of time to me if I’m going to be committing so much time to just observe.


Reasons I don’t want to play: 
- I’m worried about my shoulder and making it worse. 
- I hated it last year and didn’t have fun. 
- It was too stressful. 
- It took up all of my free time 6 days a week for 3 months. 
- I would have to quit my job that I’ve been working for 3 weeks at. 
- I wouldn’t be able to focus on my hobbies or school 
- I would be happier and better mentally. 


Reasons I want to play/things holding me back from quitting: 
- My friends are on the team and I might feel left out/ regret quitting 
- things might be better this year 
- I’ve been playing for such a long time and idk if I’m ready to let go. 
- I don’t want to piss my friends off and let down the team. 
- I would walk by my coach everyday and have a really awkward time in her gym class senior year. 
- I wouldn’t see a lot of my friends often. (I’m kind of introverted and don’t have many friends, so it would be hard for me to go out and make new ones)
- I would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle. 


If anyone is still reading this and has anything to say, I would really really like to hear another perspective. Especially from someone who isn’t biased one way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fa03ok/should_i_quit_softball/,1,"Hi! I would play.

You say one of the reasons u don't want to do it is because u'll be better mentally not playing in the team but u also say u would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle... Make your decision but wisely and don't forget what ""team"" is really about.

Hope that helped, keep me updated. Whatever your choice is, don't regret it.

Thanks for the input! I’m concerned about regretting my choice too. If I decide to play, I could regret that as much as not playing(?)

Pretty much ever since then ive thought of her as almost a sister because she supports me so much but i also found that she is one of my favorite people to be around and developed a crush on her. For too long to remember in this friendship ive denied any feelings knowing that i should see her as only my friend. Even if i thought otherwise i dont know how it would affect us as a group, they are my rock keeping me from depression most days and if i tried to date her it could ruin everything. She may so no and i rely on my best friend for the time being, or she may say she shares feelings and my best friend resents me for ruining the trio, which would fuck up even more things since our parents are planning a triple graduation party for us. And even if that doesnt happen, what if my best friend also had feelings for her. But even if it all works out, i know she has plans after graduating, and they don't involve staying in state near us for college. Im at a loss for ideas and another day idk what to do is one where i wish i knew how they feel about me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f40gte/i_like_one_of_my_best_friends_in_my_trio_and_am/,3,,2020-02-15 07:02:50
474,cnnn24,False,,2,I really need help and advice,AdviceForTeens,"Hi I'm 16 years old and going to be a junior next year at my highschool. I ran track as a sophomore and now am doing cross country try over the summer but I have a big problem. My coach had a talk with me and my mom telling me he doesn't think I can continue on into the fall with the team running without being injured all the time and not being able to run. He said this and my mom agreed with him so now I basically got dropped from the team. The reason he said this is because I have screws in my foot from when I broke my ankle in the 8 th grade because I thought I had to play football and now my right ankle doesn't bend all the way forward which causes loads of imbalances in my running form that cause injuries. I basically suffered through the summer with running and was really stressed out but I worked my ass off and now being off the team I've just stopped. School has not started yet and theirs still a practice meet coming up which I could run in but I just feel so out of shape and my parents are set on me not running anymore. The coach told me I could join back on the team and run but it would have to be okay with my mom. I really wanna finish what I started in training and not loose my fitness but I've just been so unmotivated and seditary not running this week that I don't know if I can even have the ability to run. Everyday that goes by I can't stop thinking about how I should be running and the whole team is running without me. I hated practice when I was running and my ankle just made evei more stressfull but I LOVED everything that came with the running. The feeling of accomplishment after running 10 miles to taking an ice bath after to being able to eat big meals and feeling accomplished knowing how much work I just put in is like an addiction and I cant drop it. But now it's like what's the point of even running 4 miles if I'm not in cross country... I could still join back or just become a regular person and not be an athlete but I hate the idea of that. Also even if I did join back I know that I'm basically at square one right now and I would have to go through all this shit again in putting my all into train just so I can get to a reasonable level of fitness which pisses me off. Schools about to stark and I'm lost. Running did ruin my summer but I'm just to involved and invested in running to just stop.... Forever. I don't know what to do. I thought it would be fun to not have to worry about waking up early everyday and run, but now that's its actually a reality all I can think about is how i should be running. Just any advice would help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/cnnn24/i_really_need_help_and_advice/,2,"The doctor in me says: quit running for good!
Your health is a trillion times more valuable than being able to enjoy some ice showers and praise (no offense). If you were to break that leg again you could probably never run again (not even jff) because of heavy pain and an extremely long healing phase because of your age (the older you get the harder it gets to recover, you're not 8 anymore so it takes months or even over a year to recover).  
The 17 old me says: same thing!
You could just run casually for pleasure and not professionally, take it more easily and not damage your foot.
You could find another hobby/career (if you wanna be professional), but you can't find perfect health that easily.
I know this means a lot to you and I ultimately can't make your decision but maybe you could talk to your doctor and get his opinion on in how far it is possible to train/join the team or which other hobbys you could pick up.

Well it seems like your injury cause quit the problem and the decision by your parents was already made. It sounds like to me maybe you need to still be athletic but it a different way. Have you thought of trying something more on the field side of track like disk or shot put? Maybe you could try weightlifting like bench pressing and try to break your school record without affecting your ankle.",2019-08-08 23:54:40

If you're struggling, reach out to me. We're friends, after all.""

Yes, don't try and pry to get them to tell you all their problems so you can solve them, just be there for them as a friend. Most people with depression don't want to talk about it, all you can do as a friend is be open to them and tell them you're there for them. They will come to you when they're ready to talk.

so basically this guy i met from a summer camp will NOT leave me alone.  He’s 6’4 and prolly 300 pounds, i am NOT 6’4 and 300 pounds. He sends me constant unwanted pics and tries to make me send them in return. saying things like “ i’ll give u a deal, u either send me 5 pics and we don’t hook up when we see each other or u send me one and we do” or “i know u want to, just let me take care of u”.  i would block him but he has shown up to my house before without me telling him my address so i know he can find me. we also have mutual friends and i don’t want them to find out about all this. i’ve told him i’m not interested multiple times and when he gets into his moods i just won’t answer him, but he just sends 50 pics and it’s rlly starting to make me scared. 

the day he showed up to my house , he was with another one of my friends and as creeped out as i was , i couldn’t just close the door in their faces so i went out w them. my friend had to go to work so she left, leaving me and this guy alone in his car. i asked to go home and he drove me in complete silence ( SCARIEST 30 MINS OF MY LIFE )  after he dropped me off , he texted me and said “ the whole car ride i could only think of pulling over and making u blow me “ 
I’m really starting to get scared and i need advice on how to get him to leave me alone.

This is not okay and you shouldn't live in fear. Tell your friends/parents that you met a guy from summer camp and he won't leave you alone. Tell them about the unwanted pics. Don't think about it, just tell them.

tell an adult immediately

For starters, talk to an adult, maybe report it to the police. Above all else NEVER get into his car again or go anywhere alone with him. This is dangerous behavior.

What he is doing is a crime. I know you don't want to be rude but that is not as important as your safety, so don't be afraid to close doors in his face, or whatever else you need to do.

destroy his life report him everywhere and tell everyone

Report him. Report him to ceop, I’ve had a similar problem. They’ll look into it straight away trust me. They’ll find out where he lives and probably will go and chat to him. If this doesn’t work tell an adult or guardian. Report him to the police, I mean you have evidence!!

I’m sorry to hear your going though this god.

I totally agree but do not screenshot the pictures because then you (assuming he’s under 18) have child nudity on your phone and could get in big trouble. Worst case scenario, you just wait for him to send them again knowing he will and open it on front of the police.",2019-07-20 05:46:49
505,awftp8,False,,2,I was drunk & I think i was taken advantage of? Please help,AdviceForTeens,"So I have a friend who goes to uni overseas. I haven't seen her in 3 years & I finally did at the airport when she flew back to our home country. She was flying back to her hometown & was transitting through the city I lived in. She told me to meet up with her again on her way back to uni as she will be staying overnight at a hotel in the city I live in before flying international the next day. That was on a Friday night when I went to spend the night with her at her hotel room. I brought wine & pizza & was hoping for a girls night. But she invited her other f-buddy to come over for sex & she asked to me wait outside while she did him. I sat by the pool for over 1hr & was annoyed but still waited. Later that night she told me she got tickets to a club to watch a show & said she had a good guy friend (I'll just call him Jake) coming to pick us up. I agreed to go coz I never party, I'm not that kinda girl but I justed wanted to have some fun & live a little so I agreed. Fast forward I got super drunk & my friend said she'd look out for me. She couldn't be really drunk coz she had a flight the next day. Anyways I ended up going back to the hotel room with a friend of Jake that I briefly met. I don't remember how he brought me back to my friend's hotel room coz I was out. But I do remember waking up unconsciously & realizing he had me on the bed with my legs up & I realized he took down my trousers half way so I was half naked. I didn't see my friend, I think she let Jake's friend take me back coz I must've passed out. I felt pain in my lower abdomen, I think Jake tried to have sex with me & I drunkenly blurted out it hurts. Next thing I remember him telling me to pull up my pants & roll over the bed to sleep. I don't know of that was sex coz I am a virgin. Next morning I woke up hungover & saw that my friend had returned with Jake & Jake's friend was asleep on the floor. I had to sober up so I fumbled around the room looking for water then passed out on the floor. Jake's friend moved over to where I was laying & fingered me & I made a noise so he removed his hands from my pants. My friend & Jake were on the bed.

After I left my friend I was so confused. I don't know if I wanted that. I felt violated & I have no one to talk to coz I am deeply embarrassed. I don't know if that was sec coz I've never had sex. And how am I supposed to know if he came in me. In my country, having pre-matiral sex is heavily frowned upon & is a taboo.

Now this seems pretty easy but not for me apparently. The high school teacher that teaches the course said “if this doesn’t help you in what you want to be when you grow up then don’t do it” this makes sense but I don’t know what I want to be. I thought I wanted to be a business owner but I don’t think I would enjoy that anymore, as it would have me interacting with people on a daily basis which isn’t what I like. I thought maybe I would like to be a mechanic but that would put my body under stress I don’t think I could take. I also want to do a sport which would take about 3 hours of study time away. And the course usually gives two or three hours of hw. I don’t know what I want to be and if taking an English or history course would help. I tried to take quizzes but those did not help at all. It just sucks because everyone knows what they want and I don’t. So if anyone could help I would appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f82y0q/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_be_when_i_grow_up/,2,"If you have any interest in the course, and feel like it would be worth your time, I think you should take it. Colleges like to see AP courses no matter what subject it is. I personally didn’t take any AP classes my freshman year, so don’t feel pressured. It’s not a big deal if you want to take the normal course and start taking AP courses later in your junior year like I did. I’m a senior in high school and want to go into marine biology, but I still take English and psychology AP courses for fun. So do whatever you feel would fit your lifestyle and schedule better. If you value sports more, so sports, if you value academics more, then take the AP class.

For starters I don't know what an AP class is, but that teacher is really ignorant if he expects all the young adults in his class to know what they want to do in life. It's okay if you don't know what you want to do yet, it's even okay when you're an adult. Your brain needs t develop until 25 at least, so your interests will change. But unfortunately we live in a harsh world and you must at least choose something that you tolerate and gets you a decent wage so you can pursue your dreams later.

They key word is research. Research jobs and their sub-types, research college and university courses, research where you can go with your current qualifications and the courses you plan to follow. Don't make the mistake of thinking everything will just fall into place and everything will be fine, research extensively and ask questions because not doing that may just be one of the biggest mistakes in your life.

But don't be put off by the amount of work involved. Anything you choose is going to require lots of work, and if you want to be great at what you do, you'll need to work even harder. Obviously, if you really hate many components of a course and can't even tolerate them, don't do it. I thought about being a vet and a nurse once, but I wouldn't be able to learn chemistry even if I tried.

A word about English and History, they're not the best majors to choose. With English, you can only be an English teacher, and with English and a secondary area, there's librarian and other research and record keeping jobs, or journalism. And for journalism you'd probably need to do an extra year or two to if you choose it along with something else. If none of that interests you, don't choose English or Communication studies. Plus those jobs are already pretty saturated, as in there's more people applying for them than there is demand. History is incredibly saturated, the demand for jobs is pretty low but a lot of people are choosing history, and that's why there's a lot of jobless history graduates.

299,cajqdu,False,,3,17 and my mum kicked me out and I really don't know what the right action is.,AdviceForTeens,"I'm going to try and keep this as concise as possible. I've never had a good relationship with either of my parents, I haven't seen my dad in years and me and my mum either fight alot and don't talk at all. About two months ago (three months before my 17th) she kicked me out on the grounds that I don't listen to her at all and that I'm basically a bad son and not a functioning human being, It's probably worth mentioning that I'm a)diagnosed with GAD, OCD, persistent depressive disorder and that not only has she been physical towards me but before i was made to leave she punched me in the head.

It has since been about three weeks since and I have applied for school, and to get payments from the government as I live in Australia and that is as far as I've gotten. I wanted to go home for a very long time but it has now gotten to the point that I'm not even sure, I don’t want to seem dramatic but everyone has so far sorta seemed like they’re not on my side. The conditions on which I can come home are very vague and so far it seems that I'm just at the whim of how my mum feels, no one wants to give me any time frame and I’m expected to achieve well in school in an environment that I'm really not comfortable in (a family friends house)

I don’t know if I should apply for government housing which would in theory allow me to live independently or if I should just wait and see if my mum want’s to take me in but where I am now honestly I'm probably just gonna kms as it would seem the most logical all things considered. The person I’m staying with seems to think that I should wait but she’s also super hard to convince of anything and seems to think that inaction would be the best action.

I really don’t wanna live this life anymore and I don’t know what the hell I’m meant to do or think, but I know if I don’t do something soon then I'm probably not gonna make it to to school orientation and definitely not the sweet age of 17. 

I’m sorry if this seems like a mess or incoherent but I’m just getting to the end of my rope and need advice or honestly anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/cajqdu/17_and_my_mum_kicked_me_out_and_i_really_dont/,3,"don’t kill your self bro. If your applying for a school or something can’t you tell them the situation your in? Same with the government? Any relations with auntie uncle or anyoneeee? If so have you told them your situation. Plus if your mum had kicked you out I wouldn’t recommend going back if she’s treating you with violence and arguing. It’s not healthy. The person your staying with is stupid for saying inaction is the best action. If you do nothing, nothing will come out. You have to work for it. I would stay with the person your living with, and wait for the government to help. If you need to talk you can always pop me a dm :)

I know exactly how you feel. My mum kicked me out 2 days before my 15th birthday 5 months ago and I understand how hard and conflicting it all is and how everyone opinions can make things really confusing. I would say government housing and independence would be the best way to go. Being able to create your own environment and not having to rely on anyone will hopefully provide you with some normality and stability. It helps to remember that everyone situation you go through is to teach you about different relationships and situations and that somthing good will come from what you’ve had to go through.

I totally agree. This wouldn’t be healthy mentally or physically to return home right now. Maybe this is the best thing for you and as a result of being kicked out of the house you’ll end up with a chip on your shoulder that inspires you to be a millionaire or simply life the best life you can. But no matter what, harming yourself in any way will not help at all, it will be worse. I’ve been to way too many funerals for friends and their family who had a child kill themselves. It breaks my heart every time and remember that your mom will always love you. Even if she doesn’t show it now, she loves you. I guarantee it. You hurting yourself hurts your mom, dad, siblings, friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, and even someone you don’t even know but your story will be passed to them by one of your friends because they’re explaining why they’re leaving school early and say it’s to go to the funeral of a kid with his entire life ahead of him. If you ever need help. You can also dm me.",2019-07-08 19:14:54
41,d0ryk6,False,,7,How to motivate my overweight teen towards healthier lifestyle?,AdviceForTeens,"My (44 M) teenage son (15 M) is overweight (209 lbs, 5' 9""), he is smart, good at academics, reads a lot, plays video competitive games. He is. Great swimmer and used to swim a lot pre teen. However, now he is not very physically active. 

I and my wife are physically very active and have a healthy diet and gym routine. His diet is not too bad. Generally what we have is what he has. I have spoken to him several times about overweight problems and also  spent time with him in the gym by taking him along. He seems to be not convinced about he being overweight. 

The concern and back and forth on actions for weight loss has been going on for sometime now and I am worried now. Can someone advise how do I systematically approach and help him to maintain a healthy lifestyle?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/d0ryk6/how_to_motivate_my_overweight_teen_towards/,8,"You could try to make him pick up swimming again, you could either say it’s for social reasons, or try confronting him about being overweight again, or both. And you could try to stock your house with just generally more healthy food. You could also try bringing it up to your doctor privately and ask him if he could talk about it during his next check up. My best advice is to be sensitive. Hope it works up

Maybe try working out and eating healthy as a family? I know my family does this. My whole family has always been pretty healthy but my older sister started gaining a lot of weight. We started all going on the treadmill and switching off and she started as well. It’s a great motivator! I know it’s hard though because he’s at that age, but my sister is 18 and she’s doing fine.

Usually he would end up being self-motivated. Probably needs to deal with the truth as well. Not sure how to go about this. Maybe try posting this on a reddit with psychologists or health advisors.

Try to find another sport he likes, I know I swam for years and then tapered off for a while. I did gain a bit of weight, but then I found another sport I couldn’t get enough of and it’s been great. Try to convince him to dabble in different sports, and see if anything clicks.

Thanks for responding. I think the doc angle makes sense, I will try that.

At home generally we have healthy options, but yes some time package food comes in for kids. May be we will stop that.

>Usually he would end up being self-motivated
I have tried some helpful motivational father-son talks.  Hoping it will help him at some point.

He is enrolled into basketball, he has to face a bit of rejection in the beginning but once he is at a reasonable weight and skill he should be fine. For now I have convinced him for daily brisk walk, hopefully he will change that to running and gym.

That’s good. I really hope this all works out in the end!",2019-09-07 13:10:18

I've met this guy for a bit more than a year now , and we grew really close , close as best friends. He learned that i was interested in crimes ( as i love to LEARN about the mental state and all since i wish to be a psycological student ) and he told me that he wished to do a school shooting. He already planned it when he was still in high school , he is now 21 ( i am soon to be 18 ) and not long ago he told me : give me less than a year and i will do it ( the shooting ) . He recently got some real guns .. I al afraid and don't know what to do. But more over , he was in love with me. But obssesively in love with me , scarily in love with me . I then tried to avoid him as i am no longer single . I never gave him mixed signals or anything. And lately he ""lost"" all his memories and doesn't remember me. I haven't seen him since , but as we have common friends i still hear about him , and he still wants to do a school shooting. I really don't know what to do , as i really care for him and still think of him as a great friend , but i am quite stressed out and lost.. Please help me ( ps: i live in france )
UPDATE: I finally gathered the courage to talk about to a school staff. They called a security agent ( who is also a police officer) and they're going to take care of it and keep me updated about it. I soon have to meet this agent to see what she can do , and if she thinks i need protection or something. Thank you guys for  all the usefull advices . I'll keep you updated.

Update:
It's been almost a year now, and here's what happened.
I went to the police station and pleaded against him. he was arrested for over a week and his name is in the police's files as potential terrorist . 
I've talked to him once after that but stopped as it made my ""trauma"" worst.

All I know is that now he hates me , but still talks about me a. lot to an old friend of mine ( both of them meet at a club and talk about me) or at least that's what the old friend told me.
I've seen him around town , and he sent me death glares, but I guess it is expected.
I don't know where he is mentally but , I know he saw/ still see (?) a psychiatrist, which can only be good , right ?

anyways , even after all this time I still think about it and it makes me feel bad . Thank you for your support, It means a lot .",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/7d6l3g/my_friend_wants_to_do_a_school_shooting_and_is/,5,"[deleted]

Sure ..

If you don't know how to talk to the police, DEFINTETLY talk to a school counselor (I don't know if they have them in France but in America every school has somebody you can talk to about anything.) They will know how to contact the proper authorities, and can make sure nobody, including your friend, knows it was you who reported him. 

i want to but at the same time , i'm scared..He's supposed to be my friend  , moreover , i live in france and i don't know how to deal with the authority..

If he is your friend, then that’s even more reason to call the police. If he goes through with it he could die, and if he doesn’t die he’ll go to prison for life. If you call the police, nobody dies, and he gets the mental help he needs.

I know this is what i should do . I am also worried about the fact that he is obssessed with me..

443,e988mc,False,,5,A Little Paranoid I Might Be Pregnant,AdviceForTeens,"so as soon as i (f16) got a boyfriend (m17) my parents put me on birth control (depo shot) understandably me and him decided to stop using condoms since they were giving me a weird allergic reaction (probably the spermicide on them) every time we had sex.

so i got the shot around the beginning of october, and there was only one time when he didn’t pull out because being put on the birth control was giving me some nasty emotional and physical side effects so i wanted to take full advantage of it. this was november 29th

so even before that ive been spotting on and off for about 3 weeks (it lets up a little sometimes and we manage to be able to do stuff when it does) and only after the 29th did it start getting heavy. I’ve been eating a lot more and i’ve gained 8 lbs (weight gain and spotting are side effects of the bc). im extremely paranoid that i might be pregnant even though theres about a 1% chance that i am... my parents are very religious and i wouldn’t be able to get an abortion. my mind wont stop thinking about it, i need some reassurance. help?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/e988mc/a_little_paranoid_i_might_be_pregnant/,2,"Take a test.

674,ejewsa,False,,0,"Sooooo I went to hang out with the teachers son, turned out it was a date and was REALLY touchy, turns out he was doing the same thing he did with his ex-GF",AdviceForTeens,"So the teacher’s son(who I had been texting for a year and had met up with 4 times) asked me to go to the movies to HANG OUT so I said sure. We got food before and he put his arm around me a couple times but let go quickly, obviously nervous.

When we got there he put his hand on my thigh and I acted as if I didn’t notice. Once the movie started I put my hand near his and he grabbed it and held it. Then he put his arms around me and put his head on my shoulder, eventually he started lightly kissing(and I mean I couldn’t even feel it I thought it was an accident) my neck, hair and shoulder. I was trying to lean away from him(so his head wasn’t resting on my shoulder) but he had his arm around me so I couldn’t.

I went to the bathroom to freak out to my friends. When I came back I grabbed his hand and held it. He started rubbing my thigh, slowly inching up and kissing my shoulder leaning his head on my shoulder for a second and then sitting back up. His hand got really close to my crotch and I tensed up, he noticed and stopped about 2 inches away from my crotch(*). Then leaving the theatre I grabbed his hand and held it. He was fully aware I had never dated anyone before so I thought this was normal first date things. 

After I wanted to know what he was thinking so I texted him and he replied(his old Gf is called Chloe)
“Idk I basically acted like I acted when I was with Chloe and when I realised that in fact you are not Chloe and that you are different it was too late but by then you had reciprocated and then I just went with it”

So I acted like he didn’t just say that and went along with it, until I told him I didn’t want to be a rebound, he said I wasn’t but he knew why I would think that. I basically just went off on his and we argued for another hour. Then after all that we both kept saying “we can just be friends if you want” and then I eventually said that and he replied “ok gn” and I said “goodbye and sorry”. I eventually apologised(**). 

Aftermath:
I cried a couple tears because I didn’t want to stop dating him, but then I realised I didn’t really like him, or maybe I do? I’m not really sure tbh. He still likes me and thinks I like him. I’m keeping up with this whole ‘just being friends’ with him and it’s going really well.

WHAT I NEED ADVICE ON:
Did I overreacted? So now what? Do I tell him? Keep him thinking I like him just incase I change my mind? Do I like him? Did he act inappropriately? If i do like him should I let it continue? I NEED HELP



* He actually ended up apologised for that after via text and I said it was fine but he said he was really sorry. I’m still fine about it he was watching the movie and wasn’t paying any attention, don’t know why he didn’t just move his hand down after tho.

** I said “Look, I’m really sorry about yesterday. I wasn’t really angry at you thinking I was Chloe or whatever I was more upset that I reciprocated and you didn’t want that. One of my friends says that I tend to ‘deflect my problems into other people’ or ‘blame myself for things that aren’t my fault’ so I think that’s what just happened. Sorry. Also I’m off my pill and it’s shark week so I’m incredibly impulsive and all of my emotions are revved up, complete with mood swings.

309,bq6rck,False,,1,Am I being reasonable about my future?,AdviceForTeens,"I am an Asian-American born in California to a family that lives comfortably. My mom works in cosmetology and has gotten an associates degree, but she doesn't use it. My father has a bachelors that he also doesn't use due to working the family business. Both parents have split, but both still want ""the best for me"". I never got the option to explore careers growing up. I was told I was to be a doctor from ages 5-12 and from 12 to now I'm being told that I'm to be a surgeon. Of course ""I get to"" specialize in whatever I want. I've gone through phases of straight out telling them that I don't want to be a doctor (ages 9-12) and then accepting it due to the fact that I don't have any other idea of what I wanted. I'm the stereotypical perfect Asian-American daughter with a 4.4*/3.9 GPA at the top 5% of her class. I am on a varsity sports team and have done leadership activities like ASB and councils. I work a summer job and have been saving up for a while just incase. 

I've always known in my heart that this dream of me isn't what I want to do but my parents want of me. Frankly, I'm tired of keeping up this perfect image of myself. I don't want to kill myself all through college for a career I know isn't me. Now here comes the catch. I have a boyfriend whom I love with all my heart. He currently is on the other side of the country since he's graduated early. We've had our ups and downs but I've never met someone as perfect for me as he is. He's coming to visit soon and I honestly cant wait to see him again.

I want to go to college where he is to get a bachelors in nursing or dental hygiene instead of becoming a surgeon, doctor, or whatever. Though it may seem like I'm uprooting my life for a relationship that who knows will last or not, moving away will give me freedom from my parents. I'd be able to pursue these other careers without them micromanaging me and telling me that I'm a disappointment of their ideals of me. I wouldn't be going to a UC... like they'd planned and would be going to either an average state university in his area or a decent private school there. I just dont see the point in going anywhere else and putting us through more long distance than we need to be. We may or may not work out. In the end, I'd have gained freedom, gotten a degree, and have been able to see more of America than I would have been if I didn't. 

What I'd love is a cozy house to call my own somewhere that's green and away from the city. I'd love to have a family down the road. I'd love to have a stable job that pays just enough for these wants and a little extra for a modest road trip sightseeing maybe once a year. That's what would make me happiest. 

Though I'd love if my parents supported me and helped me as if I was doing what they wanted of me, I'm ready to support myself if they don't. I'd get a job, get a loan and some scholarships if possible, and pay my bills while being a full time student. I know I can do it with or without their support in me.

Technically, I have 1 year left before I'm no longer a teen, and feel like I have these 3 future timelines laid ahead of me. Please advise me solely considering the lifestyle to be pursued and not the feasibility of it. 

Average - I wouldn't mind just working part-time jobs at like 7/11, just enough to get myself through everyday. A life where my level of contention is low enough for me to remain thrifty and still make some savings (am not really a materialistic person). A bachelor for life. And basically impacting no one's life. 

Millionaire - work enough through trading forex, stocks and the like coupled with some online businesses, to gain financial freedom and simply carry on with my hobbies and have a family simply to have the means to enjoy life fully. Impact a small amount of people. 

Billionaire - an extension of the millionaire's life, but to use the income gaimed as a capital to start a tech company, or agricultural etc. Probably staying single in the long term. But, i get to impact millions of lives deeply. Quite possibly for the better. 

Yes, I am attributing wealth claimed to lives impacted. To me, that is the significance of accumulation of money. But I remain unsure as to which path to venture on. Please share your insights fellow netizens.

Last Friday I was invited to a party, I talked to my mom and convinced her to let me go. Seeing as this was my first high school party, I got Shit faced and threw up for at least two hours. My 18 yr old brother had to pick me up because I couldn't sleepover at my friend's house like that. It was pretty embarrassing.  Of course, I got in trouble wich is reasonable, but it makes my life so much harder. I struggle to keep up with my friends and I have a hard time fitting in because Im a lesbian and a little bit of a stoner. I NEVER get in trouble though and my home situation is awkward, my mom hasn't talked to me directly for three days straight. I haven't had my phone for four days.  I snuck my phone last night and saw a text from one of my friends who took me to the party (we don't see each other in school bc track ended) She thought I had been ignoring because I was mad, I tried to explain myself, but I'm worried that without my phone I can't do ""damage control"" I go to a small school and I don't want the wrong people talking about me. I'm the good kid in the family, my other siblings have done some pretty serious bad things and I'm just nervous without my phone

She responded by saying “Oh are you not on this?” I said no and it was an awkward silence. Today it came up again, where my friend was wondering where we all were during lunch so she facetimed that group but i’m not on it, so I was sitting with two of my friends watching them join the call while I couldn’t. When I asked again about which group it was, she showed it to me, and it’s everyone except me, which. confuses me because no one has ever had an issue with me or brought anything they don’t like about me up at all. I also doubt it was a situation where they just didn’t realize I wasn’t on it, because there are six of us and the group is called “the high fives” (haha get it because like a high five but also five people that act high all the time) so it’s very clear that they knew only five people were in the group. My friends don’t really talk about feelings or serious shit that often and we just kind of mess around, how do I bring it up and say that it really hurt me without seeming like I’m being sensitive or annoying, or that one friend who’s not on the chat because no one likes them.

I went through this last year. They’re not your friends. Trust me. They’ll gossip about you behind your back. Please don’t be friends with them

I was gonna go with straight up confronting them cuz if someone has something to say about you good or bad  they shouldn't hide it cuz if you know what you're doing wrong you can avoid it.

yes go for it!! good luck and i hope everything works out and they apologise!! i’m not sure if i really helped you though :/

it's a real shame your parents didn't do that for you while you were still an infant and wouldn't have to remember the pain.

be pure..

its illegal thats why

they don't even know about it

How are you not pure?

it's fully legal in 20 US states and numerous other nations.

still can masturbate

dont assume i live in america.

So you don't want to masterbate anymore? Just stop masturbating. You don't need a medical procedure in order to stop masturbating.

i never assumed a thing.  was your claim ""it's illegal in the town where i live""?

but i still can and what if i will 
i want it gone

its not a claim it is.

Also a medical procedure won't stop your urge to masturbate.

Why do you want this gone so badly? I feel there is more to this than just you want to stop masturbating.

you made a claim.  i'm asking if your claim was about your town specifically.  if so, why should i care what's legal in your town and what isn't?  what makes your town so special?

but i wont be able to anymore

im too shy to say that stuff

stfu cunt it's illegal in my whole country not town you fucking retard

Why do you think it's so bad to masturbate?

Message me. I won't judge you. I would just like to get a better understanding as to why you want this. How you came up with this conclusion that you need this procedure done.

but it's fully legal in a lot of the world.  what makes your country so special?

i feel dirty and like i dont deserve it at all.

DID I SAY ITS SPECIAL YOU FUCKING RETARD? I SAID I WANT IT AND IM NOT ABLE TO IN MY COUNTRY
YOU RETARDED CUNT

This is pretty common for young people to feel. When I was younger I would hate myself after masturbation, I’d always try and promise myself I’d never do it again. But sexual urges are normal, and cutting off part of your body so you don’t is taking it way too far and you will most definitely regret it later.

Is your family religious? Why do you think you feel dirty? Why do you think you don't deserve it?

take a vacation.

my family isnt religious
and im not either

alone yeah sure.

So then why do you think it is so bad? Did someone tell you it was bad?

i dont think i should say it
i feel ashamed
i just want it gone

I get that. Well I feel you need to have a conversation with someone about this. Maybe even talk to your parents about your issue. There is nothing wrong with having a sexual urge. And there is nothing wrong with masturbation. I don't know why you want this procedure or why you want the ability to masturbate gone. But I feel that there is more to this than just that. Please talk to someone you trust and feel comfortable with. Maybe even a therapist. Best of luck.",2020-02-14 22:02:02

I don’t think he’s an alcoholic or anything but he drinks a little beer or wine every single day. Then my dad got sick. Life threateningly sick. And through that my mom stayed by him. During his recovery, they were on good terms and I thought things were getting better. But then my brother, who is in middle school right now, started being so rude. Every day my parents would be so stressed out because of him. He was talking back and wasn’t helping around the house. He was so incredibly rude. They told me hey were getting divorced three times already over the past four years. And now my brother is stressing them out. Recently, my brother was being really messy and my parents were yelling at him to clean up. But he didn’t. After thirty minutes he still didn’t. That’s when my dad got mad. But my mom is always on my brothers side. She said that’s he’s going through a stage. But my dad didn’t agree. So he left. He went to my relative’s house. And he said he’s not coming back to our house unless my mom goes. It’s either him or her. I think this time they’re actually getting divorced. And I really don’t want that to happen.

that is true. you do have a point on that one, it’s honestly up to you about that point. i know my boyfriend doesn’t care.

It’s just a trust thing to be honest. If there’s not enough trust there it’ll lead to accusations

You ever had a same sex crush? Or have you ever watched queer PORN? That how I discovered I was bi.

You know, you shouldn't care on what kind of person you fall in love with, you should just wait until you fall in love and than you know on what you fall, and that is that specefic person, the gender doesn't matter, you're not supposed to classify yourself in a group, you just have to yourself.

Explore and experiment. That’s what I did

I was straight and questioned my sexuality for a long time and came out as bi sexual. Later on I’m now questioning it. I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t belong to any label and I just date or fuck whoever I want. Anybody who asks what my sexuality is I just tell them I do whatever I want. I don’t like labeling my sexuality it makes me feel like I always have to follow the rules. And I hate the stereotypes.

Huh? Bisexuality doesn't have anything to do with dysphoria. Am I misunderstanding something?

I took a test for my sexuality aswell, it came out as bisexual, I surpressed and surpressed it for a while, I’m now an open bisexual and happier about my sexuality. It can take a while to really figure it out, you may be, you may not, what matters is that you come out when you’re comfortable with it

What do you do? Live your best life.

Explore your sexuality, there's nothing wrong about it. It would have been wrong if you had suppressed you emotions and sexuality. Don't let others opinion stop you from being who you are.

That's what I thought..

No,it doesn’t have anything to do with it. I was just throwing the whole dysphoria thing in the post. Sorry for confusion

Thank you!! I’ll try to live my best life!! XD",2020-02-23 04:48:52

Anyway, last week I told my friend that I like her boyfriend but I made it perfectly clear that I would never make a move on him, flirt with him, or do anything to get in between them because I respect their relationship. I thought it wasn’t a big deal to tell her and I didn’t know that she was going to react the way she did. So it turns out that she got mad, and she hates me now and she even told people which makes me upset because I thought that would be something that would just be between her and I. And many people are making a huge deal about it and are mad at me which is freaking me out because I never met to hurt anyone. Now I feel like I bad person and I just want to hear your guy’s opinion on this and maybe make me feel better about this situation because I can’t stop thinking about it. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/eyfjc9/was_it_wrong_telling_my_friend_that_i_like_her/,3,"Yeah I definitely wouldn't have done that, if you had those sort of feelings they probably should have been kept to yourself. You're her friend so she should feel like she can trust you but she must be worried about your intentions with her boyfriend even though you know you wouldn't have done anything. If I was you I would stay clear of her for a little while until things blow over. I think she is telling people because she is shocked and unsure what to do. Hopefully after some time she will come round again but maybe don't mention her boyfriend anymore unless she does and be careful how you phrase things! I know its not malicious and I guess it was supposed to be a compliment but I would have been concerned if my friend admitted that! Hopefully your friendship is strong! Good luck x

It was wrong because people can not accept that, especially when it comes to those they are in a relationship with. My advice to you is to not give in to him if he comes knocking on your door if they break up, then you’d really lose her for good. Give the situation some time. You’re wrong for opening yourself up to her regarding that topic, but she’s wrong for going around and telling people about how you feel. Keep your head high girl!",2020-02-04 06:43:56

If you like her as a friend make sure you keep being friendly, but don’t pressure her to be anything more if she doesn’t want to yet, that will only push her away from you. Keep being nice and a good friend, look out for her and maybe things will work out again soon, or maybe in a couple of years. Keep doing the stuff you love doing (hobbies), focus on school and keep in mind that in the great scheme of things your only in year 10 and you have your whole life ahead of you. Don’t revolve it around a girl. You might like this girl now and think she the one and she might be, but she might not. The truth is you won’t know. Keep an open mind and take each day for what it’s worth. Who knows, you might end up back together again or you might meet someone else.

(Sorry for the format, I'm in my phone)

Last Saturday I met a friend to spend the afternoon in a park, since we haven't seen each other for a few months (we're both 19 and going to college now). Everything was great, we caught up with our things, fooled around, then we lay down on the grass to listen to music. Then night came, I accompanied her to a fast food nearby so her parents could pick her up. They came and so our day ended.

So here's what happened that have me thinking till now:
When we were laying in the grass, she got a bit closer to me and asked about my previous relationships, like if I had a girlfriend, if I was talking to someone, if I got kissed in the last time, and this caught me completely out of guard. I answered and asked the same, then started to talk about her relationships, all of them a little bitter-sweet dramas. Then, she told me that she made out with a friend in a ""steamy moment"", all because she was feeling it.

She's a friend now, but she used to be my crush in high school, and I was wondering what could happen if I tell her this. What could happen if I kiss her without reason.

I know this is a long post, but I don't want those generic answers on Google.

511,al6p4s,False,,2,My crush vs friends,AdviceForTeens,"I have a lot of mutual friends... I also have this crush, I had a boyfriend for 1 month in the past and it ended because of problems. So I basically know nothing about love. This new crush is not the best looking, not always well known, and not an ideal bf or crush type. All of my friends just “ship him with me” but then also they are only excited since I’m knows to be dull and not very emotional. I know for certain he’s a nice person, he’s super funny, sweet, and just great overall.  I have most of the day with him and that’s also a big factor. I’m probably really obvious. So back to my friends, on the other hand they don’t really know him. You know how girls and guys have different friend groups (I’m not very popular). He also has this “girl” friend that he can talk with for fun. I’m super jealous not gonna lie. One friend of mine asks “what do you see in him?” Another says “it’s cute and all but are you sure it’s him?”. And lots of them judge me for liking this guy, they say stupid things like “he is crazy”(tbh everyone is crazy) and some even say “His nose is weird or something.” Excuse me what? His nose changes everything? What I would like to say is, “Your not that good yourself. You have lots of pimples and a bit of acne. It’s obvious you wear makeup. Your personality isn’t the best, sometimes your like those bratty popular girls. You try to show off but also nobody notices, You make fun of me everyday.” I know what some might think, this is VERY long and she’s a fake friend. Well I just keeps some people for company or support. Well anyways I just want to know what some people think in this situation or have any advice? Should I stop liking him, am I really in love? Should I stand up to them? What should I do, I really don’t like when he’s made fun of.

How do I fix this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ezaz62/im_struggling_to_wake_up_in_the_morning/,6,"Honestly same. I’m been thinking of talking to a therapist. Maybe you should try.

I would definitely consider asking a change in medicine but what is your sleep schedule? Are you going to bed early?

Also if you want I would suggest some dairy or non-dairy milk to use with cardamom and turmeric to heat/boil and drink before bed. Helps put you to sleep. Try cherries too when they’re in season lol

Fall asleep earlier and set multiple alarms. Oh and download this as your alarm sound

 https://youtu.be/fpQHabt6e-w

I mean not really, I'm a student. However, it's never bothered me before my medication. I was pretty used to 48 hour days lol

Bruh this sounds like a recipe straight outta Hogwarts

Oh then what times did you go to bed? Is it something you’re doing? If you have a hard time sleeping too that could be the case

Lmao I do this as a persian I’m dead

Oh well these days I'll sleep around midnight, but occasionally I'll fuck up and fall asleep at 5am lol

Lmao that’s your issue then! Try to sleep earlier but do it an hour at a time and avoid trying to use your phone or a device that will keep you engaged. I also recommend that you try to help make yourself feel tired before you go to bed. Avoid naps in the afternoon and maybe try going to the gym to do an activity that make you want to sleep

Best way to open up a dry texted is maybe try to play a game with them.

Conversations are going to be short but you’ll have something to talk about. Try to make a bets with them. This will get them either more into the game or you ;). Definitely take that and try to get to make a bet to call you or hangout with you. This will allows you to get around the bad texting so you can just talk to them.

P.S. This might not work for him but it’s how I got to getting a date with a couple dry texters. Good luck and stay safe. :)

I have the same problem! I’m very shy and it’s hard for me to talk to new people. My best friend on the other hand is outgoing, charismatic, and has got the breasts of a goddess. Every boy instantly falls for her whereas it takes a period of being friends with me and my boyish body for anyone to develop a crush on me. I haven’t found a sure fire way to help with the issue or my lack of self esteem, but I’d really love to share the few things that do sort of help me personally. I know it’s cheesy, but reminding myself of a few things I like about myself cheers me up a little, you know, things you think a partner would appreciate in you or maybe just a feature of yours you’ve always thought was cute. I don’t know the situation with your best friend and why she gets all the boys so I can’t speak for certain, but in my best friend’s case, it was her approachability and down to earthness that drew boys in. Personality is honestly one of the most attractive traits in anybody. If you meet someone you’re interested in you should show your best characteristics! Example: if you’ve got a goofy and funny personality, tell some jokes and make them laugh. Or if you’re really smart, gear the conversation towards a topic you’re very knowledgeable on. A huge one to remember is to be friendly!! Most people feel comfortable around someone that was friendly towards them in class the day before, and are more likely to approach you in the hallway or at lunch if they see you. I know this might all be obvious or unhelpful, but I think even trying to be a little bit more friendly would make leaps and bounds. Or maybe you could ask your best friend to introduce you to a guy. I think the most important thing to remember is that the amount of guys that like someone does not define their worth. Strangers ask strangers out based on their initial attractiveness physically and sometimes personality wise, so a guy that has just asked someone out may know her personality a little but not in the same way a guy knows his long time best friend’s personality. I think my message got jumbled up in that string of words. The point was that you have so much likability and worth, but no one can immediately see anybody’s. It takes time of getting to know each other. Maybe your best friend will just run through new boys each week (not trying to slut shame or anything) while you build a connection with someone that’ll turn out to be the love of your life! I don’t know, just a thought. I droned on a lot, I just related to this post on an almost cosmic level lol so I wanted to try as hard as I could to help you. I hope things work out in the end for you and your best friend.",2019-12-16 05:47:37

I’m new to reddit. I want to ask for some advice. I’m struggling with depression, but I live in a household where depression doesn’t exist and that if you’re sad you turn to God. 

I can’t go and seek professional help without my parents knowing. My depression is getting very bad. I have lost motivation to take care of myself. I don’t shower, I barely brush my hair and I stink and you can just tell by looking at me that I don’t take care of myself. I’m Muslim so I mask my hair with a hijab so you can’t tell that I don’t take care of it. And I smell like shit because taking a shower feels like work. Everything feels like a task, like a million pound bolder is on me. 

I don’t help out with chores and I’m basically deemed useless and get yelled at all the time. I’m called a disgrace and a disappointment for how I treat myself and how I act. But I can’t help it :(. I don’t have the decency to help myself how can I help anyone else? The only thing I had motivation for was school because I still cared for having a bright future somehow. 

One thing that makes me more depressed is my strict parents. I’m 18, a whole adult and my parents don’t allow me to hang out with my friends or really even do anything for myself. I’d have to beg to hang out with them, as if hanging out with my friends is a holiday thing. I can’t leave the house and do things for myself. Because they have a sexist view of what women can do. I feel like I can’t do anything I want anyways so what’s the point of even trying on myself ? I’m destined to be locked in this house. I don’t even ask to stay out late. I don’t drink, smoke, etc. But I can’t even walk out the house and go to the park by myself :( 

But now, my depression has gotten so bad that I’m starting to get lazy doing my school work, the only thing I had motivation to do. I’ve gained so much weight, I’m irritated over everything, I sleep all the time, new health issues present themselves to me. And I’m scared :( 

If anyone is willing to read this, I’d love your advice. Because my future looks rough if it continues like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f62qkh/i_have_depression_help/,4,"Get job and get as far as possible from that toxic environment. You are 18 and are old enough to make decisions for yourself, your parents legally don’t have a say in you moving out. But the catch is that you need job that pays enough for you to sustain yourself. For time being that you have to spend in the house you can probably find hotlines on the internet to talk to professionals. And remember that it’s not the end of world for you, there is still hope for a better future.

The best way to come out of depression is so try to take your mind away from it. Depression usually kicks in when a person doesnt feel valued or needed as a person and helping people, getting a job or simply being with non-toxic positive friends can seriously help.

I would reccomend going to a specialist if it gets out of hand and the fact ur 18 usually usually means they wont inform ur parents. The best sollution is to see a specialist, even if they do inform your parents as if u dont it could spiral and youll regret not seeing one

Sounds like you have toxic parents. There's nothing you can do about them because they will never change. You should do all you can to get into college and get a good job so you can finally move away. And to do that you obviously have to take good care of yourself. Just saying, you don't have to do makeup and dress fancy. But you need to keep good hygiene, brush your teeth and shower daily, take care of any acne, take care of your hair, wear some standard clothes and wear deoderant.

I understand how living in such an environment can kill your motivation, but you have to find ways to distract yourself and dissociate from the toxicity so you can have motivation to work. I would say stay away from drugs and cigs, even food is better than those. Otherwise try video games, reading, writing a story, researching, planning cute schedules etc.

Unfortunately you've had a bad start in life and you must work harden than other people to have a good life. But I'm telling you there's great things in store for you if you work for it.

Thank you :)

How do you get the motivation to work for it? And can you do it without having friends?

If you have questions feel free to ask them

I don't have any friends. Most of the time the only motivation I have is to not make things worse for myself.",2020-02-19 09:23:23

If anyone thinks they can help or may have any advice, I’d love to hear it.

Okay so I explained it all to my friend the other day but I texted the whole thing to him so I’m just going to copy and paste what I texted to him. There are going to be a few names in here of people you obviously don’t know. They aren’t significant. The only important person is the one I refer to as “this person”. I am 17/m and this person is also 17/m. I’m Mexican and he is black. Now here is the story : 


So, I dated this person for a while. It was truly the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. It’s still been to this day the best few months I’ve ever experienced. But we broke up months ago. I haven’t been truly happy since. This person was my most favorite person ever. I have never felt as connected to this person as i have with anyone else, and I STILL haven’t. So losing them was very very hard. I tried my best to keep them but in the end, I decided it’d be best for me to stop trying and leave it alone. The last conversation we had about I relationship, they told me that I was a sad person, and that me being so sad made them sad. And they also told me that they didn’t want to be with me because I’m not black. I told them I just want to be in their life in some way, but they didn’t seem to want that. That was 3 months ago. Since then, I promised to keep my distance in respect for their space and did my own well being. It was very hard and it hurt very much. It still is hard. But over those three months I learned a lot about people and about myself. But I’ve also learned that no matter what I do, I can’t be as happy as I’d been with that person. And I can’t connect to anyone else on the same level as I did with that person. And I don’t want to settle for any less of a connection with anyone else, but I also don’t want to be lonely. Even though over these past three months I’ve been angry at this person, and I’ve wish a thousand times that I’d never met them or dated them before, I still have to admit that I will always love them, regardless of what they say or do. Because I know that the connection we had was what people spend their whole lives looking for. And I hate that I met them so early in life sometimes, because if I’d met them later, when we were both ready to commit, I think it would’ve worked out very well. Truly. I’ve thought about it a million times in every perspective I can think of, and I do really think this person and I belong together. At the end of last month tho, this person texted me and said “can I talk to you sometime this week”. As soon as I saw that message, my heart stopped and I had an ACTUAL physical reaction to it. When I say my body froze and malfunctioned for a couple of seconds, it’s not an exaggeration. I texted them back and said sure. They then texted me back and said “I want to talk in a time and place where we’ll have space to let energy fly ✨🦋”. This made me think that this conversation would be sincere, maybe heartfelt, and that it may patch things up between us, not even concerning any idea of a relationship. So the day they asked me to talk to them, I stayed after school and waited for them to come up to me so that we could talk. Instead, they went out with some of our mutual friends and got high, came back, and sat right in front of me for the next 2 hours after that, and didn’t say a word to me. I then texted them that night and said “you know if you have to talk, you actually have to speak to me”. They then replied with “sorry, I didn’t think there was an appropriate time to”, which was bullshit because we sat in the same room for hours after school doing nothing. So I just texted them “okay, well just lmk when you’re ready” even though I was extremely pissed. The weekend passes, and I had already determined that if they didn’t want to talk, I wasn’t going to bother them about it, so I was just gonna leave it alone and save myself any more anxiety and trouble.

pt.2 : 


That Tuesday, they pulled me out of our film class, and sat me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING HALL TO HAVE THIS “conversation”. There were people passing and playing the guitar feet away from us. It was not private at all, so there was no way any genuine conversation was going to happen. They then told me “I just want you to know I’m not mad at you. It’s just hard for me to talk to you right now”. Of course, I’d didn’t think they were mad at me at all, because I’ve given them NO REASON, to be angry with me. I then asked them “why are you telling me this??” And they said “I don’t know how to answer that”. Then we both quietly and awkwardly walked back into the class room. At the end of class, I pulled them aside and told them that I didn’t think it was appropriate for them to pull me into the hall to talk about something like that. They said they understood. I told them that would be staying after school the next day, and the day after. They told me they couldn’t stay the next day, but gave me no information on the day after. So I assumed that we would just have the conversation that Thursday (the day after the next day). We didn’t. We both, again stayed after school that day, and they AGAIN, got high and sat in the same room as me for another few hours. This really pissed me off but I wasn’t going to bother them about it because I just wanted to get over it. The next morning (a Friday) , I get to school early for 10 minute rehearsal. They stop me in the middle of the stairs on my way up to rehearsal (I did not expect them to see them at all at this time). They said “do you still want to talk?” And I said “right now??” And they said “yeah, do you still want to talk?” And I told them that I had rehearsal, and they walked away without saying anything else and left me in the middle of the stairs confused as fuck. At the end of that day, in 8th period, I asked them “Do YOU want to talk??” And they responded with “I mean...if you want” and I said “No. do YOU want to talk?”, and they again responded as if they had the upper hand with “I WILL talk to you. That’s all you’re gonna get.” And I again, was confused as fuck. So we met up after school and walked to the rooftop of a parking lot to smoke. When we got up there, I took my weed out of my bag and saw that I was soaked by rain, so there was no way we were going to smoke. So we just proceeded with the conversation. I asked them why that told me what they told me, and they just said “because I just didn’t want you to think I was mad.” I then asked them why it mattered, because they had been ignoring me for 2 months before hand, so I had not expected for them to care about how I felt. They said again gave me a bullshit answer and said “I just wanted to let you know that I wasn’t mad at you”. It hard to explain to other people how this person speaks to me now, because it’s only something you can understand if you recognize how they usually speak to people, as opposed to how they spoke to me. Every time they speak to me, it’s as if someone is forcing them to. As if they don’t really want to. And I know this is most likely a defense mechanism to hide the true emotion or intention, but it still really complicated things. So we continued talking, and they ended up telling me that they didn’t WANT to talk to me, which was confusing to me because they TEXTED ME, asking to talk. I then succeeded in making them laugh UNINTENTIONALLY, and made them smile UNINTENTIONALLY and made it clear to them that if they had just tried to speak to me earlier, it’s be a lot easier to get comfortable talking to me again. And they said “okay. I’ll try”. So that was the end of that conversation. The next week was showcase week. That WHOLE WEEK, they dodged and avoided me. THE WHOLE WEEK. I made NO attempts to communicate with them in any way, but they’re would be times we would be sat next to each other, and they would move away from me. That happened about 3 times that whole week. They also looked at every single table in the senior cafeteria EXCEPT for mine, and I HAD A PAINTING OF THEM (that I did months before) ON MY WALL, ON DISPLAY. (I later found out that they had pointed the painting out to someone else from afar, without actually approaching my table. So, at this point, I was still very confused hit I decided not to concern myself too much about it because it would only make me even more unhappy. Then thanksgiving break. Then school started again. I gave them back the painted I did of them (because why would I want to keep a painting of my ex?) and I also gave them some stress-reducing coloring books that I bought for them MONTHS ago, before we broke up. I just didn’t have the chance to give them to them, and I had found them in my closet over the break since I just moved and had to clean out my room. They said thank you to me 3 times in a row, as I was walking out the door. This week, they came to school WITH THOSE COLORING BOOKS. And pulled them out RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. we had not spoken since I’d given the books to them. They started to color in the coloring books and even let other friends color in them. This also confused me. So the other day, I go on a trip with my friends to a parking garage to get high. This person is there with us since we share the same friends. We get high. I start taking pictures of everyone (because I am and always have been the group photographer). This person TOLD ME to point the camera at them and take pictures. I obliged because if u hadn’t, that would’ve made things even more awkward and tense. They then started to REALLY SMILE at the camera, and even became a little flirty with it. This entertained me (I admit, because I was high), and I continued to take pictures. We then started walking towards one of our friends house, and on the way, we passed a window that was reflective enough for me to use as a mirror to take a picture of myself in with the camera (the camera I was using was THIS PERSONS CAMERA btw). They then jumped into the picture along with another friend and yelled “THREE AMIGOS” while laughing and smiling, and hanging onto my shoulder. We then passed a camera, with a screen placed right under it, used for people to get buzzed into buildings. I started to take picture of myself on the screen and this person AGAIN (alone this time) jumped into the picture and hung onto my arm again, telling me to continue talking pictures and laughing and smiling. Although I did thoroughly enjoy this, I was STILL confused. So we went into the apartment recreational area and the friend who’s apartment complex we were in left to go get something from their room. This person and I were now sitting beside each other, in silence, watching a really dumb Netflix show that jazlyn put onto the tv. Then I left to go home, and all we said to each other was bye. The next few days we didn’t talk to each other again. It was as if we hadn’t interacted with each other the way we did. TODAY, a few hours ago, we were both at lions house for a kick back. This person was high. I was not. We were there with many other people around, for a couple of hours already. I was putting my shoes on to go outside with someone, when this person singled for me to go over to them (with that little finger thing that people do to tell other people to go over to them 💀). So I did . They told me to sit down next to them, so I did. They then asked me “what you doing?” And I said “huh?”. They said again “what you doin?” And I told them that I was about to go outside. On the inside, I was really hoping we were going to at least have a good, thorough conversation (because the atmosphere felt intimate enough for that to happen). BUT THEN, FUCKING KHADIJAH WALKED OVER TO ME AND TOLD ME TO GO OUTSIDE. This person then got excited and asked us why we were going outside, and Khadija told them that we were gonna go smoke. This person got even more excited and looked at me, as if waiting to here me say “alright, let’s go”. So I just got up and went outside, expecting to continue the conversation with this person when we got back inside. We got back inside. Nothing happened. This person sat down, got on their phone, and took a nap. And I got really irritated. We then sat 10 feet away from each other for the rest of the night, until they left. This left me pissed off and really distraught. Then I went home. Now I spent an hour texting this story to you, hoping for some advice because I don’t know what to do or what’s going on.

Okay man, I’m going to give you my 100% honest opinion here. I don’t think this person feels the same about you. They definitely did not want to be around you at all, the way you described the “conversations” makes that VERY clear. I understand that you really feel like that person is “the one” but I promise you that they aren’t. If this person really was the person you were ment to spend your life with, then they would feel the same, which they clearly don’t.
The only reason they have been “flirting” with you and getting almost intimate with you if because they miss the validation and attention you gave him. He doesn’t miss you, he misses the attention you gave him. Once he finds someone else to give him that attention he’ll completely cut you off. Trust me man, I’ve been in toxic relationships before, ones that have been broken off, then they approach be later trying to “talk” it out. They don’t like me, they like having people to validate them. It’s the same for you. Break it off dude, block them on messages and avoid them in real life.",2019-12-20 12:55:33

Due to some shitty circumstances my aunt(on father's side) and grandmother(mothers side) have joint custody of me. I used to live in Kentucky and went to a school where I got good grades, had good friends, and had relationships with the teachers (like a mentor/mentee) but my aunt had decided that I should go live with my grandmother and said if I didnt like it I could come back. Ive been down here for 4 months and am 2 weeks into school going onto 3rd and she has said that i cant come back. I have a past with depression and so far it's come back to kick my ass.

Now no offense to any florida natives but your schools make suicide prevention seem like a fucking heaven, the kids at the school are assholes and havn't even tried to communicate with me and despite my best efforts to communicate with them I'm left feeling that they just dont give 2 shits about me, the teachers here have a huge tendency to distance themselves from students and make having a mentor/mentee relationship feel like a kill yourself already relationship. I REALLY NEED ADVICE BECAUSE I AM DROWNING IN THIS SHIT and all my support is back in kentucky telling my aunt she is an idiot.

And once you find it,just kinda get absorbed in it for a long time. I know it doesn't help with school,but its something to help you out.

I'm really sorry you are in this position. Unfortunately, you can't do much about other people or teachers in your school. They will have their own way of doing things that sometimes you can't control. But what you can control is yourself. What you can do is try to immerse yourself in different things. Idk about your financial situation, availability, or what you like and dislike, but try to do something after school a couple of days. Music class, sports, art classes. Doesn't even have to be apart of school, there are programs you can find that will provide you with some paint supplies, and teach you how to paint. I know that when I was really struggling to be happy, I looked for happiness within myself. I didn't try to make friends or only be happy when I was around other people. But, loneliness at the same time isn't easy, nor healthy. So, try to make some friends online. If you comment 'who wants to be in a group chat' on a random post on Instagram (like a meme post), a few people might respond, maybe in a similar situation to you.

Sorry for any errors spelling, or otherwise, it's late and I'm very tired right now. On mobile so.. yeah. So I(M17) recently met someone at work (I work at a coffee shop if it makes any difference) and I tried to deny it at first but I'm pretty sure I'm crushing hard. She's attractive, nice to talk to (when I'm not being awkward lol), funny, and just fun to be around. Don't even know if she's single and that makes it worse but I'm not gonna try and find out y'know? I'm 99.9% sure she has no interest in me at all but our first actual conversation, like not work talk, she told me a couple personal things you normally don't tell someone so fast and some minor things that would be hints at best. Honestly she's great but I just want to get over her I guess, for multiple reasons

1. I've never been in a relationship before and quite frankly, terrified of the Idea.

2. Legitimately don't know if I'm even ready to be in a relationship. Kind of coincides with no.1.

3. Probably the most Important thing is that I work with her and I don't want to make things awkward for myself or anyone else.

4. I'm pretty sure I don't even want a relationship right now, I like the pace I'm at right now and would like to go my own way for now.

5. I'm at a semi-pivotal point in my life right now and I need to focus on myself both mentally and physically.

All that aside, I still can't help but feel this way, I can't help it and it's driving me a little crazy. I just want to stop feeling this and just get over her but I don't know how. So Reddit, what do I do?



Sorry for the rant and any unnecessary info. Any advice helps. I think writing down why I want to be over this helped a little so that's good. Thanks for reading if you did. Might post this on other subs idk.



TL;DR, I have a crush on this girl I met and for a multitude of reasons I just want to get over her already. Any advice helps.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/d7p189/how_do_i_get_over_a_crush_i_dont_want/,2,"Ok, so first we have to establish that liking a person is a very normal part of your teenage years. What I like to do is to realize they aren't perfect, and do non-perfect things. For example, I really liked this guy, but when I realized he was a class-clown and disrespectful to his teachers (I had never had a class with him) I stopped liking him. Maybe do the same with your crush, realize she isn't perfect. Also, find out if she has a boyfriend or not. If she does, it might help you lower your feelings for her, because she is unattainable (or they might grow... because she is unattainable). Still, be open to the idea that a relationship or the idea of it may blossom at any time. However, if you really aren't ready for one, don't force it.

Let me just say thanks a ton for the advice. So while I know she's not perfect, (in the sense that no-one is I guess) she hasn't exactly done anything negative or bad so far but I'll keep that in mind. As for the boyfriend thing there is no way I am asking her and there's no other way I can find out except for listening around like a weirdo. Relationships themselves are a whole other can of worms to get into, my biggest issue is that in a relationship, you either 1. breakup eventually or 2. Stay together forever. The latter kind of scares me and the other seems like such a waste of time, not to mention heartbreak. I need to go to sleep right now but if you want to keep talking I'll make sure to get back to you tomorrow.",2019-09-22 19:10:19

We are all flawed. It is part of being human. Dwelling on these and beating yourself up because of it won't do you any good. Learn some self compassion forgive yourself and move on.

I used to love hanging out with people and talking to my parents but now i avoid them cause they just annoy me. Everyone seems very happy and I’m not. 

I picked the wrong career path so now I’m never going to end up with my dream job. To get a job that pays well enough I’ll have to do something with economics and that’s depressing cause I really want to do something in the medical field like my mom but I’m too fucking stupid for that.

Also all my relationships are fucking failing. I’m toxic. I’m manipulative. I don’t mean to be but whenever my dad screams at me I feel bad and start crying so he feels bad to which I feel good. It’s very shitty. 

Intimacy scares me and the idea of kissing someone scares me. Or doing something else with a boy in a romantic setting. 

I really hate myself. I hate the way I look, I hate the way I am. Just how I talk disgusts me. I have an eating disorder and am even failing with that. End up binging and ruining that shit too.

Mentally I feel like I’m still a child. Like I never grew past 12. I’m 16 now. Idk how 16 year olds act. Maybe I’m actually normal and the sixteen year olds around me are just acting older idk. I don’t want to be 16 anymore. I can’t handle all the responsibilities. 

I think my parents would be better off without me. I’m such a problem. I eat nothing and my mom feels so guilty for that. I don’t eat meat or greasy foods. The few things I do eat I also don’t eat bcs idk what the calories are. So I throw that away and then she ends up finding her meals in the trash. I try to eat it but sometimes it’s just so greasy I can’t. 

I don’t think I actually want to kill my self. I just need a pause for me to catch up. Everything is moving so fast and I’m having trouble understanding the changes. Sometimes I’m biking and think about how everything would be over if I just bike through red.

Not everything in your life is going to be a neat straight line, sometimes you have to work outside the system.

I'd want to warn you. I don't know english well, so I could have some mistakes. Hope you will understand me.

Your problems are normal. I don't think that everything is so worse. May be you should relax and take a break for a while. You know, stop terrify yourself and look around. It is really big problem - knowing everything what happening and don't anything about it. If you really want, you could fix your life and become happy like when you were young. Also, you always could change yourself and your career. It is never late. You always have time. Don't believe eho saying you:""You haven't time. You have to do a lot to be happy. You have to work-work-work."". That is bullshit.
I understand you. I am 16 too. At the moment, my mood could change really fast. At the morning I could be happy and wish happiness everyone, but in the evening you hate everyone and want to suicide. Also, I know that problem when everyone waiting from you too much. Your parents want you to be the best at everything, but you even can't eat because of anxious.

Now, they're less strict as they assume I'll stay in line. I figure, this is my chance to live a bit as a teenager. Problem is, i lost contact with all of the people I used to be friends with. I have a group of pretty cool guy freinds, but i need to start getting friends outside of school, making friends with girls, and i feel the need to start dating.

I feel ya about the social life, my friend group is very small and consists of almost entirely guys. No big deal! 

But to make friends with girls I suggest maybe joining a club outside of school? Or getting a job. A good friend of mine met his girlfriend at his job. And don't worry about living out the last od your teenage years. We have college! And that's when you'll really branch out!

Don't stress though. It'll happen.

Don't worry man. I have no social life either. Girlfriends are fun & i'm probably just saying this cuz I can't get one but they are kinda pointless & will just end in a breakup & depression if you really liked her.

they are both friends, so that just wouldnt work out

they both like me...

Do they know that they both like the same guy? If so & they are not fighting over you they are good friends and they shouldn't be mad who you choose. You could always date one then move on to the next..

I’m definitely no expert in relationships, but this comment seemed weird to me. You can’t just constantly admit to being wrong and expect everything to work out fine. For the little things maybe, but if he constantly wins it creates a cycle of aggression. I’m not saying that you should always fight just for the sake of fighting, but you need to stand up for yourself. You should make him sit down with you and discuss the issue with fighting, because it might not get any better. However, diffusing arguments is a valid method of conflict resolution, but don’t make it all your fault. It will just cause a build up of negative emotions and resentment from both sides. So instead try to find a middle ground. Be rational and caring, work with him, not for or against him. I really hope this helps, because aside from the bad stuff your relationship sounds really sweet. Good luck.

Text me how it goes!

I agree with all of this

I told him and he said he feels awful and he is asking me to try not to think about when he cursed me out an he’s saying that we can make better memories.

Well that's not fair, you shouldn't have to not think about it you're a team after all. He has to make it up to you, not by gifts and stuff by acting better

I’ve liked this girl since we were in freshman year. We were really close friends in middle school. We went to different high schools and kept in touch over the phone. I started liking her slowly in freshman year and eventually it kept getting worse as we kept talking and meeting up. (She is also gay btw). At first I thought I could ignore it and it would pass but it’s been nearly 3 years and I like her more ughhhh. Im pretty sure she sees my as a little sister type friend. For next year (senior year) we are going to the same school and we have been talking a lot more and seeing each other more often. This is definitely me over analyzing but recently she’s been a bit more touchy and even kinda asked to give me a hickey when we got drunk at a party lol. But she did tell me about a girl she said she might like. So I don’t really think she likes me that way. Ok I don’t want to sound all “dramatic teenage girl” but I do have a couple mental health issues I guess, and she kind of knows about them? But like not in depth. I always tell her not to worry and nothing is wrong because I feel bad putting a burden like me on her but I’m pretty sure she knows I’m lying so I’m pretty pissed at myself for letting her know that much because now she probably pities me and I really don’t want that. It’s a really complicated thing and I just don’t want to like her that way. Even in the nonexistent chance she felt the same, I’d feel guilty dating her because I’d kind of drag her down because she’s just such an amazing person and I’m not. (Wow sorry this sounds so dramatic lol). Hell I even feel guilty being friends with her because I don’t like making her worry or pity me. But the worst part is that if I had any chance to date her, my selfish, dumb self would go for it in an instant. If I asked her out it would just look so pathetic on my part since she already probably sees me as impulsive, damaged, and childlike. Ugh sorry I’m dumping a 3 year long complex onto the person reading this. 

Ok so now that I unloaded my cringeworthy girl issues and other personal issues on the poor reader, what the hell am I supposed to do??

It makes me tear up inside and i start to wonder if maybe he was starting to loose interest in me because when they talk he always smiles and acts how he usually acts back when I was amusing (which was not that long ago... well it stopped when she came along) 
we use to make out every chance we had, but since the last i saw him when i tried to kiss him he'd do it quick and would pull away and pat me on the back and give me this weird half assed smile...
since he started showing interest in him ive gone into a huge mess of stress (still going through it ) where i stopped eating and stopped working out or caring about the way i looked and when we talk it just makes me feel worse and worse, i just want to confront him and ask him to limit his attention towards that girl, but at the same time i dont, because i dont want to seem like the jealous type, like my mom who yelled at my step for having an old friend from highschool on his facebook and beating him down for every chick who talks to him.

i dont know wether i should leave him or just deal with it and see how it turns out (she might take him if i do that though...) or if i should confront him about this mess and we'd have this huge make out session, but at the same time if i do that he's gunna think i dont trust him which i do! also everytime im around him i always feel so nervous to the point where im saying stupid stuff like corny jokes or awkward laughing or lately a need to be alone to get rid of the empty feeling in the back of my throat and dropped stomach...

Ask long term questions, like what does you name mean (if they have a unique name) or whats your ethnicity, favorite artist,hobbies. But if ya'll arent vibing atm then dont sweat, you'll see them again or theyll come around.

Start with a smile then subtly lead into a topic you both can relate to! Even if you start off awkward as long as you flash a good smile, people will find it cute and it’ll help make conversation:)

I always start with a compliment. It doesn’t have to be too personal, even just telling someone they have cool shoes can be a great conversation starter if you ask follow-up questions. 

For this to be effective, though, your compliments have to be genuine. People can usually tell whether you really mean it, so compliment something that you actually like, whether it’s something about their appearance, their ability to do something, or even a creative solution they have to a problem (wow that’s such a good idea to get two separate containers for those, mine always mix together and I’ve never thought to just get a second box!)

268,eji7n8,False,,2,"Thinking about leaving home, need advice on how to do it.",AdviceForTeens,"Hi reddit! This is my first post, so I hope the formatting is ok, but here's my story


I'm the oldest of six (F17, almost 18) and the things that have happened in my house recently are pushing me towards leaving.


This started back in early 2018 when my parents took my phone and found out that I'm bi. They took my phone away for a year, screamed at me for hours, set content blocks and DSNs, and then said nothing about it for about two years.


Finally got my phone back just over a year ago and they still try to check/take it regularly, but I've been refusing to let them have it, and it's worked well, but I have just short of a panic attack every time mom asks.


Flash forward to the day before New years, a few days ago at the time that I'm writing this. My mom yelled at me for turning off my phone every time she walks in the room (a coping mechanism that I learned after the last time they took it away), told me that she refuses to pay for a phone plan (the only reason I have one is for driving because I have a poor sense of direction, and so I can call for help if I get stuck somewhere, and I have been trying to use it to get a job, to pay for said plan, car insurance, save up for college {something I don't want, but they do}, and move out). And told me that I was a sinner and evil and going to hell because she thought I was dating a ""girl"" (one of my non binary friends).


So I've about had it and I want to leave, but I don't know what to do or how to pull it off without ending up dead or something. I have a plan to try and leave on the 21 of Jan, but if things get worse sooner, I might have to speed it up.

What do I do?

63,erotw1,False,,3,How can I get away from my toxic parents?,AdviceForTeens,"I need some real help that might even need to be legal help. I’m 16 years old, and ever since a young age my parents have had a competitive relationship when it came to me. First off the only real reason they got married was because my mom found out she was pregnant with me when her belly started to show even though she was very skinny. I was mostly raised by my grandmother, who taught me manners, helped me with homework, and told me how beautiful I really was. My mom, however, wanted me to be perfect and slim and perfect. I was always chunky, so every time we’d go for our yearly doctor checkup she’d say that I’ve been eating a lot and put me on a diet. Every year. For a very very long time. She also wanted me to be athletic, and got mad when I’d often get bored with sports, didn’t make friends quickly, or wasn’t trying my best. I had asthma as a child so running and jumping wasn’t really ideal, but my mom would just tell me to puff on my inhaler and go back outside. I get fatigued easily, and so under the hot sun for hours without breaks I would start to see spots and black out, and mom would think I was faking so I could go home. She was mad I wasn’t her perfect pageant queen. A 97.6% grade wasn’t good enough, it should all be 100% A’s and she would pick apart everything. She would make my best seem like not good enough, and make me feel really self conscious. My dad was barely ever there so he was almost like a stranger in my house and me and him were never tight. He’d be on the PlayStation, hanging with friends, or at work. A lot of my problems would get ridden off by them until they wanted to invade my privacy, flaming that the reason I was upset sometimes was because I was doing something bad instead of what I told them. They got a divorce a few months ago and a restraining order but have still not stopped fighting, and often make me choose who I want to be with, and put me in the middle of their arguments and try to make me justify their own beliefs. It has now seeped into my social life where if I’m not home on the exact time they said they told me to come by (even though they never said anything at all until they were unsatisfied with how long I was gone) and they blame the other for the rule and how they’re “the cool parent” and I have to cancel some theatre rehearsals to fit their schedules because their matters mean more than mine. 
This has been going on long enough and they have taken everything I have needed for a long time now and have pushed it to the side, saying the other needs to do it, the other needs to pay for it, the other needs to take you. I can’t even get my permit without them fighting, or go to the doctor without making my grandma put her foot down and say enough. I don’t know if I could live through another 2 years of this and was wondering if there was a safe way to legally move into my Mimi’s (grandmas) without my parents freaking out. Where I could get my stuff out of my room and move it into my room at my grandparents without mom saying no and trying to block me from getting my property, and where I can finally live in peace. Please help me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/erotw1/how_can_i_get_away_from_my_toxic_parents/,6,"Immediate solution - talk to your grandmother about having her file for custody. Be honest about the emotional abuse your parents are putting you through and at the very least try to get access to therapy. You might want to bring this up with a school counselor who can give more precise advice on actions to you can take. 

Long-term solution - One of hardest parts of adulthood is learning how to hold your own space in your head despite the onslaught of judgement from outside forces. Today, this is your emotionally messed-up parents. In three years it might be a vindictive professor and in ten it might be an abusive boss. Learning to make your own mental oasis in environments like that is so important. Here are some things I found help me find moments of peace:

-	Try to make friends with people who are explicitly not abusive whenever you can. While constructive criticism from trusted friends is important, never stay friends with people who are constantly putting you down. Healthy friends talk about shared interests, encourage successes, and in general want good things for each other. 
-	Make time in the day to notice things. This sounds vague, but sometimes the best way to make space in your own head is to step outside of it. Pretend you’re a nature documentarian, objectively viewing the life of a human who happens to be you. Sometimes that means noticing your physical environment, like what a room sounds like or how water feels when you drink it. Other times it’s noticing bigger trends. Maybe you notice the people in your mother’s life have always judged *her* body harshly, and that she’s passing on the abuse to you. Noticing is never about escaping or excusing bad behavior, but it helps to ground yourself in reality instead of in your parents’ messed-up fiction of reality. 
-	Start giving yourself time each day to do something by yourself that is good for you mentally, something that brings joy or peace when you do it. Maybe it’s reading a book, playing an instrument, drawing, or doing the crossword... Whatever occupies your mind in a positive way. 
-	Start journaling, even if it’s only for five minutes a day. You can just make a few bullet points about what you did and how you felt that day (bullet journal style). Or you can freewrite for however long you want (“morning pages” are an example of this). Every once in a while go back and look for patterns of what makes feel certain emotions. Looking back when you’re not in the midst of the emotion can really help you examine your own life more objectively. 

I’m not a therapist, just an adult who learned to do the above the hard way. Giving myself space in my own head to find calm reflection has helped me make better choices and survive, or even get out of, bad-for-me situations.

Talk to your grandparents about it. Talk about how your mom is definitely a Karen. And how she’s controlling. Talk about how your dad really isn’t in the picture. If you really don’t want to be in the house over exaggerate the situation. Kids often get their way in court. Ask your grandma to file a report to gain custody of you. I’m not exactly sure about how you can do that. But she can either ask your parents for custody or she can go to court. Do a lot of research also.

I'm not quite sure if this is of any help but you could possibly start spending weekends at your grandma's house and have your parent's kind of get used to you being at your grandparent's house more. You could also talk to your grandma about how you're feeling and you could perhaps tell your parent's that she think it would be better if you were to stay with her or you could talk to your parent's about how you're feeling about your family situation. If you do get the chance to move to your grandma's house do try visiting your parent's from time to time. Having you visit them from time to time would make it less likely for them to see you moving to your grandma's house as you completely isolating yourself from them as a reason they may say no to you moving out is because they're scared they're going to lose contact or not ever talk to you again. Anyways, I'm not quite sure if what I'm saying is helpful in any way but I hope it all works out for you! :)",2020-01-21 11:34:26

Blue balls

Blue balls is a slang term for the condition of temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate region, accompanied by acute testicular pain, or a prolonged dull aching pain emanating from the prostate, caused by prolonged and unsatisfied sexual arousal in the human male. The term is thought to have originated in the United States, first appearing in 1916. Some urologists call the condition ""epididymal hypertension"". The condition is not experienced by all males.

Just make it seem hella casual and you’re just inviting the person because you’re close to the person. Also if you can cook like cookies or something that would be cool. Actually you don’t even have to know how to cook well. Just try your best that’s all that matters. It doesn’t really matter to the person if it tastes bad.

634,et9fxv,False,,1,I don’t know if I should change schools or not,AdviceForTeens,"I’m having trouble making a decision on whether or not I should stay or leave my current school. Im in year 10 this year, living in Australia and i’m currently going to an all boys school. I have good friends there and I enjoy it well enough but i’m worried that it might not be the best for me for my final two years of school for these reasons
1 - Subjects
I’ve been told by some older friends that the subject selection isn’t great and that if you pick one subject you can’t pick the other which screws everything up and also the teachers and curriculum is average at best unless you get lucky with a great teacher and at the school i want to go to it looks like the subjects are a lot better.
2 - Religious School
The school I am currently at is catholic and I am not completely apposed to going to one it takes up a lot of time when we have mass and Religious Education is a compulsory subject through all years and it is a really dull subject with really bad and boring teachers. Also annoying little touch, where I live gets really cold during winter and all we are allowed to where are these crappy thin pants with no ability to keep anything warm and the uniform is overall bad.
3 - Social Skills
This is a big problem for me right now but I’m really bad socially. I have friends  and I know how to talk and make friends but i haven’t been to a co-ed school for over 6 years and I never really talked to girls then anyway. I feel like if I stay at this school I am going to not know how to talk to girls properly and not have good social skills in general. I don’t have any social media besides reddit and don’t like to use it anyway and I don’t know any ways I can meet girls otherwise.

My parents don’t care what school I go to they just want me to be happy and aren’t really religious.

So, in the winter of 2018 a girl (well call her G) moved to my city and we had a few classes together and since she was different from al the other (mostly Basic) girls i've started liking her. We've started to hang out and i've developed feelings for her, which i've confessed to her this summer but she rejected me. We've agreed to just stay friends, which i've thought we are to this day. Later this year she invited me to have dancing lessons with her and I agreed. But as its usual where I life i've had a Different dancing Partner. On this Saturday we had a Dance ball. My Mom (who is a Psychological Therapist) observed me and had an deep talk with me about love and stuff. Her words were that almost everyone can see, that i am in love with G. I’ve said that were just friends to which she replied, that i've buried and bottled my emotions for her to which i’ve started crying bc it's true and i did everything with her thinking were just friends pushing away feelings and subconsciously still loving her. 

She rejected me once saying that she doesn't want a Bf at the time and now im too afraid to ask her about it (and don't even know how to subtly ask if she has feelings for me). She thinks (afaik) that i'm decent looking and that we fit together perfectly. Heck even if we dance together it looks like we’ve never did something else (which is an big sign in my opinion). My problem is, that my feelings are still buried and I really don't know what to do or how to sort or unbury my feelings. I would say I love G and I can tell that she has a lot of fun with me if we spend time together.I know, that she has a really low self esteem and Likes to play with other’s feelings.

Here are a few things she believes. I want to stress that I don’t believe in any of this, I’m LGBT and I love studying science.  I believe that there could be other life out there, but I believe more in evolution and other sciences because of the amount of proof.
- aliens are helping to stop global warming 
- global warming doesn’t technically exist
- you shouldn’t punch nazis, even if they are nazis.
- all the royals and all billionaires are lizards and pedophiles.
- some kind of aliens wrote the bible to enslave humanity
- humans were all slaves
- evolution doesn’t exist.
- black lives matter shouldn’t be a thing 
- extreme weather is caused by aliens
- aliens literally control everything 
- all politicians but trump are pedophiles
- Trump is a good person 
-vaccines cause autism
- vaccines are killing people
- Trans people aren’t supported by science
- Tran women are men who need masculinity 

Anyways so I had a talk about a recent protest in having about the RCMP in my area dropping rape cases, and she immediately said that the royals that are moving to Canada are pedophiles and they are living with a pedophile.  That’s not what we were talking about, and I tried to steer back to the original topic, but she stayed on hers. She then brought up how climate change isn’t real, and since I’m learning about it in school, I showed her my notes and the scientific documents and proof I had from my lessons. She said human science is wrong, I called her crazy, and now she wants me to move out. She threatens me like this a lot, and it never actually happens, but I really want out.
I can’t trust anyone who lives near me enough to house me, and I go to college in September. Until then, I have no way out, and what’s worse is I started to believe what she was telling me until recently. I just hope I can make it until then,  because I really need to cut her off from my life.

After that around 7 years have passed and I have never been able to get it off my mind, he never apologised to me and behaved as if everything was normal. I started distancing myself from him, as well as my family because it was unbearable for me to get compared to him at every step or the other, when I know what an absolute monster he is. One year back I learnt he attempted to molest one of his batchmates when he was drunk. I however have no definite proof of it or have not verified it myself, and only one of his classmates have told me this. A few months back (I am 20 now) I had an ugly altercation with my brother and I ended up calling him out for it in a fit of rage. He apologised and said it was a mistake, however I am not convinced. If it really was a one-time mistake, why would he molest his classmate? It just does not add up to me. I've seen a therapist and even though she was really good, even she tried to coax me to forgive my brother which isn't at all coming from me. She told me ""people make mistakes but people are not their mistakes"". It doesn't make sense to me because even though I agree with her, I think after one point of time there is a clear distinction between a mistake and a choice. I have gathered up enough courage to tell my parents and they are in shock. They are trying to help me out with it, but nothing that they are saying is helping me. He has always been the favourite and always been treated with bias, however I myself do not know what I want out of this. I'm in a huge mess. I do not know whether I will ever be able to even have good connections with my parents because I feel my brother is always in the middle. I cannot bear being close to anyone who is close with my brother. I am posting it here to ask for advice. My father has heart issues and he has taken it very badly and both of them are blaming themselves as failures as parents. My mother thinks it's going to get healed over time and has even gone as far as saying people have it worse than me. I do not know what to feel or say, as I do not believe I am in a competition in who gets abused more. The main thing I am worried about is I'm scared of my brother, because he seems like a psychopath to me. He has terribly strong opinions about woman empowerment, and how strong rape laws should be and he considers himself an all in all feminist and here he is, molesting his own sister. I think he is a potential sex offender and the most ideal thing would be if he would be locked in forever. I do not know how this works together and what really to do at this point of time. It has affected me beyond repair. I have body issies, trust issues and confidence issues simply because of this. I do not know what to do. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/b61ubp/my_brother_molested_me/,3,"Similar situation . I’ll explain my choice and what you could do . Honestly , the same thing has happened to me . I’m 18 currently and I live under the same roof with him . My parents are Asian and they have never talk about sexual abuse . I was never aware of what it was growing up till about high school . I’ve been molested by others when I was a child , not only my brother . I’ve told my parents about the others and they didn’t do anything about it . My moms reaction was “are you lying “?  . So , I plan to not do anything about it . I could make my brother go to jail , but then I’d ruin my family . Have my families named ruined . I guess to me I’d loose my dignity . I just plan to move out and let him realize that because of what he did , I don’t see him as a hero or someone I ever look up to like most people see their older brothers . My choice isn’t the best . What I can say is , if you want to have consequences for what he did to you , then report him . He did do a crime . He knew it was wrong . I know it’s really hard you know ? But you aren’t alone . 

Thanks for the support. I really don't know what to do :(

Do you still live with him ? Do you wish to mend anything ? Because the offense was a while ago idk what you could do , but reporting him as an offender will help him not do what he did to you to others . 

He's right now not here, he's studying abroad. But the fact is he is a sex offender in the making, probably even a rapist. I'm not doing anybody a favour by not reporting him as it can happen to anybody, and I don't even know if it has not happened again. I don't want to mend anything and I am really very confused as to how it might work out. I am willing to have a relationship with my parents but I simply can't be close to anybody who is close to the same person who molested me. I know it isn't possible for them either to brush him off..... And it isn't something I want either but I really am confused as to what to do and how to handle it. 

Your parents or anyone can’t help being close to them because that’s his parents to . Know it’s not your fault if things become distance . You can still have a relationship with your parents and it can be good . It all needs time and trying . If you don’t want to do anything about your brother , then don’t . If you want to do something , then do it . 

That is not necessarily true because I cannot bear to be with someone who treats him as if nothing is wrong. I do love my parents and want to establish a loving relationship with them but I want nothing to do with my brother. And I have no idea how that can work, because I think the place where my brother deserves to be is in jail until and unless he gets proper psychiatric treatment. He committed a crime and I really can't ever forgive him for that. 

Then report him , tell the police about what he did to you . 

I stay in India. It's practically impossible to do that without your parents' help. The police makes fun of girls who go alone to report. It can only be done if my parents support me through it, which they clearly won't. They are too bothered about their family name getting tarnished and people knowing that their favourite son is a molester. 

You can be a voice for you . Just because you live in India doesn’t make what he did less wrong . What he did is wrong every where . Sometimes you have to be selfish . ",2019-03-27 16:22:09

464,da2jlo,False,,1,I am very confused,AdviceForTeens,"here is some background info:
*I'm 15 y/o
*I have 2 siblings that are in their 20s, have graduated college, and are not living with me
*my sister divorced an abusive husband who is the older brother of somebody very popular at my school
*my parents are: in their late 50s,  depressed but do not get help, only watch TV after work, creationists, both have abusive childhoods
*I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, ocd, and aspergers
*I'm in all advanced classes and in the gifted program

I have not done anything with my life besides play a select few video games (especially Roblox), watch YouTube, and masturbate. I barely interact with my family, even though they care about me very much. I'm an atheist, and I don't know how I will confront my parents about that , considering the last time my dad was confronted with something extraordinarily stressful (his parents getting in a car accident), he had a stroke. Also, I don't know about my sexuality. In real life, I only feel attracted to girls and look at them from time to time, but my sexuality is all over the place when I masturbate. I could want to give to a female, or take it from a dude, or give it to one. I have only masturbated to real life porn of girls, never guys. However, I have wanked to cartoon/furry/hentai guys, girls, yadda yadda. I have never looked or felt attracted to a guy, and I don't think I'm blocking anything. I could be though, and that worries me to no end. That could also be my OCD, same with my trans thoughts. I don't feel like I urgently need to become a woman or am one, but it comes up occasionally. Again, it could be my OCD, or I could be lying to myself. I don't know what to do with my life either. I think I want to do something in STEM and or music, but that could be another lie, and I really haven't explored my options. I have not had any will or desire to do anything. I had the occasional best friend, but it was only them, and it always ended in me realizing they were using me the whole time. I can't make any friends because they either have their own friend group and or are connected to the younger brother of that scumbag. I have never been directly bullied, but I can tell he is up to something.

I'm sorry if this makes no sense or is too descript. I am craving for help, and my parents won't get help for me, since it never worked for them, and they don't want to ""disappoint"" me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/da2jlo/i_am_very_confused/,2,"don’t be sorry! i’m going to try and offer advice to all the points you brought up separately, hopefully it makes sense to you.

1) don’t worry about not having done anything with your life. you’re only 15, and still have a long time to decide what you want to do. i’m 15 too, and i don’t really know what i wanna do in college or what career i want to pursue. i suggest attending ECAs/after school activities etc about some stuff that seems interesting to you, or going to online websites like coursera and exploring what you like. i’m kind of interested in psychology and medicine so i’ve been looking at courses and online pages and whatnot.

2) sexuality and gender is super complicated and is extremely daunting when you start to question it. as an LGBT person, i took a really long time to settle on labels that i’m currently comfortable with, though every now and then i do question some things. and that’s okay! everyone has different experiences with identity, and it’s up to you to go through that process of figuring yourself out. at the end, you might realize that you aren’t something you thought you were, and that’s completely valid. after all, the end goal is to make sure you’re comfortable as yourself. you can ask trusted friends or family to try calling you by different pronouns, or a different name, if you don’t know if you’re trans or not. if a different set of pronouns make you happy, maybe you’ll want to use those in the long term!  and about sexuality- it was hard for me too, trying to accept it, but eventually i just Knew. it’s scary but when you learn to accept it, you’ll be much happier. just see where your feelings take you. 

3) i don’t have much advice about trying to get friends, but i’d say you could try joining more ECAs and stuff and try to meet new people. it’s scary, but you’ll be able to bond over your same interests. and maybe the same for internet friends! there are discord servers and subreddits full of people that similar interests to you :-)

4) if you ever need advice again, you could try seeing your school counselor. my parents don’t know that i see mine at school, and she tends to help a lot with a lot of my problems

good luck!",2019-09-28 00:07:18

97,f157bh,False,,5,My girlfriend came out and I need a bit of help,AdviceForTeens,"My girlfriend of four years (been together since we were 14) came out to me as gender fluid. I know this sounds stupid but we have been talking about having kids recently and what that would be like. And now I'm scared that's not going to happen.. She said she only sometimes feels like a guy but she doesnt know if that's her just being masculinely gay cause shes also poly so the gay jokes are strong with her all the time. I already told her that I would love her no matter what and no matter who she was but I dont want to be with a guy or even someone that's sometimes a guy. I've been laying in bed just staring as the ceiling thinking about every bit of the future we talked about dissapearing while shes asleep on the phone. I want to tell her that I dont want to be with a guy because of my parents being religious, my friends calling me gay and shit, and just being looked at differently when I'm around her but I dont want to make her feel like a mistake. Otherwise I really wouldn't mind if it meant I got to still have her in some way. Even if its not who I've known for a good portion if my life. If I'm missing something about gender fluidity please explain more and if i could get some help on how to break what i just said to her or even how to cope with possibly losing what we have that would be great

Thanks. 

Also this is a throw away so friends that know my actual account dont see this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f157bh/my_girlfriend_came_out_and_i_need_a_bit_of_help/,6,"It can be hard to grasp with but it’s really tough to come out. She shared that with you because she trusted you. As a person who has came out twice, it’s nerve racking. But if that’s an issue, you should talk it over with her, but don’t consider anything drastic immediately. I think that if you love her it won’t matter. It can be conflicting on your own sexuality. But if your friends are really your friends, they aren’t going to treat you any different. Being called gay shouldn’t be an insult. Good luck to you and her!

I cant say I know much at all about gender fluidity but dont throw away a loving relationship because of what others think.

My ex gf just came out last night about being non binary, and exactly like the masculinity portion of your post, she said that to me. It shouldn’t change anything:) fun fact is despite being fluid or non-binary if they’re still born as female they prob still want kids. My ex asked me if I’d still date a guy and I said “well sh@t looks like I’m dating a guy” it’s closure honestly for people who tell their significant other because they have a harder time accepting the outcome if you weren’t to accept it. Just run this through urself homie- is stigma from others really worth giving up the person who I assume makes you happiest at your worst times and is there for you?

Me and my ex broke up because she moved a state over and so she finally came out expecting me to dislike her. but she explained by joking about or anything about the idea of being fluid or non binary it made her really concerned about letting me know and stuff. So bro best thing I can say is

-if ur partner as much as you say they’re to you don’t leave them. 
- don’t concern yourself with others opinions because soon enough people like that won’t be around you and all you’ll be missing is the person that was their for you.
- you’re only experiencing a hurdle which all relationships have.

In the end, if you aren’t feeling it maybe you could end on nice terms and just be friends so they’re there for you still. Not all relationships have to end negatively. If you don’t wish to date acknowledge the info u were given and sincerely close the relationship therefor they’ll still hold trust in you and not feel like they should hold themselves secretly.

Ps. Don’t listen to negativity from others, I’m a star football player, make fun of gay people because they do make me cringe sometimes, and I come off as very straight, but I came out as bi and honestly people who aren’t there for you are the same people that will devour ur future or what u want to do. I’m on a football team with all rural kids which we know isn’t a good mix with homosexual identity, a family of super homophobic people, and honestly ur family will settle if you decide to stay with ur partner. And friends won’t care they’ll make jokes but it’s nothing. It’s all about the personality when it comes to friends.

I would say that you have a stomach ache or that you have a migrane. Def don't mention anything about puking unless you do want to extend it. 👌

Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, 
non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school. Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms.

I mean, how long do u plan on skipping? Just 1 day or more?

Two weeks ago my mum and I had to go to counselling which ended in them signing me up for something called CAMHS. This Wednesday I have to go again I'm so scared of whats going to happen. I don't want people to know why I was at the hospital or why I'm going again and since one of my closet friends is my cousin I'm afraid of her finding out and telling people. I'm scared incase I get treated differently, when I moved to that school I made a friend who was really nice but I started to realise she treats me like a kid, she says ""Okay?"" at the end of everything as if I won't understand and other stuff like that. I don't want anyone else to treat me like that. I also don't know whats going to happen in these visits nobody really tells me, I'm always scared incase they bring out medication or lock me in a room somewhere. I'm a very emotional and sensitive person, I'm always scared of something bad happening and it terrifies me every time my mum or literally anyone questions my mental health. I had a small panic attack when I got there and since I really don't know what is happening this time I'm scared of a big one happening.  


My school attendance is almost at 30% which is really really bad, I struggle to force myself up every morning to the point where it doesn't even happen I just lay there trying to convince myself its worth it. I really don't want to have to repeat a year, I don't know what I'll do if I have to.   


I'd appreciate advice on on the hospital thing and how to get myself up every morning, it'd help a lot.

I’ve never been at any sort of mental hospital, but if you're offered medication, i’m sure you’d have the right to refuse it. They won’t lock you away. You’re not insane, you’re just going through a hard time. They want to help you. If it helps maybe you can look up and research the place you’re going to and maybe get an idea of what would happen. 

I think you should tell your mom that you don’t want anybody to know, and that it’s really important to you. I’m sure that she’d help you make sure your cousin doesn’t find out. 

You’re just a kid and I know it feels like the end of the world sometimes. But you’ll make it through this. One day you’ll be so glad that you did.

youll do great! people will get to know you and if they dont then thats their loss because our pasts do not define who we are today and we are who we are and they are a part of us

I’ve done chams before. Ended up running from home not because they were scary because there not but because I didn’t want to address my issues. If they say do you have a plan to kill yourself say no because then they can section you if they think you have a plan.

Honestly I would say this would be good advice but that depends on where you are. In my area, people are very closed mind and don’t give a crap about your emotional health but will care about your looks and your past mistakes. One of my friends suffer because he made a mistake and cause he grew up in a trailer park. But that’s just with where I live.

2 weeks ago she was calling a children's help line asking them what to do because this guy pretended to like her. he convinced her to send nudes then blackmailed her into sending more by sending them to others if she didn't listen. He even found her address.

I thought she had learned her lesson but on Friday she tells me about her boyfriend she met on facebook 3 weeks ago . She tells me he is 17. She's on FaceTime with him when he texts her asking us to make out on camera for him. I called him a perv and then went on with my makeup. I over heard her saying she will send a picture when she disappeared into my bathroom. I told her she shouldn't be sending nudes after what just happened. She says they where not fully naked so its okay. 

Yesterday I decide to stalk his facebook and it turns out he is 22. I tell her to call me asap. She ended up telling me she knew his age and that he was the love of her life. I tell her how sick he is for being Involved with a child. He can get in so much trouble for even having her pictures. I convince her to end it. 

She explains to me she loves the attention from these guys but it's unhealthy and dangerous.

She can easily drop me off at my boyfriend's place but she would have nothing to do for the rest of the day/night while I spend it with him and have dinner with his family. My most convenient ride home would be my dad. He works and commutes in the same city at night, so he can take me back home in the morning. We haven't spoken about it yet, but she said ""Hey I think we need to talk"" so i'm assuming she isn't okay with me sleeping at my boyfriend's...if that's the case she's going to wait and find something she doesn't really need to do until i'm done. That's just illogical, if my dad could easily take me home.

I go to college and am only home for the summer. While in college I had the freedom to make my own decisions based on what I believed was right and wrong without any sort of control from my parents. I believe that it should be okay for me to go stay over at my boyfriends house because (and my parents are aware of these) I went on a lake trip with him and his family and we stayed at their house, I visited my boyfriend just last weekend and wouldn't have stayed anywhere else since I was with him the whole time. I'm 19 and he's 20, we've been dating for about a year now.

How can I communicate with my mom to get her to understand that though she may not agree that it's okay, she needs to respect my decision? How else can I support my argument?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/w7827/should_a_19_yr_old_be_able_to_sleep_over_at_her/,3,"You're an adult. Make your own desicions.

Hmm.. As always... Parents are more protective of girls. You should be able to make your own decisions but at the end of the day, if you're still living with your parents, they should get a say in the matter. 

Aah.... The you're-still-my-baby phase. You're still stuck in it, although you have been to college at least for a year. You're mom still tries to keep you under her protective umbrella when you come home.

Try making it clear to her that you're **19** and that you make your *own* decisions. Discuss the car ride with your dad, get it approved, and say ""Mom, I'm going to stay at so-and-so's house. Dad's giving me a ride home."" Say this with a sincere, respectful tone. Play around with the words a little bit so they don't sound too harsh (since we're on the internet here, you can't really gauge how I've written it, but you get what I mean.) What this will do is that you've moved on to the stage where you are absolutely used to making your own decisions now. And she can't keep ""babying"" you anymore. Assert yourself. 

If you think that this is a little harsh, just tell her your reasoning. She can't really do anything about it.

We have this inside joke that we’re married to each other (weird I know 😂😅) and at this sleepover we were kinda like flirting a little but then we were hugging and in the background Melanie and Katelyn were playing some kinda cheesy love songs in my opinion haha, and me and Heather were lying down on the mattress while like hugging up with each other and then I thought about and lesbian mini movie I saw on YouTube were something kinda similar to this happened and I pointed it out, and then Katelyn brung up something that happened at a sleepover about 7-8 months ago (I’ve known Katelyn since the beginning of primary school) where I kissed another girl and sung ‘I kissed a girl’ after it as a joke (I hadn’t come out of the closet yet so the girl I kissed didn’t know I was bisexual, to be fair I kinda thought I was straight at the time) and then Melanie told Heather “I think you should kiss Danielle” and put on ‘I kissed a girl’ and then Heather said she had cherry chapstick as a joke and then she put it on, then it was at the first “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and me and Heather kissed, but since I was nervous I came in too aggressively she told me to do it again and then we ended up doing it again and again til the song was over . But it was moving so so quickly like I was on top of Heather, she was on top of me it was, amazing. So amazing we ended up doing it with the song on all over again. It was one of the best parts of the night haha (I’m such a horny spaz..) but after I was red as a tomato, Melanie was crying, Katelyn and Melanie were pretty grossed out (they’re not homophobic just grossed out by dating in general) and then Melanie was like “I didn’t think you’d actually do it!” And then it kinda all came to me
“I think I like Heather” 
but then later Katelyn told me that Heather said she wasn’t into it (I highly think she was because after it she pinned me down on the bed 😅😂) and my heads been messed up all day because of it, like I don’t know if I should ask out Heather, if I should just try not to think of it but, it’s been really hard 
What should I do?

To start for past two years I’ve been wanting to dye my hair but my parents control my life and their opinion or choice basically stones anything I have plans of doing.

I’m not allowed to grow my hair to my preferred length and he says “only girls dye their hair”. It definitely makes me double think everything I wish to do currently. And I hold out a lot of my issues or desires from them because a lot of the time it’s downed or joked about. I hide a lot of stuff because I only have one person in my life who I can open up to, none of which are my parents or family. 

I wanna get out of my comfort zone and try new things but my parents ultimately control what I do. I’ve brought up the fact that I wanted to move out and my mom said she’d report me as missing/stolen. 

I’m not a awful kids though my grades aren’t the best. They’re proudest during football season because I’m good and stuff but they don’t acknowledge my obvious signs of depression. They believe all because I smile and act stupid that I’m fine. When I do it cause when I do act myself people ask questions and I don’t trust opening to anyone because I’ve had it held against me before.

So I am more of an extrovert but there is a really cute girl I like and want to take her to our sweethearts dance. She is an introvert and is very shy and doesnt really have a large group of friends. What is the best way to ask her to the dance and ask her to be my girlfriend in the same night, without making her feel overwhelmed?

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ewvhjs/ask_a_girl_to_the_dance_and_date_her/,3,"Do you have her number?

Are you smooth at all? If so use a smooth pick up line but one that doesn’t sound bitchy with a present or if your not make a joke then while you guys are laughing just drop “you wanna go to the dance with me?” While looking into her eyes and you’ll get your answer but make sure she’s laughing before you ask and she feels in a safe space👌

As an introvert girl myself, I say get her her favourite sweets/chocolates and hand them to her, and write on the pack/box ""would you like to dance?"" Or something like that. Us girls appreciate gifts from people we get along with, especially without asking or them being favourites.

I have her snap and we've been hanging out for the past few days and talking for a week or two.

Thanks man that's good advice.

Thank you. That's a really good answer.

If you're getting the feeling that she's into you then yeah

Np

No problem! It makes both of your lives better because you get the girl, the girl gets the chocolate which makes any girl's life better, trust me.

I believe so she likes to hang out with me so that's a plus. But how do I ask her to the dance?

Yeah that makes sense lol. What about asking her to be my girlfriend? Should that be at the dance?

If you're not completely sure she's into you, then probably just play it cool.  Dont be super dramatic when asking her out.  Start a conversation and then try to bring it up without it seeming to forced.  Or if you're feeling like she's totally into you, you could probably go bigger.

It depends. If she starts smiling and having a good time, yeah, go for it! But if she seems a little bored or annoyed or something then hell no. Try be confident but a little shy at the same time, so you don't come off as either intimidating or unsure. Use what she's in to to tell her, like if she likes games, make a tetris-looking pattern like a heart, or if she likes magic, have a scarf in your sleeve that says ""will you go out with me?"" Or something like that.

But if she's shy, probably go smaller.

Yeah we've been talking and I think shes pretty into me. Thanks

Good lord you are really good at this😂 Thank you for the help :)

Of course I am, I'm a girl! And no problem, dude. If you need help with girls again (like the whole 'what do I do if a girl is crying' thing) then just ask and I'll gladly help out.

What should i do

Reject her ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f64sbu/question_about_love/,2,"Well it’s really as simple as if you are into her or not. If your into her then don’t reject her, if your aren’t then reject her.

If you're a teen, any relationship you choose is inevitably going to end, because teenagers are still developing and will continue changing and growing in their values until 25 at least.

So it ultimately depends on how much hurt you can take. It's one thing mutually ending a relationship because you want to do different things in life, but it's another thing being cheated on and hurt. Most people look back on their teen relationship with fondness if they simply grew apart, because they went out into the world and lived.

In my experience, people who show off their bodies are more likely to cheat, but there are exceptions. It's really your responsibility to gauge this girl's personality and if she's right for you and if you'd even get along. I don't know how old you are, so I'd say don't try a relationship until you're 16.

242,ewsvjp,False,,1,Property rights of a 18-year-old,AdviceForTeens,"I have a boyfriend whose parents are overbearing and overly controlling. They deny him privacy and threaten to take his belongings away frequently. For context, they’re trying to prevent him from applying to college. He’s trying to move out but needs time. He loves his parents but needs to know what his actual rights are if he chooses to enforce them.


The items that were given to him as gifts are his property correct?   What about items given to him when he was still a minor that he retain possession of into adulthood.  Are those items still his property or the other property of his parents?

At what point is taking away someone’s personal property no longer in the realm of parenting and now is in the realm of criminal theft?

Additionally, he provides labor services to the household is this the basis of payment for tenancy. 
If he is a tenant, does he have the right to quiet enjoyment of his room without his landlord a.k.a. his parents interfering?

615,f1y8j9,False,,0,Difficult Sports Decision,AdviceForTeens,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I've been struggling with a tough decision for a few months now.

I haven't played school sports until this year, and I picked up running cross country and track and field. Since I started in late August, I have progressed from pretty awful, to the point where I am competing at varsity meets. I show lots of future potential (I seriously have improved a lot, which I am happy with). The high school I go to is top 3 for running in the entire state, which is already a competitive one, and I just made varsity. At this particular school, those who run are *somewhat* obligated to run all three seasons, meaning cross country and both track seasons. My coach is quite pleased with how I've improved, and my parents are off the walls about running this and running that since I have gotten pretty good, and no one ever really thought of me as that great of an athlete. So, physically speaking, my life is dedicated at the moment to continue improving as a runner. 

&#x200B;

Additionally, I have high hopes for the future which aren't running related, and involve me showing that I can be a good athlete. Hence, I need one or more varsity letters to apply to specific colleges. 

&#x200B;

So the thing is, over the course of this year I have gotten to the point where I just about hate running. I've lost 10 pounds while trying to maintain my weight (I didn't really have any weight to lose and I wasn't half-assing my effort to stay the same size, either), I have gotten weaker, and I feel like a pussy for it. It sounds stupid, but for the longest time I have absolutely loved lifting weights and training my physique. At this point, I know for a fact that I could continue where I am going, but I will genuinely hate the way I am; a sacrifice to be an elite-level runner. I have decided personally that it's just not worth it, and I want to finish this outdoor track season, but I don't want to run cross country. And after that: I would like to do wrestling in the winter. 

&#x200B;

My school has a great wrestling program, and I have always wanted to try wrestling, but I haven't done it before. The coach is notorious for being a tough guy with tougher workouts, and that's what I would want to do more than anything: a combative sport where I can get stronger, instead of a sport that I am good at but hate doing. I have spoken to people on the team and they all said, for what word of mouth is worth, that I would make the team since I'm a pretty small guy (118 lbs and 5'6) but am strong and lean.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to really tell my parents that running isn't something that I am invested in anymore, and on top of that, I want to start something brand new. I think I want to wait until after the track season to tell them (so in mid-may). 

&#x200B;

Any advice on, if you can tell, I made the right decision: Do what I want to do, not what I am good at but dislike? And any advice on how to break it to my parents who won't shut up about my future in running? P.S. they are pretty supportive of any decisions, but I have never dropped a bomb like this before.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f1y8j9/difficult_sports_decision/,1,,2020-02-11 06:31:18

727,e2vz4l,False,,2,Am I Allowed to Buy a Nintendo Switch?,AdviceForTeens,"So I’m anticipating a lot of graduation and Christmas money this year since it’s all I asked for.  From parents, relatives, etc.  My parents said I can’t have a nintendo switch several months ago before I turned 18.  I offered to pay for every cent.  I know it’s messed up and I’m honestly out of energy to tell you why my parents are the way they are, maybe I’ll feel like it later if someone asks, but just accept that my parents are crazy and I’m trying to keep the peace.

They got me a Nintendo switch for Christmas last year but I left it on a plane on the way to japan, and since then they’ve changed their minds on video games.  I had a PS4 that they hated me having since I had a FPS (Overwatch, lol) but eventually I caved with stress and pressure and sold it to make them happy even though I loved overwatch and didn’t spend too much time on it. I wanted to use the money to get a switch since the games are more family friendly and we can all enjoy it together, but no. 

So anyway, If I get enough money for Christmas/graduation, can I buy my own Nintendo switch at 18?  Are they allowed to tell me what to do with my money, can they take it away before college or should I get it, keep it at a friend’s house, and pick it up on my way to college?  The trouble is, no matter what I do they’ll have to know I got one, and again, trying to keep the peace.  They WILL ground me, take my phone, keep me from friends, keep me from my car, and even keep me from college, but idk if they’re that serious since they didn’t give a hard “no” earlier today when I asked if I could buy one. how can I persuade them to let me buy. A family friendly game. WITH MY OWN MONEY. AS AN ADULT. 

But if I get it w/o them knowing, can’t just have the money disappear and when my Mom tells me I should get more clothes for college have to come up for a reason why I can’t.  It’s literally the only thing I want, I’m desperate and don’t wanna wait till I get a job in college next year or next summer.  But if I can’t find a solution, I guess I wait?

TL;DR:  Parents won’t let me buy a Nintendo Switch at 18 with my own money and it’s literally all I want. How to convince them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/e2vz4l/am_i_allowed_to_buy_a_nintendo_switch/,1,"Why are you posting in teens, when you are asking about something that will occur when you are a legal ADULT!!! You clearly have many major issues, because you have the emotional mindset of a 12 yr old. Focus on actually growing up and maturing, instead of playing games. Grow up, dude. You are too old to be playing around like you are a child

Alright bro you’re stepping out of your zone.  I’m 18 and in the same boat as people 17 years and older because I can’t get a job right now, I can’t move in with someone.  I asked a simple question about if they can take my property at 18, not for criticism of
How I live my perfectly fine life.  I’m not asking if I can lay around and play video games all day while my mommy and daddy do all my work for me.  I’m not mentally 12, it appears that that might be your situation, though.  So sorry about that.

I am having a bit of a struggle with this friend of mine she has become a toxic individual who I think is just a compulsive liar. I mean she lies a lot. Like she has told me this numerous times that she is either a foreign princess or some sort of a rich millionaire and uses all of this expensive makeup. Which I know for a fact is all bullshit and crap she made up.

I would ask her simple questions trying to prob this lie in a way like what was her official title and where did she live and what did her castle look like, stuff like that. And you know what she did she would either blatantly avoid the truth or google some image of a palace and call it hers. That type of crap. And then she would go about talking about her mom and all this family stuff which for the most part is her just over exaggerating the story. I have met her mom and she is a really nice although strict lady.

the truth that I am getting at here is that I have tried all sorts of methods to deliberately remove myself from her but nothing has worked and the only other option I have is just not talking to her which would mean not talking to my actual friends who I enjoy the company of.

I haven't done terrible but school isn't great. Talking to people, whether it's guys or girls, scares the shit out of me. If a conversation isn't started by someone else, then I find it so hard to talk to anyone. And if thats not so great, talking with girls who I find attractive is much much worse. Usually if I even talk to them l flounder, I have no idea what to do and am always afraid of coming off as weird, annoying, or creepy. I was wondering how I could be a more open person and improve my terrible social skills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/er1uom/im_15_having_trouble_with_socializing_with_people/,6,"This probably sounds annoying but try joining clubs, sports, activities you know you enjoy doing. Try being more verbal about your thoughts and let yourself be excited, try not to overthink about what you're going to say and how the person's going to react. Don't be afraid to come off as a certain way, that's just personality and different people like people with different personalities. I find it's easier for me to approach people without a bunch of people with them so try looking for people who are kind of by themselves and just slowly approach them (if you're meeting from a sports activity ask them about the sport and just general basic questions about it and about themselves. Try asking more open-ended questions to keep conversation going. But don't force yourself to maintain the conversation, let the conversation go wherever you want it to go and talk about things you actually want to talk about.) It might also help if you went outside more often to help feeling less awkward with being by people. Something that really helped me with being able to easily talk to people was to have more of a positive energy, let your energy kind of attract people to you. Definitely try changing your mindset towards socialising as a whole and think of it as a more fun thing rather than a difficult thing for you to do. I really hope this helps in some way!

one thing i learnt: don’t force yourself into a situation.

i feel the same way about talking to people as it also scares the shit out of me. it’s awful.

You should probably take it slow and if you can, speak to your parents/ a trusted adult at school about how you’re scared (it might help).

If you wanna talk, my pm is open.

Don’t force yourself into situations you’re not comfortable in. All you need is a close group of friends that you’re comfortable with, and everything else will come naturally. (F)

Embrace your introvert self

thank you this helped so far. this week social wise i have been doing pretty well! imma keep it up

So here’s a little background information:

The reason why I want to break this off with my friend is simple: I can’t stand spending time with her anymore. And it’s just that, plain and simple. I don’t want to be with her, I think she’s annoying and I’d rather my own company, it cost me so much patience to not explode and I don’t want to deal with that anymore.

(We have a history as to why I feel this way towards her, you can look at my profile for reference but there’s a lot of rant and so so) 

Long story short, how do I tell her this in the most polite way possible? How should I manage to react if she storms out or any aggressive reaction?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fbtk1w/how_to_break_up_with_a_friend_in_the_most/,18,"there’s really two ways you can do this.
the passive way: basically, if she shows up, you leave. tries to sit with you? leave. tries to talk to you? just don’t engage in conversation at all. she’ll hopefully get the hint and go away.
the less passive way: just tell her you don’t appreciate her presence in your life. give her some of the reasons why you’re ending it. then just stop hanging out or talking to her. 
big thing is, it doesn’t have to be a huge deal if you just somewhat politely end it.

Thanks! It actually happened faster than I expected. Just last night when I finally ran out if patience and calmed myself down, I told her, that I do not want to be friends anymore and now that’s it! I’ve never felt better !

Hello. My name is Moon.
I am a 15 year old (F) raised under a strict (?) household.

My parents do not know i have reddit. This is the place where i can let all my troubles because i trust people on the internet more then my own parents.

I’ll be talking as if i am confronting my parents.

1) Mom and Dad, i know about your porn account and what you do. You have lied to me saying it’s a service for online shopping. I know your login. I have screenshots of you and Dad sexting complete strangers on the internet. I have seen you take nudes and send them to people. You pay for this service, but i don’t know how much. I have dozens of screenshots that i’ve sent to myself of you chatting with these people. I want to tell someone about this, i do.

2) I dislike it when you scream/scold at me for simple reasons. You end up hitting me because of it, and meanwhile, i’m left there crying. I try my best to relate to you, but no matter how, you won’t listen. I don’t know what to do at this point, so i take it all in.

3) That one time i was in the shower, i was crying because you were telling me i was ungrateful and that i was the reason why my pet bird died. You were drunk with your friends and kicked her and didn’t help her. I don’t like you for this. I remember calling you asking if she was okay, and you said yes.

4) I was mentally and emotionally abused by my ex-girlfriend back in 8th grade. She used to tell me i was worthless, i wasn’t trying, and that i was ugly. 

5) Because of that, i started to self harm. I cut my thighs a lot, and simply say that it’s just bad stretch marks.

6) I don’t feel like i have any privacy. You go through my phone countless times, through my contacts and apps.

7) You don’t know i have discord.

8) I am dating someone named Otto. (M) We met on discord and grew to like eachother, we know how we look like, we know how we sound like. We have made an agreement of boundaries to respect eachother and when we need personal space. He lived is Kansas, and i like in Texas.

9) I don’t know if i have depression or anxiety. I am friends with someone from Texas A&M, his name is Dylan. He is studying for a major in psychology and he has told me i probably have depression.

10) When i was in 7th grade, i used to go to Dylan so tell all my problems to. He was there when you never gave me the physical and emotional attention. He was the one who gifted me the moon necklace for my birthday, not my friends. I called him a ‘secondary’ parent. You don’t know his girlfriend took her own life, and that his mother also died. 

I want to tell my parents about this, but i don’t know how. Every time i try to tell them calmly and with kindness, they proceed to scold me for my actions, calling me useless and ungrateful. I have to take care of two cats, two dogs, and i do most of the stuff for you since you are busy fucking in the bedroom. I do your taxes. I keep count of your things, things you can do yourself. You are almost 50. I don’t think grandma and grandpa would like this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/efikva/i_need_help_deciding_if_my_parents_are_strict_or/,2,"I would suggest reaching out to someone you can tell this to. Maybe a trustworthy aunt or uncle? Grandparents? It sounds like you suffer from a lot of emotional, mental, verbal, and occasionally physical abuse. I would also try calling or texting a Crisis hotline and then deleting the messages/phone log afterward. Crisis members are specifically trained for situations like this.

I assume you are in school. Do you have any teachers or counselors who you think you could confide in?

It sounds tough, and I’m sorry for the situation you are in. One thing that has always kept me pushing, especially from a young age, is that things pass and to just take everything one step a time. It might not seem like it now, but it will.

Whatever you do, don’t end up bottling everything up and lashing out on your parents. It will be easy to do so but it will result in a lot of tension and possibly more verbal and emotional abuse.

I do think that what your parents do in their free time is their business. You shouldn’t have to worry about what they like to do together. I would say focus on getting help for the things that directly effect you.

Hey! I feel like you need to talk to someone. Please message me if anything! I will absolutely love to talk to you about what is going on. I have complicated relationships with my parents as well. It sucks. However...
Whatever choices they make, do not let it reflect on you or change how you see your life and yourself. At the end of the day, there is always a reason behind every action. Think about maybe your parents life before you...did they experience emotional trauma or any type of trauma? That may be why they act this way in adulthood. What they are doing is a little out there ( I also think, it isn't necessarily your buisness, and I'm saying this as genuine as possible about the type of sex life they have) if they chose to be unfaithful to one another...that's their poor choice.

We ate a delicious Menu and after some glasses of wine and 2 liquor we went to a small place where we ordered a Gin Tonic. Everything was fine till that point. Then 2 other people joined the party, my coworkers knew them very well but I didn’t.
So I was sitting in this bar and all of a sudden my 2 friends left the club to go sit outside, which I totally overlooked. So I was left with the 2 other ones not knowing what to do... At that point I called my brother on the phone out of instinct. I went outside in order to hear what my brother was saying and I told him to get me, and ended the phone call. Then on my way inside I noticed my 2 friends sitting outside next to a fireplace. I approached them and said that I’m going to leave. Then my 2 friends started to down talk me like I’m the worst person of the night. Which I probably was... but this whole ‘let’s party and pretend that everything is fine’ is just not my type. Im not like that.
Anyway, my friends then said ‘You need to come with us, it’s gonna be fun!’ 
And my other friend said that’s really uncool from me to go home. 
I said ‘Please don’t be mad with me, but I’m not the right type for that...’
Thy then continued to try to get me to go with them.
‘You’re part of the Team you can’t just leave us, you gotta do the things you don’t like, maybe you’ll enjoy partying a lot’ they said.
I felt really really really bad from that point because I was leaving. I went inside to get my coat and umbrella, went outside again and said good bye to them and they were just ignoring me. Didn’t even say bye to me. Which did hurt me a lot actually.
After I left the place I felt so bad that I repeatedly hit the my umbrella to my head.

I was 10. We were friends at first and then got to know each other. He was caring and surprisingly mature for a 10 year old! Anyways, he kind of flirted with me. I still thought it was gross. I followed him around a lot and one day I asked if he promised to be my boyfriend and marry me. He said yes. It was cute, buy then we got older and just forgot about it. We didn't like each other anymore. It wasn't a dramatic breakup, we were 10! Now I'm 14. Never had a crush since, although we are still friends and hang out at lunch. As friends. I'm still kind of disgusted by relationships, although I'm waiting for when I won't be. One day I was texting someone because we had to work on a library project together. I had never met her in person, buy she seemed pretty cool. In my mind, we bonded immediately. We both had a lot in common: we both drew anime, both loved cooking, and hated relationships. We both thought we were too young for relationships, we were still children, after all! And I was disturbed whenever I thought about 4 years ago. Anywho, we planned the whole thing for the book fair and that was that. Never saw each other, never hung out or texting again, until the next week when we planned to meet up and discuss the book fair. When we got there, I was horrified. I saw her and I completely lost it! She was so perfect looking, and her smile was so kind. I'd never even seen her before, but I acted as if we had been friends for ages. I was completely obsessed with her, I practically stalked her. It scared me a lot. I could barely speak when I was around her. I had dreams about her when we were in romantic relationships. I know this all sounds like I have a huge crush on someone, but actually, it confuses me. I wasn't lesbian. At least, I didn't think so. Relationships disgust me, so I never even thought about my sexuality. It can't be a real crush. I still can't decide if I like her in that way! We only talked for about a day on text, and when we met up in person we barely looked each other in the eye. She doesn't really say ""hi"" to me when we're at school and she never texts me. Ever.

Sincerely, 
Me UwU",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fameml/i_need_help/,1,"Your presentation is a bit confusing, maybe try separating paragraphs next time.

Sexuality can be pretty confusing, inconsistent and flexible. It's all okay (as long as you're not hurting anyone). You might be bisexual. I don't know why everyone keeps forgetting the option of bisexuality.

It's also normal to be disgusted by sex at any age. Some people are disgusted to the point where they don't want any sex but still desire a romantic relationship.

My sexuality presents very strangely. I know I'm certainly bisexual, and do think sexual thoughts about people. But at the same time I am averse to romantic and sexual affection, and cannot ever envision myself doing it with someone. But then, I fantasise a lot about fictional characters that I make up in my head doing each other.

first off, the way you write kind of comes across like you overanalyze and look deeply in on yourself constantly. stop doing that.
second, there’s no problem with getting in relationships young as long as you don’t take them too seriously. third, you don’t need to define your sexuality yet if you don’t want to. you’re fourteen.
the big thing is to not get so obsessed over somebody. just reading as an outsider, it almost seems like you’re pushing yourself to have a crush on the way you see other people on tv or in movies. you don’t need to construct this narrative about this girl. on one hand, you’re pretty self aware (too young for a relationship) but on the other, you’re investing a lot of energy in this girl.
I’d suggest you figure out if she’s into girls or not. even if she is, there’s no obligation to date you. try to keep your friendship above all else, okay? and good luck in school and stuff.

I get where your coming from. But your wrong about me pushing it. I didn't want this. I can't help it and it's not my fault. I don't watch that kind of TV or movies because I hate them, as I stated earlier. I didn't construct any narritive, but thanks. Thank you so much for the advice, though, I'll take it.",2020-02-28 09:02:24

But honestly, you don't need a date, be with your friends, have fun and make memories.

You say your a junior so that means you still have next years prom, I wouldn’t force yourself to go if you really are unsure, what is important is that you go at least once because it’s a high school Experience most people regret not going to when they pass it up. Best of luck!

Any advice?❤🙂",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f7buxf/parents/,5,"I am 17 and i am completely disconnected from everyone and everything, not just my parents. We don't have anything in common, especially with my mom. I guess it's just a normal thing, but what the fuck i know. If you want to connect more with them just start talking about your everyday life, but again it's ok not to. Relationships are changing all the time, maybe you just need to give it a little time.

How old are you? I have a simmilar situation and I'm 15. We don't have things in common or do things together either. 
 
My advice is to think of something you and your parents would enjoy. Maybe something you used to do. For example watch tv, play a game or go somewhere for example to a swiming pool.

I for example sometimes watch movies on the weekends together with my father and my litle brother, because we have a simmilar taste in movies. 
We have been doing it for years. And it's often the only thing we do together.

Doing things together can be fun and you do things together. I don't think it's normal to do nothing together. But there may be a time where you are a litle disconected.

No, not at all! My dad disconnected from his parents, his entire family, even, over a decade ago and hes really happy about that

I feel your disconnection is due to more than not having much in common. If a parent was there for their child, comforted them and nurtured them, a child will always grow up loving them, or will at least grow closer to them in adulthood. There is the saying ""you'll get along better with your parents once you move out"" because they make a lot of rules for you and hover over you, and once a young adult is free from that they'll realise that though their parents were annoying, they only did it because they loved them and thought they were doing the best for them.

But if a parent has been awful, was not there for their child, did not comfort them and nurture them, that child will probably never grow close to their parent. So contrary to what some two-faced parents say on the internet, children don't just leave and abandon their parents because they're selfish, they do so for very valid reasons.

My mother did not parent me in any way, and my father was always a refrigerator. My grandparents practically raised me, but they have done some awful things in the past and they didn't know how to parent me past 12 years of age. I feel no love for them and will not miss them once I move away. And if I do anything for them, it will only be if they're in a desperate situation, and it will only be out of my instinct for human decency, not familial love.

I'm 17 in about 6 weeks. Me and my mom sometimes go to the cinemas but it's pretty rare, it's the same with my dad and football matches. The disconnection feels prominent almost everyday, but I guess their jobs get in the way a lot, I'm trying hard for us to do things but they have very weird days off, like Wednesday and Monday, sometimes feels impossible. 

The most I ever do with this is watch movies in the living room, but were all just sat in dead silence, and my parents seem to think this dead silence and disconnection is completly normal.

I'll definitely try to find common interests though 😄 thank you for your advice.",2020-02-21 22:29:57

If yes, then how did she responded to it?(good or bad) If no then start showing those signs, and give it a little time, as you proceed to make a move.

（Edit: don't you dare forgot to mention those juicy details) 😏

Once you are out of school, your social status means absolutely nothing. Always remember that. Try it out with this girl, talk to her, get to  know her, see if you have common likes. But don't waste your time if you don't think you click with her, she seems like a loner for a reason so try and not ruin her impression on love so early. Also the field trip is only going to put pressure on the two of you because everyone will be watching, you could just talk to her and be nice but don't ""make a move"" haha, good luck friend ~

My advice is dont skip the friend process and immeditely confess your love, try to know more about her and spend more time with her as a friend while doing that try to be a gentleman and help her and stuff dont ""accidentally"" touch her too much because it might make her uncomfortable. Normally introverted people do not like the attention so if you are gonna make a move dont do it infront of too much people.

If you are really popular with girls keep in mind that they might get jealous of her and start being mean to her.",2019-08-19 04:02:16

I am a student from Hong Kong. I am 13 and I am in need for $5000 because I really want to buy a new phone, specifically Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which actually costs $5988 at the moment but I'm sure I'll somehow the price will drop by the time I do have the money. First of all, I cannot sell my old phone because my parents said that it technically is their phone, because they bought it for me, and that they have authority over my phone. And I don't like that. I want a phone that really belongs to me. Secondly, I can't use my pocket money because to my parents it is for our-daughter-but-we-will-make-sure-she-doesn't-use-any-of-it purposes. I can't do something illegal because I am a mere piece of trash, and I don't want my future to be any trashier. I tried earning money online but obviously doing surveys for  Swagbucks can't really help and I cannot apply for any online jobs, or do any stock investments. I made a PayPal account only to find out that it can't help either. I am planning to sell my hair but then I am not Rapunzel so I don't think my hair will cost $5000. I can't mow lawns, or walk the neighbour's dog, and babysit someone's kid, put up a lemonade stand, tutor someone, because, well, it's impossible to see kids doing that in Hong Kong. And I don't even know my neighbours that well. I am a student with poor grades so I can't really help another person with their grades. I might do some music covers and post them on Youtube, add some ads, but then, ads are my pet peeves, I won't do that to others in order to earn money, and most of all, I sound like a frog when I sing. In conclusion, I am a talentless, worthless, and broke student who needs $5000 in 4 months. I can't stand using a phone that doesn't really belong to me. Please give me some ideas on how to earn money, like $5000 in 4 months, please. It's okay if you say something like ""Duh! Kid, you're impossible."" I'm used to it. Please just comment something.

My parents’ divorce has been a pretty dramatic thing, and the tension is still loud and clear. Because of my secluded childhood I am horrible at just talking to people, and with an anxiety disorder on top of that my daily social life is very difficult. My mom, who is very emotional and pretty delusional, has sole custody of me, while my dad has visitation rights. 

So I have two houses in two separate towns. My dad is a really chill and understanding guy, and his girlfriend and my step-siblings have made it a very wonderful place to be.  Whereas in the town my mom lives in, I find myself constantly struggling to get footing, the slightest validation, and dignity. 

Mentally, I’m always the most healthy with my dad. I can’t even remember the last time I stressed out up there. But my Mom has a very over dramatic and horrifying story of what happened back then, and if I say anything about it then she has a lot of trap cards to pull. Everything I do, I have to be careful or else I’m fucked.  If my dad were to try and get custody... my Mom has a story to hold over him. There’s no doubt she’d take him to court or something and get him in trouble. Her version of what happened is very different from what actually happened... we all know that she’d get the upper hand being a woman. 

I’m not even sure if it’s worth mentioning... but I’m growing more and more depressed and I don’t think being here helps my anxiety any. What can I do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/cdbs3c/im_walking_on_eggshells_but_unhappy_with_my_home/,1,"If you have your dads phone number then TELL him what’s going on and how you feel. If you still go to school? Then tell teachers and even a school therapist about how you feel and what’s going on at home and that you don’t feel comfortable. I’m guessing you would much rather live with your dad, and seeming as your the child I think you should have the choice between which parent you stay with. It’s your future aswell as there’s. I think your mum is differing the story and doesn’t like talking about it because she’s still not quite over it, and she doesn’t know how to get over it. But this doesn’t help with your anxiety and it’s causing you to become depressed. If it’s not too difficult I’d say have a heart to heart talk about how you feel, I’m just extremely wary about this because she seems pretty sensitive towards this subject and I don’t want you or your mum getting hurt in any way. You could ask to spend more time with your dad? 

The biggest thing I would recommend is talking to someone about what’s going on. If no one knows how you feel then how is anyone going to help? 

I’m sorry to hear this it sounds so difficult. But I hope my advice helps in any way.
If you need any more help you can always message me privately :)

P.S. sorry for my wrong grammar ",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/8gyvrd/im_scared_of_becoming_an_adult_f_14_years/,2,"Use your fear; turn it into motivation. Write down your goals, then write down what you can do RIGHT NOW to support your goals. It could be building habits, working on your soft skills (like talking to people, building your vocabulary, building confidence, etc...), or trying new things. 

Learn about yourself. Give yourself permission to make lots of mistakes & learn from them. I always tell myself that I don't fail; I win or I learn. The upside of your age is that you have so much time to try lots of things and to make lots of mistakes! Take advantage of it! Have fun, make friends, go to events, and figure out what you're really passionate about. (And give yourself permission to let that passion evolve!)

You're already saving money & you have a general direction (healthcare). If you're up for it, go talk to a school counselor about your fears. Good counselors are MAGICAL; they help you love yourself & help you to find your way through whatever you're struggling with.

One of the sayings I use all the time (which I stole from a novel in my highschool library) is ""Master your worries or your worries will master you."" Essentially, don't let what you're afraid of run your life. Let mistakes happen.

I'm word-vomiting, but you get the picture. You're young, you have so much time to work this out. You're going to be ok ,and you'll probably be better than ok. :)

I seriously have a great life but why do I hate it??? Does this make me a bad person? Like am I being ungrateful? 

I’m angry when there are people around me. I love to be alone. That’s when I can actually get myself to be happy is when there is nobody around me. 

For example this last week I’ve been staying with my dad where he’s working and he’s only around me for like 4 hours of the day. He feels bad for leaving me alone but I absolutely love it. Then my mom brings my siblings down and I instantly start getting extremely snappy. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I love my family I really do but I hate them around me. I hate people in general around me.

119,cs6m8l,False,,4,"[Serious] Do I have to love my difficult, self-centered and narcissistic father?",AdviceForTeens,"Hey guys! Ever since I could remember my father and I have had a pretty strained relationship. Growing up my father had a very hard time expressing his emotions. For most of my childhood he was always at work and was always thinking about money. I vividly remember being really young, maybe six years old, and him showing me his bills and how much he had to pay. He would explain how much he is doing for me and that I should be thankful for his sacrifices. My whole childhood was spent discussing money, bills and my father's stress about making money and paying the bills. **I felt like his therapist instead of his daughter.** He only seemed to talk to me when he WANTED to rather than being there for me because he was my father. He never really took the time to get to know me, however, he didn't have any problems trying to exercise his control over me. He knew how to push my buttons with guilt, always trying to make me feel like his behavior was MY fault. He was very verbally abusive and didn't hesitate to curse or put me down. I spent a lot of my childhood trying to earn his love through awards, a nearly perfect GPA and a full four-year merit scholarship to college. Little did I know chasing after those things would never make him change. My dad is 62 years old now, and he still hasn't changed. Sure he doesn't yell as much anymore, but he's still the same guy. The only reason he's changed is for HIS own health because HE doesn't want to take in stress although he didn't mind making me and my mother stressed for the past 18 years. I'm at a stage in my life where I no longer felt empathy towards him. I don't know if I should love him. **How can I love my father if I don't like his personality? I really need help because these experiences still cut deep and hurt.** 

Just to sum up some of my traumatic experiences/memories associated with my father:

1. My dad talking non-stop about his stress and piling his emotional pain onto me . His favorite sentence is ""I'm sick"" (even though he isn't sick) and ""My head hurts"". He doesn't know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve HIM. It is always about him, his life and his problems. 
2. He only talked about money and bills. He always painted money in a negative light, and constantly reminded me of how sad and stressed he was about paying our bills. As a result, he made me feel like a burden on him. 
3. He likes drinking and socializing more than being a father. The only time I've seen my father really happy is when he drinking or with friends. He may stress about money but does not hesitate to buy a big bottle of alcohol for him and his friends. He drinks almost every night and self medicates his pain with alcohol. 
4. He use to be aggressive when I was a child. He would swerve the car if he got mad and his yell was very very very loud. He would basically scream in our faces and threaten to hit us if we challenged him or his authority. 
5. I saw him treat my mother like shit. He never once respected my mother or the work that she does to provide for me and my family. I watched him yell at her and curse at her. The first traumatic memory I have had of my father is him yelling and screaming and cursing at my mother to the point she left our apartment and ran out the door. I was five.

the same thing happened with my mother and it turned out to be emotional abuse. the best thing for me is to avoid them and i recently moved in with my dad. avoid conflict as much as u can and if ur in physical danger don't go to the police without evidence (i did go without and they laughed in my face and tried to diagnose me with BPD) i know how emotionally and physically exhausting it can be but just hang in there as long as u can and if u ever need to talk to someone i'm here

You don't have to love anybody but yourself. Sharing some DNA doesn't make people entitled to your love or appreciation. I myself don't like my father and don't care much about him, neither does he I guess.

7,engdov,False,,5,If you need advice I’ve got some for you,AdviceForTeens,"If your a teen and want some key advice about young I’ve got you covered 

Life is way too short and being a teenager doesn’t last long in life and you only have only life to live,so live it your best don’t make regrets with your life and do what you want in life because your on this planet for a reason and nothing can stop that.go with what you think is right and go follow your dreams cause literally anything is possible if you try hard enough 

LOVE:
If you fancy someone but your afraid/shy to tell them 
The best advice I can give you is tell them how you feel and go with your gut,because chances are they might truly like you too and is in the same boat as you they might be thinking “how do I tell him how I feel?”
And if it does go wrong which it probably wont but if it does I do too know how it feels to be rejected or if the person doesn’t feel the same way about you it hurts and there nothing you can do and you can’t make people like you or love you and I wish it did too but love isn’t about grand gestures or destiny it’s dumb luck and sometimes you find someone who feels the same about you and sometimes your unlucky but someday it could be tomorrow or next week or next month but when that tome comes your gonna find someone who feels the same way and appreciates who you are there’s like 7 billion people on this planet there’s so many opportunities out there you’ve just got to go get it.LOVE FINDS A WAY AND ITS WORTH THE WAIT IF IT TAKES LONG

FAMILY:
Family Is all you’ve got,there your blood and they’d do anything for you they’d be there at your best and worst times they’d been there since the day were born. Appreciate every second your with them because you never know when there gonna go.spend every second like it’s the last and family is one of the most important things you will want in life because they’re always there when you need. 


KINDNESS:
Always be kind because It does make the world go round. If your nice to someone the chances are you’d put them in a happy mood and might encourage them to be kind to someone else. There’s already too much hatred in this world and there’s no need for your anger and hatred too because you’d be making this world corrupt.Being kind to someone comes along way even just a small compliment to someone can the world a better place",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/engdov/if_you_need_advice_ive_got_some_for_you/,13,"Coolio

Rejection hurts, but remember it isn't the end of the world. You'll find something better, and this will become a half-forgotten memory of something that happened to you in highschool.

If you draw or do art of any kind, it can be a good way to vent. Use your pain for something productive.

Shes been ignoring my snaps and messages.
Thank u for coming To my ted talk
Ps: im fucking broken
And im not In highschool but thanks anyway. I'll try drawing

If you can find her, you should try to geniunely apologise for making her uncomfortable. Just because yout relationship isn't going to way you want it to doesn't mean you should let it ruin a perfectly good friendship; and who knows, maybe later on she'll see things differently.

Drawing is just one of many ways to vent, I’m not saying it’s bad as a matter of fact it’s actually fantastic for that but I’m trying to say that you also have other options such as spending more time on your hobbies if you have any.

If you decide to tell him, don't view it as a crush confession; you're not confessing to anything bad. Rather, you are casually admitting you think it would be cool if you started dating. Don't put pressure on him, don't make it seem like a big deal; even if he hasn't been thinking about you the same way, he might still become interested in you, but when someone likes you a lot more than you like them, it's hard to develop feelings.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, I've been on a relashionship with my GF for over 3 years, we're very happy together. We've had some problems in the past but nothing much. 

I never thought something like this could happen, but I'm on my last year of school and there is one Girl on my class...and slowly I started to get closer and closer with her, to a point when she admited that she kinda likes me.

At first I didn't care, but slowly I started to develop feelings towards her...

And for the last 2 weeks, we've been really closed. We started the year always having lunch together, but things started to change since this new year (2020) begun...

We started to get closer, to actually hold hands from time to time, we eventually even started to hug recently...

I know this is wrong...I've got a GF and I'm developing feelings for another girl...but I just can't stop it. My GF also does not have any clue of what's happening between me and the Girl...

I really like this girl. Last week I told her that I love her and she replied back. We spend a lot of time alone.. (we never kissed, just hugs and touches \[hands\])

She always reminds me that I've got a GF and if I want to stay with her (the girl) I would've to make a decision (break up with my GF), but the thing is...it's hard. And I don't even know if thats really what I want. I spend many weekends with my GF, at her house, with her famaly. I don't know if I would have the guts to just end it all, there is just so much history between me and my GF that the thought of just ending it all at once hurts me so much that I have no idea of what to do...

&#x200B;

Today I fked up hard, we (me and the Girl) were going to the center of the village by bus (to take each a train to get back home from school), and at the bus stop (where we had to quit), my GF was there (she was going to take the next bus) and well, I just got out of the bus, kissed her and said I had to hurry to my bus, meanwhile the other Girl she was already moving towards her train (I was not surprised by her reaction), once I finally cought with her, she basically told me to not follow her and she hurried to her train (her eyes were also red), I know what I was doing, I fked up hard...

&#x200B;

I sent her a text apologizing, I know it doesnt change a thing but yeah...

&#x200B;

She replied as I'm writting this (40 min after I apologized by text) saying ""Don't talk to me right now"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I never thought I would ever write something about my life on reddit, but here I am asking you for help...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Should I break up with my GF, and start something with the other Girl?

Should I just forget this Girl?

I legit do not know what to do. Any help is welcome

tl,dr

I (17M) started to like another Girl (15F) from my class, considered breaking up with my 3 years old relashionship with my GF (16F) in order to stay with the Girl, but don't know if breaking the last 3 years of life over a ""quick crush"" is the wisest thing to do.

566,fc2g8n,False,,0,how do I handle this news?,AdviceForTeens,"let me start by making things clear - I've done wrong here. I won't shift the blame, I won't sugar coat it, and I won't start pretending its ok. I messed up. I've apologized and I apologize again.  I've had issues mentally (anxiety) for a while now, but this particular issue started nearly a week ago.  I was feeling particularly bad leading up to this, so I decided to visit a friend (person one) who is quite good to be around (to make this better, this person knows I've had a crush on them before but we were over that). through the day we hung out, talked, I taught them some self-defense and we had fun, and that was it. the week went on fine, and then 5 days later was my birthday party. myself, person one and a few others (including person two).  we had an attempt at a game, which dissolved into drunk comedy and fun, though I noticed at one point person two was a lot cuddlier that night. I didn't think much of it, however, as most people who were there are very physical like that platonically and I knew person two definitely didn't/doesn't have feelings for me, which is fine. the following dad, myself self and my dad were discussing the night and laughing about it when he said that apparently person two was being cuddly to distract me from person one. this didn't immediately say anything to me, but between then and me messaging them earlier tonight it started to grow on me. it soon reached me messaging them about my head, and I also mentioned that I heard about the planned hugging. to abbreviate what they said they were actually quite uncomfortable about what happened and didn't want to make things awkward between us by saying so, so I asked person two to make sure nothing stupid happened. again, what happened was clearly my fault and ill hold my hands up to it, but my problem lies with the fact I now have to think about what I trust. can I trust my friends to be honest with me, can I trust myself to not take things to far? can I trust that I'm not going to depend on people and that I'm not going to cause harm around me? how do I go about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/fc2g8n/how_do_i_handle_this_news/,1,,2020-03-02 07:08:54

664,ellylg,False,,0,my mother and i,AdviceForTeens,"I just started crying in front of my mom today for several reasons but none of which my mom thinks it is. I might think nothing of this tomorrow and will probably delete this post tomorrow but for now, I need a source to get it out somewhere so I can study.

  
I come from an old school Korean background so it's typical for moms to not really listen to personal stories of their children unless under VERY special circumstances. My mom is pretty nice and unique so she likes to be more friend-like with me so we talk (one way) to each other a lot (and I'm an only child so things can get boring). I like to tell my mom frustrating stories of my friends which I empathize about because it's fun and sometimes helpful to hear her opinion. She rarely does give any comments to any of my stories. My mom's not the type of person who speaks a few words, in fact, she talks a lot. The problem is she likes to talk a lot about things she wants to according to her mood. I've always been matching myself to riding her tide in a conversation and I feel like that habit gets her into some trouble at work. 

  
Recently, I've been \*blossoming\* into my late teens and my relationship with my mom has gotten better. Amid my puberty, we were literally at each others' necks (ok, well, to be fair she entered menopause too). When I'm giving her one of my stories of the day, the glint in her eye tells me she's somewhere else in her world. I don't know if it is because I'm still immature or not, but I find this unfair. For years I've been listening to her stories whether I liked it or not but that's not exactly the reason why I'm upset. My mom likes to do many activities after work, like exercising, shopping and learning more English (through Netflix shows). I'm totally okay with my mom wanting to do the activities she wants to do but I just wish she would listen to some of my stories. I never ask her to listen to what I'm stressing about at school because that makes me more stressed out, but I just want her to listen to one of my random stories. This really helps out a lot. On purpose, I try not to talk to her when she's busy doing something at home or when she's enjoying her free time. I only try to talk to her when we're finishing off dinner and that's when she's in her greatest mood. For all the Asians out there, you might tell me to suck it up, but I really don't have anyone to talk to because this kind of links to family stuff that I don't want to share and my dad worked far away since I was small so I don't feel any connections to him (all he talks about, IF he does, is world history which is probably inaccurate on his side).  
I've tried to seriously talk to my mom about it, but she would make a huge turn in the conversation and scold me for something recently I did wrong, which is always linked to Korean manners and I always don't understand what I did wrong because I was born in Canada. 

  
I know talking about this sounds like boasting but compared to other kids I don't really ask for much (although I should ask myself about why my marks are like that in school). I earn my own spending money and the only time I really get anything from my parents is during Christmas and my birthday (and those two are in close proximity so I really just get one big gift). This excludes the afterschool activities I go to and the very few vacations I went on when I was younger.  
My mom likes to focus on how much money she spends on me because I go to extra math classes after school. What I really want is for her to realize my mental health would do so much better if she could listen to my random (maybe boring) stories once every day for a maximum of 15 mins.

  
Oh, and my mom only listens to me when I give her advice about socializing at work (she's bad at it and she admits it too). I really don't like that because my mom knows I have scarring memories from fRiEnDs using me as an advice bot. 

  
How can I get the message across to my mom that I need a little time to vent in front of her?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/ellylg/my_mother_and_i/,1,,2020-01-08 10:14:18

364,f559mr,False,,3,A little story for ya...,AdviceForTeens,"So I really feel in an empty space right now, let me tell you the reason why: So I met this girl in school and we just met on social media and texted and stuff. Then we actually started meeting in passing periods, whatever time we had, we used, we had so many jokes and fun with eachother. We passed so many notes and made weird eye contact that also made us laugh. The thing is that we were never able to talk to eachother much because the closer we became, the more shy I got. By a year or so, I was barely able to even sit by her at a table without holding my breath because of how shy i was. As you already figured, ive caught feelings. I was better off like this, having friends and crushes, as i would not be ready to have a date and take on that responsibility at that time. And as dumb as i was, another girl came up and i instantly got attached to her, our friendship eventually disappeared, we just texted for homework help which we do partly now, but after i started dating this other girl i knew i couldnt be responsible. I broke up with her so she could find better people then me. So these days at school, we still make eye contact somehow where ever i look, its never the same because we just look. Every corner i look at i always make eye contact with her. I miss those times, where we would just be buddies til the end. I want to build that bond back, but my shy self wont let me. All i can do is look and see her everywhere. I feel that ive receded in life back to when i met her, but shes no longer the person i see in passing peiod talking to me and waving. We always high fived, and i wish we could go back in time. But it always leads back to her. No, im not planning to date her, i just want to start over and become best friends with her again. someday ill gain the guts to actually be the person to high five her, as shes the person who usually does it. Though it may seem little, it goes a long way for this guy. I really want this friendship back, without it, im sitting in sand, trying to get her off my mind, finding hobbies so i could do it, but it all leads back to her. I tell you this story so i dont die of holding this thought in every second of the day. to her even though she wont see it: im sorry that i was so why not being able to talk to you when i had the chance, i wish i could fix that from the start i met you. thanks. im sorry if i hopped to random topics that you couldnt understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/f559mr/a_little_story_for_ya/,2,"Hmm try sitting near her at lunch and strike up a conversation. If she responds well keep going. Do that for a while and then be like ""hey we should meet up sometime"" if she agrees plan it then ""ok how about the weekend at ________"" then when you hang out have some time where yous just vibe and after a while explain why you stopped talking (you don't have to mention the crush part but explain you're quite shy) she'll probably understand and yknow keep your friendship going after that. I too get really nervous when talking to people so I know it'll be difficult but, that's all I could think of.

Well most of the time she sits by her friends, one i know really well and are currently friends rn. Its kind if of rare to see her alone, as her friends are always around her.

286,dpvoat,False,,5,How do I ask my mother this sketchy question?,AdviceForTeens,"So I obviously need some advice. The advice I need is on how to bring up a question, and ask said question.

I need help on how to bring up and ask the question of, can my best female friend and I fly to a different state that's a while away alone (without an adult) to meet an online friend of mine. I know this sounds pretty sketchy but for some background I will include the following paragraph.

I met him online playing video games. We ended up talking and what not. We've been talking for a couple months now. I think of him as my bestest friend, someone closer then all of my other friends. We both really want to meet each other. He's a minor like myself and our age difference is very small. I know for a fact that he is a minor, not some older man pretending to be a teenager. The reason we haven't meet up is because of the large distance between us.

So that's the background. I already accounted for the cost of plane tickets, baggage, someone to go with, and a public place to meet. I will be paying for the whole trip for myself and my friend so my mother won't have to spend a penny on it. We're only going over for a day, and we (my friend and I) will be missing one or two days of school. We would go late one night so we'd get there in the morning then leave that day. We will be meeting at a very public place with tons of people. He might be bringing male friends as well. 

Just for the record because I feel like this will go along with what my mother will say, I am a responsible person. I act mature, never get in trouble, get good grades, ect. So if that helps any it's there. 

Also an extra question that I haven't quite thought out. My friend and I are legally allowed to fly alone but need a guardians signature. How would I do that on a round trip?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/comments/dpvoat/how_do_i_ask_my_mother_this_sketchy_question/,3,"Really depends on how old you are.

As mentioned by others, that’s really not ok but I get it, you’re a teenager. Try to find someone you can talk to who you’re confident wont get u in trouble and tell them about it. Getting stuff off your chest helps sometimes. And u should probably talk to ur sister about it and smooth things over so it’s not as awkward every time u see her. And if anything like this happens again, remember that we live in the most sexually-free generation ever so u can go online and either get free porn or if you want something other than a “one-man job” u can go on Snapchat, or instagram and try to get a dating relationship out of it. Honestly, I would’ve encourage hooking up for one night stands at any age let alone 15 bc it’ll damage your reputation with any girl and some guys who find out and rumors and stuff spread quick and before you know it all your friends will be texting you because this girl is accusing you of rape bc she has been shammed by her friends for having a one night stand. Take it from me. It happened to one of my buddies a few months ago. It was horrible. He couldn’t come to school for a few weeks and was destroyed.

Yeah. This is really not okay. You should talk to a counselor or something about it. It’s all confidential according to their policies.
