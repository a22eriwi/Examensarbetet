928,9yk0u8,False,,68,Starting a Company is a lot like doing a PhD,Entrepreneur,"So I was recently talking to my friend who has her PhD in Engineering as well as has worked at several startups as a CTO. She hit me with a big analogy that rang true.

&#x200B;

Starting a company is a lot like doing a PhD you can sprint and try to be done in 3 years while being stressed and having no family or social life, or you can take 5 years and probably still get there while having a more balanced life.  Really the only thing that changes how long you like to stay broke and in bad working conditions.

I was recently at a large startup competition and I always ask fellow entrepreneurs how many hours do you work and it ranges from 40-80+ I always felt like I was on the low end usually putting in an honest 20-30 with perhaps 10-20 of administrative tasks anyone could do like booking tickets.   I was amazed and mortified of these guys I see who have way more roles and responsibilities than me.   Especially those that had a bigger team size.  


We were all in similar stages all in similar profits and revenue yet they were killing themselves and I feel the most fulfilled and happy overall I've ever been.  I learned in my technical career there there is just a limit to how much you can do of technical work be it financial statements, SEO or marketing or engineering or software dev.  Rather than try to load my schedule as much as possible I looked hard at automating the business and always finding people better to offload the tasks while I work one what I'm truly good at. I would rather focus and do 10 hours a week of amazing work, than 80 hours a week at 3 job functions I'm just descent at.    


I chose to take 5 years to build a company instead of 3 but I think we found the opposite, by delighting just a few customers and putting out really technical and great work (that probably took us a few months longer) we deferred a lot of fluff work that didn't  actually further the objectives. We are crazily enough ahead of schedule and budget even though we can only afford 1 full time engineer.  Also since I'm usually rested and low stress I have a chance to prepare for ""big client"" meetings and knock them out of the park.  


 Another entrepreneur said it best:  ""would you want to train your whole life for the Olympics and then the day before your event run a marathon?"" Many of us finally land big meetings iwth landmark customers, or investors or give talks.  Why would I want to work 16 hours the day before I had a big client presentation instead of taking 4 hours to tweak the slides and practice and calling it a day to go rest wit the family?

&#x200B;

I don't think I have a point or even a conclusion I just see a lot of people burning themselves out with work that doesn't actually further the business while I feel I'm doing more with less and still meeting the same metrics as our peers.  My biggest advice to fellow entrepreneurs is to be honest about what you're actually good at and do it as much as possible and differ the other work to those who are better ""but I can't afford to hire a full team""  You're right neither can I, my chief job is making the people on my team and customers excited, I can't compete with google and amazon for salary, but I can offer exciting work or find junior engineers stuck in corporate environments who want to expand faster than they could and give them work opportunities that they otherwise would have to wait a decade to earn in a big corporate.  Use your tools to your advantage they don't all have to be cash on hand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9yk0u8/starting_a_company_is_a_lot_like_doing_a_phd/,407,"When you work only 40 hour weeks and I work 80, after just 1 year of work you will never ever ever catch up to me.

516,32gwjj,False,,191,"April 2014 I started a trucking company while working a full time job, acheiving nearly $360,000 in annualized sales. AMA",Entrepreneur,"[Year Two Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4j7kcr/year_2_update_i_started_a_trucking_company_while/)

The entrepreneurial community tends to be very ""all or nothing"", and it's easy to see why; the risk and commitment required to build a successful business often requires everything of a business owner. However, in my opinion, this is not always the case. My business story is not all or nothing, but rather a highly stressful flirt with insanity that seems to be headed in the right direction. 

To provide personal background: I am 23 years old. In 2012, I graduated from a US university with a BBA in Finance and Real Estate; in 2013 I graduated with my MBA in the same fields. In 2014, I started full time as a valuation associate at a Mergers and Acquisition firm and, 3 months into my position, **I started a trucking company that posted 2014 revenue of $293,278.78 and 2014 EBIT of $26,589.82.** I invested no personal money (to start), had no credit history, no industry experience, and no clue if it would work out. This is the story of how I did it, where we are today, and where we are planning to go. 

**The Idea**

The idea started very basic, evolving the more I dove into the industry research. Originally, my plan was to operate as a broker for trucks that haul aggregate and other various loose materials. A broker, by definition, is a company who adds minimal value, but operates as a middle man between large construction companies and individual truck drivers. The brokerage exists because drivers cannot individually facilitate large contracts requiring 5+ trucks and cannot afford to be paid once every 30-60 days. As such, the drivers use a broker to find work and buy their weekly invoices (which are sold for 5% of total gross). Specifically, I was looking to target the construction industry as it is usually very local in nature, has long account receivable gaps (30-60-90 days to get paid), has high demand, and is very fragmented. My role would be to secure a line of credit with a local bank ($100,000-$150,000), hire a dispatcher to find work, and have the dispatcher send the trucks on routes.

I liked this business model quite a bit. My role would be minimal, simply managing Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. I could immediately grow the business up to $15-$30,000 a week in gross receipts (~$800 - $1,500 gross profit) and would have a very limited risk/work load. However, the more I looked into the industry, the more opportunity I saw in actually owning equipment and hiring drivers on my own. To gather data, I pulled my step-fathers numbers from the previous 6 months. I input these numbers in an excel model *(see model images attached)* for rough performance estimates, comparing them to what I could find on online forums and by asking around the industry. By November of 2013, I had a very developed excel model that projected a business with between 15-20% net profit in conservative conditions. 

**Beginning**

In January of 2014 I was hired at my first full-time, non-self-employed, job as a valuation associate at a mergers and acquisitions firm, which I still hold today. My role is to work directly with small business owners (average $4M in value) to create a professional financial model and pitchbook for an eventual sale. *Side note, feel free to ask questions about this as well. To date I have valued around 50 businesses, worth about $205,000,000.* My business took a back seat for my first month on the job, but I quickly picked up the pace and, by February, I was searching for financing. I prepared a very detailed pitchbook and set appointments at every bank in my home town. I met with about 5 separate banks, all of which had zero interest in lending money to a 22 year old operating in a historically high risk industry (most didn't even open my 20+ page pitchbook). Having struck out there, I looked online for construction equipment lenders. I found about 20 lenders and messaged each directly. To my surprise, about 3 wanted to lend to me. To my further surprise, each wanted well over 20% interest to carry the notes. Initially I was appalled that these rates were offered, but after further research my model said the payment was easily afforded, despite the high rates, and I pursued financing up until the closing table. 

Almost by complete chance, my father (who works in the construction industry) had a conversation with the financing department at Richie Bros (a heavy equipment auction company). That conversation led to me stalling the previously offered note and I eventually secured a 6% note with RB in the following 72 hours. During this time, I had been in contact with a close friend of mine who agreed to buy 10% of the Company for $10,000 in working capital, giving us the cash needed to get started.

**Establishing Connections, Purchasing Equipment, and Starting Business**

While originally against the idea, I knew that my father (connected in the industry and a great mechanic) was going to be a resource that I had to have 100% on my team. Until I started actively pursuing financing, he was wholeheartedly against me starting a business. I'm sure I'll receive flak for his role in the business, but I believe a good businessman leverages the strengths of those around him, and (if it helps) it proved to be an expensive relationship to have. To bring him on board, I had him create a separate equipment rental company. His role would be to purchase the trailers that I would rent and, in exchange, I would pay for all maintenance, repairs, and related expenses if he agreed to help me work on equipment. 

Having the financing and team in place, I purchased my first truck (2003 Mack CH613) in April of 2014 for $22,625.38 in an equipment auction, he purchased his first trailer (2013 Asher Belly Dump) for $33,356.97 around the same time. 

From there, I placed ads on craigslist looking for a driver. I hire all drivers on a 1099 basis, which allows me to avoid any employee benefits and tax obligations. I found my first driver very quickly, called a broker who I had established a relationship with (refer to my original idea, it's someone who does that), and let the broker dispatch my truck. My role from then on was very simple: I took calls from the driver, I paid/performed all minor to medium repairs, and I managed all invoicing. 

**Growth**

The business model was strong, quickly proving itself to be profitable for everyone involved. However, it was clear that there were major economies of scale benefits that we were losing out on. Specifically, we were losing 5% of gross revenue through the broker, we were losing 2% on our fuel bill by using the broker fuel account, and we were losing majorly in the form of downtime. As a general rule of thumb (referencing downtime), you always buy trucks in a set of three. If you own one truck, when that truck is down you lose significant money (you don't run and you pay for repairs). If you own two trucks, when one truck is down you break even. If you own three, when one truck is down you profit on the third truck. While not a perfect rule, it was very clear that it was proving to be true. We were profitable, but by my account we were leaving at least 10% of revenue on the table by not having the additional 2 trucks and by maintaining our relationship with the broker. At this point, however, I did not feel comfortable managing a fleet of three. So, in May of 2014, I purchased my second truck (father purchased second trailer), and we continued operations with the broker. The hands-off business model was still working and, having just hit stride in my new corporate position, I believed the 5-10% broker expense was justified. 

The next few months proved uneventful, but the numbers continued to improve. By September, I was preparing for further expansion and for my split from the brokerage. I again applied for financing through the same source as the previous two loans and was almost immediately approved (you'd be surprised how easy it is to find money once you prove your business model). I purchased my third truck (fathers third trailer) in October. By the start of November, I split away from the broker and was running a dedicated route for the company my dad works for. In just November of 2014, running at full capacity, my company earned over $20,000 in EBIT. The rapid growth and split from the local brokerage firm had paid off.

*Important note: this route is an arms-length transaction. My dad's company is one of the largest employers of trucks in the area. I'm paid average to below average rates on routes that are normally sent to brokers, I just offer to run them as a reliable, dedicated driver which is attractive to the client. My company had to prove it was capable, it was not handed to me in any way.*

**Greed Kills**

In November of 2014 I was pretty high on the horse. In just 8 months I had created a business that earned my two weeks corporate pay nearly every day. I was unstoppable.... and foolish. I purchased two more trucks on December 1, 2014 (dad purchased one trailer), bringing the total count to 5 trucks and 4 trailers. The idea was pretty simple: I'll have 4 trucks running and 1 truck as a spare, just in case any others go down for repair (they did quite a bit), which will significantly reduce one of my biggest expenses: downtime. At this point, I have a combined $208,869.73 financed at a weighted average cost of capital of 10.05%. It is now, with expenses at an all time peak, when Texas weather decided to absolutely shit on my dreams and produced one of the coldest, wettest winters in recent memory, effectively shutting the entire construction industry down. 

**Survival and Present Day**

Weather forced me into full survival mode. I had about $30,000 in the bank and another $10-20,000 available on various credit cards. I cut all spending that could be afforded and started to manage my budget very closely. From December to February, we saw the $30,000 dip to as low as $1-2,000 before work started to pick up again. In that time, I lost my best driver to other work, I flirted with insolvency, and I busted my ass at my corporate job to earn enough money for not only myself and my company payments, but to help out the remaining drivers if they needed a loan/advance. It was incredibly stressful, especially so because it was impossible to know exactly when the weather would break and demand would pick up again. 

Luckily, though, the weather did break. Mid to Late March 2015, everything started to look up, with demand showing glimmers of the previous high's just before December 2014. Currently, everything is on the up-and-up and, while the extra trucks were more burden than blessing during the winter, having the extra equipment is helping me quickly recover by fully taking advantage of demand. We're back to operating at normal levels, with weekly EBIT of about $2,000 - $3,000.

**Future**

For 2015, I am changing the direction of the company. While profitable, the time commitment of owning equipment and maintaining a full time job is proving to be far too stressful. As such, I've contacted dispatchers who are pursuing maintenance free routes (routes that I can put rental equipment on, that the rental company maintains) and I'm looking into going back to my original brokerage business plan. My plan is to build a significant cash cushion this summer to prepare for winter while expanding these two new business areas. These two new business models are not as weather dependent or capital intensive, which will hopefully mitigate the impact of Winter 2015.

Financially, I have an aggressive 2015 revenue projection of approximately $1,000,000; which depends heavily on me landing one of the new rental routes. Should I maintain my current business model, I'm projecting 2015 revenue of $750,000 and EBIT of $116,000. 

**Closing**

My advice: If you want to start a business, just do it. There will never be a right time to do something, you will never have enough data to support you, and you'll never be comfortable about the decision. Being an entrepreneur is about embracing the uncomfortable and pushing into the crazy. There is no right answer and it's not always ""all or nothing"". Work hard, do your research, and fill a need, that's how you'll find success.

878,5iaz5h,False,,176,"[AMA] We are three 21 years olds who started building speakers for festivals from our basement and now have become one of the fastest growing hardware startups, SOUNDBOKS. Ask us anything!",Entrepreneur,"SOUNDBOKS AMA
Hey guys, 

Fairly new to Reddit but have used /r/entrepreneur for tips for a long time. Don’t see too many hardware posts so thought it might be helpful to talk about our experience starting SOUNDBOKS.


**TL; DR** 
Founded a portable speaker company in our basement, got funded, Kickstarter got us a bunch more sales, and now we’re expanding to the US from Denmark/Europe.

&nbsp;

**Full story**
My name is Hjalte and two years ago I founded [SOUNDBOKS](https://www.soundboks.com) with two friends out of high school and about $5000. 


For a few years, my friends (now co-founders) and I had built our own speakers with car batteries and spare parts for our campsite at Roskilde Festival, a Danish music festival. We needed a speaker capable of powering an endless party and withstand rain, hot/cold weather, and the weight of a dancing man. At Roskilde, your typical mass market portable speakers don’t stand a chance. Each year, we would have to make new speakers for the occasion. 


This brought about the idea for SOUNDBOKS. What we needed was a durable, loud portable speaker that would last us for years.  What we found online were built with lead acid batteries that started dropping off after half a year or so. 


It only took **one craigslist ad to validate the demand**, advertising that we'd built Roskilde-ready speakers. We received a few dozen responses, which we really weren’t expecting. Sure there are tons of portable speakers, but we couldn’t find any loud enough to power a dance party. 


After producing the first 500 in our basement and selling to festival-goers we applied and were accepted to Y-Combinator in Silicon Valley. With funding and guidance from **Y Combinator**, a few prominent Danish businessmen, and Mathew Bellamy- the lead singer of MUSE, we were able to hire some great engineers, create some organizational structure, and launch the most successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/554939252/soundboks-the-loudest-battery-powered-speaker) ever for a Danish company.

I would say the best advice we received from the YC network, was that we were the best people to answer questions about product, and the direction of our company. This seems obvious, but it was important for us to hear it from successful entrepreneurs. Especially since we were so young and had missed college to start this.

Fast forward to the present- SOUNDBOKS launched the **most funded Kickstarter campaign in Danish history** and we’ve delivered to more than 5000 customers in Europe and America. In the process, we’ve had time to build a great customer support team, find new and better logistics suppliers, and create an appealing and consistent brand. We have also decided to enter the US market, and our flagship store will be opening in January on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles. We’re also in talks with US retailers like Guitar Center. 


**It’s our first retail store ever so any tips about running a physical store would be super helpful!**


My current role is the Chief Branding officer, although the CEO and CMO are all online. The team consists of a mix of ages between 18-49 and 11 nationalities spread over 25 colleagues based in Copenhagen, Los Angeles, and Shenzhen (China). To help answer questions, we'll have people from **engineering, logistics, marketing, support, and branding all online**.

It featured a SOUNDBOKS and has gotten millions of views so far. We’ve shot a lot of content around the SOUNDBOKS and have reposted a lot of videos made by our customers, so it was really cool to see one take off. 

A few weeks ago we agreed to give one of our speakers to the dancer in the video, Marquese, and helped him shoot some videos showing off the SOUNDBOKS. 

**Right now we’re definitely getting a lot of exposure, but we’re still figuring out how to get people to our site from the video. It's been hard contacting the media outlets that are reposting. Any suggestions?**

463,diapg3,False,Lessons Learned,108,40 Rules for Selling,Entrepreneur,"I work as a Sales Director and I wrote the following text in Spanish long ago. Some people considered it useful, so I translated it into English hoping it can help more people:

1. **Call more and call now.**
Prospect by default, but have in mind that every time you'll try to start prospecting your brain will make up a thousand excuses to convince you it's not the best moment to do it.

2. **It's easier to sell to those who already have your product or a similar one.**

3. **Use a script.**
Your key message must be delivered in your first intervention and be contained in no more than 3 sentences.

4. **Desensitize yourself to rejection.**
Every 'no' gets you closer to the next ""yes"".

5. **If the recepcionist doesn't like you, you'll never reach the decision-maker.**

6. **The quickest way to be liked is to ask for help.**

7. **Don't talk to nondecision-makers.**
Be nice to them, they can become referrers, but don't talk to them about your product or company. A nondecision-maker can't say ""yes"" but can say ""no"".

8. **There will be objections.**
If it doesn't let you to move forward smoothly, is and objection. It's trivial whether the objection is based on a truth or not. ""Send me more information by email"" is also an objection.

9. **Don't believe anything.**
(Almost) everybody lies, about almost everything, almost all the time; and the reason why that happens is irrelevant.

10. **Don't send presentations.**
No one reads them, and even if they did, you'd first need to figure out what your potential customer wants to know, and to figure out what your potential customer wants to know you need to have a conversation, and once you've had a conversation a presentation is no longer needed. Potential customers only use presentations to discard candidates, never to hire them.

11. **Work your eloquence.**
Be brief, be concise, don't digress, stay firm, don't doubt, be interesting.

12. **Don't be generous when it comes to availability.**
If it's scarce it must be good.

13. **Don't plan your meetings.**
No matter how many scenarios you think of, and how many questions you get ready for, every meeting will develop in a different way from what you imagined.

14. **Become friends.**
Under same conditions people choose their friends, and under unequal circumstances… also. It doesn't matter how good your product is if the customer doesn't like you.

15. **Shut up.**
Don't interrupt. Don't even nod. Just shut up and pay attention. If you talk more than 20 % of the time, you are doing it wrong. If you listen before pitching, by the time is your turn the customer would have already told you everything he wants to hear.

16. **Don't move.**
Don't nod, don't smile, don't force your laughter. Just look and listen.

17. **Don't try to convince.**
Great salespeople don't try to turn ""noes"" into ""yeses"" -that's impossible-, what they do is to quickly detect -and reject- those who won't buy.

18. **Don't say you are good, show it.**
Give hints and let the customer reach the conclusions, it's way more believable.

19. **Don't talk about yourself.**
Your product, your company, and your life are boring. Like everyone's else. Like mine. Don't tell your client what you do, tell him how his life will be after buying whatever is you offer.

20. **Safety and ego are heavier than features and benefits.**
When someone buys from you, he puts his job in the line, or that's what he thinks. Once the customer is not afraid of losing his job, admiration from peers becomes sexier than the pricest treasure.

21. **Kill presentations.**
If you are a great speaker, a presentation will disminish your value; if you are a bad speaker, it will be even worse.

22. **Unsell.**
Contradict your client, deny some of his requests, show disinterest.

23. **Learn to say ""no"".**

24. **Don't be a butler.**
Avoid those ""pleases"", ""thank yous"", and ""excuse mes"" that you wouldn't genuinely say to a friend. While you are at it, kill the ""are you busy?"" and, above all, murder once and for all the denigrating ""thank you for your time"".

25. **Brag about your flaws.**
Start by mentioning the drawbacks of your product. Most drawbacks become advantages once you brag about them, and when not, you'll be transmiting honesty and they'll remember you for being unique.

26. **Interested customers are the least interesting.**
A customer showing too much interest, in hurry, or who brags about how well one is doing, doesn't want to buy anything. Think of it, when you are about to buy something expensive, do you want the seller to know you are willing to do anything to get it?

27. **Best way of solving objections is silence.**
Second best, whatever that starts with ""That's exactly why"".

28. **Do not solve objections.**
What the customer asks is not what he wants to be answered to. Behind every objection hides laziness or lack of trust. To overcome the former there's nothing to do but insisting; to overcome the latter, the customer must like you. If you answer to what you are asked, you'll lose your chance to do either and the conversation will end.

29. **Ask ""why"" times fives.**
Soon, you'll find that what your potential customer wants is not exactly what he first said.

30. **After every interaction *you* say what the next step is.**

31. **Keep emails below 100 words and containing no more than one goal or question.**

32. **Always-fucking-deliver.**
Be puncutal, and if you agree on something, do your part exactly when and how you agreed.

33. **Don't customize your proposals.**
And keep them under 3 pages. Whenever you deliver a proposal you are delivering free work. The more free work a client feels you have given him, the less he'll value you.

34. **Persevere.**

35. **If in doubt, phone.**
I also prefer the email, but email is for cowards, and cowards can't sell.

36. **Ask for the close.**

37. **Network everywhere, with everyone, all the time.**
Go to events and introduce yourself to others, but leave twitter and those events in which everyone already know everyone. This is about making money, not about being popular among peers and competitors.

38. **Get your contacts to introduce you to their contacts.**
This will help your sales more than everything I said before.

39. **Almost-sales don't generate revenue.**
That's why you'll never say again that a deal is hot or almost closed.

40. **There's no sale until you get paid.**
The deal is not closed when a client says he wants to work with you. Not even when he signs the contract. Only a deal is closed when someone else's money gets into your company's bank account.

297,cap86r,False,Startup Help,250,Digital Marketing Agency Making Consistent $8K Per Month (No Course BS/No Buying BS) PT. 1,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

I really miss the way this subreddit used to be. I swear to god I see someone trying to sell their services every week and I'm over it. Back to dropping as much knowledge as possible and I know some of you will say well why should we listen to your POV. Well, I'm an average Joe just like you and I feel I've made some headway.  

&#x200B;

I'm a long time avid Reddit reader and poster. I wanted to really go in-depth on how I created my digital marketing agency. The reason why I'm picking this topic is that I'm seeing more and more people trying to get into this field and the more people that get into this field the more scams, and ""gurus"" that pop up trying to sell their $999 course to you. I'm actually so over all these damn courses and everyone trying to just scheme off this industry. Its a real industry with a ton of value. I hope this post brings value. It's probably the same stuff as you would pay to get but free.    

&#x200B;

* Starting a Digital Marketing Agency - Logo, Website, Brand, SEO       

&#x200B;

When I started my digital marketing agency I quit my 7-4 job as a construction project manager where I was making $1,650 a week. It was a good job, but I couldn't stand waking up every morning making some other dude rich. Obviously, I talked with my wife and I got the OK, but I quit in March of 2018. I had 2-3K saved up and I was on my way to doing digital marketing. I knew a little about websites, SEO and presence on Instagram but nothing insane. My best advice to the newcomers. Save money, and go to Udemy/YouTube and learn about creating WordPress websites, and SEO tactics.     

&#x200B;

I went to ThemeForest and bought a $30 logo that I still use today. Again I'm trying my hardest not to do links or promote anything else. This is what I used for myself and it worked out extremely well. I bought a theme for WordPress off ThemeForest as well and customized it to my liking.    

&#x200B;

Now you have a website, make sure that you SEO optimize your website: H1 Tags, Meta Tags, Meta Description, Title Tags,  Alt Text, Keywords - Before contacting businesses to offer SEO services. I can't tell you how many people I've talked with that have shit fuck websites and are trying to sell an SEO package for $1,500. It's actually incredible.  

&#x200B;

* Starting a Digital Marketing Agency - Social Media Platforms  

&#x200B;

I've been asked countless times which platform is better for digital marketing. Some people say all of them, and some people say one platform. At the end of the day just choose a platform and work hard on it. Personally, I would recommend Instagram, and grow from there. A lot and I mean a lot of people underestimate the power of social media. I can't stress this enough.     

&#x200B;

In order to grow your agency and grow in general, you need to post content. I don't like the once a day method or once a week method. I'm talking good quality postings of 1-3 per day. Talk about your agency, and how to grow it. Talk about your techniques. At the end of the day give value over trying to get someone to buy a course for $300-999 dollars. I'm a strong believer in value > $.  

&#x200B;

This could be a whole segment on growing your platforms and will probably come in a later post.  

&#x200B;

* Start a Digital Marketing Agency - Branding  

&#x200B;

A lot of people overlook the type of brand they create. Try and come up with a name that catches people's eye. I get complimented almost every time I go to a meeting on the name I created for my agency. For Reddit purposes, I won't state the name here as I don't want any type of advertising.    

&#x200B;

Think long and hard about the name because this should be your name forever. Start the branding process on all social media accounts & website and start working.  

&#x200B;

* Start a Digital Marketing Agency - Getting Clients    

&#x200B;

I was going to leave this for PT. 2 of the post but I decided what the heck. When I first started my Digital Marketing Agency from Month 1 - 3 I had a ton of leads but I didn't close anyone. I half-assed my work and I thought I could easily get clients. My website looked like shit, and the way I went about it was I was trying to make this easy money. First things first it isn't easy money and the trick to succeeding in any business is hard work. You won't be an instant success in a week a month or even a year. It takes multiple years of hard work. I'm just being honest and that's probably the best advice I can give to anyone and HEY look at that it doesn't cost you a cent.  

&#x200B;

* Cold Calling - I know most of you dread this but giving someone a call and saying ""Hello my name is Joseph is the director of marketing or the business owner available?"" - ""What for?"" - ""Well I own a digital marketing agency in the local area and I was calling to see if they were interested in getting more clients for the business, a new website or any type of SEO services to rank you on the first page of Google"" - It's that simple. You can either get a NO, an email to link information which means a lead or a sure one second. I've gotten my first 2 big clients over cold calling. It works. You need to pretend you are a goldfish and forget if anyone is ever mean to you on the phone. Keep calling and keep working.  
* Email Marketing - Now Gmail puts a cap of 500 emails per day. I use Gmail. That gives you 100 emails of emailing business of not spam but give them actual knowledge of their business. Give them a Free audit report of their business, audit their Facebook/Instagram accounts. Give them value and stop trying to sell over an email right away.  
* Networking / Chamber of Commerce - Join your local chamber. Probably costs $240 to join but its worth it as you get to go to all these meetings and meet new people. Once again its about providing value. Don't instantly try and sell the first time you see them. Help people out.  

&#x200B;

The second part when I get some time will be what I actually do in my digital marketing agency explaining SEO, Web Design & actual marketing tips. Again this could be used for the average business owner who can't afford digital marketing services or people starting their own agency.

&#x200B;

417,6ztybx,False,How to Grow,98,How I attract high paying clients to my design & development agencies,Entrepreneur,"# Sideproject Marketing

After my ([previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6wz5d5/10kmrr_in_3_months_i_have_nothing_to_sell_you/)) I've been getting a lot of questions in my inbox from people asking me **How I get clients to my agency?**

So, right now I'm running a [Design firm  that offers unlimited UI design to tech startups & software teams](http://fairpixels.pro).

This isn't my first agency and I've been getting high-ticket clients for almost 8 years. For design AND development projects.

Instead of answering everybody individually, I thought I'd write a short post. The strategy I've been using to bring in clients does *not* include:

* Spending money on ads
* Spending years building a social following
* Going to networking events
* Cold calling

There's nothing wrong with any of these methods, but as a maker, I'd rather spend time... making things. So if you're a designer or a developer, and hate all of those things listed above, try out the following strategy to attract clients to your agency on autopilot:

It's called: **Side project marketing**

I did not invent this, do a quick google search and you'll find a ton of awesome articles on this subject. But basically this is what it's about:

1.  You build a side project, separate from your main/core business. The side project needs to be something that is 100% free, easy to build and provides massive massive value to your target audience. I'm not talking about an ebook (though you can do that), but a high value tool. It might even look like a full fledged stand alone startup company.

2. Then, instead of promoting your agency, you promote that side project. Why? Because it's something that (hopefully) provides instant value for free. People are more likely to share an awesome free and simple tool vs the website of your agency. So marketing the side project, simply by posting it on relevant forums, sharing it with bloggers, sending it to journalists to potentially write about, will make it a lot easier to drive traffic to those side projects.

3. On the side project, there's a link to your core business/service. A percentage of the traffic, will visit your core business and... if what you offer is relevant to that audience, convert to a customer.


**Here's a real life example**

So before we started offering unlimited UI design, we were just designing logos. That's it. We started out as a tiny logo firm. What we did was build a website called Logodust. Logodust is a website where we open source our unused logo designs. Then we posted it on Hacker News, sent it to a few bloggers, and before we knew it, Logodust was featured on Product Hunt, TheNextWeb and a bunch of other high profile websites.

A good chunk of the traffic, ended up hiring us for a premium logo design service. Until this day (this was about 2 years ago I think) we get clients on auto pilot, from that one side project. *Without* looking for clients.

**conclusion**

So... Use your making skills as your marketing skills. Build awesome free tools and services that are easy to market. Tools and projects that people are likely to share because they offer something unique and of high value. Then convert a small chunk of those visitors, to paying clients for your agency.

Let me know if this was helpful.

657,c4p8am,False,,85,Your idea is worthless and execution is everything - the story of Tom and John,Entrepreneur,"This is the (fake) story of Tom and John. Two men who run two identical lawn care businesses in two identical neighboring towns. They both have a book of 250 weekly customers. They both have 5 crews working full time each summer.

**Tom works 20 hours a week and earns $400k a year after all of his expenses are paid. John works 70 hours a week and earns $75k a year.**

Tom has a crew of good employees and John complains that hiring reliable people is impossible in today's business environment. Tom spends his time overseeing his crews and John has more turnover and unreliable workers so he spends most of his time on the jobs or putting out fires.

Tom is not particularly good at lawn care and hasn't been on a mower in years. John is really really good at his work. Hes the fastest in town and mows the straightest lines and does the most beautiful landscaping projects.

**Tom is a salesman and a communicator.** He focuses on bringing in new business and hiring/managing his employees. He knows what he isn't good at and outsources it. He outsources his digital marketing to a freelancer. He hired a great customer service and account management specialist as his first hire. He outsources his bookkeeping, compliance etc. **John is a jack of all trades**. He mows and then comes home and does billing and customer service. He sets up his marketing campaigns on the weekends and crams his bookkeeping at tax time.

**Tom turns down more business than he accepts.** He only does the job if it's profitable and it's what he is best at doing. **John says yes to most opportunities even if he knows it isn't what he does best.**

**Tom competes on speed and service.** He understands he won't get every customer so he closes 20% of his jobs at 2x the price of his competitors. He only wants the customers who are willing to pay more for better service. He doesn't take it personal when he loses bids. Its a numbers game. **John competes on price and complains about the craigslisters and fly by nights that underbid him and keep him from making any money.** John works hard to win every bid, often discounting services to undercut competitors. He closes more leads than Tom but at a lower price. For some reason the customers call and complain a lot more than Tom's customers do. They don't pay on time. They try to take advantage of him often so its a battle.

**Tom focuses on marketing that his competitors are ignoring.** He records videos and posts them to youtube when hes working on an interesting landscaping project. He writes articles attempting to help local home owners answer some questions about the local environment and lawn issues. He has his crews put yard signs in lawns. He sends hand written notes to new home owners after they close on expensive houses in town. He encourages customers to leave reviews with photos on Google My Business.

**John is too busy for that so he throws more money at his social media and Adwords campaigns.**

**When customers call Tom his staff answers on the first ring every time with a smile.** They get quotes out using Google Maps in about 20 minutes on average. When he's dealing with clients and bidding big jobs he goes out of his way to help them. He gains trust. He answers their questions and even tells some customers how to do parts of the job themselves. He offers first cuts for free to his customers so they can try out his service with no obligation.

**John is on the mower so his voicemail picks up most of his calls and he calls them back when he has a chance.** His margins are too low to waste time chatting or talking to customers who aren't buyers yet. He can't offer a free service and has to milk his early customers for profit to keep his lights on.

Since Tom charges 2x what John does he pays his employees more and can retain better employees. **Tom's crew has very clear tasks at hand and they know exactly what needs to be done. Everyone specializes in what they do best.** The office handles billing and customer service. The crew leader drives the mower. The second guy is on the trimmer all day. A separate grew does landscaping. **Johns crews do a little of everything because there is no-one else to collect payment on invoices or answer customer's questions about the service or a separate crew to do landscaping projects.**

When an employee asks **Tom a question he tries to teach that employee** how he would frame it and solve it. He asks them questions with the goal of teaching them how to think about it and how to solve the problem while supporting them and giving them the tools to make it happen. **John doesn't have time for that so when an employee comes to him with a problem it becomes his problem and he takes over.**

**Tom spends his time on stuff that is important but not urgent.** He makes decisions now and does work now that will remove 10 future decisions or 10 future tasks. Hes putting out fires before they start. John is running from fire to fire solving urgent problems. He has no time to prevent them from happening in the first place.

**Tom has a manager at his company that answers the hard phone calls and deals with 99% of the problems**. Tom invested a lot of time over the years training him and gaining his trust. When Tom leaves for vacation or goes out to quote jobs things flow along smoothly.

**John is where the buck stops at his company.** Every problem comes to him. Every question comes to him. Problems just pile up in front of him until everything comes to a halt. If he leaves his computer to go out on a job (which he does often) everything comes to a grinding halt. John hasn't had a vacation in 10 years.

344,4t9n76,False,,203,Every entrepreneur that is promoting his business online is making exactly the same mistake,Entrepreneur,"Hello /r/entrepreneur.

I would like to share with you guys something that I have noticed in past few weeks. I have started my own Social Media Management agency 3 weeks ago following advice from this subreddit. I have 6 clients so far and everything is going way better than I have expected and I have never been happier.

However, I have noticed something that is really bugging me. Every entrepreneur who is promoting his business, products or services online is thinking like this:

""I have such great products and amazing website!! I will make Instagram and Facebook account and I will share my awesome products every day so everyone can buy them!! Social media is great and I will make tons of money!!!!""

Once they figure out how to set up their social media accounts, they start wasting their time posting pictures of products even though they have 3 followers. After few months of working hard, updating everything few days per week and begging some of their clients to like their page (if they have clients) they usually end up with 100-150 followers/likes at most and usually 0 sales.

This is HORRIBLE approach. This is not how you want to promote your business online, especially on social media. Think like this. You are using tons of products every day (food, hygiene, etc...) Are you following your toothpaste brand on Facebook and liking all their pictures? Are you following coffee that you are drinking every day and liking their pictures? I don't think that you are. 

Why would you or anyone else subscribe to page that is offering them nothing in return except seeing poorly made daily advertisements of their products?

In order to grow your online presence - **YOU NEED TO PROVIDE VALUE** to your audience. One of my clients was promoting his online shop for 14 months. How many followers he acquired during that time? 160. How many sales came from his Social media page? 0. Engagement rate was almost 0%. (0.4% to be precise). I have started posting content that was entertaining to his audience and his potential customers. I spent a lot of time searching for his target customers and interacting with them by following them, liking their photos, commenting and building healthy relationship with them. In 3 weeks I grew it from 160 to 1600. No magic tricks, just common sense and a lot of hard work.

In order to grow your business online you need to give your target group something. You can post something that entertains them for example. If you are selling fitness products, post fitness motivation quotes, weight loss tips and stuff like that. 80-90% of all your posts needs to be content that is offering them something. Only 10-20% of your content should be products promotion. And when you are promoting products, it is nice to give your followers discount - as a reward for following you. They are 10 times more likely to buy something from you if they see that you have sale and that you are running discounts at the moment.

Please, try to engage with your audience. Build healthy relationship with them. Make them to like you and trust you. They are seeing, just like we are, hundreds of ads every single day. You need to stand out. There are thousands of people selling same stuff as you. Why would anyone choose you? 

You will need to spend a lot of time, especially if you are growing your accounts organically. (Like you should in my opinion). But it will be worth it. Even if you grow only couple hundred followers per month, in a year you will have few thousand followers who are interested in your services and who are following you because you have built friendly and healthy relationship with them. You won't need to spend dime on Facebook/IG advertising. 

Grow your brand awareness and don't rely on paid advertising only. It can give you instant results - If you somehow manage to optimize campaign properly, but this will be pretty hard unless you have experience in IM. Take a longer route and trust me, after few months you will thank yourself.

But **a lot of customers are super entitled and down right mean**. It sounds silly but some use controlling and emotionally abusive tactics to get refunds, take advantage or get their way. 

We had a customer who fell behind on rent. When we reached out she was upset about the lack of a rope hanging down from her unit door. Claimed she couldn't use it properly. Claimed we were discriminating against her for this reason or that reason. She continued to harass our customer service rep with a lot of offensive language and threats on the phone. I had our maintenance guy stop by and install a rope (this was her first complaint on the matter) and then I called her personally.

She insulted me. She spoke to me like I was 5 years old. She used a lot of profanity. She threatened online reviews. She threatened lawsuites. It was a wild conversation.

At the end of her lecture she demanded 2 free months of storage and a reduced rate moving forward. If we didn't comply she would sue us.

720,7vgbvf,False,Case Study,101,From $120/m to $5000/m - Part 5 of my Website Flipping Case Study,Entrepreneur,"Hey all, it's been a while since I last gave an update on this case study. A quick background for people who haven't seen any of the past updates. I bought a website for $1,250 in May of 2016 and the site was making around $120 per month. I started the case study to document the entire process of me buying, growing and eventually selling the site. I originally planned this case study as a quick flip (6-12 months) but soon saw there was a lot of potential here, so I decided to not flip it and instead focus on growing it more. The site has gone through a lot of changes but in January 2018 it made over $5000 in revenue. This update gives you a peek into how the site has grown so much and what I've been doing. I would highly suggest reading the past updates first so you have context for this update.

&nbsp;

As I do with all of my posts, I have formatted it all here on reddit for you to read without having to go to my site. However, for a better reading experience I would suggest reading the article on [my blog](https://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-flipping-case-study-part-5/). 

&nbsp;

********

&nbsp;

I have a exciting new case study update for you all today where I will show you how this site is now making over $5,000 per month. For context, a year ago the site was making less than $200 per month. The growth on this site has been amazing and I can’t wait to get into all of what has happened since the last update. Before I do, make sure to catch up on the previous case study updates:

&nbsp;

Reading those updates will get you familiar with the origins of the site and how things have changed since I purchased it in June of 2016.

&nbsp;

Now let’s hop right into this update!

&nbsp;

## Why the Increase in Revenue?

The burning question you are probably asking yourself is how the site has made a huge jump from less than $2,000 per month 3 months ago to over $5,000 per month now. The answer is somewhat of a letdown because there is no magical reason or special “trick”. This growth is simply from all of the consistent work we have been putting into the site the past 11+ months and we are starting to see some major growth. People always think there is a trick or some special tactic that people use to grow websites, but it really boils down to 3 things:

&nbsp;

- Create high quality content in high quantities
- Build solid links
- Monetize properly

&nbsp;

That is it.

&nbsp;

Do those 3 things consistently and you will find success with growing websites. Yes, there are other things that contribute to having success but those are the 3 pillars to success. This site is proof of it working. Let’s take a look at the traffic and revenue graphs to see the full growth history of the site.

&nbsp;

## All Time Traffic Stats

&nbsp;

Traffic Stats - [https://imgur.com/tsBbh3O](https://imgur.com/tsBbh3O)

&nbsp;

Consistent month over month traffic growth thanks to consistent content creation combined with a solid content strategy. It just works. A year ago, in January 2017, the site was getting around 2,000 sessions per month. Fast forward a year to January 2018 and the site is now getting 34,000 sessions per month.

&nbsp;

## Content Creation

To give you an idea of what our content creation looks like I want to give you a peek under the hood. Below you can see how many articles we are creating per month, total cost, cost per work, average article length and more. Click image for a better view.

&nbsp;

Content Stats - [https://imgur.com/VsyhfQE](https://imgur.com/VsyhfQE) 

&nbsp;

Here are the monthly averages:

&nbsp;

- Articles: 13.27
- Words: 17,125
- Total Cost: $517
- Cost per Article: $40.41
- Cost per Word: $.03
- Article Length: 1330

&nbsp;

On average we are publishing 13 articles per month and spending $500 per month on this content. Doing this steady for a year is the biggest reason for the growth in traffic and revenue for this site. Consistency is underrated when building websites. A lot of this consistency of published content can be attributed to having systems and processes in place that have allowed the site to continue to pump out content with minor efforts from myself. Hiring a project manager and implementing systems is hands down the best thing that has ever happened to my businesses.

&nbsp;

## All Time Financial Stats

As I have mentioned in past updates, revenue is the most important metric that I pay attention to when growing websites. Profit is important, but in my opinion you should be reinvesting all of your websites earnings right back into it. That is the quickest way to grow. Yes, your profit is not going to look fantastic during this growth phase but it will pay off huge later. That is what we have been doing for this site. Reinvesting everything back into the site and only focusing on growth, at whatever cost. 

&nbsp;

With that being said, below is our monthly revenue numbers since I took over ownership in June 2016:

&nbsp;

## Revenue Stats

Revenue Numbers - [https://imgur.com/SWaRyAt](https://imgur.com/SWaRyAt)

&nbsp;

The revenue growth has been incredible. I’ve seen this happen a lot on other sites where the revenue or traffic hits a plateau for a few months and then all of a sudden your break through that “wall” and move into the next plateau. From the chart above, you can see the first plateau was around $200 from October 2016 through March 2017. Then from April 2017 to July 2017 the revenue went all the way up to $1,800. It plateaued in the $1.8k – $1.6k range for 5 months and then in December 2017 shot up to $3.6k and now we are over $5.2k.

&nbsp;

It will be interesting to see where the level of the next plateau will be.

&nbsp;

## Perfecting the Monetization Methods

Testing, tweaking and trying new monetization methods can be one of the best ways to increase the revenue of a site in a short amount of time. If you recall all the way back when I purchased this site it was solely being monetized by Adsense. That’s it. My initial plan was to just optimize the ad placement and increase revenue that way. Doing that did increase the revenue, but I didn’t see a major boost in revenue until I tested other monetization strategies such as lead gen and affiliate content.

&nbsp;

To better illustrate how the income streams for this site have evolved and how they have improved the revenue per visitor over time I have created a chart below. 
The top part of the chart shows the revenue streams each month broken down by the type of revenue. You can see how the first 10 months we mainly used ads to monetize the site but once we started testing affiliate and lead gen strategies the total revenue went up AND the revenue per visitor did too. You can see the revenue per visitor over time in the bottom line chart. I’d suggest clicking on the image to make it bigger ans easier to read.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## All Time Expenses

Expense - [https://imgur.com/InGXRtO](https://imgur.com/InGXRtO)

&nbsp;

In the last update I gave a detailed breakdown of these expenses and where we are spending our money. Most of the expenses are for content and our project manager. You will see that we had our highest month ever in terms of expenses in January for a total of $2,649. The main reason for the increase in expenses was that we gave a $1,000 bonus to our project manager. So the actual expenses for January would have been around $1,600 without the $1000 bonus. I wanted to note that because the $1,500 $2,000 range for monthly expenses for this site is just about the ceiling. That range for expenses will be where we will sit for most months moving forward.

&nbsp;

This is interesting now because we have reached a point where our expenses are “fixed” in a way so our profit will continue to go up each month as long as the revenue keeps growing. In the past, our expenses grew with our revenue which made it so the site broke even each month. Now we are to the point where the site will actually start generating solid and consistent profits each month while still growing.

&nbsp;

## All Time Profit

Profit stats - [https://imgur.com/D05EOL6](https://imgur.com/D05EOL6)

&nbsp;

The graph above illustrates my point that I made earlier about the site now generating a consistent and solid profit each month. The site has now reached the stage that we have been trying to get it to for the past 9+ months. We knew that if we heavily reinvested all earnings back into the site we would eventually get it to a point where we would outgrow our expenses, which is where we are at now. I’m super excited about achieving this because we now get the best of both worlds. On one hand we get to keep growing it each month by investing around $1.5k to $2k per month but then on other hand we are also able to take a profit each month.

&nbsp;

## Current Site Valuation

This case study originally started as a “website flipping” case study because I planned to quickly flip this website within 6-12 months. However, I quickly realized that the site had too much potential to do a quick flip. Now the plan is to continue aggressively growing this site until we feel like we have reached the ceiling. Once that happens we will think about selling it. So looking at the current valuation of the site right now doesn’t really matter, but it is worth mentioning for the sake of the case study.

&nbsp;

To keep things as simple as possible, I will use the last 3 months average profit and a 25x multiple to find the valuation. In reality, a lot more factors would be considered and it would probably fetch a higher multiple than 25x.

&nbsp;

Site Valuation - [https://imgur.com/ABkaVii](https://imgur.com/ABkaVii)

&nbsp;

The valuation is also skewed due to how heavy we are reinvesting all of our profits back into the site. Which is why I don’t care to even look at the current valuation. If you take a look at the profit chart in the above section you will see that in November we actually lost $139. November numbers were used to calculate the valuation of the site, so you can see why the $38k valuation is skewed lower.

&nbsp;

Next month, assuming we make a profit of $2000 that would bring our new valuation to $55,883. Just to give you an idea how much the valuation can swing when you are growing.

&nbsp;

##What Have We Done Since Last Update?

To be honest, a lot of the same. Creating content, building links and testing monetization strategies. The things mentioned below are things a little more “out of the ordinary”.

&nbsp;

## Started Selling our own Product

This is the biggest thing we have done in the past few months. We have created our own study guide for a test that HVAC techs have to take. This took a lot of work to put together because we wanted to make sure it was top notch. We launched it a few days ago to our small email list and made a few sales, which is encouraging. This product is our MVP and now that we know their is interest in this area we will begin to promote it further and start creating other products we can sell.

&nbsp;

We eventually plan to build out a catalog of products that are our own and we hope that this will be a solid income stream for us in the future. I will talk more about this in a second.

&nbsp;

## Optimized Lead Gen Monetization

One of the biggest reasons for the increase in revenue has been due to the optimization of our lead gen affiliate program. I optimized content on the site to better convert readers into leads. I made changes to the 50+ pieces of content we have geared towards lead gen and this has a direct impact on our revenue. I’m very pleased with the results.

&nbsp;

##Started Building an Email List

We have started collecting emails and building out an email list. In the past it didn’t make sense to try and collect emails on the site for two reasons:

&nbsp;

We had no use for an email list
All content was geared towards lead gen or affiliate content, both more profitable to not try and convert readers into email subscribers
Now that the site has matured and we have more types of content where we don’t have a direct way to monetize it makes sense to try and convert readers into email subscribers. We are also now selling our own products which can be promoted via email. We now have a way to monetize this email list.

&nbsp;

We have started slow, but are up to over 100+ email subscribers and will continue to work on growing the email list. This could prove to be crucial in order for the site to take it’s next step towards making our own products a solid income source.

&nbsp;

## Future Plans and Goals

My plans for this site have continuously evolved. At first it was going to be a quick flip but then in the 3rd update I decided to take a longer term approach to the site. In that update, which was in in July 2016, I set my goal at $1,000 per month. It took one year, but in June 2017 the site earned $1,000. Then in the 4th case study update I upped my goal again, this time to $5,000 in a month. I set this goal in October 2017. A few months later I was able to reach that mark in January 2018.

&nbsp;

Now what? Good question!

&nbsp;

The new goal is $10,000 per month in revenue. I think reaching this mark will actually be easier than expected. We have been working really hard to expand this site into new areas that will allow us to reach the $10k mark. Some things we are working on are listed below.

&nbsp;

## Double Down on Amazon Affiliate Content

Content where we write reviews about various types of products has proven to be very successful on the limited sample we have so far. There are a lot of sub niches that we have yet to explore and a lot of untapped content we can go after. We feel like we can really grow this aspect of the website fairly easily so we will be doubling down on this type of content. You can see from the revenue numbers talked about above that Amazon has become a major part of this website’s income streams.

&nbsp;

One thing that is interesting about the AC/HVAC niche is that it is seasonal, but half of the products are popular in the summer and die down in the winter and the other half are the opposite. For example, heaters are poplar in the winter months but then AC is popular in the summer months. We are trying to create this content in a smart way so that we don’t see a dip in traffic as the seasons change.

&nbsp;

## Expand Product Line

Creating your own products to sell on your website is HUGE.

&nbsp;

You make your business a lot more sustainable by doing this because you are no longer relying on a 3rd party for your income. I really like the idea of expanding our products we create and sell in order to minimize our 3rd party risk and add another income stream for the site. We have only dabbled in this area so far with our first study guide, but the initial sales have been encouraging and we will begin to look for ways we can expand this part of the site.

&nbsp;

One idea that I think is really interesting is to eventually move into a more interactive “course” of sorts that will provide the user a variety of material that will help them pass the exam. We are still brainstorming ideas but we are eager to expand this area of the business. This will be important for the site to reach the next goal of $10,000 per month.

&nbsp;

## Test New Sub Niches

When I use the term “sub niches” I am talking about new avenues within the overarching niche of the website. This site started as mainly an informational website about HVAC, but once I took over I began to caover more sub niches such as product review content and local keywords. Both have been the main pillars for the site’s success so far. We have done a good job with these first two sub niches, but it is time we begin to look for new angles we can create content around in order to keep growing the site.

&nbsp;

As a recap, we have currently created content for the following sub niches of the main niche of HVAC:

&nbsp;

Product reviews
Local content for state specific content
Test study guides and practice tests
General HVAC info

&nbsp;

Some new areas we are looking to expand into include:

&nbsp;

AC brand reviews
AC troubleshooting content

&nbsp;

Both of these are very deep, meaning that there is a lot of content that can be written for both of them. There are probably at least 50+ pieces of content we can write between these two new sub niches. This is where a lot of our time and money will be spend over the coming months in terms of content.

&nbsp;

## Until the Next Update

That’s gonna do it for this update. Hope you enjoyed seeing how the site has progressed and grown since I first bought the site. You can probably expect updates every 3 months or from now on since there isn’t a whole lot of new developments on a month to month basis that would warrant a a new blog post.

479,3hlswi,False,My Success Story,263,"How I made $3,000 dollars a month while at University with placemat advertising",Entrepreneur,"Okay, so this may sound like one of those spammy internet posts, but I seek no financial benefit from this post, only to share with you an incredibly simple business idea I ran whilst studying at University.

During years 2-4 of my University studies I started a business with a friend called ""Adspad"". Adspad enabled businesses to engage with the student population by offering targeted advertising opportunities within the university environment. It did this by producing paper placemats which appear on trays in university canteens. 

The business was simple, we sourced a printing supplier (FSC certified paper to cut down environmental impact), set up a year agreement with the university to let us supply the university with placemats every month (pretty easy sell as we were students of the university and they wanted to support a uni startup), and then sold advertising space to local and national businesses who wanted to promote their products & services to students. We started off with one university and grew to two within a couple of months.

Each individual advertising slot was sold for $150 and clients could merge slots for bigger adverts. We had 10 slots per university per month so if we sold all our spaces at both universities we would turnover ~$3,000 per month. Printing costs were low, around $600 per university per month. 

It was a nice little business and certainly beat working part time in a bar. Idea was really simple and required little to no startup capital to get it off the ground. After University I sold the business and a few years later it closed down as the new owner moved onto something else, but can't see any reason why someone else cant replicate the idea in their campus.


Here is an [example of one of the placemats](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_45tUS4UTHzs/SxKgNb_wUSI/AAAAAAAAAZc/4cEwENXnrII/s1600/untitled.bmp.)

So why don't we use the revenues from data as a means to fund everyone's personal causes by redistributing it to people as a market incentive to drive content, market research and commerce?

521,626r7n,False,,139,How I started an Amazon FBA business for about $500,Entrepreneur,"I'll try to make this short and leave details for questions in the comments I am hoping that I am able to create an free resource for people looking to start selling using Amazon FBA. Do not waste your money on a course when you could spend that on product. Personally, I think it is better to watch some YouTube Videos, read a couple of blogs and just getting started on a smaller scale. You’ll learn more from doing than you will from any course out there, when you could spend that on product.


This isn’t rocket science, you can do it with less than  $500 and in about a month without Harvard MBA, million dollars on yor bank account, reinventing the wheel, all you need is common sense, some work hours and as I said $500 of initial investment.


This is how to it, step by step, with sample product.


Here’s a quick breakdown of costs for my first batch of 100 units ordered:


* Manufacturing costs: About $280
* Shipping/Freight costs: $150
* Photo editing: $20
* UPC: $8 from Ebay
* Amazon monthly subscription fee: $40


With some quick math, you can see my total costs are about $498


**PROCESS**


* **Product research**

Product that meets the following basic criteria:

* Obscure, boring item that sells well

 * Existing demand on Amazon (we do not want to try to create demand, just leverage existing demand)

 * Product without too much competition. Where there aren’t a lot of items with hundreds of good reviews competing for the top spot (1 product with 1,000+ reviews? Bad. Only one product sells. 5 products with less than 100 reviews? Good. 5 listing with 1,000 reviews? Bad, competition is too high. 6 guys with 10 reviews? Bad, no demand)

* A national brand name does not rule the market

* Lightweight and small products are preferred The ideal FBA product takes no storage space and sells within a month. The further you get from that ideal the less likely you are to make a profit.

 
*  **Alibaba: order a product**


You can go to AliExpress and order several units to test the market with minimum financial risk but I suggest, go directly to Alibaba and order 100 units due to better rates. Delivery time is 3-4 weeks.


Now look arround your house and try to get an idea. Browse Amazon for each item you see no metter how obscure item is. Let’s say, I saw stretch lid and decided to compete with it. (Tip: do not compete in things like phone chargers (two much fake products, you can face with numerous refunds and get your account banned) and phone cases (too much competition, gross margin and ROI are disaster).


How do I do it:


* Search “stretch lids” on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=stretch+lids&sprefix=stretch+l%2Caps%2C339&crid=2MOA0OEV3SUIQ)


* Check out the first page listing, how many reviews they have, photos and price of course. Seems like the 6 pack set is about $13-15. Sales price is determined by our competitors, so we will set our price at $13-15.


* Search “stretch lids” on [Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/trade/search?fsb=y&IndexArea=product_en&CatId=&SearchText=stretch+lids)


After several messages I received an offer for a nice looking, FDA and LFBG approved, made from food grade silicone, BPA free, dishwasher and freezer safe, flexible 6-set silicone stretch lid. $2,8 per set for, minimum order quantity – 100 sets.


This price difference looks great but there are some other costs to consider. Shipping and Amzon fees.


Supplier can organize aircargo+UPS delivery for $150 ($1.5/set costs to ship from China). So that’s $4.30 per set. Amazon then takes a their cut and for this particular product their cut is $4.53. You Amazon fees you’re gonna use Fulfillment by Amazon Revenue Calculator.


As you can see a product that costs $2.8 will actually cost almost $9. That’s three times more than you saw on Aibaba. In this example we’re making a $3-5 profit/item. Not much all but eventually you’ll see that better selling products have even lower profit margins.


I know, when you sell all 100 units it’s only $300 of profit but you can’t expect to earn more with such a low initial investment.


General milestone that Amazon sellers seem to strive for,  is reaching $1000 a day. You may think that you do this by launching a hugely successful product and yes you can do it that way but it’s actually the hard way. You would need a product that makes $30,000 a month. The problem with most $30,000 a month products that have any kind of profit margin is that they will be highly competitive. Second problem is invetory. The simpler way is to aim for a product that sells 10 – 20 units a day and sells for between $15 and $25. Once you have this product up and selling on amazon you can start to expand into other items in this category which will lead to a reduction in your shipping costs in the long run. To get to the magic number of $1,000 a day you would just need to duplicate what you did with this product with 2 other products. Or 4 or 5 other products that sell between 5 – and 10 units a day.


**Waiting for product to arrive – what to do?**


The most important parts of your listing are your photos and your title. Many people won’t even get past your main photo. Instead of hiring a product writer on Fiverr I suggest you write your own descriptions, bullets, title, and keywords buton the other hand taking your own pictures is bad idea if you don’t have a professional camera, lightbox and Photoshop skills. Photos could increase conversions by quite a lot, so hiring a professional for photos is one of the best investments for a successful product line. Additionaly, you should research PPC, track your competitors (analyze their sales, keywords and targets) and lastly, look at your pictures once again and ask yourself, could they be better. If they can, retake pictures.


**Product lunch – strategy**


Product have arrived at the Amazon warehouses. Our listing is officially active and live, now what? Get reviews on the product anyway you can and as soon as possible. This should be your main focus because reviews are KING but it is very difficult to get organic reviews. Last year Amazon banned incentivized reviews so you have to think out of the box here. Ask your friends, neighbors, family to find your product manually on Amazon and buy it at full price, hire someone (fiverr, Upwork, bartender from a local bar, your dentist…just find someone) to search for it and buy at full price. You’re noticing a pattern? Don’t send a link to your product – let them find it manually. Amazon will rank higher your product for that particular search terms. Let them buy at full price, so you won’t have any problems with Amazon and incentivized reviews. Additionaly, along with review other potential customer will see it’s a verified purchase and you’ll have social proof. This is against Amazon TOS but trust me, without those initail sales and reviews your product will just sit and collect dust in Amazon warehouse.


That’s all folks, now you have started your own brand.


If they sell, don’t take money out of the table, re-invest into more inventory, decrease shipping costs, move on to a new product and start the whole process again. Except this time it should go much smoother and easier and eventually you’ll have your own company, your own small business.


If you want to invest more, I would buy 4 or 5 different products rather than a lot of inventory of one product. You’ll maximize your chances of success by having multiple possibilities for success.


I run an email list that alerts people on new profitable Amazon products.

934,6kdae6,False,,111,"After 10 years, Eroshare.com is going down today - a nsfw website born and grown from Reddit",Entrepreneur,"Not sure how much users in this sub penetrate the darker, nsfw side of Reddit, but eroshare.com is basically ""imgur for hardcore amateur videos"" and has become the go-to place to self-host your nsfw naughty content for people posting that sort of stuff to Reddit.

As per [this article on Vice](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbj3mx/amateur-porn-platform-eroshare-is-shutting-down), at the start of June, the platform announced it would be turned off today due to explosive, unsustainable growth.

Which begs the question - how could they not be making money?

There are a few other threads on reddit discussing the ins and outs of this, but as far as I can see it comes down to the fact that:

* They (admirably) wanted to create an ad-free environment

* They don't (as far as I can see) have a subscription model to support the site

* They're not (as far as I can see) making sufficient $$ selling the data from the site

To me, it seems like a prime target for acquisition by Pornhub, and I'm a bit surprised we haven't seen anything announced in that regard. The amount of original, amateur content the site has collected would surely be worth quite a bit to their brand. I also suspect that if Pornhub did a spin-off site now that was exclusively branded towards self-publishing your own content (compared to their existing model where amateur/community content is still under the primary site), they'd probably have a huge win.

Similarly, given how firmly rooted in Reddit culture they currently are, I'm surprised that the userbase of reddit hasn't come together to fund the site. Although it looks like our [datahoarder homies are on top of preserving existing content](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/6g4c3p/erosharecom_nsfw_shutting_down_june_30th/)

It would be awesome if /u/paulwild or /u/eroshare came on and did an AMA about the business logistics of running a site like this, and some of the background to how it all operates. It sounds like there's an awesome story there, right from their initial launch 10 years ago when they wanted to be a NSFW alternative to youtube

881,4ashqq,False,,58,5 things I learned as a startup founder with zero marketing background,Entrepreneur,"*(For the original article, [click here](https://medium.com/@FranklinAcosta/5-things-i-learned-as-a-startup-founder-with-zero-marketing-background-cb6f7aa12e7b#.9gario7we))*


I made that mistake before of leaving all marketing related decisions to my co-founder because that was his background. So after launching my startup, I took a break from fixing bugs to learn as much as I could about advertising on social media, composing website copywrite, email marketing, and more to help build traction for my product.

Even though my journey on becoming a marketing jedi is far from finished, so far, here is what I’ve learned.


**1. Think in the perspective of your customer.**

This is #1 for a reason; it’s the most important one.

Nearly every sentence on your landing page should answer the question, *“so what?”* Communicate in terms of what **value** your service provides, not **what** it provides. A new customer does not care about what your product does… all they want to know is what is in it for them.

It seems that so many startups think they’re supposed to describe what their product/service is. Too often I see website taglines say things like, “The AirBnB for Pets” or “The Best Digital Marketing Agency For Your Brand”. *Who the hell cares?* The truth is that nobody knows who you are so, honestly, nobody cares. **Instead, tell them why they should care.**

Let’s imagine a website for a product that manages the room temperature throughout your home and use that as an example.


BAD: “Automated temperature monitoring for your home”

BETTER: “Lower your monthly bills and worry less with the perfect temperature in every room”


*Automated temperature monitoring for your home* (so what?) means absolutely nothing to a potential customer. In other words, there is no clear value as to what value the product offers. However, the 2nd line clearly states the benefits of the product to the consumer.

Use this method of thinking for your marketing emails, social media marketing, copywrite, videos, and almost everything you could think of related to selling your product. When you think you’re done, give it to someone else (not mommy and daddy), and ask them: *would you buy this?* Heck, just [tweet your link to me](https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%40FranklinAcosta_,%20would%20you%20buy%20this?%20%5B%5Blink%20to%20your%20product%5D%5D) and I’ll tell you if I would buy your product/service based on your website copy (I’ll do this free, of course) :)



**2. Go to where your customers are.**

Whether your startup is B2B or B2C, your job as the salesman for your product/service is to present solutions to people **that may actually experience the problem you’re looking to solve**. Your job is also to find where this community of people are and go straight to them.

Hugh Liddle from Red Cap Sales Coaching once put it perfectly; his friend, let’s call him Bob, sold a product in the agriculture industry. Instead of going farm to farm (which can be very time consuming), Bob discovered that every morning at 8 am all the farmers in a certain town visited a local coffee shop to get their morning cup of joe. Well, guess where Bob was every morning at 8 am.

While your customers may not all be in a coffee shop like Bob’s was, they may be on an online forum, a subreddit, an online chatroom, a live conference or trade show, a local market, or even the unemployment line at your local welfare office.

When you find them, make sure to follow point number 3 (below).



**3. People don’t want to be sold to.**

I don’t know a single person that likes it when someone tries to sell them something. As soon as I hear something along the lines of, “Do you experience back ache in the morning? Do you wish your bed was more comfortable?”, I immediately look the other way because it sounds like a sales pitch. If this sounds like something you do, stop it now because it’s hurting your sales.

Last week a friend on Facebook sent me the message below after I posted a status about entrepreneurship.


> **Her:** Hello. I came across one of your posts on my newsfeed and I thought it was great. I like some of your posts and I actually just wanted to run something by you. I’m not sure if you’re open but I am working with a group of millionaires on a billion dollar idea and I am looking for people who want more than what they are currently getting right now. Would you be one of them? Yes or no?

> **Me:** Hey [friend’s name]. Many entrepreneurs are working on what they perceive is a million or billion dollar idea ;) What is the idea that you’re referring to?

> **Her:** Well that is true but our actual company growth is headed into that billion dollar direction! Let’s exchange contact info and I’ll be happy to show you what were working on!


I didn’t respond to her after that.

Let’s be honest. Would good ol’ YOU actually reply to her saying, “Yes OMG I definitely want more than I am getting right now”?

I’m not going to get into the specifics of all the things wrong with this message but it’s obvious that she wanted to sell me something and that’s all she cared about. Her interest wasn’t really to “help me get more than what I’m getting”. It also sounded like something straight out of a flowchart from the sales training class of her “billion dollar company”.
Be human. Be authentic. When reaching to customers/businesses just use natural language. **People want to feel important.** If you speak to customers in cheap-car-salesman lingo, you’re not making them a priority. You might as well be a robot.



**4. When sending cold e-mails make it personal and straight to the point.**

Again, follow point number 3 especially when looking for cold leads via e-mail.

If your startup is B2B, make your e-mails to potential clients personal. Don’t make your e-mail seem like a canned response or template. Nobody likes that and most people will not read it. Remember, **people want to feel important**. Instead, tell them exactly why you *know* **they** will specifically benefit from your product/service.

Also, make the e-mail short and sweet. Don’t get into details about your product/service or attempt to sign them up immediately. Right now all you need to do is get them interested and set up a follow up call to talk more.
Try to make your e-mail super short. It shouldn’t look like a letter and it shouldn’t be more than 2–3 paragraphs of more than 2–3 short sentences each.

Get them interested. Talk details later.



**5. A 5-year old should be able to understand what you do.**

Without scrolling or clicking anything, your customer should at least have a clear idea of what your product/service is about within 15–20 seconds of visiting your website.

The attention span of a new customer can be very low so you should communicate your message in the simplest words possible. I learned somewhere (if I remember where, I’ll update this) that your landing page should be able to explain what you do to a 5 year old. I use this concept all the time when making landing pages. Here’s why:


Nobody has time to decipher your message. Give it to me straight.

Make it super simple. Here is how:

* Keep your message short.
* Use words that flow well together in a sentence (match syllable counts when possible). No, I’m not talking about making your website a rap song or haiku ;)
* Use words that even a non-native speaker of your language can understand.
* Do not use English phrasal verbs. Here is a [list of a few](https://www.englishclub.com/vocabulary/phrasal-verbs-list.htm). Not everyone understands what these may mean and a 5 year old probably won’t either.


BAD WORD CHOICE: establish

BETTER WORD CHOICE: prepare, create/make, build, deliver, give


BAD WORD CHOICE: come upon, identify

BETTER WORD CHOICE: find, explore, discover


If you’re not sure what alternative word to use, look up the word on thesaurus.com and keep it simple! :)

340,d6rc4w,False,,253,[NEWS] PayPal Decides To Keep Transaction Fees If You Process A Refund,Entrepreneur,"Super predatory practice going on at PayPal right now and the email they sent out is fucking really sneaky.

They decided to change their payment processing terms of service where if a customer needs a refund or to cancel an order if you refund them they keep the 3% transaction fee + 30 cents.

So if you sell a computer for $1000

Paypal would get $30

Let’s then say the customer decided they ordered the wrong item or found it cheaper elsewhere and they need to cancel.

Boom you just lost $30 for absolutely nothing!


Meaning essentially a competitor could come to you with PayPal and just place a ton of orders and cancel them to drain a you in fees just for fun!

Stop using PayPal if you aren’t already. No other payment processor does this it’s extremely predatory.

My name is Ryan Grant and I run an online retail business selling on Amazon, eBay, Jet.com, and our own websites.

Here's a screenshot taken this morning of our Amazon Sales dashboard: https://imgur.com/a/yYIKZ

Almost exactly 4 years ago I quit my job as an accountant to pursue selling online full time.  I have been selling online in some capacity since 2008 when I was a freshman in college, and it has been my full time business since September of 2013.  

I now have a team of 10 that help me run the business. The individuals on my team handle the bulk of the day to day operations and I am able to focus on how to grow the business.  

We source products via a variety of methods including retail arbitrage, online arbitrage, wholesale, as well as import products directly.  We now are focused primarily on growing the list of wholesale brands that we work with.  

I have documented my journey from quitting my job to growing this business on my website: www.onlinesellingexperiment.com.  For the first 21 months I shared all of my income reports breaking down exactly what was coming in and going out each month.  

Through the website I have also built up a consulting/coaching business that has grown to provide a nice additional income stream.  The onlinesellingexperiment site is monetized as well.  

I will be answering questions for the next couple of hours, and will check back periodically throughout the day as well to answer any additional questions that come in.

348,586ofh,False,,109,This Is Why I'm an Entrepreneur,Entrepreneur,"I recently started a full-service digital advertising agency. We build websites, run social media campaigns, make videos - if it's on the web, we do it. I'm not gonna lie - it's been pretty rough at times. I find myself wondering if I made the right decision in leaving my cushy 9-5. I've had to drastically change my lifestyle to make this work, and even then I'm barely staying afloat. 

This afternoon, a client and I were discussing a project we recently completed for him. When we kicked things off, we had agreed to make just one single overview video for his business, but after an initial draft and looking over the amount of footage we got, we collectively decided that breaking it up into 2 to 3 would deliver his message much more saliently. While on the phone, he told me to include whatever up-charge there was for breaking up the video into the final invoice. I told him no - this is what we agreed to, and delivering a quality product is more important to me than a extra few hundred dollars. I jokingly told him that as long as we move forward with a retainer agreement for us to handle all of his marketing, there's no need for an up-charge. 

He then told me: ""There's no if - we're absolutely moving forward with whatever retainer agreement you propose. You're the first person I've ever worked with in this space that I trust, and I know that you have my best interest at heart. You just tell me what you think we need and how much that is, and you got it.""

I'm not gonna lie, I got emotional. For a few seconds I couldn't even say anything. Everything I've been doing, everything I've poured into this business and the work I do for my clients, all of it was justified by just a few sentences. 

I started this business because I saw an opportunity to create a digital marketing company that people could trust. I was so sick of the bullshit my previous employers would pull; locking clients into unfair contracts and recommending different type of online work for the sake of the number on the proposal, not for what the business needed. This will probably come off as self righteous, but I believe that doing right by people is always going to benefit you in the long run. While that belief has been shaky these last few weeks, today completely reinforced it.  

Anyways, I just wanted to share my story. If you're feeling down about your business or aren't doing as well as you'd hoped, maybe my story will make you feel a little better. Never stop improving, never stop learning, and always consider your clients needs first.

199,axncm4,False,,152,15 lessons from our first $15 million in recurring revenue,Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit,

I wrote this post for my blog, but thought you might all find it interesting. Happy to answer any questions!

Last week we crossed $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) for ConvertKit, my email marketing company. My original dream was to get to $600,000 in ARR, so I'm pretty thrilled! Over the last six years I've learned and written about quite a few lessons, but it's always fun to reminisce on the highlights, that oddly enough mostly come from the hardest times.

## 1. Focus is everything

It's fine to start something on the side, but if you want to turn it something real it needs to move to the center of your focus. Years ago I decided to [go all in on ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/doubling-down-on-convertkit/), moving it from a side project to my only project.

Without that decision ConvertKit wouldn't be here today.

Anytime someone brags about how many businesses they run I cringe. I'd far rather take one thing and do it really well. I'll leave the serial entrepreneurship for the scattered, the wannabes, or those who are truly far more talented than I am.

A friend told me the other day that he was surprised I still only did ConvertKit. At this point we have an incredible team, available capital, and the leverage of an audience. Why not start something else and run it in parallel?

Because I know myself.

Focus is where I thrive. Focus is where I get results. Focus is everything.

## 2. Choose a niche

Choosing a niche is the easiest advice to give and the hardest advice to take. When you don't have traction, it feels like choosing a niche will exclude the few people who are coming in the door. In reality when we chose *""email marketing for professional bloggers""* everything changed.

Messaging became clear, the product roadmap was trimmed, and the prospect lists practically wrote itself.

Without that change—without excluding everyone who didn't fit into the blogger bucket—it would have been incredibly hard to get off the ground.

We eventually expanded to ""email marketing for creators,"" which now includes podcasters, actors, YouTubers, authors, artists, musicians, and so many more. Even with growing into that larger audience we are still so much more focused than our competitors who target all small-businesses.

## 3. Use sales to kickstart word-of-mouth

Word-of-mouth is the best way to grow a company, but you need traction for the referrals to start. That's where direct sales come in. By choosing a niche, listing out your prospects, and getting in touch directly you no longer have to wait for them to come to you.

Each conversation—even though most end in rejection—will teach you so much. At first it's one customer. Then five. Then ten.

Immediately you'll notice something crucial: the customers you recruit are higher quality than the ones who just walk in the door. Why would you leave the future of your product up to just anyone who stumbles across what you create?

Instead go out and sell to the customers you want. Then ask them for referrals. Finally, when the word-of-mouth referrals kick in, they will be to the right people.

## 4. Do the hard work that doesn't scale

Each sales call would end the same way: ""I love what you're doing and I'd love to switch...but it's too much work. Sorry.""

Ouch. No matter how much convincing I did I wasn't able to overcome that objection. That is until I offered to do the full switch for them for free.

That meant getting their account access, moving every form, copying and pasting every sequence email, exporting and importing their subscribers, and so much more! It was terribly unprofitable to do that for a $79/month customer. But early on that was how we got momentum. Every customer matters.

So many people told me that wasn't scalable. I needed to use paid ads, SEO, or some other scalable way to acquire customers. That's great if you can make them work, but many can't. So I did the work that no one else was willing to do.

John and Patrick Collison famously did this with Stripe. Rather than waiting to follow-up after a promising conversation, they would migrate other startups to Stripe on the spot.

Don't wait for the follow-up or have the customer do all the work. Do the hard work that doesn't scale.

Today we still offer a free concierge migration for anyone over 5,000 email subscribers. Many of our competitors have copied it and offer it as well.

It feels good to make them react to us.

## 5. Find what works and repeat it

Webinars were the first scalable growth channel we found that really worked. My first thought was to do those and keep searching for the next thing...but then I realized that we should focus on what's working. We test and iterate like crazy, but then once it pays off we go all in.

Over the last three years we've done hundreds of webinars with an incredible number of affiliate partners. They are hard, time consuming, and exhausting. But they work.

Run all the experiments. Test. Analyze the data. The when you find something that works be prepared to go all in.

## 6. Building infrastructure to support growth will take far longer than estimated

We spent our first company retreat fighting fires and rebuilding our server infrastructure. What was supposed to be a time to just connect, plan, and get to know each other turned into an all hands on deck fight to keep our product online.

I thought we'd spend nearly all our time building cool new features for customers. But instead the work was in doing what customers care about most: making sure the basics work well. Emails need to send on time and subscriptions need to work flawlessly.

There's a lot of software that when it goes down, you just work on something else. Not email marketing. It's core to the entire business and reliability is everything.

The infrastructure that was built to support 1,000 customers will break at 10,000. It's crucial to dedicate time to support the growth.

## 7. Funding is optional

Right about now we should be raising a $25 million series A. Or at least that's what our peers are doing. Instead we haven't raised a single dime of outside capital. I put in $5,000 to kick things off, then another $50,000 when I doubled down on ConvertKit.

Getting rejected by venture capitalists is one of the best things that's ever happened to me.

We built ConvertKit our way, at our pace, and with our values. Every line of code is funded by the creators we serve. I wouldn't have it any other way.

## 8. It's possible with a smaller team than most people think

Today at ConvertKit we have 38 amazing team members. At $15 million ARR that is nearly $400,000 per team member! A much higher ratio than any of our peers. At this stage 75 employees would be normal.

Instead of hiring as quickly as possible to solve every pain, we are deliberate about working on the right things. The constraint requires us to say no, not spread ourselves thin, and only do the highest leverage work.

It also means that we can invest in each team member more and carefully craft the culture we want, rather than simply focus on reaching headcount goals.

There are always tradeoffs, maybe we could move faster, build more, or support customers better. So we are still striving to find the right balance between team size, efficiency, and total output.

## 9. Culture is everything—and it's not what you think

We have so many weird habits as a team at ConvertKit: talking about someone in the third person as if they're not there, long walks in pairs where only one person is allowed to talk, starting meetings by asking, ""red, yellow, or green?"" and diving directly into the hard conversations.

That's because to us culture isn't bean bag chairs and free lunch, but instead an environment where conflict is kind and direct, expectations are clear, and trust is most important.

Our version of culture has turned ConvertKit into a place that we all want to come to work.

## 10. Share the profits

There are two important factors for running ConvertKit as a financially efficient company:

1. **Transparent financials.** Every dollar spent is visible to the entire company through our open books.
2. **Profit sharing.** We share more than 50% of the profit in the company with the entire team.

The result is that everyone is incentivized to spend money efficiently.

We once asked the team: ""would you rather go to San Diego or Costa Rica for the next team retreat?""

Everyone said Costa Rica.

So we did the research and found that Costa Rica would cost about 50% more because of higher housing costs and additional travel logistics. With the complete picture we asked the team again.

This time San Diego won by a landslide.

That attitude carries over to everyone when they use their company credit card. It's not just the company's money, it's their money. And they spend it accordingly.

In the last few years we've distributed over $1,000,000 to the team in profit sharing. All while spending aggressively on growth. That's a number I'm really proud of!

## 11. Always pay your debts

No, I'm not talking about Game of Thrones, or even financial debt. There's another kind of debt more devastating to software companies: technical debt.

The code that worked fine at $15,000 in revenue looks like a joke at $15 million. Not to say you should have spent the time to build it perfectly from the beginning—that's a fools game to try—but instead that every shortcut you take is building more debt. The longer you wait the more interest accrues.

We've had to spend a significant of time and money refactoring all of that old code. It's part of scaling. Every software company has to do it, but it would be so frustrating if we didn't expect it and have a plan to pay it back systematically.

## 12. As you grow, your company’s name builds equity. Don’t take that for granted.

For years I've wanted to build ConvertKit into a global brand and I thought that meant changing the name to something more brandable. While being focused on this new change I completely missed the trust, care, and love our customers had for the name ConvertKit.

You just quietly enjoy the status quo. People only talk about what they want to change. It would be weird to send an email to Patagonia saying, ""I really love your name, please don't change it.""

So when we would receive emails every month from creators who thought ConvertKit was too salesy and they didn't want to be associated with the brand, that wasn't balanced by all the people who had quietly grown to love our name and the brand it represented.

Ultimately we decided to stay as ConvertKit, which is a long story that I promise I'll write in full at some point.

## 13. You don’t have to be an asshole to build a successful company

Being an asshole is *one* way *some* entrepreneurs have been able to build big companies. Assholes are often loud about their own success, so we hear about them more than we should. But there are a bunch of good people building exciting companies too. Good people who care for their team, their family, and their customers.

Ignore the entrepreneur media.

Don’t be an asshole and don’t settle for working for one.

## 14. Surprise launches aren't worth it

A surprise launch or release is fun for you… until it isn’t.

I love having my Steve Jobs moment by unveiling a new feature to the applause of a crowd. I've done it the last two years at our conference, [Craft + Commerce](http://conference.convertkit.com/). But behind each of those moments is weeks or months of pushing hard to make a deadline. Trimming the project scope, reprioritizing backlogs, and hoping that everything goes well in the live demo.

But that's only part of it. What follows is releasing to customers, which is really painful if you missed the mark on any of your designs, planning, or timelines. That means a ton of tickets in the support queue, frustrated users, and losing confidence in the product.

Now we've moved away from launching these big surprises. Instead we work with smaller groups of customers to understand how a new product or change will affect them. Then we use that information to build a smarter launch and rollout plan. A plan that usually involves methodically rolling out to a few features at once.

We're still be able to make a splash, but we are able to do it with more confidence and a lot less stress.

## 15. I felt most successful after the hardest decisions

While skiing a few weeks ago my friend [Anthony](https://www.breakthetwitch.com/) asked the group, ""do you feel successful?"" It was a great question to reflect on while riding the chairlift. I'm always striving to learn more and grow the company, so it's foreign to pause and feel success. That feels like settling when I know I'm capable of more.

Overall, I do feel successful, but I was surprised to realize the moments I felt most successful weren't after hitting a major revenue milestone or landing a famous customer.

In hindsight, the times I felt most successful were when I leaned on my principles to make the right decision, even though it was incredibly hard.

Letting a senior leader go. Rolling back a name change I'd worked on for two years. Restructuring the company.

I wrestled with each one. Struggling to have the courage to make the decision I knew was right. But with principles to guide me I could make the decision with confidence.

To me success knows that I've built the courage to make the right decision, especially when it is painful and expensive.

900,f87yc6,False,,56,The Dracula Strategy: Generating B2B leads on LinkedIn by leeching the network of influencers.,Entrepreneur,"Hello guys,

I'm a growth marketer and my expertise is content. I'm doing this strategy on LinkedIn recently and getting a lot of traffic to my blog. Even got some hot leads out of it with zero budget.

It's a very short and potent 3-step strategy. Here I go.

\--

With Linkedin came new influencers and experts. Whatever industry you are in, it has, for sure, an influencer that inspires your audience.

These people are super influential. For Growth Marketers, they’re precious resources to spot audiences that are active on LinkedIn.

What if you can tap into this audience and surround yourself with them? It would be easier for you to open conversations, get engagement and create new business opportunities, right?

This is what our Dracula strategy is all about. Generating leads on LinkedIn by leeching the network of influencers.

# Three bites of Dracula: 

The Dracula strategy is an easy to execute strategy compared to our other playbooks. You have three steps to follow.

1. Find the vessel.
2. Feast on the comments.
3. Steer the attention.

# Step #1: How to find a vessel?

You need to find the most famous person in your industry. You know that type. When they post content, they get engagement showers. 

And that’s what we’re looking for. Mainly comments.

This person is an influencer or your competitor in your industry. And thanks to LinkedIn, finding them is easy. 

All you have to do is to know your audience’s problems. The keywords that they’re already searching for on Google to find answers to their problems. Our keyword will be “LinkedIn marketing” this time.

Go to LinkedIn search and click on content.

Then type your keyword and click. You'll see a list of people with hell a lot of engagement.

I have 900ish comments (total of 5 different posts) in here sitting in front of me. 900 people that potentially will be interested in your LinkedIn marketing service or product.

These people share content daily. They could be gold mines for your business and this is the beauty of growth marketing here. Even if you don’t have the resources and an army of employees, you can still outsmart your competitors.

This was our 30 seconds quick search. You can go more in-depth with different keywords and find influencers in your niche. 

But you got the idea. Now we’re hungry, let’s head to the feast of generating leads on LinkedIn.

# #2: Feast on the comments.

Here you’ll scrape all the profiles in the comment section of the LinkedIn post. If you don’t know how to scrape here is a video crash course:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23e1RHpE5iQ&t=10s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23e1RHpE5iQ&t=10s)

Note: Dataminer sometimes doesn’t work on LinkedIn pages. We don’t know the reason but the solution is to create a new user in your Google Chrome.

After you scrape the comments, you’ll have all the profile URLs. Keep in mind, you can also scrape the people who liked the post if you want to reach more people.

But people who commented are more qualified because they’re engaged with the topic and have an active user status on LinkedIn.

Now, what are you going to do with all these comments? 

# #3: Steer the attention

What is your goal? You can redirect the attention however you like.

* Do you want to promote your SaaS product?
* Do you want to use these people as a traffic source?
* Do you want to make people download your eBook?
* Or do you want to send them your presentation?

You can do anything you want. In our last campaign, I've sent our latest blog post to 1300 people. We used it as our content distribution channel.

We provided a free playbook. But in the playbook, there were CTAs to our products and other eBooks. And it performed well.

We got a little organic traffic jam on the website, had dozens of qualified leads and two customers. All with zero budget.

If you’re a small business with no to low site traffic, you can do the same. 

There are two approaches to send messages. 

**#1: Pull approach**

Here is the message I wrote

>Hey ""Name"",  
I saw you commented on X's post about LinkedIn lead generation. I'm also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with likeminded people like you. Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, let me know if you want to read it.

**Why is this message so effective?**

*“I saw you commented on “X” post about LinkedIn lead generation.”*

It makes my message more credible and personal. We share similarities and I’m using it to my advantage.

*“I’m also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with like-minded people like you.”*

I’m straightforward here. That’s true I want to learn more and expand my network with people that share the same goals.

*Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, let me know if you want to read it.*

This is where I pull. Yes, I wrote something for him but I’ll not throw it to his face. I’ll not enter his territory before he let me in.

Here you give an option to the other party to accept you. And once you let them decide and don’t cross the boundaries, people are kind.

This respectful approach is a good first step to maintain a relationship and start the conversation. 

The result? He liked it and shared the article with his WhatsApp group.

After this point, you can proceed to the next steps. You can ask him if he wants to join the weekly newsletter etc.

With this approach, you need to follow up manually to send the link afterward. 

**#2: Push approach**

With the push approach, you don’t need to follow up manually because you’ll share the link with the first message. Like this.

*Hey Jason,*

*I saw you commented on X’s post about LinkedIn lead generation. I’m also trying to learn more about lead gen and expand my network with like-minded people like you.*

*Recently I wrote a new article about how I generated 700+ leads on LinkedIn, if you would like to read here is the link.*

[*www*](http://www/)*. blahblah. com*

This looks a bit more spammy and can backfire. But then you can automatically send all of the links and don’t have to look back.

**3 compelling message templates for your next campaign**

**1. Salesy and honest reach out**

This is a straight forward message about your intention. People usually accept this kind of invitation because you’re not trying to sell anything to them.

Here is a message template we shared before, which is pretty personal and honest. Ready to be sent.

*Hey #firstName#,*

*Sorry to message you out of the blue. I have this idea that solves X problem for content marketers. I’m trying to connect some like-minded people to talk and get feedback.*

*Would love to know what you think of the idea. Please let me know if you’re interested.*

You can customize this message a bit to your taste and needs. Then you can send your free trial, eBook, service, product, landing page, briefly anything you want.

Or you can push the link in the same message. Our personal favorite is the pull approach though. 

It definitely takes more time with manual work. However, it’s definitely not a waste but an investment.

**2. Straightforward reach out**

This is a straightforward message about your intention. People usually accept this kind of invitation because you’re not trying to sell anything to them.

Hey #firstName#,

I hope you’re having a great day. 

I’m trying to learn more about content marketing and expand my LinkedIn network. Right now, I’m looking for smart and like-minded people on LinkedIn to follow, learn from and exchange ideas.

I thought it would be great to be your connection,

**3. Promise valuable content for them**

Hey #firstName#,

I’m trying to be more active on LinkedIn and connect with like-minded people. I’m planning to share unique content about “X” every week. As a content marketer, I thought you could find some value in them.

Would you like to stay in touch and exchange ideas?

Lastly, add them as your connection and send the message with Phantombuster. 

[Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com/) is my favorite growth hacking tool. You can scrape data, add people, like, comment or message your prospects on different social platforms all automated.

(You can use it for free btw)

Here we’ll use it to add people and send them automated messages.

You have two options here.

1. LinkedIn Network Booster phantom: with that phantom, you can add and message your prospects. But you can only add 80 people per day.

 2. LinkedIn Message Sender phantom: You can send hundreds of messages but you can’t add them.

It's quite simple to use. Just go to the desired Phantom and follow the instructions.

After you chose one all you need to do is to paste that spreadsheet that you have from Dataminer. Then customize your message.

Note: Don’t forget the write the name of the column that contains the LinkedIn profiles in the Dataminer spreadsheet to “Column name from which to get profile URL’s”. That will indicate Phantombuster where to extract data.

Don’t forget the daily limit. Set it to 10 people per launch and 8 times a day.

Run your phantom and get ready to generate leads on LinkedIn.

This is it.

The Dracula Strategy is a flexible one. What you can do is all up to your end-goal and creativity.

373,flym8l,False,How to Grow,72,We just compiled a huge list of learning resources for digital marketing. We thought this sub would appreciate it!,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys! With the whole self-isolation thing going on, it’s an awesome time to learn a new skill (or ten). I've been hoarding some of the best guides / resources on digital marketing for the past \~5 years or so, and recently decided to transform it into a guide.

To make it an awesome read, I also created learning paths for most of the digital marketing channels. So, it's not like, ""go read 4835 articles,"" but more like, ""Read A, then B, then C,"" and so on.

Enjoy!

# Before we start talking about specific channels, though, let's discuss HOW you can learn digital marketing best.

 First things first - you need to decide which channel to start with.

If you have a knack for writing, we’d recommend going with **Content Marketing** or **Copywriting**. On the other hand, if you’re more analytics-oriented, go for **Search Ads** or **PPC**.

As a given, you DON’T have to learn all the channels. You can just pick one that you like, and specialize in it!

Once you’ve decided on which channel to roll with, you should also establish a learning methodology.

As with most things in life, reading on digital marketing won’t take you far. You need to also put everything into practice.

We usually recommend going with one of these 4 options: 

1. **Create a test learning environment**. Basically, you create a website for a basic product or service (heck, even a blog would do!), and start applying whatever you learned about digital marketing to get leads and customers. Even if you have ZERO budget, this can be an interesting learning experience. And yes - it’s possible to start w/ a zero budget. 
2. **Get an internship**. This can be a bit painful if you’re in the middle of your current career, but hey, swallow the pride. If you do your best, you’ll be doing some real work 6 months after the internship.
3. **Offer a local business to help them with marketing for free**. Find a business you think you can help in your area and reach out to them! 
4. [**Create an affiliate blog**](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/affiliate-marketing-blogs/299053/). Pick a niche, create an affiliate blog, and start pumping out some content. This is mainly relevant if you want to learn SEO or content marketing.

And here’s what you ***SHOULD NOT DO***:

>*Read a guide or two, buy a course, whip out your own website, repurpose the course and start pretending to be a marketing expert to potential clients.* 

There’ are way too many people doing this as-is. Please stop! You’re setting yourself up for failure. 

You’d be surprised how many people we see on Facebook Ads groups asking, *“hey guys, I closed my first client, now how the heck do I deliver on my promises?”*

...Now that we got that out of the way, let’s get to learning some digital marketing!

# How to learn content marketing 

Most traditional advertising channels are focused on directly selling a  product. If you turn on the TV, you’ll see a TON of ads for this product, or that product or service.

Content marketing is a form of indirect advertisement.

The idea here is, instead of directly pitching your product to your target audience, you create content (article, video, infographic, etc.) around the problem your product solves, and pitch that instead.

To make this a LOT clearer, here’s a practical example.

Let’s say you’re a marketing agency that specializes in helping SaaS companies with their digital marketing (meta, right?).

Instead of directly running ads yelling “We help SaaS companies!” you create a mega-guide on the topic and advertise that.

...Which is what we did.

We created a mega-guide to [SaaS marketing](https://apollodigital.io/blog/saas-marketing) and promoted the hell out of it all over the web. This netted us around \~10,000+ traffic and 15+ leads in the first week, and we STILL get traffic to the piece, 2 months later.

We even posted it on this sub and got around 600 upboats.

Sweet, right? 

Now, you’re probably wondering, is this option better than just running ads to your service / product?

Yes, yes it is. Here’s why:

1. **It’s free (ish).** The only resources it took was our time to write the post, edit it, and promote it. Ads, on the other hand, can be super expensive.

**It builds your brand authority.** Who’d you trust with your marketing? A random guy that popped up on your Facebook newsfeed, or the guys that wrote the most comprehensive guide to SaaS marketing you’ve ever read? Exactly! 

If you want to learn how to do content marketing, here's what we recommend:   


1. **First, learn the basics.** You can find a ton of online courses or articles on this. Here are some of our favorites:
   1. [HubSpot’s Academy content marketing course](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/content-marketing)
   2. Neil Patel’s guide to [content marketing basics](https://neilpatel.com/what-is-content-marketing/)

   2. How [Mint grew to 1.5 million users](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-mint-grew/) (a big chunk of the credit goes to content marketing) 

### Learn SEO

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is another super popular digital marketing channel.

In a nutshell, SEO is the act of optimizing your web pages and content for Google so that your website pops up when people look up certain terms.

For example, let’s say you’re a project management software. Would it benefit you if you popped up #1 when people Google for your keyword?

Yes, yes it would. You’d be getting **highly qualified** leads for your software every day, for free, with ZERO ad spend.

Cool, right?

Here’s what an SEO specialist does on a daily basis:

* **Content Creation** \- Create SEO content (or work with freelance writers)
* **On-page SEO** \- Make sure that all content on the blog is optimized for Google and interlinked to each other 
* **Technical SEO** \- Make sure that the web dev team is following SEO best practices when working on the website
* **SEO Strategy** \- Doing keyword research and finding new web pages and content to create
* **Link-building** \- Conducting link-building (or supervising outreach specialists).

331,9hd5f7,False,Case Study,136,How I got 48 YouTubers to agree to review my product,Entrepreneur,"I previously wrote about an [experiment where I spent $13,867 on YouTube ads](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/what-i-learned-advertising-on-youtube) promoting Candy Japan, a Japanese candy subscription box I run. Many suggested that instead of spending money on ads, I should have just sent samples to YouTubers to get them to cover the service for free.

That was a good suggestion, so I decided to try it and do a writeup here (and also [as a blog post](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/ab-testing-contacting-youtubers)) about the results.

## Gathering a contact list

Being new at this, I decided to start by contacting a larger number of small YouTube channels to learn what kind of an approach would work the best. 

I assumed the response rate would be low, so I would need to find a lot of channels to contact. I wanted them to be relevant to people with a strong interest in Japan, and after several evenings of work managed to put together a list of several hundred small cosplay channels. At this point I only had their channel URL, but no way to contact them.

Many list their email address directly in their YouTube profile, while others only have a link to their Tumblr page for example. That page might then link to their other social media profiles, one of which might eventually have a way to contact them. Besides just finding an email address, I also wanted to find names. I read all channel descriptions and watched the beginning of video introductions to make sure I was addressing each recipient appropriately. 

This was mind-numbing work that took me close to 10 minutes per channel initially. It's also distracting work in that I needed to spend a lot of time on YouTube and in various social networks without getting sidetracked. To be able to focus, I turned it into a little game for myself. How fast can I go through the next 20 channels? What can I do to improve my time? In the end I had improved enough that I was able to find the name and contact information for a channel in less than 2 minutes.

A little setback happened along the way: [Google removed private messaging from YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57955?vid=0-997051002115-1537321334743).

I had hoped to use YouTube private messages as a fallback for channels that don't list their email address anywhere. Just as I thought that I had gathered enough channels to contact, private messaging became impossible, and I had to redouble my efforts to make up for all the channels that had now become unreachable.

In the end I had a spreadsheet of 180 cosplay YouTubers with a way to contact each. The average channel in the list has less than 4000 subscribers, with a total of 664k subscribers – power law at play here, combined these roughly match a single popular YouTuber in impact. I wasn't sure if a tiny channel could send enough sales to exceed the cost of sending them a sample, but if it did, that would scale nicely as I could keep sending more and more samples to similar channels. 

### A/B testing message content

I decided to amuse myself with a little multivariate test and send everyone a slightly different message to learn what works best. 

#### Choosing a title

I tried two different subject lines for the email, but the difference was minor. The worse one turned out to be ```""Want a Japanese candy review box?""``` and the slightly better one ```""Free Candy Japan sample for unboxing video""```. Of the people who received the former, 25% agreed to do a review. Of the latter, 28.26%. 

#### Message body

I started each message with:

```
Dear so-and-so,

Would you like to receive a Japanese candy review box for your YouTube channel?
```

I created five snippets of text, randomly including them in the messages I sent out. Below you can see each snippet, along with what the response rate was when each was absent or present. 

**Snippet 1: clarifying what I want them to do**

```
I was hoping that if I send you two boxes, you could unbox and try the candies and introduce the service to your subscribers.
```

With the above snippet included, 29.55% agreed to do a review. Without it, 23.91% agreed. Takeaway: be clear about what you expect people to do for you.

**Snippet 2: longer self-introduction**

```
I run a site called Candy Japan, which sends surprise boxes of Japanese sweets to members twice a month.
```

With the above included 27.63% agreed, without 25.96% did. Takeaway: including an elevator pitch of your service may help.

**Snippet 3: appealing to popularity**

```
These types of ""trying Japanese candy"" videos tend to be very popular, many having millions of views. 
```

With the above included 24.72% agreed, without 28.57% did. Takeaway: don't be patronizing?

**Snippet 4: offering their viewers a discount**

```
I can also give your viewers a discount coupon.
```

With the above included 27.38% agreed, without 26.04% did. Takeaway: it doesn't really matter if you offer a discount or not. In the end I still gave everyone a discount coupon anyway.

**Snippet 5: call-to-action**

```
If you would like to receive a review box, please let me know your mailing address.
```

This had the highest impact: with the above included 21.11% agreed, without 32.22% did. Note that even without this line, in the end everyone still gave me their mailing address, so this only means that it's better not to ask for it right away. 

I can think of two reasons for this. Either people need a bit more back-and-forth before parting with such personal information, or possibly it's just more work to reply to this email, so more people will think ""I'll reply later"", and then forget about it.

**Include image or not?**

Another variation I tried was attaching [an image of the Japanese candy](http://www.candyjapan.com/static/candy_japan_october_2017.jpg) I might send them. I expected this to be a no-brainer in that having the picture would be better, but this actually turned out not to matter. Out of those who got the image 26.97% agreed vs. 26.37% for those who did not get it. 

My guess here is that it may actually be beneficial to have the image, but that it is balanced out by more of these emails ending up classified as spam.

## Overall response rate

I sent out 180 messages, and guessed that perhaps a dozen people would agree to do a review. In the end 48 YouTubers sent me their shipping address. Only 5 people outright refused to do a review, and even they still wrote polite responses. 

Having 26.67% agree to do a review was a much higher rate than I had imagined, and I ended up annoying my wife by having a larger than expected pile of samples in our apartment. I was taking the samples to the post office by bicycle. For some reason it takes close to 30 minutes for the local post office to process each batch ([pic](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/pile_of_boxes_at_japan_post.jpg)), the UI in their POS must be pretty terrible.

One wrong assumption I had was that more popular YouTubers would be harder to get to agree to do a review. Splitting my list of YouTubers evenly into ""less popular"" and ""more popular"" groups of less or more than 2290 subscribers, the agree rates were 27.78% and 25.56% respectively – a difference of only two more YouTubers agreeing in the less popular group.

## Thanks for reading

It is a fair amount of work to find enough relevant YouTubers to contact, to correspond with them and to actually ship samples.

If you need to ship a YouTuber a physical product sample, don't ask for their address until after they have replied to the initial email. Include an elevator pitch of your service and be clear what you want them to do in the video.

With this approach when contacting relevant less popular YouTubers, you may expect around 30% of recipients to agree to do a review.

I have now sent out most sample boxes, but not everyone has made their videos yet. It will also take some time to know how popular the videos will turn out to be. I will post again once I have data on how many sales these videos actually resulted in. Until then 👋

911,8diejt,False,Case Study,106,"8 months and $547,600 in revenue. Overview of starting my own freight brokerage.",Entrepreneur,"For people not involved in transportation & shipping, a freight broker is an intermediary between a shipper who has goods to transport and a trucking company who has capacity to move their product from point A to point B.

&nbsp;


**Background** 
I’ve worked for 7 years in freight brokerage prior to starting my own shop and I was able to manage the department and moderately grow from $100,00 per year in gross revenue to 15 million in my final year. I was lucky enough to have a great mentor and hardworking coworkers and gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and wherewithal in the industry. The summer of 2017, I was getting burnt out from the hours and travel, so I decided this would be the best time for me to try this on my own and see if I could make it work without a large asset based transportation company supporting me.

On July 31st, I gave my notice and the next day started the LLC.

&nbsp;


**Setting up** 
For as many rules and regulations the federal and state governments put on transportation, it was a surprisingly quick and simple process for an industry that is heavily regulated. I formed an LLC, applied for the brokerage authority through DOT and purchased a brokerage bond and insurance. From the day I quit to officially open for business was 10 days.

&nbsp;


Our costs for initial setup was $4,490.52 (insurance, bond authority, LLC, software) and our recurring expenses (dispatching software, insurance, phones, etc.) is $770.00 per month. As a new transportation provider with no history of credit, I had to partner with a factoring company so that we could pay our transportation carriers immediately so I wouldn’t have to wait 30-45 days to get paid from our customers and to then pay them. They take 3.75% off of the gross revenue for each invoice but I am hopeful sometime in 2019 to ditch the factoring company and use my own cash flow to manage AR & AP.

&nbsp;


**Monthly Revenue**
(Aug 1st – March 31st)

I wasn’t required to sign a non-solicitation agreement at my prior company, so I was free to target and work with who I wanted and knew. Unfortunately I misjudged how much pressure my former employer would use against all customers that I had previously worked with, and after the 2nd month, none of my accounts that I brought with me were using me for fear of losing the services of my previous company. After a year in business I will have the opportunity to win some of those accounts back but I am moving forward with the mindset that they are lost forever. 

I am slowly building up new customers and exploring ways to get my name out there. 

Revenue | August | September | October | November | December | January | February | March  
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
Gross | $50,800 | $205,000 | $52,100 | $36,400 | $50,800 | $62,300 | $42,900 | $47,300
Net | $6,900 | $29,500 | $7,200 | $5,500 | $5,500 | $6,200| $8,100 | $5,400

Since Merch by Amazon (the program I was using in the old post), is still on lockdown, I am going to show you step by step how to take graphics/designs, and sell them on Amazon on 10’s if not 100 different kind of items by using the new Shopify Amazon integration combined with print on demand services to fulfill your orders. This means you can take action TODAY.

Before any of you get on your pedestal about self promotion, yes, this did come from the [Merch Informer blog](https://merchinformer.com/shopify-amazon-merch-no-inventory-integration-guide/), and yes you can do this method I am about to lay out for you 100% without using any tools. If you want to learn something, continue reading. If not, continue on with your day. Let’s do it.

**What Is Merch?**

If you have been reading what I have been posting this last year, you may be thinking about Merch by Amazon where the focus was just t-shirts. Merch, however, goes a lot more broad than that. This can include anything from funny novelty t-shirts to flags you hang on your wall, to the yoga pants that are worn to the gym and everything in between.

If you have sold on Amazon before, or pushed t-shirts and realized how many customers you have access to, then you know how lucrative it can be. Shirts are just the tip of the iceberg though. If you could start selling beach towels, coffee mugs, yoga pants, flags, and any other type of merch without ever seeing or touching inventory on Amazon, imagine how your earnings would explode overnight.

**Why Merch?**

[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-revenue-1024x768.png)

As you can see from the image above, Amazon is doing it’s very best to capture as much market share as it can. That is literally all they care about, grow bigger than everyone else! At the very end of 2015, they opened yet another program to attempt to take over another sector of the market: Merch by Amazon. This program was aimed at dominating the print on demand (POD) niche, and it was an overnight success.

This program allowed everyday people and designers like you and I to put up original artwork and funny says on novelty t-shirts and sell them to Amazon customers without ever dealing with customer support or touching the actual product. Amazon sold, packaged, and shipped your products and gave the designer a royalty. Earnings from early adopters were absolutely massive and in some cases into the 100’s of thousands of dollars.

Unfortunately, Amazon did not expect the monster growth of the Merch by Amazon program and quickly turned it into an invite only program. Recently they have been processing so many orders that they have completely stopped accepting people to the program and people who do have an account are not allowed to publish or are allowed to publish with restrictions.

[https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png](https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/online-retailers.png)

You can see that if you want to make money online by selling apparel, you NEED to be selling on Amazon. There is really no other way around it. By 2020 they are going to be absolutely dominating the online market place and you have the chance to be a part of it.

With Merch by Amazon closed to the public, and not wanting to deal with shipping items from China or dealing with a print shop for every order, what can be done?

Fulfillment by Amazon is an option, but from our experience, not a very good good one. You would have to buy the products a head of time and send them to a ware house. With Merch by Amazon, we clearly know that selling Merch hands off is the way to go!

**Use Shopify To Sell Your Merch!**

Many of you reading this are at least familiar with Shopify as a content management system and online store payment processor. From here, you will be able to put your products up for sale and sell them to customers who visit your site.

With recent changes and Shopify integrating with Amazon, this 100% the way to go. Why?

You will have access to not only T-shirts but….

* 	Tank Tops
* 	Phone Cases
* 	Beach Towels
* 	Coffee Mugs
* 	Cutting Boards
* 	Stickers
* 	Long Sleeves
* 	Hoodies
* 	Dog Bowls
* 	Flags
* 	Blankets
* 	Mouse Pads
* 	Shower Curtains

and much more!

Are you starting to see the big picture here? You can take the artwork that you created for shirts or other mediums, and turn a single image into 10s if not hundreds of different products that you will sell ON Amazon.com. No more handling inventory or trying to drive traffic to your store anymore.

This is going to be a long one, so strap in, and let’s go over step by step on how to set up everything so you are no longer held back by Merch limits.

**Shopify Amazon Print On Demand Method**

To make this method work for you, you are going to need 4 things.

* Understand Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank) and what sells best on Amazon
* Designs/Artwork
* Amazon Seller Account
* Shopify Account

Let’s go over how I get everything set up and then we will tie them all together.

**Understanding What Sells on Amazon (Best Sellers Rank)**

The very first thing you need to do before you start your journey is understand what sells best on Amazon, how to spot these items, and how to properly research the different niches you want to create merch around. There are two very key aspects that you need to have a solid understanding of to have any success. These are Amazon BSR or Best Sellers Rank, and the second is understanding Copyright/Trademark.

**Amazon BSR (Best Sellers Rank)**

Every single product that is sold on Amazon has something in the product information called the Best Sellers Rank or Amazon BSR. It will look very similar to this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BSR.png

The BSR is a representation of how well that item is selling in its respective category. The smaller the number, the more items they are selling. The higher number, the fewer items they are selling. For example, if a shirt were to hit number 1 in clothing, it would be the most popular shirt selling on Amazon.

From my experience selling, a BSR of around 100,000 in clothing equates to around 1 sale per day. This is not set in stone, but 100k BSR is usually what I focus my sites on when doing niche research.

**Copyright/Trademark**

You also need to have a full understanding that you are not allowed to infringe on someone else’s copyright or trademarks. This means that you are NOT allowed to simply copy someones design and put it up on another piece of merchandise. Doing so would be breaking copyright laws.

If someone has a particular saying in their artwork that is selling particularly well, they might decide to trademark that term. This would mean that you are NOT allowed to use this term in any of your designs even if it looks completely different.

Copyright and Trademark are both different beasts so make sure you are not infringing on someone else’s intellectual property. A lot of times, you might put something up on Amazon which then gets trademarked later on down the road. They can then use this trademark to come after you and the items you put up causing infractions and an entire mess. If you have thousands of products up like we do, this can be almost impossible to keep track of. If you are at all concerned about this, make sure you are checking daily.

**Getting Designs/Artwork**

When I first started, I created some designs myself. Since I am not a designer by trade, this took a lot of my time up and I had to actually watch some tutorials on YouTube to make sure I was using Photoshop correctly. Once I saw just how well my designs were selling on Amazon, I started to scale up very quickly and this meant getting a designer (or 5), on board to start cranking out original designs. 

Finding a good designer can be extremely hard. You want one that you can count on to be on time, every time. You also want a designer that has some integrity and will be original when you send them ideas. I have managed to hire my entire team of designers at full time for $4 per design each. This may just be personal experience but a lot of them from the Philippines and this really ads up to a great wage in that part of the world.

I have found excellent success by using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com). Upwork is a marketplace to post jobs you are interested in completing and then hiring freelancers. Below is the script that I used to hire each one of my designers.

Hey, I am in need of 400 t-shirt designs in the time period of 2-3 months.

> Your task will be pretty basic, I will send you ideas of t-shirts I want to make and you make them yourself in your own unique style. For example, I might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and I would need you to be inspired by it and create a better version that is in your own creative style.
> 
> I will leave a lot of 5* reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a long-term position. Once we have done the first batch of 400 – around 4 per day, we could continue if everything looks good.
> 
> I look forward to doing business with you!

This works well for me because I always have a lot of designs for them to do because I am quickly scaling up so they will have some long term work from me. It also works well because a lot of very talented people are new to the Upwork platform and are trying to build up their profile to find other jobs. Lots of great reviews from you as a satisfied client can help them in this journey. What this means for you is that they are going to put the best effort forward in order to earn those 5 stars.

**Quick Note: Weeding Out Bad Designers**

When I first tried to hire someone to design for me, they stole images and straight up copied designs. This is wrong, and will get your Merch account banned. I was not able to use any of these designs.

When I first hired someone, I let them know that they cannot use any images which are Copyrighted, or infringe on any Copyright someone else owns.

Then, I will send them a T-Shirt idea that is very clearly Copyright infringement. If they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use, I will immediately get rid of that designer (and that design). The design may have cost me $4, but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats!

**Amazon Seller Account**

The next piece of the puzzle that you are going to need is is an Amazon seller account.

This will ask you to sign into your Amazon account and if you do not have one already, simply sign up for one.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sign-up-for-Amazon.png

Once you are signed up and logged in, there are few things you are going to want to do.
First you will want to navigate to the upper right hand corner to “Settings” and then Account Information. It will bring you to a page that looks like this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/information.png

Fill out the Deposit information so that you are going to get paid, and the tax information. Feel free to change any of the other information but for now all that you need to change is how you get paid, and the tax information.

Next, navigate to the left hand corner of that page where you should see a “Your Services” box.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png

Click on Manage and then upgrade your account to a Professional Account.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/your-services.png

This offers you multiple benefits. It will cost you $39.99 a month, but…

* 	No $0.99 Closing Fee for each item sold, only a monthly $39.99 subscription fee, referral fees and variable closing fees
* 	Ability to collect US sales and use taxes on your orders
* 	Customize your shipping rates and services levels for all products (except Books, Music, Videos and DVDs)
* 	Manage your inventory using feeds, spreadsheets, and reports
* 	Manage orders using order reports and order-related feeds
* 	Access Amazon Marketplace Web Service to upload feeds, receive reports, and perform other API functions
* 	Ability to offer Promotions and Gift Services
* 	Eligibility for Featured Merchant status and listing placement in the Buy Box.

Simply put, If you are selling more than 40 pieces of merchandise a month, you are much better off get a pro account so you have higher profit margins. For this method to work with shopify, a Pro account is REQUIRED.

**Shopify Account**

Getting a Shopify account is extremely easy and they have a 14 day FREE trial.
Head on over to [Shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com/) and click on the get started box in the upper right hand corner.
 
You will then just need to fill out your email address, password, and the store name you want to create.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/set-up-shopify-store.png

Click on the big green create your store button and Shopify will start setting itself up.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-a-store-300x177.png

**Connecting Shopify and Amazon For No Inventory Fulfillment**

Now that you have a fancy new Shopify store for free for the next 14 days, it is time to start taking advantage of what it has to offer. At first, your store will look just like this when you log in.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/brand-new-created-store-1024x631.png

In the lower hand corner, you will see “Apps”. Click on this.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apps.png

What we are looking for here is an App that will fulfill all your orders for you. This is how we are going to print on demand without holding any inventory ourselves.

Search for Teelaunch. It will bring up the page for this app that looks like this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-app.png

Click on the big green “get” button to install this app. You will need to quickly confirm that you want to install it on your shopify store.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/install-app.png

Click on Install App and let it do its thing. Once the app is installed, go back to the left hand side menu, and click on Apps again. We are about to set up this app and add our first product.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-1024x164.png

Once you click on the app, you should see this dashboard:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-product-1024x303.png

Click on the Account button in the upper right hand corner. We want to make sure everything is set up to auto accept and fulfill orders.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account.png
https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-account-1.png

Fill out this page making sure that the top box says “YES”. You will need to add a credit card for the orders that you send Teelaunch. While you will be paying them the base price for the shirts and other merchandise orders you send them, you will be collecting the money from the sales in the Amazon central account.

You will also need to set Shopify to NOT automatically fulfill orders. To do this, go into your Shopify settings -> Checkout and then in the Order processing section, unselect to automatically fulfill the order items. In most cases “Do not automatically fulfill any of the order’s line items” will be selected which is the setting you want.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/auto-fulfill-1024x513.png

**Adding Your First Piece Of Merchandise**

Now we are finally ready to add our first piece of merch. From the teelaunch app, you will want to click on “New Product” on the bar near the top of the page.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-choices-1024x425.png

This is where you can see all the products that are available for you to put your designs on! Not only can you do shirts (which is what this entire tutorial is going to go over), but as mentioned above, there are so many other pieces of merch you can print and send to customers on Amazon. All without lifting a finger for the products yourself. Teelaunch will take the orders and ship them for you while you sit back and collect money off the designs and products!

For this method, we are going to be using the Gildan Unisex shirt. As you can see I have chosen that one on the screen. Once a product is chosen, scroll down to the bottom and click on “Start Designing”. This will bring up the product information and give you a little information about the shipping costs. This is also the space where you can upload your artwork to the shirts and pick what sizes and colors you want the shirt to be available in.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/publish-design-1024x536.png

As you can see, using this shirt, it will cost you $8.50 as a base price and $4 shipping.
Click on “Choose File” to upload your design and then play around with dragging and dropping it as well as dragging the edges out so it displays properly on the shirt you want to list. I just took one of my Merch ready shirts to display how it would look. Pick a few colors and a few sizes.

**Important**: You will need a separate UPC code for every single color and size variation you pick. I will go into this in detail further down, but it is best to not automatically select every color and every size.

Once the design is looking good, click on Review and publish Designs. This will bring up a page where you can add product tags, add your selling price, title and description.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/setting-up-shirt-1024x535.png

Once you are satisfied with how everything looks, go ahead and click on publish at the bottom of the page and your shirt will start processing in all the colors and variations that you have picked.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/processing-to-store-1024x328.png

This can take a little while if you pick a lot of sizes and colors. As you can see from the above picture, I have 48 different variants of just this one shirt! Once it goes through all of them, your shirt is now published in the back end of your shopify store.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shirt-uploaded.png

The entire point is to publish your goods on Amazon though right? To do this, we need to connect them now.

Go back to the main shopify menu and click on “Add a sales channel”. This is BRAND new from Shopify and why I am so excited!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/main-menu.png

You can also find the same thing from the home page. It will be at the bottom. From the screenshot here, you can see you need to hit the install Amazon button to add this as a sales channel to your site.

If you are new to shopify, you do NOT need to create an online store since we are interested in only selling your products on Amazon using a print on demand service (teelaunch).

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Channel.png

Once that is installed, you should see the sales channel added to the menu.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-sales-channel.png

Go ahead and click on it and it will more than likely ask you to update Amazon. This is what you want to go ahead and update the sales channel.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/update-amazon-plugin.png

Once it is updated, you will be able to access the page. From here, you want to be able to connect shopify to your Amazon sellers account we set up earlier.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/connect-Amazon-account-1024x176.png

Click on Connect to Amazon. There is going to be a popup about Amazon MWS. You will need to agree to this. Essentially this is giving Shopify access to your seller central account so they can interact with each other properly.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/agree-to-Amazon-MWS.png

Once these are connected, you will see a screen that looks similar to this. You will see that the account is connected properly:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/account-set-up-1024x544.png

Click on the Listings in the left hand corner. We want to take the shirt we just put online and then put that shirt we created in Teelaunch onto Amazon.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sell-on-Amazon-1024x405.png

Click on the sell on Amazon button. This will bring up a list of the products that you have on Shopify that you may want to sell on Amazon. Since we used Teelaunch to create a shirt, this is what is going to come up in the list.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-product-1024x419.png

After you select the product that you want to list on Amazon, they are going to ask you if you are selling a product from another brand, or from your own brand. Select your own brand.

**Note:** For all the Merch by Amazon users, this is your first real opportunity to build a coherent brand and put work into growing your brand on multiple sales channels. You have full control here and will even be able to respond to the reviews you get!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/select-your-brand-1024x326.png

When you pick that the product is made by your brand, you are going to come to the Amazon listing details. This is going to look very familiar to you if you have sold shirts on Merch before.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-Listing-Details-1024x540.png

Enter in the title, your brand name, the bullet points, and description. You will need to pick a category and will notice that you cannot sell the shirt for both genders at the same time. That is perfectly fine, you can go back after the shirt is live, and then sell the other genders version under the same listing.

Finally, when you scroll down, you will see variants that you have chosen when you were creating the shirt. There will be one for every color and size combo that you created.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Shirt-Varients.png

For each variant, go through and make sure the correct colored image is showing up for the title of that variant. As you can see from the above screenshot, I made sure the Royal Blue image is showing for the royal blue variant of the shirt.

**SKU**

You will need a unique sku for every single varient of your shirt. Your visitors will never see the SKU or the UPC, but Amazon requires you to enter this information in for every shirt Variant.

For the SKU, head on over to [https://www.random.org/strings/](https://www.random.org/strings/) and select the following options and click go. You can generate however many strings you need by modifying the first box.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/use-for-SKUs-1024x622.png
 
You can use each line as one of your SKUs.

**UPC**

Each product and variant must have its own UPC code. These are 12 digit codes. If you have sold on Amazon FBA before, you may have used EAN. So far with the Shopify integration, these will not work so you will need the 12 digit UPC. I highly recommend buying these on Ebay. You can get 1000’s of them for only a few dollars. Once you have them, enter a unique UPC for every variant of the product.

**Clothing and Apparel Category Approval**

You will notice that Shopify tells you that you need approval from Amazon before you can list in this category. Click on the “apply to sell in this category” link and open it in a new tab.

Make sure you answer truthfully to these, but you will be auto approved in the end!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category.png
https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/apply-to-category-2.jpg

The next step is going to be answering some questions about the images you will use. Go through the questionnaire and make sure you answer them all properly. Remember that the images you will be using are being pulled from Teelaunch so they are all good to go with Amazon’s requirements.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Amazon-image-requirements-1024x515.png

After that is complete, fill out the information and submit your application!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/submit-clothing-application.png

After you hit Submit Application you will now be instantly approved and can go back to your shirt listing you were working on in the other tab!

**Finishing Amazon Listing**

Now that you have your SKUs and UPCs listed on each variant of the product, it is now time to submit your product listing. If everything has been entered properly, your listing will go through!

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/listing-created-30-min-to-live-1024x173.png

As you can see from the image above, the listing has been successfully submitted to Amazon. Your listing should be listed in a pending status. This generally will change within 30 minutes to live and you will have a link to your product on Amazon.com.

**Note On Shipping**

When your product finally goes live and you check it, you might notice that the shipping is higher than you expected. Well, you can change this! The shipping is all controlled within your Amazon seller central account.

Head on over to your Amazon account and find the Shipping Settings and then Shipping Templates. Click on Edit Template and then you will be able to pick what type of shipping you will charge your customers.

As you can see from the screenshot, I decided to change shipping from $4.49 for everyone, to $2.99 for the lower 48 states.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/shipping-times-1024x461.png

**ROI Calculations**

This is going to vary per shirt depending on what you price at. Keep in mind that with certain products you may be making a lot larger percentage. You might be making 100% ROI with yoga mats for example.

For shirts though, if you are pricing at 17 dollars, and charging 3 dollars shipping, then the total charge will be around $20. With Amazon fees around $3, and the t-shirt costing you $12.50 (cost of the shirt plus shipping) and a 30c Shopify fee, this leaves you around $4.25 profit for something you never touched! Scale that up by a few hundred if not thousands of shirts you are making great money.

Scale it up even further with the multitude of products you can reuse your designs on, and now you are talking about MASSIVE money, all from your original designs.

**Getting Your First Sale on Shopify with Amazon**

Now with your listings live, you are probably going to get some sales. When you get a sale, they will show up in Shopify (as well as seller central). Make sure you are only dealing with the orders through Shopify though.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/first-order.png

Getting your first order feels great! What is even better though is that from here it is 100% hands off.

If you go back down to apps and then go into the Teelaunch app, you should see this:

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/teelaunch-production-1024x360.png

Without touching it, your shirt is now being made with Teelaunch and will be shipped to your customer as soon as it is complete. This is possible for t shirts and all other products that teelaunch offers.

**Fulfilling Orders Manually**

If your orders are not automatically going through to Teelaunch, you will need to do them manually. The only reason this may be happening is that the Shopify/Amazon integration is BRAND NEW and I have been assured by higher ups that this is being worked on and will be fixed soon if anyone does encounter it.

**Getting Revenue From Amazon**

In order to get your money from your seller account on Amazon to your bank account, you need to have a few things.

The first thing is that you must have valid credit card information on file for verification and billing purposes. This is why you added this when you set up your seller account.
The second thing you must have is valid bank account information so a transfer can occur. This can be added in the “my profile” section of your seller central account.

Basically the way it will work is that after you get a sale, it will show up in your Shopify account. Once the order is marked “fulfilled”, the buyer will be emailed to let them know that their product is on the way. The funds held within Amazon will be deposited to your account every 14 days. The good news is that you can request funds faster than that! Here is what Amazon has to say on the subject.

https://merchinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/amazon-payment.png

**Wrapping It Up**

The Shopify/Amazon integration represents a REAL massive opportunity in the print on demand space and is going to see plenty of people make millions of dollars a year. In order to take advantage of this opportunity successfully you need only a few things:

* 	Know what sells on Amazon
* 	Be willing to WORK and scale your business
* 	Know how to properly optimize your Amazon listings

If you are not hopping on this opportunity today, you are 100% leaving money on the table that is there for the taking. There is zero need to run traffic, zero inventory to hold, and 100’s if not 1000’s of possibilities for making money with the crazy selection of products you can now put for sale on Amazon.

That about raps it up ladies and gentlemen. Any questions ask them below.

Here's 10 things we've learned.",Entrepreneur,"This is the story of how [me](http://www.twitter.com/visakanv) and my partner Desmond created a six-figure ecommerce store entirely in our spare time while working full-time jobs. (We're currently working on [Candybar, a digital loyalty app](https://www.candybar.co/?ref=reddit) for offline stores.)

 We did it by tapping into 2010's Singaporean pop culture just as it was beginning to emerge. 

**[Statement](http://www.statement.sg)** began as doodles in a notebook, and has since done some pretty cool things – showcases at design festivals, [regular features in local media](http://www.statement.sg/pages/about-us/) and a nice passive income stream for the two of us, as well as the opportunity to do all sorts of cool experiments we wouldn’t otherwise be able to do.

###Here are the lessons we’ve learnt along the way.

# Lesson #1: Start quickly by testing the smallest version of your idea

I’ve always been a little too perfectionist about most of my ideas, but in this case I was happy to mess around because I didn’t seriously think I had any chance of going anywhere with it.

So one day when I was a little bored, I decided to [post the ideas on Facebook to see what my friends thought of them](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150340477698915.356918.650823914&type=1&l=eab8a039f1).

On hindsight, this was a very important step, for several reasons:

* “Writing down” my idea to share it with others forced me to make it “real”.  Putting something out puts a stake in the ground for you to subsequently rework with. A crappy draft of an idea is more actionable than a perfect-but-imaginary one.
* Learning that people were interested in my idea motivated me to move forward. I didn’t have ANY of the skills needed to build or run a t-shirt company, and I definitely wouldn’t have felt motivated to learn them unless I knew that people were interested in buying what I had to offer.
* I got buy-in from the guy who’d become my partner. Having somebody else who’s also interested in driving your project forward makes it feel much, much more real.

# Lesson #2 – Get feedback and buy-in from customers ASAP

So great, now I had someone who wanted to help, and he had some visual design skills. He could help me do [mockups in things that weren’t MS Paint](https://www.facebook.com/visakan.veerasamy/media_set?set=a.10150540170793915.387113.650823914&type=3).

These got us from “hey, those are pretty cool ideas, I’d probably wear something like that” to **“How much is this t-shirt and when can I get it?”**

Knowing that people wanted to actually buy these theoretical t-shirts got us motivated to figure out the t-shirt printing process. I don’t think we’d have bothered to go through all the hassle otherwise (and it would’ve been tragic if we did that, only to then print t-shirts that nobody wanted.)

# Lesson #3 – Learn from others in your field – they know more than you and can help you out.

**Ask, ask, ask.**

How do you go from an idea to having actual t-shirts printed? We didn’t know, so we decided to ask someone. Specifically, we sought out an older acquaintance who already had some experience selling t-shirts, and bought him dinner in exchange for his thoughts. He not only shared his experiences (successes and missteps), he gave us the contact to his t-shirt printer!

Note: Please don’t be self-obsessed when you do this. What’s in it for them? How much time will you need? What exactly do you want to ask them about? What questions do you need answered? Show that you’ve done your research. And pay for the drinks or food.

**Be visible**

This would happen again and again in the history of our business: We’d be selling t-shirts at some flea market and have someone approach us offering to re-sell our products, or feature us in some publication. Some of these folks have gone on to become critical partners in our business – our best resellers and our current printers were all people we met in person while selling t-shirts at some event or another.

So ask people out to coffee. Talk to suppliers, vendors, event organizers – and get to know them personally, ask them for their opinions, be genuinely curious. They will have all sorts of interesting information for you. One of our resellers opened our eyes to the wonders of courier shipping, saving us a ton of trouble.

# Lesson #4 – Start exchanging product for cash as quickly as you can

**We literally started out selling t-shirts directly through messages on a Facebook page.** We didn’t have nice pictures or a “Shop” segment when we were starting out, but still managed to sell hundreds of t-shirts.

We would get messages from people on Facebook and we would track their orders in a Google Sheet. It took us a while to figure out the concept of an SKU – we just used different rows and columns for different sizes!

This worked fine when we were selling a few t-shirts a week, and it was possible to respond to everybody on Facebook. But once we started getting dozens of t-shirts a week, we realized it wasn’t going to be sustainable, and so we set up a “proper” ecommerce store on Storenvy.

Getting cash from your first sale is a huge rush, and the sooner you get it the better – because it’ll compel you to do more. The longer you defer this, the likelier you are to get bogged down with details.

# Lesson #5 – Focus on a niche

I never set out to be a “Singaporean” brand – I just wanted to make t-shirts that I liked. But it just so happened that some of the t-shirts I wanted had a local flavor to them, and those were the t-shirts that resonated resoundingly with people.

So we followed the money and doubled down on that, making more and more t-shirts in the style that our customers wanted (while continuing to establish our overall brand),

The litmus test is this: **what can I say to one person about my t-shirts that would get them excited enough to tell somebody else about it?**

# Lesson #6 – Celebrate your customers and they’ll adore you for it

This came very naturally to us – we were very excited to see that people liked our t-shirts enough to post pictures of themselves wearing them, so we were eager to share and celebrate that success with the rest of our page, as well as on Instagram.

We started getting a lot of word-of-mouth. People would literally ask their friends on Facebook “Hey, where’d you get that shirt?”, and the wearer would tag us in the comments, and we’d get an order (or five) from the friend.

# Lesson #7 – Prioritize a few essential things

You DON’T need to do EVERYTHING. There are a lot of extensive guides available online with a massive list of all the possible things that you could do. But it’s entirely possible to make several thousand bucks with just Facebook messages and a Google spreadsheet.

You don’t need to be on all the channels – it’s much better to focus on one or two channels and really build great relationships with customers there, than to try and be everywhere all at once.

One thing we did always prioritize was giving our customers the best experience we could. In the early days, we’d  often go out of our way to help people with replacements and urgent deliveries if possible. We couldn’t sustainably scale that, but it definitely made an impression on our earliest customers and got us a lot of positive word-of-mouth.

# Lesson #8 – Value your time, pay for useful services.

We also setup a proper ecommerce store to save us the trouble of having to manually enter sales data – we started out on StoreEnvy because it’s free, and then moved to Shopify because we wanted more features and functionality.

With the benefit of hindsight, we’d have gotten onto Shopify earlier – we were uncertain and broke so we were very skeptical of spending any sort of money, but the time and energy it would’ve saved us would’ve been worth the cost. Having all the customer data managed for you in an accessible way ALONE is more than worth the cost. Having “proper” business expenses also has a psychological effect of making it “serious”.

Things we’re glad we paid for, and wish we paid for sooner: Shopify, WaveApps, Receiptful.

# Lesson #9 – Delegate! Figure out tasks that other people can do for you, and compensate them for it.

When we started getting more orders than we could handle, we ended up hiring interns to help us out. We felt awkward at first – are we employers? Do we know how to manage other people? We basically copied what the best practices were at work – we used a Trello board to keep track of all the tasks we wanted to do, and we had fortnightly 1-1s with our interns.

Different interns brought different things to the table. One helped us do photoshoots with their friends as models. Another helped to codify our processes and customer service protocol into Google docs.

# Lesson #10 – Write down your partnership agreement, and manage all your bills and paperwork properly, and do weekly or monthly reviews.

**Seriously, write down all your shit**

This is something we DIDN’T do, and regret. Just because you’re running a side-business doesn’t mean you can be totally lazy about it. We each put in a couple of hundred dollars to pay for the first round of t-shirts, and thought it would probably make us a couple of thousand bucks – negligible amounts we could write off. So we didn’t bother much with keeping track of the paperwork. But it’s grown to over $100,000, and figuring out all the accounting inconsistencies was a nightmare. We've actually lost several thousands this way (paying for things we didn't need and so on). Painful lesson learned! 

**Have good meetings regularly**

We also didn’t meet as often as we should’ve, which meant that our business grew more slowly than we’d have liked. Having regular meetings also helps you get re-aligned on multiple things – why does your company exist? How are you making progress towards your goals? Asking these questions is a great way to stay focused and motivated. You don’t need to have meetings that go on for hours – a quick 20 minutes catchup with your co-founder can make all the difference.

# Questions I got from friends on Facebook:

## When should you set up a formal business entity?

You don’t need to set this up from day 1 – that’s just a tedious distraction from the most important thing, which is making sure that people want to give you money for whatever you’re making. 

My recommendation is that you start thinking about it once you’ve made about a thousand dollars. In our case, we didn’t bother until we needed a company bank account to receive payment from some particular vendor.

## Should you use accounting software, apps, etc?

Yes! It took us way too long to bother with this because we were trying to keep our costs low, but this is a bad place to try to cut costs. 

Keeping rigorous track of your invoices is crucial – it gives you peace of mind, it helps you understand your business better, etc.

## How do you run meetings?

There’s a lot of meeting hate in the world, but it’s really bad meetings that are bad. Effective meetings can be short, snappy, energizing and even exciting. We resolve things together and we have new ‘next actions’ to drive the business forward.

## How do you move forward when you don’t know what you’re doing?

Seriously – just try something. Ideally you'd have a list of ideas, and a framework for prioritizing those, but if you're feeling stuck, just go with whatever you feel like doing! **Do what you're curious about and excited by, it's a critical part of staying motivated.** 

We never really bothered doing any serious marketing – we took a lot of pride in spending as little time and energy as possible on the project. But looking back, we could’ve done more even with the little time that we spent, by being a little more focused. 

Now we have to figure out what the next wave of products will be – which is a fascinating intellectual challenge – but we could’ve extracted more value, which would’ve given us more $$ – which we can then deploy towards interesting projects of our choosing.

## What did you learn from your customers?

**IRL:**

When we were selling t-shirts at flea markets, we initially tried to persuade people to buy t-shirts for themselves. Those people rarely needed much persuading – they either immediately noticed something they wanted, or they’d just scan everything idly and move on. We noticed, however, that quite a few groups of friends would point at some t-shirt or other and say, “Haha, that’s so John!”, or “This is totally Sally!”

We realized that people liked buying gifts for friends, and so we changed our pitch from “See anything you like?” to “Do any of these remind you of our friends?” We started converting people much better, and this influenced how we sell.

**Online:**

We'd often get emails saying things like, ""Can I get this within this week? It's for my brother's birthday party on Saturday"", or ""It's to wear to my class reunion on X date"" – which gave us a much better sense of the ""Jobs-to-be-done"" aspect. 

## Any questions? Happy to answer!

814,4skt0t,False,,127,How long does it take to create an overnight success? For John Hanke it’s taken him 20 years to create Pokémon Go.,Entrepreneur," This week, the Pokémon Go app has broken all records, with 10 million+ downloads in the first week, exceeding Twitter in daily active users, and with higher average user time than Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram & WhatsApp.

How did John Hanke create such a massive overnight craze? Here’s the 10 times he levelled up in his lifetime to reach Pokémon Go:

1st Level up: In 1996, while still a student, John co-created the very first MMO (massively multiplayer online game) called ‘Meridian 59’. He sold the game to 3DO to move on to a bigger passion: mapping the world.

2nd Level up: In 2000, John launched ‘Keyhole’ to come up with a way to link maps with aerial photography, and create the first online, GPS-linked 3D aerial map of the world.

3rd Level up: In 2004, Google bought Keyhole and with John’s help, turned Keyhole into what is now ‘Google Earth’. That’s when John decided to focus at creating GPS-based games.

4th Level up: John ran the Google Geo team from 2004 to 2010, creating Google Maps and Google Street View. During this time, he collected the team that would later create Pokémon Go.

5th Level up: In 2010, John launched Niantic Labs as a start-up funded by Google to create a game layer on maps. John explains why he called it Niantic:

“The Niantic is the name of a whaling ship that came up during the gold rush and through a variety of circumstances got dragged on shore. This happened with other ships, too. Over the years, San Francisco was basically just built over these ships. You could stand on top of them now, and you wouldn't know it. So it's this idea that there's stuff about the world that's really cool but even though it's on the Internet, it's hard to know when you're actually there.”

6th Level up: In 2012, John then created Niantic’s first geo-based MMO, “ingress”:

John explains: “In the case of Ingress the activity is layered on top of the real world and on your phone. The inspiration was that it was something that I always used to daydream about while I was commuting back and forth from home to Google.""

""I always thought you could make an awesome game using all the Geo data that we have. I watched phones become more and more powerful and I thought the time would come that you could do a really awesome real-world adventure-based game.”

7th Level up: In 2014, Google and the Pokémon Company teamed up for an April Fools’ Day joke, which allowed viewers to find Pokémon creatures on Google maps. It was a viral hit, and got John thinking the idea could be turned into a real game.

8th Level up: John decided to build Pokémon Go on the user-generated meeting points created by players of Ingress, and the most popular became the Pokéstops and gyms in Pokémon Go:

As John says, ”The Pokéstops are submitted by users, so obviously they're based on places people go. We had essentially two and a half years of people going to all the places where they thought they should be able to play Ingress, so it's some pretty remote places. There are portals in Antartica and the North Pole, and most points in between.”

9th Level up: John raised $25 million from Google, Nintendo, the Pokémon Company and other investors from Dec 2015 to Feb 2016 to grow a team of 40+ to launch Pokémon Go this year.

10th Level: John and his team launched Pokémon Go on July 6th in USA, Australia and New Zealand. Since its launch, Nintendo’s share price has risen $7.5 billion, and the app is already generating over $2 million daily in in-app purchases, making it an overnight phenomenon.

The overnight success of Pokémon Go has taken John Hanke 20 years to create. Throughout these 20 years, while he had a big vision of a game layer over the world, he didn’t know what form it would take. At every step, he just focused at his next level up.

At each new level, he had new powers, new team members, and new items in his inventory…

Are you, like John, treating your own entrepreneurial journey like one big MMO?

Keep the end in mind, but focus today on simply levelling up.

At every level, grow your powers, your team, and your luck.

And know it takes many levels to win the game.

840,345onz,False,,244,The Cannabis industry: It's the smallest it ever will be.,Entrepreneur,"""It's the smallest it will ever be.""  A statement that I'm just now comprehending about the cannabis industry.  Last night I attended a [Boulder Cannabis Industry](http://www.meetup.com/Boulder-Cannabis-Industry-Meetup/) meet up at a place called [Canopy Boulder](http://www.canopyboulder.com).  The first of its kind, Canopy Boulder is a startup incubator specifically for the cannabis industry.  A few weeks into their first round, they have 10 startups working diligently to change the landscape of the cannabis industry.  We live in exciting times.

A whole room of people dedicated to education and utilization of cannabis.  I'm unsure if there were 100 people there, but if not that many we were quite close to filling the room.  The first takeaway for me was the sheer amount of people in suits.  Respectable business men and women, startup founders and cofounders, and many local business owners.  Not a single person in the room would have fit the stereotyped public perception of ""the stoner"".

From HR services, to online sales catered to a more premium market, and even [bed and breakfasts](https://budandbreakfast.com/) catered to cannabis users, the startups and businesses in the room represented a wide array of opportunities in this **budding** industry.  If ever there were doubts about the future of the cannabis industry, Canopy Boulder is a shining seed of the future.  The industry really never will be this small again.

I encourage you to check out Canopy Boulder's site, and more importantly their current [list of startups](http://www.canopyboulder.com/about/portfolio/).  Also if you are in the industry or plan to be, they are currently accepting application for their fall 2015 session.  The benefits include $20,000 in seed funding, 13 weeks of an extensive ""business bootcamp"", access to 100+ mentors, and exposure to at least 1000 investors.  Not a bad deal for a budding industry!

The entire paradigm of the world of cannabis is shifting.  We are heading towards a future where it isn't risque to partake in cannabis.  A future where businessmen and college kids alike may freely utilize the benefits of one of mother nature's greatest gifts.  No longer do we need to don tie dye and dreadlocks in order to be a part of the cannabis world.  Together we can educate the world and help millions of people lead healthier happier lives.

Tie dye and dreads are still cool though!

*Full disclosure, I have a blog called [Reefer Fitness](http://www.reeferfitness.com/) dedicated to living an optimum lifestyle utilizing weed.  Probably too many self-help posts atm.  This is an entire article.*

**I am very curious to hear from /r/Entrepreneur  about your cannabis related start up, ideas you've had, or just your opinions about the industry.**

****EDIT: Wow, this took off.  A lot of great comments from business owners, industry people, and those curious. We could almost have a cannabis industry AMA post soon.****

*****EDIT:  http://i.imgur.com/Pz3uF4T.png I'm sorry but it had to be done.*****",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/345onz/the_cannabis_industry_its_the_smallest_it_ever/,433,"Sounds like pot smokers amping up other pot smokers. 

Results from states are coming in and they're not dramatic or impressive.  It's hard to get people out of underground economy, and people don't want to pay high taxes to do so.  (Similar to how people smuggle and buy untaxed cigarettes, except that the whole system already exists for pot.)  

I do think wide spread legalization is coming, but what that actually means is unclear to me.  The double tax situation sucks right now and it will suck for the foreseeable future.  

I've seen what happened to cigarettes.  A popular legal mega industry was not only pushed out, but lost its appeal.  Why is pot any different?  Smoking up joints instead of cigarettes... is that supposed to be cooler or feel better?  Ehhh...  

Are the opportunities?  Hell yeah.  But there are opportunities in a lot of thing and you don't have you touch substances of questionable legality and tax situation.  The amount of opportunity in Pot is most definitely offset by the amount of uncertainty.  

I also suspect it's like the photography business.  Every kid with a camera wants to be in the photography business.  There is demand, but not that much demand to absorb all these wannabes.  There's a ton of pot smokers who probably have the same dreams, not realizing that the demand isn't going to support them all.   ",2015-04-28 14:36:33

**If you are an eCommerce owner, you probably know how big of a buzz is about Facebook ads.**

-

-
I was annoyed by this fact when I started working with eCommerce clients so here I’m writing everything I learned from my eCommerce campaigns.

High-level strategy
======


**Why are FB ads good channel for eComm businesses?**

-
When you are looking for a marketing channel for your eCommerce business you usually look for three things:

-
1. Is your market on that platform?
1. How much can you scale?
1. What’s the initial investment to enter the channel?

-

Despite Facebook becoming overcrowded, it’s still a great channel for eComm businesses because it fits all three criteria. 

-
You can start advertising with very low budgets and get the initial results really fast (IE generating sales).
And at the same time, you can massively scale this channel to 6-7 figures a month in revenue.

-
To get more tactical, let's cover the basic high-level framework of FB ads for eComm businesses.

-
**Frameworks**

There are many different frameworks and goals you can set for your campaigns but here are the three most common:

-

*Day 0 - ROI positive*

This is usually the case when FB ads are the main channel for acquiring new customers. If this is the case, you need FB ads to make you profit. 

This is simple math, taught by most of the experts, etc.
If you have $50 NET profit margin on your product, your goal is to have CAC of $25. This means that for every $1 spent on ads you make $1 profits.

-
*Day 0 - Breakeven*

This scenario is used when a company wants to use Facebook as a channel to grow their customer base. In this scenario Facebook ads are self-funding, meaning that you don’t need outside capital to expand your customer base. It allows you acquire massive amounts of customers and be open to the potential upside if you have some operational efficiencies coming up that will reduce your COGS.

-

Coming back to the 1st scenario: if you have $50 NET profit margin on your product, your goal is to have CAC of $50. This means that for every sale you make you are on break-even. (NOTE that your ROAS will be higher than one as you need to include COGS into the equation)

-

*Day 30 - Breakeven*

This is the most aggressive scenario that some companies use for massive growth. You will need to have very developed systems and analytics to make this work, as well as significant access to capital to fund for this money lost period. 

In this scenario, you are relying on your LTV calculations and average customer profit after 30 days.

-
So if you have $50 NET profit margin on the first sale, and you know that after 30 days you AVERAGE customer makes you $100 in profits, you aim for CPA of $100 that will make you break-even on day 30.
(NOTE that this is more common for SAAS companies as they have more predictive 30-day revenue projections than eComms, but having substantial loyalty and referral campaigns can make this strategy work)  
 
-
**Social network aspect**

-
Facebook is a social network. And if you are to advertise on it, you need to accept this as a fact and put that into consideration.

-
You don’t need to game the algorithm; you need to feed it with what it wants.
 
-
People are on Facebook for two reasons:

* To engage with content they are interested in
* To connect with people they like

-
So when you are promoting your product, there has to be something unique about it. It needs to build a narrative and tell a story. You can’t sell commodities on Facebook as opposed to Google. 

-
If you have a new and unique product - your ads can be pretty straightforward, but the emphasis is that at least SOMETHING has to be unique. 

-
For example: 

* Product
* Brand
* Cause 
* Personality 
* Humor
* Story 

-

**Product**

-
Before we even begin to go into details about ads itself we need to address the element of the product. 

-
Your advertising success is 50% the quality of your product!

-
Regardless of what anyone is telling you, the product is BY FAR the most important part of your advertising. By quality I mean: is there mass appeal and desire for the product that you are selling?

-
If people don’t want the product, don’t have the need for the product, you WILL fail. Period. 

-
If the product is excellent, it does the marketing itself. You really won’t have a hard time creating promos around the product that people are eager for and spending money to get it.

-
If you don’t have access to unique products (dropshipping or reselling other people’s products), you need to create unique marketing that will be appealing to your market. Meaning, they need a story or some different kind of value provided as for why they should buy the product.

-
Now let’s get into the weeds!
&nbsp;

Types of traffic
====
-
**How they differ and how to approach each.**

-
When it comes to types of traffic, on Facebook, you can literally do anything from upsells, cross-sells, loyalty, retention, referral campaigns, etc. But here I’m just going to talk about acquiring new customers.

-
When it comes to acquisition, there are two main types of traffic

* Retargeting (IE Warm traffic)
* Prospecting (IE Cold traffic) 

---
##**Retargeting**

-
**Setting expectations**

-
Retargeting existing website traffic or email list that you have is usually the best way to start advertising your store. 

-
Retargeting can be very powerful for stores that are driving other sources of traffic (content marketing, affiliate, influencer traffic, SEM) as you will have a lot of people that didn’t convert on their initial visits and you can follow up with them on Facebook. 

-
Your expectations need to be higher for this type of traffic as these people are on a higher level of awareness (Will discuss later in detail). So your goal with RTG traffic should always to be profitable for two reasons:

1. The scale is going to be limited by the amount of traffic you have
1. These people showed interest, which means they are much more likely to buy

-

**How to segment it**

-
####Dynamic: 

The reason this is called dynamic is that people get shown specific ads based on their behavior on the site. 

-
Using Dynamic Product Ads (DPAs) is the effective and simple solution for people who have a lot of products in the store. 

-
Usually retargeting people who have visited specific product pages in last seven days OR who have added to cart is the most effective. 

-
DPAs are arguably the only campaign that you can set-and-forget on Facebook as you don’t have much room to optimize (other than the text copy) 

-
####Static:

-
There are a lot of options, variations, and segmentation  you can do here so here are a few rules of thumb that I use to make decisions:

-
*Potential upside* - 
if you have some segment of your site that is generating a lot of traffic and attention, it’s worth to try segmenting this section (example: your blog is generating 10,000 organic visitors a month - you will want to figure out a way to monetize that interest)

-
*Low hanging fruit* - when you look at the behavior of the customers, can you identify someone that is more likely to buy than others? (example: people who have initiated checkout in last 1-7 days)

-
*Results of initial test* - as we said earlier, the scale will always be limited. So you want to get the results from these campaigns ASAP. Meaning, if the initial campaign for the specific segment isn’t producing good results right off the bat, it might be a good idea to backlog this segment - you only have limited time resources, and you don’t want to waste it on some part that will have little impact on your campaigns. 

-


**When there is too much segmentation**

-
Two rules apply here to identify when you have segmented too much:

* Budget allocation and results
* Time allocation

-
If you are spending a small percentage of the budget on RTG, that is NOT producing the results you want; you might be overcomplicating and not cutting unnecessary segmentations. 

-
Time allocation is the second rule: if you spend a disproportionate amount of time compared to the budget you are spending, you need to simplify.

-
**Creative aspect**

-
Ad creatives will usually be much different for RTG traffic. Your primary job will be to show the product in action, customer reviews, address any sales objections your customers might have. 

-
Your ads and creatives will have much more engagement and better Click-through rates because people are already familiar with your brand/store.

---
##**Prospecting**

-
**Expectations**

-
It’s challenging to set expectations for cold traffic because there are so many variables you need to take into consideration. Even looking at your competitor and seeing what they are doing might not give you a good picture of what you can do. 

-
That’s why you need to set the system in which you will benefit from the volatility. (the concept of [convex tinkering](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility) introduced by Nassim Taleb)

-
Meaning, knowledge is a poor substitute for trial and error process.

-

This practically applies like this: You need to create a very large amount of small tests (bets) based on your assumptions and expose yourself to the potential benefit of big upside.

-


**Mind-shift from RTG traffic**

-
The important thing is to realize that Cold traffic reacts and acts much much more differently than RTG traffic. 

-
You are trying to get people to buy from you in their first interaction with your brand. 

-
So you need to think about what kind of emotional and psychological processes are happening in their head and how to channel those to your product.

-
Cold traffic is much more about tapping into the consumer psychology and really understanding your market through trial and error process.

-
**Audience aspect**

-
Audience aspect is a massive part of cold traffic. 

-
Your products might be appealing to a type of people that might be counterintuitive for you in the first place. 

-
So your convex tinkering model will help you to tap into these parts of the market.

-

**Creative aspect**

-
Creatives that have worked for RTG will usually not work for cold traffic. 

-
Your ads need to do a vast majority of the selling before prospects even land on your page. 

-
**Media Buying**

-
With RTG, you will not have that much of issues with adequately structuring your campaigns to ensure that you get the best traffic available. But with cold, quality of traffic can vastly influence your results - therefore you will need to pay much more attention to it. 


-
I’ll write about this in more detail in a specific section.

On-site optimization
====

AKA Websites

-
Your landing pages need to have few key conversion points. Your funnel is not that crucial part of the equation as people will often buy even if you didn’t do a great job designing your store.

-
There are few key components that your site needs to:

-
* Trustworthy (guarantee badges, secure badges, SSL, etc)
* State the benefits and features of the product
* Be clear (price, product, shipping)
* Have reviews 

-
**Number of steps before they make a purchase**

-
This is essential conversion factor. The fewer actions your customers need to make, the higher conversion rates you will have. 

-
For example:

Product page → Cart → Checkout → Purchase

VS

Product page → Checkout → Purchase

-
The less room for drop off, the better conversions. It’s vital when it comes to paid traffic as you are paying to get that visitor, so you need to have a clear and straightforward way of monetizing this traffic. 

-
Let’s get into details about landing pages. There are three types of pages that we found are doing great.

-
##**Product pages**

-
Static old-fashioned product pages still work. There is nothing new here, and the standard applies. You need to have:

-
* Product name
* Product description
* Great images
* Reviews
* Mobile-friendly optimization

-
##**Traditional funnels** 

A landing page designed for FB ads

-
Here we go a little bit deeper to extract more conversions. Usually, those are landing pages with much more content and different options. 

-
The main feature of this type of landing page it that you can customize pricing, bundle products and create special offers as you wish. It gives you better control over conversion rate and AOV. If you can sell products in bundles, you can test which bundle works the best, which offers work the best, etc. 

-
Long form sales page

They rely on content, here you have the chance to really introduce customers to your products and your company, which will inevitably help you with conversions if you can put in the personal touch. 

-
VSL

You can also have a VSL type of sales page. But this requires better video production abilities, and it usually doesn’t improve conversions that much (as you’ll see, the video is best used right in the ad).

-
Special offers

The obvious example here is Free + Shipping offers. You want to create an F+S offer on a separate landing page, so when your prospects visit your site, they will see that the product offered with Facebook ads is only free if you land on that specific page - which will increase trustworthiness and conversions.

-
##**New types of funnels**

-
Now, good old product pages work well, but you need to have a unique product to do REALLY well. 

-
Traditional funnels work even better.

-
But the newest trend and the best funnels are new hybrid funnels. They have this content aspect that significantly helps conversions. 

-
There are a couple of versions:

-

* Listicle

Buzzfeed style article with 5-10 bullet points. People love this kind of content, and you will get much cheaper traffic. You can also optimize the content in a way that will address all the objections your customers might have and make the purchase much earlier than you expected. 

* Quiz funnels

Create a quiz where they will answer a couple of questions and end up on the sales page.

* Build a box

Fun funnel if you have options to bundle your products. This requires more tech support, but it can be great.

-
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This covers the introductory section and foundations to running any successful Facebook advertising campaign. 
Now we’ll move into the section about FB ads itself.
-

I like to split FB ads into two sections that are equally important to success. This split is made to make sure that I always know what I need to improve on and how to achieve my goals. 

-

It’s split on:

* Ad creative
* Media buying

-
##**Ad Creatives**
====


Ad creatives are essentially ads that you are running on Facebook. 

-
Ad creatives will have a direct impact on the price of your advertising by CTR (click-through-rate) and Conversion rates.

-
So your ads job is to sell the click - to get the traffic to your store - BUT at the same time, it needs to prequalify and sell your audience even before they land on your page. 

-
It’s split into two segments: 

* Visual
* Ad copy

---

##**Visuals:**

-
**Videos**

Since the introduction of video in FB ads, this has been a game-changing feature that businesses needed to use. They are particularly effective for physical products as you get a chance to show what your product does in a clear demonstration of the features and benefits. 

-
Here are the types of the video ads:

-
* Short videos (snippets) - 0-30 seconds
* Traditional style ad - 0:30-2:00
* Long videos (edutainment) - 2:00 - 6:00

-
General content guidelines:

* Keep it short as possible for FB
* Think like silent film artist (85% of video views happen in MUTE)
* Incorporate design to make your videos look like high-quality production (example - slow-motion)
* Create educational and inspirational videos

-

FB video ads have three distinct parts:

-
**First 10 seconds of the video:**

This is the most important variable of the video, and something would be good to split test and figure out how to attract the attention. 

-
**The Meat:** After 1st part, your video needs to:

* Educate
* Entertain 
* Demonstrate 

-
You can pick and choose one of the variants that suit your brand; it’s not necessary to use all 3.

-
**CTA:** A good Facebook video ads CTA is fluid, natural, and a logical next step to the viewer.

-
There are 2 ways you can transition to selling:

1. Hard CTA (buy the product) 
1. Soft CTA (Learn more, take a sample, etc.)

-
Here are some content ideas from the videos that have been performing well lately:

-

* Product demonstration 
* Celebrity endorsement and testimonial 
* Customer testimonial 
* Unboxing of the product 
* Animated demonstration of the product and benefits
* Interview a person who helps make the product
* Show how the product gets made
* Do a how-to video featuring products

-

If your product has a very appealing use and it’s entertaining and beneficial to users, by all means, invest in creating video content specific for FB ads, you will reap massive ROI from having those videos. 

---
##**Images**

-
Go for metaphor instead of logic. People are more naturally inclined to paint the picture themselves, so it creates much more powerful impact

-
Ex. If you are selling some kind of supplement, use milk and cookies as a metaphor (milk supplements cookies)

-
**How to think** when choosing images:


* If Facebook didn't allow me to use text, what would I use to illustrate the solution?
* Tell a story and stand out
* Think about the end goal, not so much the process

-
Ex. Coca-cola does an excellent job of building emotions that they connect to the product.

-
**Product images in ads**

If the product is self-explanatory and visually appealing (but don't fall into the trap “if I think it's explanatory, the audience will too), you can use simple product images to treat extent. No need for any fancy design or anything. This actually works very well lately.


-
If it's not 100% clear what your product is or does - it's it's best to use the images of the product in action that demonstrates what it does and how.


-
**Types of images:**

-
There are three types of images that are working really well:

-
* Professional images
* UGC - Any images created by the customers themselves are the perfect asset
* The amateur images on purpose - when you use your phone to take images of the product. It works really well if it matches your brand and suits your audience. 

---
##**Copywriting**

-
Copywriting is as old as advertising. And the same rules apply as they did in the early 1900s.

-
Here are some important pointers:

-
**Battle for perception**

-
Advertising and marketing is battle for position in your prospects mind.
Remember that there is no reality, only perception. And if you can win that perception battle among tons of other contents pieces on Facebook, you will win.

-
You need to find a unique position where there is fertile ground for the idea you are trying to plant. People need to be ready to accept the ideas you want to share about how your products will fit into their daily schedule. 

-
It’s straightforward to see if you got this right - your CTR and conversion rates will be much higher.

-
**Market awareness**

-
This is from the book Breakthrough advertising, and it's it's very relevant for eCommerce advertising.

-
It stands for the level of awareness your audience has about the solution and the “problem” your product is solving.

-
It’s divided into five stages:

-
1. Your solution aware
1. Solution aware
1. Desire aware
1. Problem aware
1. Unaware

-
You need to know exactly what segment of the market you are trying to address. For cold traffic and bigger scale, you will need to talk to third to the fifth level of awareness as that’s much larger segment than 1st two. 

-
**Conversational Tone**

-
You ALWAYS want to have a conversational tone in your advertising. Especially on Facebook; you need to have developed a brand voice, something people can relate to.

-
You can use humor as well, be witty, engage in conversations, as there are many brands out there that are actively doing this and it creates certain expectations from customers (this is excluded in luxury items as you need to keep this high-class perception)

-

**Types of copy**

-
Here are most commonly used types of copy:

-
*Short copy* - 2-3 short sentences with clear product descriptions, benefits, and features.

-
*Just stating USP* - if you have a really unique product that didn’t even exist before (Introducing: AAA battery that has 500 active hours lifespan)

-
*Long copy* - here you have more opportunity to tell a story about your brand, your customers and talk about the benefits of the product in more detail.

-
*Claims backed with proof* - (The best Chocolate cookies in Midwest - approved by 500,000 customers) 

-
**Angles**

-
Angles are ways that you will try to enter perception of your market. Usually, you will need to create associations with what is already in the mind of your customer if your product is entirely new.

-
**Discounts and offers**

-
If you are offering big discounts, you need to have a damn good reason why. It works well, but without reason, it's just plain sketchy.

-
Creating discounts can be a very effective way to attract new customers. You state the benefits, the features of the product and invite them to try the product as you are offering xx% discount for first-time customers as you know they will love the product.

-
**Special offers** - 

-
An incentive why they should act NOW - very important as you are paying for that visitor.
This area is very borderline all the time. You need to give your customers an incentive to act now (scarcity is usually the best), but you can’t deceive your customers. 

-
Sometimes maybe you are low on stock, or you are running a limited promotion with a fixed expiry date.

-
The best would be if you could point out the fact that they should’ve started using your product yesterday - if not yesterday, the second best option is today. 

---
**Creative testing process**

-
As the quality of your creatives is vital to your FB success, you need a very efficient way to test creatives.


-
Here's the process I use to find winning ads quickly:

* Establish benchmark (CPC target that you want to lower)
* Create 5 ad sets with 5 different audiences (LAL or Interests)
* Run with $10-day budget 
* IF CPC is below the benchmark for ANY given ad set - keep running 2 more days to get enough sample size for Purchases
* After 3 days, winning ad set should get a sale (depending on your CPA + improvement on CPC
* Test 2 creatives at the time (every 3 days - Monday / Thursday)
* One should be similar to baseline ad (the one that is currently your best-performing ad at the moment) - one or 2 variables different
* One should be vastly different - all variables different


What is considered as a successful test?

-

* Improvement on CPC benchmark on at least 3 audiences
* ROAS positive ad

-
Remember - your goal is to get lower CPC - When you do get a new ad, use it in the rotation in your other ad sets where you can see that CPC is getting higher. 

---
---


Media buying
====
**Audiences AKA targeting**. 

-
This is how you will target buyers.
You will spend most of your time on Facebook just managing the audiences. Trying out new ones, killing bad performing ones, finding new interests, etc. This is the reality, and there’s no other way around it.

-
There are no specific rules what will work or what not. Here are only couple of pointers that could lead you right way:

-

* Lookalike - aim for at least 1000 people in seed audience
* Start narrow and go broad - whenever you are starting a new campaign or new product - go with an audience that is most likely to buy (usually narrow audience). This works in 80% of the time
* Bundle interests and Lookalikes - Sometimes bundling interests into one ad set gets you better results if you split them into separate ad sets. (Reason this is is that Facebook likes larger audiences with a bigger pool of people to choose from)

-
*Audience saturation*

-
Note that you will soon get to audience saturation phase depending on your budget (especially if you are running small audiences (10,000-500,000 are relatively small audiences)

-
When your audience starts to saturate, you will first notice a drop in CPA, and then you will begin to see frequency points increase. The solution for this is either rotating ads within the same audience or just changing up the audience and moving on. 

---

##**Being clear about the numbers**

-
This is a vital part of Facebook ads. You **NEED** to know your numbers. 
There are three most important numbers that you need to have in mind all the time:

-
CAC - Customer acquisition cost

AOV - Average order value

COGS - Cost of goods sold

-
So you need to know:

1. How much you are paying to acquire one customer
2. How much does that customer spend per average order
3. How much profit margin do you have per one sale

-
*I was stunned when I realized how much people don’t know their numbers.*

-
When you know your basics, you need to know some other numbers that will tell you how your campaigns are performing and how to improve them.

-
When you look from a higher level, there are two types of metrics:

* KPIs
* Input metrics

-
*KPIs*

In any simple eCommerce campaign, there will be only 2 KPIs

* CAC - cost to acquire a customer
* CPC - cost per click

-
These are essentially two metrics that are determining how well is your campaign performing at any given time. You need to know how much are you paying for a customer and how much you are paying for the click.

-
*Input metrics*

-
Input metrics are metrics that create those KPIs

They are for CPC

* CPM - Cost per 1000 impressions (what you pay to Facebook)
* CTR - Click-through rate. What’s the percentage of people clicking on your ad? 

-
You have much more control over CTR as the quality of your ad determines this. You can only change CPMs by switching your audiences.

-
For CAC they are:

* CPC - Cost per click
* CR - The conversion rate of your website.

-
The way you can change your conversion rate is by doing CRO experiments which I won’t talk about here. OR by changing the audiences - some audiences will be more inclined to buy so you will have a better conversion rate. 

-
*Advanced metrics:*
-
***You can skip this part if you are not already spending a decent amount on FB***

-
Blended CAC

Blended CAC is what you need to calculate when you have a multi-touchpoint campaign. 
You need to get into consideration all the numbers and money that you are spending to acquire one customer.

Meaning that the end campaign is just one part of the equation, you need to add in the costs of the first touch.

-

If you are doing this multi-touch approach, you probably noticed that your economics are a little bit harder as you will need really good frontend and backend numbers to make this work. To get that numbers you need to have a really awesome content piece that is:

1. Attractive to a cold audience - it needs to be attractive to get you cheap video views/clicks/engagement for economics to work
1. Warming up the audience - The people who have viewed this type of content need to convert much better than any cold or warm audiences to have the economics work

-
As I said, this is the difficult approach, but it’s worth it when you are scaling to 6-figures a month in ad spend. 

---
##**Placements**

-
Facebook offers you a variety of placements, and it can be difficult to choose from. Here are the rules we use for placements

-
*Start broad and narrow down*

Start with automatic placements. It will give Facebook room to put your ads to audiences all over their network and give you initial data what’s right for you and what not. 
Usually, I see that automatic placements work much better than narrow ones lately

-
*Narrow down if you see a pattern*

If you notice that one placement is outperforming everything, or that one placement is just not giving you anything, focus on using or killing that placement.

-
*Blended conversions*

-
Facebook uses different placements to show your ads to people and increase conversions. So in a way, you can have assisted conversions with different placements. Facebook might show your ad to your audience on Audience network placement where it’s much cheaper, and then show them the same ad on the Facebook news feed. This way the ad will look familiar, and people are more likely to purchase if something is familiar to them.

-
**Keep this in mind when choosing placements.** 

-
*Preferred placements -* 

-
Facebook always has one placement that it prefers. When they roll out new placement for the ad, they will usually give you lower CPMs to get advertisers to hop on this placement.

-
At the moment of writing this, Instagram stories are still an underpriced asset and if you have creatives suitable for this placement, by all means, use it. 

-
New placement they introduced is Marketplace ads. Didn’t use it yet, but I suspect that it will be beneficial for local businesses and stores to utilize that placement early on.

---
##**Bidding** 

-
Old manual bidding is gone. But there are still some rules you can apply to get the best out for your money. 

-
You need to remember that Facebook as a platform still works as an auction process. This means that you are competing with other advertisers, and some markets might be more saturated than others.

-
There are two types of bid available as of writing this:

-
* Lowest cost bid - Facebook will try to get you as many conversions as possible for the money you spend daily
* Target cost bid - Facebook will make sure that throughout the conversion window you are getting a conversion at desired cost. 

The main difference is: 

* With Lowest bid cost Facebook will spend all of your daily budgets regardless of conversions
* With Target bid cost Facebook will only spend money if they can get you conversions for the desired price. 

-
This is the general rule, and it’s not applicable all the times, and in all situations.


-
##**Number of ads in an ad set**

-
Couple of rules of thumb - as you increase the budget on the ad set, you will want to have more working ads.

-
What seems to be the sweet spot is having four ads in one ad set. This by no means you need to have four ads and stick to this rule religiously. Sometimes for one ad set, you’ll only have one ad that is working well, sometimes you’ll have all four working well.

-
The general rule is that you will go over 4 in very rare cases - when you scale the budget very high or have a high frequency on a particular audience. 

-
Usually, it’s not the best to have 1 ad per ad set, as you are dependent on the performance of that one ad.

-
##**Decision-making framework**

-
You need to have a system that is easy enough for a noob to use. This will be based on the numbers that you can produce and your goals.

-
It goes like this: 

-
1. Determine and define your main metrics and proxy metrics
1. Determine how much are you willing to spend for exploration
1. Create custom preset in ads manager that will give you only the desired data
1. Set rules for certain situations
1. Automate rules using FB rule tool or 3rd party tool

---
##**Optimization**

-
Optimization of your campaigns is nothing more than identifying what numbers can you improve on, what are growth potentials, and what ads to kill (cutting the fat).

-
*What can you improve?*

So when you know What numbers you want, and you know what numbers can be improved upon → you allocate more time, resources in improving those numbers.


-
*What are the growth potentials?*

When you identify something as an obvious growth potential - like New retargeting audience segment (say blog) or a bunch of video views on one video → you allocate more time and resources in taking advantage of that opportunity.

-
*What ads to kill?*

And the biggest part of optimization is killing the bad performing ads and audiences. This is known as “cutting the fat,” and it’s essential to do. Your overall performance will be dragged down by bad performing audiences, so if you identify them early and kill them early once they haven’t spent much money, you will help yourself big time. 

-
I like to look at proxy metrics when deciding to kill ads as they will show you a better picture before KPIs. 


One of the metrics that I watch regularly is Cost per initiate checkout. Usually, my best performing ads will have great CPCheckout, and the ones that have slightly worse metrics, typically are bad performing ones. So when I notice that an ad set is performing slightly worse, or just plain bad on this metric, I will kill it. 

-
Looking at different time windows. Sometimes an ad set can seem to have a decent performance over lifetime period - but when you look at the seven-day window, and it’s not performing well, you need to cut this as this is another piece of fat that is reducing your overall efficiency of the ads. 

---
 
##**Scaling**

-
There is only one general rule for scaling - do what works for you. There are many strategies, but they don’t work all the time, for all the markets and all the messages.

-

###**Budget Scale**

-
Scale you campaigns by increasing budgets on your best-performing ad sets. There are a couple of ways to do it:

-
* Slowly increase the budget for the best-performing ad set (10%-15%) a day
* Ad set duplication


Duplicate winning ad set and slowly increase the budget

The best practice is to use another ad account

-
* Fast budget increase


Ex. Increase immediately from $20 - $100 

Leave for few days to optimize

-
* Immediate scale


When you know that you have a winning creative and audience

Put 3 ad sets with same targeting and copy and high budget ($500)

Leave the best performing, kill other ones

---
###**Audience scaling**

Sometimes increasing the budgets will mess up the performance of your ads. Meaning you will be back to square one. In this situation, you want to go horizontally and explore as many new audiences as possible to increase total budget spent. 

-
* Additional interests

Find additional interests similar to winning one's (Audience insights)

Use your buyer’s list in Audience insights to find more interests

-
* Lookalikes and additional lookalikes

Aim for at least 1000 buyers before creating

This is really the segment where you will find the most of new audiences

Get creative (highest value buyers, Cart abandonments, email list, multiple buyers, specific date range buyers, pixels, page visits etc.)

-
* Lookalike expansion

Go to 2% of the best performing 1% lookalikes

Up to 10%

-
* Pixel optimized audience

No targeting, just optimize with data from the pixel

Statewide, worldwide, regionwide

---
###**Optimization scale**

-
This is one of the advanced scales which is coming in the later stages. It works by either changing the objective of campaigns or changing the messaging of your ads to reach broader market:

-

* Change campaign objectives

Switch to clicks optimization

Go to Page post engagement (!)

Only with proven audiences, creatives, and funnels

-
* Messaging

Your message is only attractive to a certain part of the audience

Reach other parts of the audience with different messaging

---
###**Portfolio theory** Based on [Social Fulcrum](https://socialfulcrum.com/blog/tactics-sophisticated-marketers-portfolio-theory-audience-bidding/) 

-

Similar to investing portfolios. Instead of putting all of your budgets into one ad set - split it into segments:

-
* Different interests
* Age ranges
* Geography
* Messaging

-
This way you will have much more controlled CPA as you can reallocate the budget from bad performing audiences to the ones that are good. 

-
The main benefit of this strategy is less volatility if you need to be careful with your losses.

---
###**Automated rules scaling**

This one is a little bit technical. 

-
You want to take 10 (or any number of audiences you have working) of your best-converting audiences. Spread them into ten different ad sets. Set a very high budget (anything that you are comfortable with). 

-
**Set up automated rules to kill ad sets that didn’t have purchase within your KPIs** (you can be more aggressive here if you want to play it safe. Run the audiences for the day


-
This way, you will only have audiences that are producing positive ROI spending money, and the ones that aren’t converting that day will be killed early. 


-
At the end of the day, reset the audiences and repeat this next day.


-
The goal here is to go with really high budgets that you are willing to spend as you know that if it stops producing results, you will be profitable. 


-
This is an excellent way to scale as you will limit your potential downside with killing ads early if you don’t have conversions, and you will be open to the massive upside if Facebook can find people that will convert

931,4dmwqf,False,,190,"How blowing $20,000 made me learn to code.",Entrepreneur,"I thought my story would benefit some of you. 

Here's the link to the original article on [Medium](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-i-blowing-20-000-made-me-learn-to-code-84c05499b9d5#.7fch5hrb1).

Two years ago I started a company called NextMover. We were the first mover — pun intended — in the Uber for moving space. I’d won Startup Weekend Santa Barbara and raised $65k in seed funding at the event.

With tons of great momentum, we set out to get our first version of the product to market. We started with simple landing pages, spreadsheets, forms, and used Venmo and PayPal for payments. It was a pretty manual process but we were able to get our first customers and learn a lot.

**No one on my team knew how to code.**

We decided to hire a rails developer to build our first product.
Our developer assured us that he could build our app based off some mockups we gave him. We liked him and decided to move forward.
I’d never worked with a developer and didn’t understand exactly what I was asking him to build. I had no way of knowing if his quotes were reasonable or if the code was being built properly.

Every time we needed a change, it took way longer than I thought it should to put in place.

It felt like a game of telephone — everything got lost in translation.
Part of the problem was my inexperience. We created what I call “developer whiplash” with too many changes to the product specs. Seeing that something wasn’t working I decided to do my own digging. I recognized I needed to get more educated on what I was asking him to build.


As bad as it sounds, I’d never logged into GitHub.
I just didn’t realize how it worked. Ninety percent of the contributions on GitHub we’re not him. He’d been outsourcing our product to some guy in El Salvador.


**Queue cold sweat #1: We’d just lost $20,000 building a shit version of our product.**


**Mistake #1: Hiring the wrong developer and not knowing how to manage him.**


Even after taking such a big loss it didn’t really sink in just how badly we needed this skill set until I reached out to one of my mentors, Steve Blank.


Steve is an eight time serial entrepreneur and is a leading mind in the field of startups and innovation.


I was lucky enough to get him on the phone for about 30 minutes.
I walked Steve through all of the challenge we were facing when he stopped me to ask about the team. I said we didn’t have anyone who knew how to code and he cut me off.


“Alex… you don’t have a business… you have an idea on the back of a napkin…”


**Queue cold sweat #2: My business was just a napkin.**


As hard as it was to hear, I knew he was right. Not having the technical skill on our team to build our product was a deal breaker for any investor and for our business.


We didn’t have the skills on our team to prototype new ideas cheaply and all the evidence pointed towards a business model that wasn’t viable. We decided to cut our losses and close down the company.
Everyone went their separate ways and remained friends. I remain close with my angel investors and am so thankful that they gave me this opportunity. The lessons I learned while building Next Mover guide me everyday.


Lessons Learned:


Have the skills on your team to execute your vision.
Know enough about coding to hire right and prototype your product.


What I’m doing today.


I spent the next 2 years learning how to code. I built my first app in just 30 days and continue to test new ideas. Entrepreneurship and education are my passions. Thus, most of the products I’m building focus in these two areas. The hard lessons I learned motivated me to gain a new skill and led me to an amazing team at OpusLogica. I’m currently an Entrepreneur In Residence working with the Opus team to build SaaS business.

**Wow thanks to u/Rouxmire for awesome and insightful advice**

A bunch of people have been asking about my experience learning to code.

1. I used these services to learn Ruby on Rails. [One Month](http://mbsy.co/onemonth/18685779) then go to [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and then [GoRails](https://gorails.com/) these are my favorite courses that I've tried. If I had to start over I'd still do most of these courses but I'd focus more time on learning JavaScript. 

2. I think I'm close to intermediate level with my dev skills. While I'm far from an expert, my skills have helped me build the first version of my next business with out spending any money. With this product I'm getting my first customers and revenue. More importantly, and to some of the comments below, I've been able to inspire some very experienced software developers to join my team because they can see that I have traction and that I'll be able to communicate what I need built with them.

107,chj2vk,False,,292,"Side Hustle: How I'm making over 1,000/month calibrating TVs for middle aged wealthy people",Entrepreneur,"Just thought I would share this method since I'm pretty sure most of you won't bother actually trying it anyway. (No self-promotion)

It all started late last year when I was looking to buy a new tv for my room. As I browsed through all the major retailer websites I noticed an add-on service that best buy offered. **TV calibration** for **$250**. I was blown away. How could that possibly cost so much? Well apparently Best Buy has certified Geek Squad techs drive out to your home to calibrate your tv with some special equipment. I knew that I had to get in on that one way or another.

Later on I finally chose the tv I wanted (not from best buy) and when I went to set it up in my bedroom I gave more thought as to what it really would take to get the best picture quality. I then spent days going through youtube videos, blogs, forums learning as much as I could about tvs (I love watching movies). I ended up calibrating my tv the slow way-- going back and forth with the settings.

I was terribly curious about some of the tv calibration kits online. So using the justification that I would purchase one with the intent of becoming a professional tv calibrator I bit the bullet and bought one after doing my research.

When It finally arrived I began by resetting my tv to factory and using the device. It was much quicker than just eyeballing it and perhaps a bit improved over what I had thought was the optimal setting. So I then went one by one to family members houses and started adjusting their tvs. I learned a few tricks and became more comfortable using the equipment so I knew it was time to get in to business.

The first thing I did was design a few **facebook ads** with photoshop. The premise of the ads was to show side by side stills from movies and tv shows. One would be an ""HD"" still with the ideal color balance and next to it would be the same image but washed out (another version was an HD image side by side with a darkened still). I then posed the question ""Are you sure your TV is set up properly?""

The Ad then takes the individual to a landing page where I had visuals with more ""before and after"" calibration imagery but this time in the form of a youtube video. I also made it clear that my services included some cable organization, installing soundbars, WiFi troubleshooting (Thank God for Powerline Adapters), cord cutting solutions, and even streaming service selling^*

I made it clear what my competitor charged and how I was a local small business offering a great deal: **$150**.

Also a money back guarantee if they were unsatisfied. 

My ads targeted homeowners in wealthy neighborhoods (not middle class) People 40+ years of age. I have gone back and forth targeting men vs women but it seems women convert at a slightly higher rate (even though once in home the story usually goes ""my husband always complains..."")

In terms of delivering service I always make sure to finish up by comparing what the picture quality looked like before I got started vs after. I think its also pretty important to show the customers some basic functions of how to adjust the tv as the reality is you'll probably need to switch modes depending on how much light is in the room when you're watching something.

Its not enough to quit my job but I normally spend less than an hour in someones home and I usually do 2 per weekend so its definitely worth it for me.

I think the lesson here is find something a big business is doing and offer it to people in your area for a better deal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/chj2vk/side_hustle_how_im_making_over_1000month/,1126,Do you offer to refill their blinker fluid while you are there too?

For me it was an entirely positive experience and loved all parts of it. They've got their shit together and they treat you fairly.

**The Start**

So, the process from beginning until airing is a very long process. We submitted an application to the producers in September 2013 when we were doing $28k/month in sales. I then headed to Austin, TX in March 2014 where they had an open casting. We still had not heard back from the production and were planning on also attending that, but at the last minute decided not to. From talking with others, those open casting events are where they try to find the ""unique"" businesses. 

I'm glad we didn't sit in line for that, because about 2 weeks later the team from Shark Tank reached out to us and started the process of getting ready to be on the show. We didn't beg, or send multiple emails trying to get on. It was that one attempt with a compelling story and a successful business. We planned to move on with our lives if nothing happened. Can't build a business on a lottery opportunity.

**The Process**

Shark Tank is like the fight club. Once you start the process YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE SHARK TANK. You are signing more documents than when you buy your house. There are clauses in there to make you hurt for spoiling the show. So, DO NOT TALK ABOUT IT or you will ruin your chances of getting on the show. 

I'm not going to go into too many details about everything that is involved in the process, but basically Shark Tank want's to keep a positive image and be well regarded. They don't want some renegade entrepreneur going off shouting about how bad they are and how bad they got screwed. If you a reasonable entrepreneur, you should be able to comprehend the risks and weigh the rewards. If you can't, I'll lay it out for you.

**The Risks**

* You will spend hundreds of hours of your life, many resources, and never get on the show.
* You may get on the show, but they may not accurately portray what happened in the tank.
* You may not be able to handle the stress of the Tank and that gets shown publicly to millions of people.
* You may get the opportunity to be on another reality TV show and they can prevent you from doing it.
* The sharks could bash everything you've worked so hard to build - on national TV.
* Shark Tank tends to bring on companies without established brands, we didn't want to appear like a company that was just about the product.

**The Rewards**

* You could bring on a business partner who has more clout than almost all other investors in the world. 
* You get to tell your story to millions of people.
* You get to prevent your competition from getting up there and telling their story to the world.

**The Process Continued**

So, if your business is selected to move forward, you will need to do presentations to sell the producers on the idea of filming you. You've gotta have a lot of energy and make it look like you'll be good on TV. Crank it up a notch over comfortable. But you still need to be yourself and be comfortable. 

Invest in good sound and good video for these recordings. It doesn't have to be studio quality; but don't leave them struggling to hear you, or see you. My YouTube experience helped a little bit with this. If all looks good, you'll need to record your pitch and they'll help you write it and compress it.

Take the advice of the producers. Look, these people know what they are doing and they know what makes for good TV. If you make for good TV then you'll get on TV. Check your ego and listen to their advice. They've had 100's of entrepreneurs come through the door. Your producers are your friends. I still stay in touch with mine and love those guys. 

**The Pitch**

You are responsible for your stage & pitch. Because of the risk of not getting on TV, we decided to keep our stage pretty small. We rented some tables and shipped over a few boxes of products. Shark Tank supplied the TV. The table rentals and product shipments probably cost us about $500 all together. I wanted the focus to be on me, not the stage. In addition to that, the more simple I make something the less stressed out I'll be - thus more comfortable come pitch time. I let the Shark Tank team setup my table, even though I had full control of how it could look. I trusted them and they did way better than I could have.

So to prepare for the pitch I worked with our law firm who did research on our business, our competition, and what other entrepreneurs have done for deals. That firm who works with Microsoft, Alibaba, Amazon, and other notable companies valued our business at $4 million to $8 million. I also talked with other entrepreneurs, local VC individuals, and business partners. From that crowd we validation for the business to worth around the $6 million mark. I also factored in getting an offer for our business when we were doing $30k/month in sales and had us valued at $1 million.

So with those numbers, we took into perspective the unique opportunity a shark brings and dropped our valuation to $2.6 million with room to negotiate if they were interested in our company. With the 2 minute pitch you'll want to leave some teasers in there that leave them open to asking questions.

**The Sharks Questions**

So, you guys saw about 6 or 7 minutes of my time with the Sharks, but I actually spent around 45 minutes with them. I had them at the end of the day after they had already seen 10 other entrepreneurs. I got a sense that they were slightly tired, and they wanted the day to be over. 

Most of the questions were about the products and it's a bit of madness in there. The best way I can describe the Sharks is like a kid in a candy shop. Right after my pitch all five of them will ask questions simultaneously. If you have a preferred shark you want to partner with, you might want to give them top billing when answering questions. 

They get easily distracted and you need to reel them in and keep the conversation in control. You'll see on my pitch that they were really focused on the kit but I wanted to bring them back to the core product. They spent the majority of time just thinking the Beardsman Kit was what we were all about, but we brought that to help show our full product line. 

In hindsight it might have been better to just focus on one product and really win them over with that, rather than trying to sell the whole company. They aren't prepared to understand a company who is successfully branding because they never see that. My numbers rocked, and we spent very little time talking about the numbers. I felt very confident backing up our valuation, but the sharks didn't seem too interested in the market. I think Lori summed it up best when she said she can only imagine Amish as the target market. It's clear they don't interact with a lot of beardsmen on a daily basis.

**The Results**

Well, there are a bunch of theory's about how to take advantage of a sudden influx of visitors. I spoke with others who suggested doing a pop-up to collect email addresses and throwing out discounts to get sales. We felt very uncomfortable with that - as we've built our brand on quality pricing and non-intrusive shopping.

Yes, we are probably turning away thousands of dollars by not having a totally ""optimized"" website - but we think there are some intangibles that will play a role in the long run. We didn't want thousands of people's first impressions to be that we discount our products and that we annoy them with popups. 

In addition to that, I hear that companies who don't get deals don't have as impressive results as those who get deals. So take these numbers as a ""worst case scenario."" We also had our episode aired on a holiday (Halloween), so viewership was probably down.

So what did all this hassle do for our business? Well, why don't you see for yourself.

**Bullet Points**

* We've gone from about $4500/day to about $12k/day
* We got 20k visitors on Friday and Saturday of the show (40k total)
* Most concurrent visitors we had was during the East coast airing with about 6300 visitors

I don't know if this will be our new floor as it's only about 1 week after the show, but I'm hoping it is. If you have any questions, ask away and I'll answer if it's possible. 

There are a lot of more details that I can talk about, but don't want to write a novel. From here it's best that you ask questions and I'll answer them like I always do.

**TL;DR** I was on Shark Tank and made lots of money.

88,4uexyw,False,,263,"9 years after starting my first biz in my mom's basement, and 4 companies later - these are my biggest takeaways so far...",Entrepreneur,"It's hard to believe it's been 9 years. But it's been an epic journey, and as I start my 4th business I have been reflecting a lot. I started writing this for myself as a journal entry of sorts, but thought some of it may be of value to those of you who are just starting out. 

But first, a bit about my history. 

I have been the founder of 3 companies, and a partner (but not a founder) of one.

* An 8-figure business
* 2 x 7-figure businesses
* A 6-figure business

**My latest business: [Unbound Merino](http://www.unboundmerino.com)** Unbound launched 5 months ago (July 2016) and we've done over half a million dollars in revenue so far. We are on track to making 7 figures by the end of our first year. Definitely off to a killer start!!!

**First Company: [BizMedia](https://bizmedia.com)** Digital Video Agency did 60k in revenue in the first year, 600k in the second year, and by the third year was a 7-figure business from there on out.

**Second Company: [dbrand.com](https://dbrand.com)** Vinyl skins for smartphones, laptops, gaming consoles etc. Grew this business to almost an 8-figure business within 3 years before being bought out by the founder (and one of my best friends)

**Third Company: [Hitsu Socks](https://hitsusocks.com)** Online and retail manufacturers of funky socks designed by street artists. An epic journey that had me cycle through 4 different partners until I found my current partner who is an entrepreneur far beyond me who has taken this from a struggling, money losing (but fulfilling) side project into a real business with real legs which is finally a business doing 6-figures. But it was a real grind to find the path with this one. Happy to say it's on the path to real growth.


The night after launching my most recent business I couldn't sleep much. I was very happy with the launch but my head was spinning and I couldn't stop thinking about all the different experiences I've had over the years and how it's shaped me. All the people I've met and worked with, all the mistakes I've made, all the lucky breaks I've gotten, and so on and so on. So I started writing some of these things down, not with the intent of sharing them - but more so just to get all the reflections out of my head and on to paper. Thought maybe it would help me sleep. It did. Anyway - these are some of the lessons of my 9 year journey. It's not in any particular order and a lot of this is just rambling. But hopefully some of you can take some value from this. And if you have any questions I am happy to answer!

**Go save money!** It costs a ton of money to start most businesses. You don't have to be rich to start a company. I was broke as all hell when I started. But I freelanced as a videographer and editor to get the funds to start my first business while waiting tables on the side. I would rather wait tables and save $20k and start from there than start a business for $500 like a lot of threads I see on here suggest is possible (which it is!). But while you technically CAN start a business with just $500 and be really successful, that is a crazy steep hill to climb. And getting traction with a $500 startup I am willing to bet would take longer than going and waiting tables, saving $20k and starting with that money. You can always tinker with a $500 startup on the side of making and saving funds working a job.

**Forget your social life** It's not important. It never was and it never will be. Unless of course your social circle is directly related to your line of work / your startup. I mean, people who could help you, work with you, you could sell to, etc. Just because you went to high school with someone and you like them, doesn't mean you need to go waste time with them at the bar on Friday nights. Friday night is a time when 95% of the world is taking a break, what a time to get ahead. If people get mad at you for not coming out any more, tell them you want to focus on your startup. If they can't understand and support that - you don't want those people around anyway. 

**SALES - the most important word in business** Sales is the most important skill you can ever obtain. Good sales people are the most under appreciated and rare breed of people you could ever find. Keep sales people around you. Go to sales seminars, find entrepreneurs who say the word ‘sales’ over and over again, who’s only concern is sales. They have all the answers you are looking for. I can't stress this enough. In business sales fixes every problem. You need to understand the mindset of the people who's lives are sales. The most successful entrepreneurs have sales blood. 

**Join and be involved in organizations that better you** I spent years in Toastmasters learning to be a better public speaker, then I joined the board of trade (tried for a year but wasn't a huge fan), then I joined EO (Entrepreneur's Organization). In every year of my journey as an entrepreneur I was a member of, and heavily involved (usually at the board level) in some kind of organization. This is a great way to meet people who are growth oriented and care to see you succeed. The people you meet in these organizations are the types of friends you want close to you. It may take you a while to find an organization that you take lots of value from, but look for it. And don't just pay your dues and expect results, put in and contribute. The more you give, the more you can take out. Being on the board and regional council of EO has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life and it's helped me through all of the biggest challenges I've faced as an entrepreneur. I don't know where I would be without the support of the brilliant people in EO Toronto. 

**Start on something now** While I said go save money before diving in, I didn't mean you shouldn't be starting in some capacity. Even if you're just researching, planning, blogging, maybe doing a side project selling some soap you make at home or something, find something you can make or source, or a service you could provide today - and start selling. You could be an entrepreneur by tonight if you wanted. All that matters is you have something to sell and you find someone to buy it. Anything. If you get someone to buy something off you, you're gaining invaluable skills that will compound over time. Experience is everything. So get started on something, even if you have bigger plans for later. Oh, and if it fails miserably. That's a great outcome. Which brings me to my next point, and probably the most important...

**There is no failure really. Only feedback** That's a line stolen from Jeffrey Gitomer the sales author. But what the hell is failure really? You tried something and the outcome was different than your hallucination? Failure is FEEDBACK. And it's the feedback that is only given to those who have the balls to try. I would rather be a man with 100,000 failures in life than someone who hasn't tried to do shit. At least I'll be able to write a book about what not to do at the end of the day. Maybe I'll have a really sweet reddit post that will get me lots of karma. OR maybe my experience will take me to the place I was looking for all along. You can look at the list of companies I've founded and think I've been successful, but I left out all the failures I've endured in the process. The gut wrenching, nightmare inducing fuck ups. But they all help in the end. The key is to never ever let a failure slow you down. Failure will give you that feeling that you need to stop and reconsider your direction. Just learn from the failures and go harder. The path just becomes clearer and easier to navigate after each failure. As long as you have the will to not let them break you. Feedback. It's freaking feedback.

**Earn Cash, Don't Burn Cash** Build a business that doesn't burn cash, but earns cash. It's so 101, but I'm amazed at how easy it is for people to forget. Don't spend anything that won't make you more money in return. Be ruthless about this. I've blown more than $1MIL that I probably didn't need to over the past 5 years on stupid shit that I am now embarrassed of. And it's came close to devastating and ending my business. You don't need to grow your staff and the size of your office, unless you NEED TO. Stack your money, and guard it. Again, it seems 101 but I admit I have made some pretty dumb decisions spending myself, and so many people around me are guilty of the same thing. 

**GOALS** I think this will apply to those of you who already have a company, or the early seed of a company. Have a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal - a term from Jim Collins book Good to Great). A BHAG is a vision of where you can take your business if things go BEYOND WELL and you are incredibly lucky and everything goes amazing, 25 years out. So if you're in video you may say you want to create the next HBO or something. Something that is so big that it's almost unreasonable based off of your reality today. The only reason you need a BHAG is because it sets the direction, no other reason. From the BHAG, figure out where you could be in 3-5 years if things go well. The 3-5 year goals need to be leading you towards the BHAG. For example, you want to have $10-15MIL in revenue and one online show concept that has XX million subscribers on YouTube and 3-5 corporate sponsors. I'm just pulling these out of my ass but you get the point. From the 3-5 year goals, find your 1 year goal. Things get real now. What is realistic within 1 year that is in the direction of your 3-5 year goals? Maybe have 5 big corporate video clients (for revenue) but also to have 2 YouTube shows with original content already in production (the early attempts at making big time original content in the future). AND THIS IS WHERE THE BEST PART COMES IN. The quarterly goals. Nothing is more real than a quarterly goal. 3 months is the perfect amount of time to conquer one meaningful and sizeable project that moves you in the direction or your 1 year goal. Maybe it's to have your corporate website up, to have show concepts and pilot scripts written. Whatever. There's nothing pie in the sky about this. You have 3 months to do it. And it takes you towards your 1 year goal, which is a step towards your 3-5 year goals, which are aimed at your BHAG. It's ALL about direction. You can always tweak the long term goals as you go, but the quarterly goals MUST be set in stone and executed against. We break our quarterly goals into weekly and even daily action plans. Take the whole project and map it out over the 3 months and stay on time. Trust the plan. Get in the trenches. Get to work. 

**Expose yourself to feedback** And let it sting. This really hit home with me recently. My EO forum (group of 8 other entrepreneurs who meet monthly) all recently went on a forum retreat to New York City. We met with another member of EO from a chapter over there. I am not allowed to share who it was because there are very strict confidentiality rules in place for EO. But, he's a business titan. He recently sold his company for over $800MIL USD and he took us in and told us all about building his company and what he's up to now, and took us for lunch and really spent some good time with us. He's working on a new project and he was so eager to get our feedback on it. Now it's important to know that while the businesses in my forum are all multi-million dollar companies, none of us are quite at the level of being sold for $800MIL. Not even close. But he was so keenly interested in our take on his new business, that it really made me realize that he's just an obsessive tester. He gets as much info as he can from wherever he can. We may not be as big as him, but we're all entrepreneurs and that was enough for him to truly want to dig into our thoughts on his direction. I started being more aggressive in my hunt for feedback on what I do, and it's amazing to open yourself and your ideas up like that. Even my recent Indiegogo campaign was completely shit on by a few of my colleagues which stung so much. But ultimately led me to make very pivotal changes last minute that made the campaign way way better. Find mentors, and seek feedback. Be open to what you hear. This may be obvious to some but it took me a while to learn and be more open to it. 

**If doing business internationally, have a mentor** I do a lot of importing from China and I've wasted so much time and money learning lessons the hard way. I then started seeking help from a friends friend who does tons of business in China, and in one hour he taught me enough to completely change the way I get things done with overseas suppliers. If only I met him earlier, I would have saved SO MUCH FUCKING TIME AND MONEY. If you are dealing with people overseas, find someone to give your pointers and guide you. This actually applies to every aspect of business. But the importing thing is fresh in my mind. 

**Don't be an egotistical prick**  In your 20’s you are at your peak of energy and there is very little you can do wrong. Fucking up is a gift and the repercussions of doing so in your 20’s are next to nothing. But don’t ever think you’re smarter than those who have been in the game longer. You may have insights they don’t have because you’re younger – but experience is the best teacher there is. And your ego can easily piss off older people who probably have a ton to teach you and likely would really enjoy helping you. So keep your ego to yourself and surround yourselves with people who are older and wiser than you. And be grateful and have your ears wide open. 

**You're the average of the 6 people close to you** If 1 person in your immediate circle isn't ambitious, hard working, smart, helpful and generally and awesome person... Get them the hell out of your immediate circle. Your close circle is the most important asset you have. Don't mess it up by having a douche bag in there. Because then you're 1/6th douche bag yourself. 


**Passion / Purpose** People always have advice about following your passions, or ignoring you passions to find purpose and yadda yadda yadda. Just fucking learn skills and make each day count. Come up with an idea and a plan and get to work. There's nothing wrong with having passions, but I don't see why everyone tangles passions into your work. I love music, but I don't need to make my money writing songs about my achy breaky heart or some shit. I'm happy having music be in my life as I passionately learn and work hard and try to grow my businesses. Learning how to make a business work is just as fun as playing guitar or ice hockey or eating an amazing cheeseburger. It doesn't matter if your business is a new social app, or you manufacture industrial cleaning products. The mechanics of starting a company or simply improving yourself are enough to be super passionate about. I never thought growing up I would be selling socks. I just go through life trying to solve problems and get better every day. So there, my purpose is making each day count towards my longer term goals. 

**Have an accountant in your circle** Accountants speak the language of business better than anyone else. Have a good one in your corner, and have one as a friend to help you with a second opinion. Even better, hire one who no longer wants to be an accountant. Have them help you keep your books clean and to mentor you to understand how to really make sense of your P&L. Know your P&L like you know the back of your hand and stay on top of it. 

**It's going to get real hard**  And when things are the worst, give yourself 5 min to wallow in your own shit and then write down where you want to be, then write down what actions you can do today that would set you in that direction. You can’t do anything more than what those actions for that day are, so just do that. It’s all you can do. And it’s the right thing to do. Nothing to be bummed out about anymore, you’re doing your best and you’re going in the right direction. 

**Picking a business to get into** From what I've experienced - the best businesses to get into are those where you feel all the current offerings that exist suck. When dbrand was founded, it came from the realization that all the now competitors actually made garbage skins. For some reason, nobody was doing a good job at making skins. The soil was fertile for that business. My friend started a hair extension business called Luxy Hair. It came from his wifes terrible experience trying to find good quality extensions online for a good price. They couldn't find it, so they created it. It's a multi-million dollar business today. And my new business Unbound, we created it for us (my partners and I), after having no luck finding anything that was the right look, fit and quality. We made this company at a time when the soil is fertile for growth. My sock business on the other hand was founded in a very crowded market. It took 2 years just to find our niche, and only now are we seeing any traction. We got excited because socks were so popular. That isn't the smartest time to start a business. It's a lot tougher. 

And lastly...

**Entrepreneurship isn't for everybody** I fell into this and it's become me. At times being an entrepreneur sucks. Really. I have many days and weeks where I have no idea how I got myself into this. But I am built to handle the shit storm and not break down. Not everyone is like that. For some people having a good job that you can stop thinking about at 5pm is a much better life. There are amazing upsides to entrepreneurship, but if you aren't fit for handling the really hard and ugly side, be smart enough to avoid it. Entrepreneurs have great stories, but you often don't hear the ones about those who never made a 7 or 8 figure business. There are a lot of casualties in this line of work. And it sucks so bad so often. BUTTTT. When it doesn't suck, It's FUCKING AWESOME!!! Just be ready to not let the feeling of roasting in the fiery ditches of hell with no way out in sight get to you. And when things are great, don't let that get to you either.

I have no idea if anyone will read this. But it felt good to write. And sorry if there are any typos or grammatical errors. No way I'm reading all of this. I need a beer. 

All the best!

Hello everyone my name is Josh Shogren and I am currently a Freshman in college. I have some money saved from my niche sites that make me over a $1k a month and I am in the process of selling one of my niche sites for $14,000. I have decided that I am going to put some of this money towards starting a new private label business on Amazon through their FBA program.&nbsp;


I have also decided to not go the route of buying a $4,000 course and I am going to figure everything out on my own. That means that I am going to use only free information on the internet and learn by doing and making mistakes. I know a lot of people want to get into this business but don't have the extra money to spend a ton of money on a course and have to pay for all of their initial inventory.&nbsp;


I will act as a test dummy for all of you and try to make some money on Amazon with only free information. I will be updating everyone as I go along. I posted the [introduction post](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/follow-along-as-i-try-to-make-money-with-amazon-fba-introduction) last night on my website and you can read what I said below. I have cut out some of the fluff and only kept the most important parts of the article.&nbsp;


Thank you for reading and I hope this is something that will be of interest. The next update will be out soon!&nbsp;


**What Can You Expect from me and this Case Study?**&nbsp;

I am going to be documenting all of my progress as I try and get a product up onto Amazon. I have not taken any paid courses about private labeling products or any type of course related to what I am going to be doing. I have found everything online for free and that is where I have gotten all of my information at this point. My plan is to absorb all of the information I can for free and figure everything else out on my own all while posting everything I find here for all of you.&nbsp;


As I go through the process of getting my first product on Amazon and selling, I will be explaining every step for you guys to learn from and follow. I would rather save $3,500 and use that for my inventory and on learning by doing then on a course. By not following the course and doing things on my own I will act as a crash course dummy. I will be a test dummy for all of you that want to get started selling on Amazon but don’t have enough money to buy the course AND all of your inventory.&nbsp;


My plan is to update you all very regularly as I go through the process of finding a product, finding a supplier and getting it on Amazon. It is not going to be that simple and there are a lot more details that go into private labeling a product and selling it but I will cover it all as I go through it myself.&nbsp;


**How Will I Be Updating the Case Study?**&nbsp;

I will be posting new updates very frequently on the site and I will show you every step of the way from beginning to the end. I will make use of videos a lot in this case study because I will be able to show you exactly what I am talking about visually instead of trying to explain everything through writing. I am going to be making videos for the niche research process, product selection, supplier selection and many other parts of the process that I feel are important.&nbsp;


I might even do some webinars to help answer questions that people may have or start a Facebook group for people that are looking to start selling on Amazon but don’t want to spend a ton of money on learning from a course. Instead, we can all learn together as a group and help each other out when possible. I am also open to suggestions that any of you may have so let me know!&nbsp;


**I Have Already Started….but I Will Catch You All Up**&nbsp;

I have already settled on a product that I am going to be selling but that is as far as I have gotten. I still am in the process of finding a good supplier that will do everything that I need.&nbsp;


The good news is that I will still have videos and updates covering the part that I have already completed. I will go through the whole process and explain every step. There will be a couple of updates to this case study that will come out here in the next week or two that will catch you all up to the point where I am at currently, which is looking for a supplier.&nbsp;


Even though I am already a little ahead, I am still going to be updating the case study from the very beginning of the process and explaining each step of the way. The next couple of updates will be coming out at a quick rate so that I can catch you all up to where I am currently at as quick as possible.&nbsp;


**Will I be Sharing my Exact Product?**&nbsp;

I am not sure yet. I don’t want to risk sharing my product and niche and then have people either a) try to sabotage my project or b) bring in extra competition that there wouldn’t be otherwise.&nbsp;


But I do see the benefit of sharing my product so I can use that as my example in everything I do in this case study. I am pretty torn on this decision and I am still deciding, I would love to hear what you all think about this. So please let me know in the comments below.&nbsp;


**Will This be Free?**&nbsp;

YES.&nbsp;


This whole case study is 100% free and I am not going to sell you anything. I am doing this because I want to document my progress as well as help people succeed on Amazon who don’t have the extra money to spend on courses.&nbsp;


I think I have a pretty good grasp on what I need to do to be successful on Amazon but I will be constantly learning and everything that I learn will be shared here, with you.&nbsp;


**Conclusion** &nbsp;

I hope this post wasn't too long and that you are all interested in following my journey. All of the updates will be posted here - [my site](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com) but I will also be posting the updates here as much possible.&nbsp;

636,4rce93,False,,135,"This subreddit is full of stories of success. I have a few of them, but far more businesses I have tried to start failed. Here are some of the worst.",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit. There are so many stories of success on here I thought it would be interesting to hear about some failures.

I have started a popular coffee shop, created a successful sporting goods brand and built and sold a tech startup.

That all sounds great. A lovely fairy tale of success. But it's not the whole story. 

The true story is that along the way I tried to start a lot of other business that totally failed. Costing me thousands of hours and enough money that it still makes me feel ill. 

Including:

**A social network.**
Yes, I tried to become the next Mark Zuckerburg. And failed. 

**A dropshipping clothing business for a music niche.**
A 10% margin and small-time bedroom business suppliers was a disaster waiting to happen.

**A car importing business.**
Importing went fine. But it took almost a year to sell just three cars.

**A gambling affiliate site.**
Lost the equivalent of a deposit on a house trying to build something I have no interest in and think is slightly immoral.

**A web development firm.**
As a student, I assumed it was an easy way to make money. But I'd never built a website before and turned out to be rubbish at it.

**An educational site to teach students how to make money.**
Actually made some money, but nowhere near enough to cover the time and work that was put into it.

On top of those I tried countless get rich quick schemes, played and got played by the stock market, and bought into a few random rubbish and very small-time companies (a face painting business, an events firm, a carbon trader).

They say: fail fast, fail often. 

Well, I don't know about that, but I do know that without the lessons I learnt from these failures I would never have succeeded in the other businesses.

196,3e70uu,False,,264,"$50k a month with lead gen guy here again, If I had absolutely nothing and had to start from the beginning with $0, what would I do in detailed steps...",Entrepreneur,"Hello again.  

I have been trying my best to answer every reply I can, I have also tried answering almost every PM that I can.  I've got tons of pending skype msgs but I will get back to you later on, I promise.  Currently, I am traveling in Indiana for a day to finalize a few operators.

First, I would like to clear a few things.  I don't have anything to sell you.  I am not selling any ebooks or have a plan down the line to send you to a website to pay me money.  If I ever do that, please ban me.  Secondly, if we chat on skype, after the conversation, please remove me from your log, I don't need your personal information in anyway so you don't feel I am going to try to sell you something later on.  Lastly, I am only helping people out.  It's how my parents raised me, it's what my religion teaches me, it's who I am, if you personally knew me, you'd know I go out of my way to help you in anyway I can. No bull shit, all up front, the real deal.  

Let's get right to it.  

Everyone asked me a lot of questions, by far the highest ranked question would be,""What and how can I start a business with the operator model?""  Even though I was trying to share my secret I stumbled upon for lead generation, it seems many were interested in operator structure as well.

So, I have $0.  Let's say bad credit as well and at the same time no one out there to help me financially.  All my friends are as broke as I am.  What I do have, however, is knowledge, lots of it, from reading a lot.  I honestly and truly believe I've read more than some college graduates.  Keep this advice handy.  

1 - What do I love and I am passionate about?  I like computers, anything tech, internet stuff, good food. (I would write all this down and make a detailed list)  
2 - First, I need to make money, I want to do something with computers.  
3 - Work at a computer store, any where I can, best buy, local pc store, dell, hp, any where you can. The money I make isn't important, the experience I gain is much more important.  Make sure you're targeting a industry that has a good future.  
4 - I start working and saving up, 6 months, year, however long it takes.  Keep saving.  
5 - Now it's time to start making more money, I start utilizing business cards and craigslist posts.  I post ad's online in the closest metroplex around me to see what sort of leads I get.  The ad must be catchy and interesting.  It shouldn't say, I fix your computers, call me.  Something more like, *Computer GENIUS who can fix all your problems for a flat fee of only $25.*  Once you're in the customers door, you upsell.  Play with test ads, you'll see the $25 get a huge response, maybe 100x more responses.  It works.  I visit the customer, fix the problem if its software related for $25, upsell open source virus programs and what not for an additional $75, $100 or more.  You can't charge for free stuff but you charge for your time.  
6 - I dress professionally, buy a shirt with a brand/logo on it, file for company name under a few hundred dollars that I've made already.  
7 - Now time to open my first store?  I don't think so.  This is where many people screw up.  They rush it.  First, you need to make sure your service will have demand.  In retail, a block makes a difference.  Keep in mind, real estate is king.  If you're a doctors office, you can be in the middle of the forest, it doesn't matter, people will look for you and find you.  It's not like that for other businesses, that's why they pay prime for real estate.  Location is key.  
8 - I can start from my own garage, let's say I live in an apartment, so I start looking for busy electronic stores (mom/pop).  
9 - Approach one or many, cell phone stores, electronic stores, etc.. are perfect.  Offer them a cut from my profits for using a small space in the back of their store, all I need is a counter.  Test it out. Play with it.  I realize now, people are breaking their phones left and right, I need to watch youtube videos and learn this as well.  I take the time do to so, next thing you know, I am now a valuable asset to this electronic store.  Build clientell.   
10 - I've got a lot of money saved now, at least $10k.  I start looking for sublet opportunities.  I dont' have credit, it'll be extremely tough for me to get approved, therefore I start looking for someone who already has a lease and for whatever reason couldn't run their business and need someone else to run anything they want in the store as long as they sublease it from them.  I have no risk this way, sublease in many cases comes with zero liablities, it's a temporary gig approach.  
11 - I get a small sign made, not from signarama or one of those high end companies, go on dhgate.com or alibaba.com and find a sign company over seas for a flat sign or a light box.  Don't need channel letters right now.  
12 - Look for some quick used showcases, something like this - https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/sss?query=store+showcases  
13 - Cheap and affordable, fill up your small store, work 9-9 daily.  You have to work hard.  
14 - How the forumla works :  
No hard work = No good results.
Some hard work = Some good results.
110% = 110% results.  

This is the magic answer, that's it.  Nothing else.  

15 - Grow customer base, 6 months - year.  
16 - Post ad on bizbuysell.com / other businesses for sale sites locally saying, ""BE YOUR OWN BOSS, Run Your own Computer store! Existing customers and extremely profitable!""  
17 - Find a hungry operator, similar to yourself, he might be in the same shoes you were in few months/year or two ago.  
18 - If he has money, great, use it as a fee for yourself.  Give the operator 85% of the business, even 90 works.  
19 - I now have funds do start my second store, this time I also have more leads and more money from others who are interested in investing.  
20 - Time to repeat and grow.  


I am not saying this is the only method that will work, it's just one way that has worked for me and can work for anyone.  It can be applied in any industry :

Nail Salon Business  
Hair Salon  
Food Cart  
Web Development  
App Development  
Lawn Care  
Lead Gen.  
Construction / Contractor  
So many options...  

I don't care what industry you're in, even if you're a doctor, I know a doctor that has 3 offices with a similar setup.  This operator model isn't something I invented, it's the same concept all the franchises in the world are already doing, which is finding the right investor/business man to grow and run their businesses with.

1 - Year 1 - 10% residual from one operator.  (Work hard on making them successful, this can help you with future operators)  
2 - Year 2 - 10% residual from 2 to 4 operators.  (Work even harder and hire help)  
3 - Year 3 - 10%  from a dozen ore more operators and start getting creative, become Mr. Wonderful from shark tank :)  

Before you know it, you're making 1000's a month in residual from great operators.  You can tap into a ton of other business ventures now.  

These are just realistic goals that any one can do.  I have done the same thing with 4 foot carts that sell chicken and rice, I plan on doing the same thing across the nation with them as they are extremely successful.  The list goes on and on...

Any questions, post it on here and I'll respond when I can.  I'm still going to get you guys the video when I fly back out of Indiana tonight and have it posted by Friday hopefully.  This wraps it up - I need to wash up now and pray, good luck to you all.

541,aqle0u,False,AMA,193,"3 years ago, I was 🤬 of being a ""business guy with an idea"" and learned to code. Last week, I launched my first SaaS app.",Entrepreneur,"\[Sorry resubmitting, previous post disappeared\]

&#x200B;

Business guys. You know, the Patagonia vest wearing tribe of people who have bold visions but can't tell you a thing until you have signed an NDA. The ones who are always one developer away from becoming a billionaire.

&#x200B;

**Yup. I was one of them**\--save the Patagonia🧥, I never liked that look.

&#x200B;

I graduated from a top undergrad business school and established a career in management consulting / corporate strategy on Wall Street. I'm not trying to humble brag. I'm just illustrating *how deep in this shit I was*.

&#x200B;

I had ideas, loads of them. I even tried to execute a few of them--that's a story for another post. But I was always missing something, someone. **A mythical developer** who was willing to risk the odds and put in the hard work in exchange for ""equity"". And it's not like I didn't try to find her. I networked, hard. Name a tech meetup in NYC or an online startup forum, there's a good chance you would have found me there.

&#x200B;

At some point, it occurred to me that developers are not averse to risk or good ideas. **Developers are averse to people.** **People who have no track record of bringing products to life, don't understand technology, and think ""that feature should only take a few days to build"".** I needed to demonstrate that I'm different. I wanted to speak their language and show that I am willing to put in the hard work, day in and day out, to turn an idea into reality.

&#x200B;

So I taught myself how to code. I knew a bit of Java from high school, but next to nothing about web development. **My ultimate goal** was to develop an idea, research the market & customers and launch an MVP. Little did I know that it would take me three years. **Three long years** of juggling 80+ hour work weeks with social life and spending all my remaining time on coding. Why am I telling you all this? Mainly to assuage my bruised ego for taking so long 😭.

&#x200B;

**But was it worth it? Absolutely**. Being able to combine corporate strategy with technology has been a game changer for my career. It has also helped me understand just how difficult it is to go from an idea > research & test > plan > product. Ideas are truly worthless.

&#x200B;

Now for the next challenge--grow the customer base and find that unicorn tech co-founder. Or just hire developers. I have options now. **Moral of the story:** don't wear Patagonia vests. And if you are a fellow business guy with no track record of launching startups, maybe try coding.

&#x200B;

If there is interest, I'd love to write a follow up detailing either my learning process or how I researched and built my app.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading. Thoughts and criticisms are welcomed.

730,c8b0g3,False,,98,How I Make Money Off 4th of July Festivities: Selling Glow Sticks!,Entrepreneur,"So in my area, there are a couple different fireworks shows between June 29 - July 6. To capitalize off the festivities, I sell glow bracelets, necklaces, and glasses at the shows! I can usually get the glow sticks in bulk at around $0.05/stick. I then sell them at:

*  $0.50/bracelet (One glow stick with a bracelet connector), 
* $2.00/necklace (four glow sticks connected together),
* and $1.50/pair of glasses (2 glow sticks with special glasses connector pieces)

&#x200B;

I carry them around on a display made out of PVC pipe, and usually recruit a cousin or sibling to help me sell. 

&#x200B;

Here's the results for the show we went to on the 29th:

I spent about $15 in product and had my younger brother help (I held the display, while he made the change and helped people get the bracelets off). I kid you not, as soon as we took the display out of our vehicle, people started running up to us demanding our products. We had a window of around an hour to sell before the show, and during that time, they sold like crazy. All we had to do was slowly walk around and people would either come running up to us or yell for us to come to where they were sitting. 

&#x200B;

We covered maybe half of the viewing area, and made around $120 during that time.

695,ej3bfl,False,,49,I quit 12 years of government work to start a mushroom farm! - UPDATE!,Entrepreneur,"Hey team, Tom here from Oak and Spore.

Here is the link if anyone missed it and wants to check it out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/e8mtcr/i\_quit\_12\_years\_of\_government\_work\_to\_start\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/e8mtcr/i_quit_12_years_of_government_work_to_start_a/)

Anyway after posting about it on this sub, user u/avemk messaged me and said she happened to be visiting New Zealand and staying in Governors bay, which is just around the road from the farmers market I sell my mushrooms at, and that she would stop in and say hello! Pretty cool having an internet stranger come by your little business. Avery stopped by and had a chat, and it turns out she runs a new podcast which interviews people from different walks of life. She asked if she could interview me for her podcast, which I thought was a fantastic opportunity!

We organised a date, and she came to my property to look at my mushroom farm and give me an interview about quitting my job and starting a mushrooms farm. The story covers my life quitting the armed services and Police, and diving head first into a mushroom farm.

266,atjai5,False,,79,I Reached Out to 30+ Navy Seal instructors and asked what are the top characteristics that get students through training. Thought their answers apply to us.,Entrepreneur,"I've always been interested in high performers pushing the bounds of human strength and endurance. Starting and running a business is tough. 70% of businesses [fail after the first 10 years](https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail). 75% of Seal candidates wash out.

I reached out to Dozens of **Former** Navy Seal instructors and asked them ""What are the main physical, mental, or personal traits that they saw in students that succeed vs those that failed?""

Here are some of their responses.

&#x200B;

""There have been many studies, many stories and books written on who/what does it take to make it through BUD/S, bottom line it is mental fortitude to endure challenges and most of all being a Teammate.""

""Most of the guys that quit are the ones that wanted the title, uniform, recognition, etc. SEAL training is not good for you. That’s why you need to have a good reason to go.""

""There have been many studies done on guys that made it through training and they have not found a common denominator yet. Some are big, some small, some smart, some dumb, none quit. I believe that it has to be for the right reasons.""

""Most students are already Olympic caliber athletes and mentally and physically superior to most of their common peers. It comes down to one word when they hit that wall, desire.""

""Each person has to discover that \[motivation\] on their own. For some it’s worth it, for most, it’s not. That’s what makes us elite.""

""We could never tell who was going to make it. It all had to do with each persons mental toughness. There were many times I was at first surprised, but then you see the mental strength of that person come through. Rarely was it the biggest or most fit guys who made it. It was usually the guys who were used to fighting for everything their whole lives. Best way to put it is, BUD/s doesn’t make potential SEALs, it finds them.""

&#x200B;

It was interesting as I was reading their answers some common things came up. It wasn't the fact that they were the fittest. Many were surprised when weaker students would make it. Mental toughness was mentioned a lot. More than physical fitness

But even more interesting was the underlying trait that drove mental toughness.

Words like ""desire"", ""right reasons"", ""good reason"". These all boil down to their **why.** It's what drove them to push past the walls.

Starting a business is tough. You may not be the most talented, smartest or capable in your industry, but that doesn't matter. We hit walls and it takes a strong mental toughness to push through. But what pushes us it is our ""why"".

&#x200B;

"" I would say, i didn't know who was going to ring the bell.  Quiet determination is the main characteristic. I had classmates that surprised me, but students were all kind of like lumps of clay that could be formed. You make it if you leave yourself with no choices. ""

"" Mental toughness and having no plan B... knowing the goal was to be a SEAL and not simply to get to or even just to get through BUD/S... starting with the long game in mind - I wanted to be a SEAL... do what SEALs do... be a part of an elite brotherhood... I didn’t just want to go to BUD/S. Quitters go to BUD/S... ""

"" There is always special surprising moments and unpredictable candidates who pass and there is very little predictions on who may or may not quit.  It is challenge to truly understand what that mental focus is and what drives an individual across the finish line..., and it does not stop after BUD/S.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/atjai5/i_reached_out_to_30_navy_seal_instructors_and/,789,"> booya

21,ge9swn,False,Lessons Learned,288,I changed careers and went from $40k to $100k in one year.,Entrepreneur,"Eight months ago, I changed my life completely. I went from being severely depressed, unfulfilled, and frustrated, working 50 hour weeks, barely earning above minimum wage, to landing my dream job, and more than doubling my salary. 

I’m sharing my experience because when I first began this journey, I would have loved to have heard a story like mine. 

After 7 years as a hairdresser, it became clear I was on the wrong path. Having always loved writing, I became determined to pursue a career in copywriting. 

The problem was, I had no idea where to start. 

When I researched ways to transition into the industry, every resource said I’d have to go back to college and study. I didn’t want to waste another 3 years, accumulating enormous debt for a piece of paper that I knew wouldn’t make a difference. I needed to find a different way to reach my goal.

Here are the steps I took to change from hairdresser to copywriter, without a degree, and without an internship.  


**1. Shift your mindset.**

I had to unlearn everything I thought I knew about how to build a successful career, starting with challenging the belief that I wasn’t capable, or deserving of the career and life I truly wanted. These limiting beliefs mean most people just settle for a job they can tolerate, not the life they want. 

I read the work of many successful female entrepreneurs to learn about how they overcame their own self-sabotaging beliefs, as well as researching material online about how to handle “imposter syndrome.” I have an entire hype-board on Pinterest, purely to remind myself that I am deserving of a seat at the table.  


**2. Find a mentor**

I ""apprenticed"" myself to my friend who is a successful entrepreneur and runs several digital businesses. Find someone who has been successful in the niche you’re interested in and ask them for help. If you ask for help, the majority of the time, you’ll receive it. Successful people have been where you are now. When someone who genuinely wants to achieve what they have, asks for help, they are almost always more than willing to give it.  


**3. Research**

I researched on Goodreads to see which books were consistently mentioned as being the best across marketing and copywriting. 

These included:

* *Mastery,* Robert Greene
* *Daily Rituals*, Mason Currey
* *On Writing Well,* William Zinsser
* *The Adweek Copywriting Handbook,* Joseph Sugarman
* *Ca$hvertising,* Drew Eric Whitman
* *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,* Robert B. Cialdini
* *The Copywriter’s Handbook,* Robert W. Bly

A key part of my process with these books is to take notes as I go, and either create or find online, a book summary once I’ve finished reading. I keep a Google Drive folder just for book summaries and I refer to them at least once a month to refresh my mind.

I did one online copywriting course that I actually found here on Reddit, which turned out to be incredible. The thread is still up if you want to [check it out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/aiwymi/i_make_around_300000_a_year_as_a_freelance/)   


**4. Start TODAY.**

I practiced as much as possible, journaling daily, writing on Medium, and submitting work to sites. I gained experience by working for my friend to practice working to a brief, following a word count, and meeting deadlines.  


**5. Cold-email small businesses.**

I started cold-calling and cold-emailing small local businesses, offering my services for free to help gain experience and build my portfolio. I landed my first \*legit\* client this way. In “Influence”, Cialdini talks about the principle of reciprocity —  if you offer your services for free to a few people, it’s likely that at least one of them will return the favor by offering you ongoing work.   


**6. Apply for jobs**

I started applying for copywriting jobs. Initially, I never heard back from a single application, until I decided to leave my work history off my resume entirely. I think potential employers were seeing my history as a hairdresser and immediately concluding I wasn’t qualified for the role. This tactic worked; I got a callback and they asked me to provide a writing sample. I knew I was up against 3 other top candidates, so I decided to go above and beyond — I didn’t supply just one writing sample, I supplied 4 and explained how I would split test them to find the top performer. I figured no one else would go to that amount of effort, and my employer later told me that was true, no one else had. I had an interview and I got the job. 

Less than 6 months after that I became a freelancer, continuing to work with that company as my main client but with others on the side as well. Today, I work with a range of clients including social media influencers, brands, and small businesses. 

I don’t expect to gain anything from sharing this, and I’m not looking for new clients. I just thought some of you might feel inspired by this or find some of the steps I took useful.

918,b55a4f,False,,89,How I overcame my biggest hurdle? Me and my ego.,Entrepreneur,"I own and operate a $1.2mil marketing company, own a new $300k small clinic and I am building an SAAS product. I have a small family, decent home, car etc.

I started working for myself in my 20s. I would try do everything in my business and fit every role. I would feel burnt out ever two years. I had an unhealthy ego and inflated sense of self worth.

At 34 I nearly lost my marriage, however, luckily I killed my ego instead. You see, 1 year ago I started seeing a psychologist to help with my anxiety, stress, my ego, my arrogance and fear of failure. My business would regularly decline in conjunction with the decline of my mental health and this impacted my total quarterly net profits, my attitude and my family.

Over a few months, my psychologist helped me learn the importance of taking proper holidays, taking business less seriously and my health more seriously, splitting work and life, and importantly helped me understand that it’s ok to quit or be defeated. The greatest mindset I learned was to trust people and rely on others, even if I get burned by people. Funnily, a combination of these things let me see how unhealthy I was and how I was limiting the growth of my own businesses and the comprising the integrity of my marriage.

My advice: Seek advice from a medically certified psychologist and share your struggles with them openly. 

Mental health has a negative stigma that is generally perpetuated by ignorance, low income demographics and a lack of education. You are not crazy in seeking professional medical mental health advice. Furthermore it is perfectly normal for highly successful people to speak with professionals regarding concerns and feelings. 

If you are like me and rely on your brain and state of mind to make money and support your family, then getting a check up regularly will be a very helpful. Regular checkups will aid you in keeping your mind well serviced to ensure years of continued success, profitability and happiness.

610,1u0unt,False,,154,How I Made $1k Selling Egg Incubators I Found on Alibaba,Entrepreneur,"I've noticed the content on r/entrepreneur has been improving over the past month and I wanted to add my experience to help. First, I don’t have a blog, info product or plans to create one. This is just my story with real numbers, real product names (rarely seen on this subreddit) and how I made $1k by selling a product I found on Alibaba. The reason I’m sharing my story is because I don’t intend on continuing to sell this product. I still have a domain name and shopify store I set up to expand on this product but I have other side projects I would rather focus on and I don’t think it's enough of a business to sell it on flippa. If anyone is interested I'm still in contact with the supplier.

If you don't have a basic knowledge of how importing products works or have never used [Alibaba](http://www.alibaba.com/) I would suggest starting [here](http://www.startupbros.com/how-you-can-make-big-money-importing-from-china-the-rise-and-fall-of-my-empire/) (FYI I have no affiliation with startupbros).

Second, it's probably relevant to mention that I have sourced products from Alibaba for a [drop shipping site](http://www.gundogco.com/) I run and at the time I was already an Amazon vendor. These aren't huge advantages but it is important to mention that I did not start from zero. My best advice would be to jump straight in. You will learn a lot more by doing.

**The Idea** 

Several months ago there was a debate in my city on whether or not chicken coops should be allowed within city limits. This led me to research what people needed to house chickens. Apparently, there are a lot of people doing this around the country (USA). Next, I went to Alibaba to look for relevant products. I stumbled across egg incubators and saw that is had potential.

**The Product**

Here are the steps I used to validate products I thought had potential:
-Search Alibaba for price per item and MOQ. Egg Incubators were around $50-$80 based on quantity and manufacturer
-Search Google/Amazon/Ebay to get an idea what they were selling for.  Under Ebay advanced search you can see completed transactions. The Incubators on Ebay appeared to be cheaper, around $230, but Amazons lowest list price was $350. Shipping cost is still a concern but it’s worth moving forward at this point.
-Message suppliers on Alibaba to try and get a “sample” or small initial MOQ. Here is the exact message I sent: 
>Hi,
>My name is *blriber* and I am the owner of GundogCo.com.
 
>I am interested in your 48 Egg Incubator. Would you provide me with >price and MOQ for an initial order? The shipping address will be 
>[redacted]  USA
 
>I look forward to hearing from you.
 
>Thanks

I received several promising responses and ultimately was able to purchase two incubators as a test order for $60 a piece + 195 shipping (for both). The shipping is really expensive by air for a large product like this. It would have been much cheaper to ship by boat but I wanted to test this product quickly and not wait a month. Plus, with the shipping my total cost was $157.50 per unit. This still leaves enough room for profit if they sell for $350.

**Results**

-After receiving the two test incubators I placed a listing on Amazon. To my surprise the first incubator sold in about 5 days for $350. After taking out the 15% Amazon fee and my shipping cost I was left with $270.50 almost covering the initial investment of $315. 

-Once the second incubator sold I ordered four more from the same supplier at a total cost of $665 ($166.25/unit). I also ordered two from a different supplier and tested a few different prices. Both were the same exact incubators so I’m pretty sure I was working with wholesalers and not manufacturers.

**Here were my totals:**

Sales:            $2,800

COGS: 	       ($1,295)

GP: 	        $1,505

Amazon fees ($420)

Shipping        ($104.84)

Net	        $980.16

899,3j27th,False,,110,There is no easy way.,Entrepreneur,"Ah, the fabled easy way.

I’ve been there, looked for it, determined it does not exist and then went back to look for it just to make sure.

Google great small business ideas (I know we’ve all done it) and all you see is the same old crap rinsed and repeated with no tangible steps on how to be successful. Then we start a t-shirt company and wonder why we fail.

Here’s the secret, there is NO EASY WAY. Period.

I have recently been studying entrepreneurs and businesses who started from scratch (no investors in the bag, no free publicity, no real safety net etc.) and are now doing well to try and identify common themes. I looked across sectors, from apps to food to imports to subscription boxes to niche products to service so that any similarities would not be industry specific and thus would (hopefully) be universal.
 
Want to guess what I found?

The single, most-repeated, trait was *working like a maniac on their business*.

Not a couple of hours here and there or finding time on the weekend. We are talking 8-12 hours daily, usually in addition to a separate full-time job.

For those bad at math, that’s 40-60+ hours **weekly** on their business for at least 3 months from anywhere to a year or two and then they turn into a overnight success and people looking from the outside make excuses like “I thought of that idea first” or “they just got lucky” or, one of my favorites “they already had money”.

Here is a summary of how some of those entrepreneurs spent their time:

1. They looked around and see where people were making money and came up with a way to do it slightly better

2. They developed their thing and made it look awesome, professional, and trustworthy

3. They proceeded to market like a madman/woman. Like the kind of marketing where you tell everyone you know and ask them for referrals and then tell all of those people and ask them for referrals. The kind where you reach out to every influencer within your niche. Where you go around and cold-pitch businesses, or sell door-to-door. They told people about their thing and why they should use/buy it.

4. They reiterated steps 2 and 3 based on customer feedback and identifying what was working.

The truth is that success in the world of entrepreneurship isn’t about luck, circumstance or privilege (although those can help). It’s about putting the nose to the grinder and making something that people are willing to pay for (either with time or money).

I think u/localcasestudy says it the best:

“There are only really three things we look for when deciding what to go after:

1. Are people making money doing xyz?

2. With our available skill set can we be better than at least on of those people?

3. Are the monetary requirements relatively small?

If the answer is yes to all three, we go for it, otherwise we pass.""

Success, my friends, is both *achievable* and *repeatable*, but it doesn’t come without busting your tail to get there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3j27th/there_is_no_easy_way/,418,"> Here’s the secret, there is NO EASY WAY. Period.

I had a van, I bought a rake, a spade, a bucket, some gloves and some bags and blasted all of the local buy and sell pages on Facebook I could get my hands on. 

I've been unemployed and depressed for quite some time and finally decided I had to try something to make myself an income, I couldn't face working for someone else in my state.

Within 2 days I had a full week of bookings lined up (about 90% of which are weekly reoccuring customers) to come scoop up after their dogs. Apparently no one is offering anything like this within a 100 miles of me maybe even further and my customers are amazed no one has offered this before.

I plan to scale this up to £300 a day in the next few weeks as word spreads (I haven't actually cleaned a garden yet first day is tomorrow) and I'll hire someone from there to do it all for me and enjoy the semi passive income, I'll still be taking the bookings but hopefully I can afford to stop blasting these Facebook pages soon and do proper advertising.

Just a humble brag of a post really, my hope is to maybe inspire some people out there! It is possible to do things like this even still today. Not everything has to be ecommerce or private labeling on amazon.

Do the people who get that equal measure of success get there because of these 'Steves', or because of something they did themselves (dumb luck, good contacts, existing money, good looks, etc etc)?

Just food for thought. I've devoured so many podcasts, videos, books, and whilst I feel motivated and driven by their words, I often find nothing changes, and cannot figure out why.

I thought I'd share a bit about my business on its 10 year anniversary.    
I opened a hookah bar in a town of ~50,000 people at the age of 21 with about $5,000 and a $20,000 SBA loan. It was originally open 6pm-1am Wednesdays through Sundays. For probably the first 18 months I worked probably all but 4 or 5 shifts, without taking a penny. I also kept a day job the whole time to pay for my personal expenses. I've never ended a year in the red. Besides my initial start-up costs I believe I had to deposit one of my personal checks from my job in to help with bills maybe a year or so into business. IIRC the first full year I grossed roughly $27K. I obviously was very passionate about what I was doing and I was just happy to pay the bills. After 10 years I have 3-4 part time employees on average that generally 'run the shop' on their own each shift. I do very minimal work and, for the most part, it runs itself. The last few years I gross between 110k and 120k. I've purchased a building and net roughly 15% of sales.    
I wanted to share this because it isn't glamorous, but I am proud. I essentially have an investment at this point that takes very little management and makes me money and builds equity. I employee a few people who enjoy their job, I give people one more place in my hometown to enjoy and be social.    
I've been told many times it wouldn't last, or that I would fail. My parents cosigned my original SBA loan and were told point blank that ""when"" I failed they'd be on the hook. I faced a statewide smoking ban, bugged the shit out of lawmakers, and went to my capital to state my case for an exemption on the day the bill was signed into law. The exemption did not exist on the bill when I arrived that morning, only me and one other guy were asking for something that would keep us and at least a handful of other businesses from essentially being forced to close. They added it in as a grandfather clause that day. I made a lot of friends, I've learned, and continue learning, a ton about business and I even met my wife because I opened the place.    
My advice is this: Don't get into something to get rich (especially quickly), it rarely works, you might end up hating it and quitting before you get anywhere. If it were easy to get rich few of us would be in this sub, we'd be on our yachts. Do something you have a passion for that through research you feel people will be willing to pay you to do or sell. Don't let people that aren't your target market stop you from starting a business. Listen to the feedback you receive from customers and be willing to make changes even if they weren't part of your initial vision. Don't be afraid to ask for and receive advice or help from friends, family, customers, or people you look up to, or that may have insight on the issue at hand.

577,85baz1,False,Feedback Please,218,Purchase a $99 online course. Get a 100% refund if you finish it.,Entrepreneur,"Online courses platforms completion rates are pretty low. To motivate more people to buy courses and actually finish them, I'm thinking about a new business model.

#Updated idea (find the original one at the end)
Due to great feedback (thank you all!), I changed my mind on several aspects to build a coherent business model that makes money and is trustable.

You enroll in a 10 chapters course by purchasing it at a high price, let's say $100. Each time you complete a chapter, you get a cash reward of $7.5 which motivates you to keep going. You have 30 days to finish it (depending on the course size of course).

If you fully complete the course, you get $75 back (I arbitrarely capped the discount to 75%). Otherwise the money left goes to the charity of your choice. I earn 25% of the price for each course.

TAGLINE: *The more you learn, the less you pay*

##FAQ

**How could you ensure students really complete the course and all chapters?**

Students will have to complete chapter 1 to access chapter 2.

How can I manage that? By using clues blended into the chapter content so the student must read the whole chapter to get all clues. Then, put together, the clues form let's say a word, you enter this word on the website and it unlocks chapter 2.

The unlocking system must be simple enough so non-technical people can easily find the answer thanks to the content and access next chapter. I don't want students to be stuck in the course progress. I want them to read the whole course though.

**This is not very secure, someone can collect all the answers and post them online!**

Sure. This person can also take your paid PDF ebook or videos training and put them online for free. There is no way to avoid piracy. I consider piracy as free marketing. It's part of the business.

**But that's insane! You'll be incentivised to build crappy and unfinishable courses to maximize your profit!**

If I do this, I will burn my customers, I won't get any referrals, I won't build trust with my audience, my business will be screwed.
The purpose is not to maximize profit by making students frustrated or angry! It's to make them happy by motivating them through the money reward to finish the course they enrolled in. That's the main goal they have when they first enroll in the course.

Also, I can give the money not rewarded to a charity! So on a $100 course, if you do 6 chapters and give up, you get 6 x $7.5 = $45 rewards, then I take $25 and the $30 remaining goes to the charity of your choice! How awesome is that?

**How will you build trust with students?**

Simple. The first chapter will be short and easy. That way I can immediately reward the student with cash so they can be sure the system works and they'll get their money back if they continue to progress within the course. I will also provide a 7 days money back guarantee no question asked.

**How to make money out of this?**

As said in some comments, there were a flaw in my initial idea: I first wanted to fully refund if the course was completed. But if everyone completes the course, I did't make money. A good suggestion by ralphisahomo is that I can use a discount instead of the full price refund. I can even optimize the revenues by using tiers thanks to ListentoLewis great idea.

* Pay $99, get $50 back on completion. (They pay $49)
* Pay $149, get $110 back on completion. (They pay $39)
* Pay $199, get $170 back on completion. (They pay $29)

I can also think of non-linear rewards. For example, chapter 1 rewards $5, then chapter 2 rewards $6, then $7 etc. The more you progress the more you earn. That could provide a boost in motivation too.

#Original idea

You enroll in a course by purchasing it at a high price let's say $99 (the loss of money must be important enough to motivate you to finish the course). If you finish the course, you get a full refund. No fees or whatever, just a full refund. At the end, it's like having the course for free.

If you don't finish it, you say bye bye to your money.

What do you think about this? Would you be more willing to purchase this kind of course? Do you think it would help you finish the course too?

EDIT: Updated the format and content of the post to reflect awesome feedbacks and answer common questions (thanks you all!).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/85baz1/purchase_a_99_online_course_get_a_100_refund_if/,546,"I think this is a great idea. I think you should merge some of the feedback you've received:

1. In order to keep the revenue but still keep the idea of it being completely free, you should give them the money back, but make the last bit be credit toward more courses rather than actual cash back.
2. Your idea of progressive payments in each chapter is good, but it shouldn't be 1:1. I.e. if there's 10 lessons in a $100 course, let each lesson earn $5 back. The whole point is to incentivize them to finish the whole course, not just part of the course.

Combine these ideas like so: $5 for each lesson, they've got $50 back. Another $30 in cash at 100% completion plus $20 credit towards their next course.

Adjust those percentatges as you see fit. As someone else said, you'll have to pay transaction fees on each transaction, so to get more full-course buy in and to minimize fees, make it so that they can only claim the per lesson credits by giving up on the full course so that you only ever pay for a maximum of 1 refund transaction per course.

Getting URL clues is weird and complicated. Just make them take a quiz after each section.

If you're going to use the different tiers, then I like the idea of making it some sort of wager. Duolingo does this. However, since it's real money, you might run afoul of gambling laws doing that. But at minimum, you should give the option of an outright payment for the course with no refund. That sets their perceived value of the course. Using this scale you laid out:

>Pay $99, get $50 back on completion. (They pay $49)
Pay $149, get $110 back on completion. (They pay $39)
Pay $199, get $170 back on completion. (They pay $29)

I'd make the ""regular"" price without any money back on completion be a minimum of $79, maybe even $89.

And as someone else said, content is king. To build a course platform, you need quality courses first before whatever marketing scheme you choose to employ matters. ",2018-03-18 13:46:53
659,8ksb6g,False,,71,"How To Sell Anything Part 2: The Biggest Factor To Why Only A Few Are Successful, And The Only Reason People Spend Money",Entrepreneur,"As I posted [How To Sell Anything Part 1: Your Mental Blueprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8k98bt/how_to_sell_anything_part_1_your_mental_blueprint/); I've gotten both good (and negative) feedback for a couple of reasons.

First, I would love to address that these posts are not posts that will magically give you the ability to sell anything you want no matter the product. 

What I would love to derive from these posts is the ability to teach people what I've noticed that made myself successful in sales, and what made others successful too. 

It may seem redundant to you; sure. If you are already aware of the advice that I'm spending across, fantastic. This is for the people that I've seen with my own eyes (I currently work as a sales trainer that on-boards new hires for different companies) that may not know about how to tackle the realm of sales. 

What I've also learned is that you can **always be learning.** I believe anyone who takes the time to posts valuable advice (clearly relative if you know about it or not) can always add to your sales arsenal as both a salesperson and as an entrepreneur. 

Still, I would love advice/feedback/positivity on how I can improve these posts for both myself and my readers. 

To start, probably one of the biggest factors to what differentiates successful salespeople and unsuccessful salespeople. What are salespeople doing that you’re not doing?

**Top Salespeople Are Goal-Oriented**

for people who al goal-oriented, there is a direct relation to success. If you live a goal-oriented life, you will never lose sight of your goals and your dreams.

The problem is, people are the only goal oriented when they are motivated. Right when they lose that motivation, Then you know what happens next?

Eventually, they give up, “life happens”, or they [insert excuse here] and cave back into their own comfortable routines, finding any kind of rational through a series of mental gymnastics finding any hole they can.

Then, they won’t readdress their goal until something motivates them again.

“People with goals succeed because they know where they’re going.” – Earl Nightingale 
You might say:

“This is obviously common sense.”

But I’ve seen the majority of the people give up pursuing their goals when it becomes to difficult for them and I personally believe this makes up for the majority of the population.

When you relentless purse a goal that a majority are not, your chances of ending up more successful is extremely high because your sharp shooting your target – rather than hustling 6 months there, a year there, 1 week there.

“How do I live a goal-oriented life then?”

Make goals, and attach deadlines with repercussions. I’m asking you to use fear to your advantage. Fear is primally deeply rooted and etched into our brains. Once you will move out of your comfort zone – you will scramble to find your way back.

Fuck all that bullshit of:

“Make conscious decisions to step closer to your goal throughout the day.”

“Write down your goals and you’ll remember them.”

Lot’s of individuals become entrepreneurs because of the fear of being controlled by a boss. The fear of wasting their life in corporate America. The fear that they will spend the rest of their lives doing something they absolutely loathe.

Lots of poor individuals become so obsessed with success (and become successful) because of the fear of being poor again. The fear that they won’t achieve greater things in life. The fear of that same pain of being so broke, they would skip multiple meals and suffer.

You develop a discipline for yourself that will make your hungry for your goals and to achieve them.

Lot’s of artists use the fear of not being able to make a living from what they love doing, so they relentlessly pursue it until it comes to life.

Former fat people become so fucking obsessed with becoming jacked because of that fear of being fat, unwanted, and ugly and the dark side it comes with it.

Now, I’m not saying that this is the only way to be motivated. But this is the only want in my experience plenty on how a lot of successful people stays on their toes.

This is considered “fear-setting”.

You aren’t making the money you want to be because you are a lazy fucker, it really is that simple.

You aren’t making the money you want as a salesperson because you don’t want it bad enough.

Lot’s of salespeople who first struggle to pay rent, in fear that their lives will continue being this constant struggle – so they develop strategies to get to a point of being comfortable (where your comfort zone is). 

Hint: **your comfort zone does not exist.**

Now I can make this completely philosophical, and advocate always practicing misfortune so you’ll both constantly be comfortable with being uncomfortable – but that is not the point of this post.

When making your goals, it is absolutely essential for you to know how much you will earn each year, or you’ll end up with nothing just like you did a year ago.

 

Now, ask yourself:

“How much do I intend to earn for the next 12 months?”

Write this number down. This is the target which you will orient all your activities throughout the year. 

[Statistics don’t lie:](https://sidsavara.com/why-3-of-harvard-mbas-make-ten-times-as-much-as-the-other-97-combined/) A Harvard study found that the 3% of graduates from their MBA who had their goals written down, ended up earning ten times as much as the other 97% put together, just ten years after graduation.

A goal that is realistic, but challenging. Remember, goals rediculous goals won’t motivate you – they will demotivate you. You will quit at the first sign of adversity.

For example, take the amount of money your making now: and increase it by at least 25%.

Top salespeople know exactly they are going to earn each year.

If you were to ask any successful salespeople how much they are going to earn that day, they will give you that exact number. Low performing salespeople have absolutely no idea what they are going to earn. Every day is a new adventure with no compass.

Now ask yourself:

“How much am I going to have to sell to achieve this annual goal?”

After you decide your annual sales goal, break it down over the months.

Then, ask yourself:

“How much am I going to have to sell each week/month to achieve this annual goal?”

Break it down to the point where you are making daily sales goals. This is the best way (personally) how I found myself making the annual sales goal I desired. If I wanted to make six figures (tax-free), I would make a goal for myself that would look like this:

$100,000/52 weeks = $1,923/week. $1,923/7 days = $275/daily. I would then wake up every morning, relentless pursuing this $275 daily goal – and eventually, give me a yearly goal of six figures.

Then, you will need to develop strategies to get to that $275/daily goal.

“How many calls will I have to make to make this daily goal?”

“How early do I have to wake up to start prospecting, to make this daily goal?”

“How much should I sell my product for, to make my daily goal?”

“Who do I need to talk too, where, and how long for each prospect to make this daily goal?”

“Who do I have to hire and what marketing techniques do I need to make this daily goal?”

When you can document everything and look at it objectively, you’ll soon be able to predict (with accuracy) exactly what you’ll have to do each day to achieve your annual goal.

Force yourself with this motivating factor to follow through doing everything you’ll exactly have to do each day.

Think about this about yourself: is this you, or are you that person who tries to sell “as much as possible?”

**The Law Of Averages** 

You will have dry periods, and you will make more than you’d thought. You will have your sales highs and your sales lows.

Some days you’ll make nothing – and some days you’ll make x3 the amount. If you continue to make those necessary actions to achieve your goal in sales, you will eventually make that annual goal on schedule.

As you make it a habit, you will train your subconscious mind – it will further alert you to new opportunities, and give you the “right” ideas to get to your goal quicker. Your subconscious mind will help you better read your prospects face, smell bullshit a mile away, and even further distinguish if a prospect is even worth your time.

Your mind will always help you perform at your best – in the pursuit of your goals. When you have a positive self-concept about yourself and are goal oriented – you will always have the right things to say, at the right time, in the direction of your goals.

When you set goals for yourself, you will be amazed what’s possible.

**How Setting Goals Outside Of Sales Will Further Lead You To Sucess**
 

“I have a daughter, and I want to show her what success looks like. So, I’ll [insert all your actions here]” 

“I want my family to finally be happy.”

“I eventually want to enjoy life alot more than I am now”. 

Using additional facets of goal setting outside of sales will give you the motivation to bounce back and continue pursuing your sales goals. This is sort of like a system of checks and balances.

When you’re aggressively trying to sell your product; will the person with only one obligation/goal succeed, or will the person with 50 different goals/obligations succeed? More reasons, more desire.

After you have your mental blueprint set up and have a goal that you will relentlessness pursue; you’re ready to further build on your sales foundation to become one of the top salespeople in your field.

I firmly believe the biggest, number 1 rookie mistakes amateur salespeople make (and still are making) is…the inability to figure out their customer’s needs by asking questions in order for them to take action.

**The Two Reasons People Buy**

*Desire for gain
*Fear of loss

The desire for gain is the improvement within their life, of some kind.

Your job is to help your prospect understand how much better his or her life would be with your product, to the life they are living now.

Prospects are afraid of wasting their money.

As prospects become familiar with the market which results in becoming more cautious of what they buy, they fear they will lose if they make a purchase if there is no real value behind it.

This is called [Loss Aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)

People generally prefer to avoid losses than to acquire its equivalent gains.

It is better to not lose $5 than to gain $5.

[The Prospect Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory), which is research done by both Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, found out the psychological value of losses and gains indicated that people may have a loss aversion ratio of between 1.5 and 2.5.

This means a loss that is identical in money terms to a gain may be valued up to 2.5 times more than the gain.

People hate losing more than winning.

What is the key that makes successful salespeople close more sales?

Salespeople are able to demonstrate both. 

Your job will be to both: find if that individual will gain from the product or service (desire for gain), and how much worse off he or she will be if they don’t act (fear of loss).

**The Psychology Behind Why We Take Action**

Every action we take is based on a motivating factor to take that action. simple as that.

People buy products and services because of two main reasons:

*They feel as if they’ll be better off in life after purchasing your product
*They have so much “fuck you money” so they can spend all day and every day because money is no factor to them.

Rarely you’ll get the second reason. It’s happened to me a couple times, but it probably made about under 5% of the sales throughout my sales career.

There are three actions a person can take in the realm of sales:

*They can buy from you
*They can buy from a competitor
*They can buy nothing

Understand, you are ultimately signaling to the prospect that they are better off with your product, than without. 

Your product must serve as a solution to their lives since they’re looking for one.

They then will be willing to give up a portion of their freedom (money) in order to find whatever solution they are looking for.

**The Human Desire For Freedom**

Also, it will help if you understand that money does not exist. Money is a medium of exchange to buy people freedom.

Money is a fiat. Money has no value behind it. Most people traded their time and labor for their hard earned “money” which they will use to exchange for a product or a service that will help them give them a degree of more freedom or an improvement in their lives.

If prospect buys a product that has no value to him or her, they’ve just traded a portion of their life away for a product that gives no value to their lives.

For the majority of people who understand that they’ve worked hard for their money – there will always be some kind of buying resistance. 

An individual always wants to get the most out of what they buy, so they look for a product that gives them the most benefit and satisfaction to their lives.

In economics, this is called marginal utility.

If you put a product out on the market, it is already assumed that your product is at it’s best price and quality.

A mistake I’ve seen is when salespeople reinforce the product by saying:

“Buy my product because of the price and quality!” 

Sure, you are a salesperson, but it it’s most literal definition.

You are an individual who sells goods or services to other entities, but you’d probably not be a very successful one.

**Finding Your Customers Needs**

In order to help your prospect both not lose – and for you at the same time win; you need to see if your product or service will bring value to them at the point in time.

How do you do this?

You need to ask a plethora of questions – the more specific the better, in order to dig out specifically why the customers want to buy your product or service at that current sale.

Let’s put this is an example in simpler terms, using a scenario in car sales.

Prospect A just graduated college, just signed a lease for a new apartment next to his work office and just want a car the is both sufficient and economical to get to work every day.

How did you know this? You asked about who he or she was, their background, and why they were shopping for a car at that time.

Do: ask questions. 

Here is are two scenario that I’ve seen destroy salespeople, so you can better understand this concept.

In the first scenario, prospect A walks into the dealership. You, as a salesperson, make commission off the cars you sell want to make as much money as you want possible: so what do you immediately do? Start asking the prospect questions immediately show him or her the newest car out, substantially wasting time forcing information about a car (that they gave no indication that they were interested in it) down their throats.

He or she looks at the price tag, sighs, and eagerly waits for an opportunity to tell you that they’re not interested. Then, after an hour of the salesperson talking, he or she stops and says:

“So, what do you think?”

Little did you know, he or she just graduated college and isn’t looking for a big-ticket commitment like that car. He or she was just looking for an economical car that they could afford, just to take them to and back from work each day.

You are out a sale and a precious hour of your time. What you could have done:

You could have shown him or her a used, cheap economical car which would have potentially got you a sale if you understood your prospects needs first.

As addressed in Part 4, you have a daily goal to hit and you only have 24 hours in one day. You just wasted an hour of it.

What makes you think someone would want to buy your product? Because you like it? Because it’s nice? Because you making a living off of it and you have no choice?

No. People buy your damn product because it has to align with their goals during that given time. If a wealthy individual walks in and you use the same tactic and made a sale without asking a question, you got lucky, friend. 

After that sale, you’ll subconsciously look for clues that signal wealth. When you make enough sales to wealthy people, you’ll start to be hyperfocus to prospects upon the way they dress.

They way they speak.

What that currently drive.

Then, through trial and error, you’ll (hopefully) realize to sell cars to people who can obviously afford it and to sell other cars to people looking for cheaper alternatives. You’ll also realize people who are a waste of your time.

In the second scenario, let says a salesperson is trying to sell car insurance.

That salesperson might spend the time to talk about its affordability, how it’s better than it’s competitors, the reputation of the company, or how cheap it is.

Sure, this is all important. But this is not the sole reason why a customer will buy car insurance. He or she will buy it, for peace of mind.

A simple strategy you can use when identifying new prospects:

“Do you feel the need to keep your car safe and secured – with a peace of mind and 24/7 support, spending as little as possible?”

If the prospect does not say “Yes!” immediately, you will not spend any more time trying to convince him or her. If he or she is feeling relucted to secure their car, they won’t care too much in case of an accident.

Learn to ask questions and discover your customer’s needs in order for them to take action, or to figure out if they’re worth their time.

**Reasons Why People Purchase**

Once you find the right motives to why they are purchasing your product, it is usually the individual:

*View a purchase of your product as an accomplishment or an item that represents their status
*The product your offering either makes or saves the individual money
*Security (to become safer)
*The appeal after the purchase to being liked, accepted and respected by others
*If your product can enhance health & fitness (high levels of energy and/or attraction)
*Gives the prospect power, influence, or popularity
*The desire to staying “up-to-date” (need the newest iPhone, ect)
*The ability to give the prospect of love, attraction, sex, and companionship
*Personal growth (learn new skills or a permanent transformation)

**People Are Ruled By The Sensual And The Visual; Logic Always Comes After**
All buying decisions are usually emotional, based on what they see and how it makes them feel. People justify their decisions logically and usually decide emotionally.

Humans have an array of emotions – but the strongest emotion operating at the particular moment will determine what that person will act upon at that time.

784,9u6obu,False,,86,"Don't be afraid to take on low-skill / low-pay ""menial"" jobs.",Entrepreneur,"I went from a highly technical (Engineering) job to being unemployed for quite some time, due to a bust in my industry. This led to months of being unemployed, and a metric TON of job searching. 

In the meanwhile, I also called temp agencies, and agreed to take ""anything"" that came my way, just to do *something*, really. 

This led to a string of ""shitty"" jobs, often one-time assignments. And even though I was highly educated, with good work experience, it was mostly manual labor, or quite menial jobs. 

Did I feel like a failure? Sure. I had imagined something else. But I always do my best, no mater how boring or uninteresting the job is. I was also sending out applications during the evening, so I figured something would come along, sooner or later. 

But there's one thing I had not foreseen: The sheer number of ""*There* **HAS** *to be a better way of doing this!*"" moments. 

A ton of these jobs are being done the same way they were done 20-30-40 years ago. Minimal digitalization. ""Process optimization"" is foreign. 

For example: I worked at one warehouse, which was part of a leading big box electronics store, where 90% of registration and data tracking was done manually, *by paper*. Employees registering data with their one phones, sending important information over snapchat or FB chat. 

One time we had to manually count a whole truckload twice, because the guy in charge had lost his checked inventory list (paper), but before he got to enter the data on the computer. 

Or the fact that expensive cargo (cellphones) would get shipped in one large box, then ""hid"" in the rest of the cargo. These boxes would sometimes contain hundreds of phones, and be worth hundreds of thousands. 

They contained no tracking systems. No anti-theft systems. No-nothing. And it's still like that. 

So, if you're really struggling to come up with ideas, I highly recommend to just dive into some jobs, and see what pops up. 

It's easy to get accustomed to always having cutting-edge tech at your fingertips, if you work in tech - but huge parts of large industries are still very primitive, and ripe for change. 

And you won't really discover those things, unless you actually work there (or happen to be a consultant, trying to identify all these things). 

EDIT: In case someone misunderstood my post - I'm not advocating people to pursue these jobs, but rather that if you find yourself in the position of taking jobs like that, you absolutely should look around for things that can be improved.

785,8k98bt,False,,87,How To Sell Anything Part 1: Your Mental Blueprint,Entrepreneur,"Some years ago, Harvard University did a study upon 16,000 salespeople - determining that there are basic qualities that determine the successes and the failures for a salesperson...and the determining factor?

It was all mental.

It is everything that goes on in the mind of that salesperson that makes all the difference.

If a person had certain psychological qualities with everything else constant - that salesperson would succeed.

If you personally develop these same psychological qualities, then you will form your own foundation to your own sales success.

If you want to see how tall a building is going to be built; look at the foundation. The deeper that foundation, the taller the building is going to hold. The same concept applies to sales.

The greater understanding and foundation you develop about sales, the more money you'll be able to build for yourself.

Once you have built your foundation and truly become phenomenal at selling, you can now go where ever the hell you want and write your own check.

Never stop trying to dig a deeper foundation for yourself.

**People Don't Use Their 90% Of Their Potential **

Most salespeople only use 10% of their sales potential. It is estimated that the average person doesn't use more than 10% of his or her potential.

What this means, is that the average person has 90% or more potential left untapped. When you learn how to unlock the 90% of your own potential, this is when you can move yourself to the top 20% of the highest earners.

**Follow The Lions, Not Other Sheep**

The first thing you do in your field is figuring out who is the top 10-20%.

Instead of following other followers - in this case, the other sheep, follow the lions.

Pretty obvious, right?

Learn to compare yourself to the lions. Remember, nobody is better than you or smarter than you. We were all cut from the same cloth.

If someone is doing better than you, all it really means is that he or she found a more efficient way of having a selling success that you've yet to discover.

The very proof that something can be done, is that someone already did it.

This means if someone is earning a seven-figure income, this is real, concrete evidence that you can also earn the exact same amount of money as that salesperson did.

The four-minute mile was supposed to be unbreakable. Roger Bannister thought otherwise and broke it.

And what do you know? Everyone now has the confidence to break 4 minutes mile (which was always achievable...someone just had to do it).

Remember, everyone starts at the bottom and works their way up. If someone specifically is doing better than you, find out the exact strategies that salesperson used to eject him or herself from the bottom to land where he or she is today.

Sometimes the very best way to figure this out is to just go and ask. He or she will probably tell you.

Top performers are usually willing to help other people who are willing to succeed. Since they've already beat everyone in the field they're in, they demonstrate more value for themselves by teaching others to get to where they are today.

So they write books, set up courses and seminars, or teach other people to achieve that exact same success.

**Your Self-concept**

One of the biggest breakthroughs in psychology in the 20th century was the discovery of a ""self-concept"".

Your self-concept is a bundle of beliefs you've created about yourself (both external and internal).

This is the way you see yourself in the mirror or think about yourself in any area of your life. This is exactly what goes on your subconsciousness - and has a direct relationship on how you interpret reality and the actions you take in it.

Everything in life starts to improve when you start to improve the source - the inner programming of your mind.

You always perform externally in direct relation to your subconscious and self-concept.

You also have a series of mini self-concepts.

These are little self-concepts that will determine the effectiveness and success in each area of your life from making perfect, fluffy pancakes - to the extreme of giving a speech amongst thousands of people.

**Your Self-concept In Sales**

If you are confident and have a high, positive self-concept about yourself - then prospecting and selling is absolutely no problem.

You get up in the morning, ecstatic to call, sell, or approach new people. You are so confident, your sales pipeline is always full because you know people want the product or service you are selling.

If you have a poor self-concept about the sales your making, you'll approach sales with fear and anxiety.

If your subconsciousness is filled with this negative traits, you will subconsciously take actions in the real world that will sabotage your sale.

You will avoid it, whenever possible.

The very idea of selling will make you tense and uneasy.

You will try to do a little as possible, and subconsciously try to find ways to avoid the act of selling. This is true in any other facet of life as well.

Every salesperson comes to work with a self-concept of how much they are going to earn. Psychologists have found that you cannot earn 10% more or less than your self-concept about your income.

If you earn 10% more than you think you are supposed to be earning, you'll subconsciously engage in behaviors that will derail you from ever achieve 10% more income.

You will start to go out to fancy restaurants, buy a nice car, or even take months off for vacation. This will eventually burn a hole in your pocket big enough to the point where it's like you've never made more.

If you earn 10% less than you think you are supposed to be earning, you will be engaging in scrambling behaviors.

You'll start thinking about working harder. Longer. Smarter. Better.

You do this in order to get your income back up to your comfort zone. When you get into your comfort zone, you will relax and take things easy again.

**Change Your Comfort Zone**

The only way to expand your income is by expanding your comfort zone.

Some people have a comfort zone of making $50,000 a year. When they get to that level, they relax and coast.

Others have a comfort zone of $100,000 a year. They strive to get to that level; and once they do, they relax when they hit that target.

There is a very little difference in talent between these two. The only real difference is that once has settled at $50,000 - while the other salesperson refuses to settle until he or she makes at least six figures.

**Reset Your Mind**

You can never earn more on the outside that you think you can earn on the inside.

If you see yourself as a $50,000 a year person, you will continually engage in behaviors that will keep your income at $50,000.

For example, a salesperson will set his/her goal for $50,000 a year. Once that salesperson hits that $50,000 mark, earlier than they were supposed to, the sales awkwardly dry up.

That salesperson, for some reason, can't get him or herself motivated to sell more until the end of the year. That salesperson spins his or her wheels until December 31. Then, on December 31st, they become phenomenal salespeople again.

In every case, it's your self-concept. This is actually quite common.

**Break Free Of The Past**

Some people think that it isn't possible to earn more than their parents. Time and time again, people plateau at a certain income level because that's the highest amount their parents have earned.

At an unconscious level, they have decided for themselves not to earn more than that amount. In turn, it becomes reality to them.
After You've Reset Your Mind: Change It
To increase your income, you must achieve these financial goals in your mind before you can ever achieve them in reality.

You aim should be to increase your level of you self-concept slowly, as a higher income earner.

Imagine yourself as already the person you want to be, already earning the kind of money you want to earn.

Look at other people making more money than you; then act exactly like them.

Imagine you are already financially independent, and the only reason you're making these sales is to meet new people.

This calm, collected, and confident self-concept will help you perform at your very best in the market.

**But, Be Realistic**

It is extremely important in developing this new self-concept realistically. When I first learned about the power of self-concept, I was earning $25,000 a year.

I immediately set a goal to make six figures the next year.

Instead of this goal motivating me, this was probably one of the biggest demotivators.

This was supposed for my mind to look the make that kind of money, my mind became extremely overwhelmed and down.

A goal that is vastly large - anything that you've never achieve for yourself, is ignored by your self-concept.

I finally realized my mistake, and set it for $50,000 a year. Guess what? I already hit my targeted goal in half a year.

A salesperson may start at the bottom, and work his way up over several years eventually making six figures.

But then, the economy goes south, the industry retracts, and he has to start out at a new company selling a different product.

How much do you think that salesperson made that following year?

Still well over six figures.

Why? Becuase this salesperson already has a self-concept of a six-figure salesperson. No matter what happens, this salesperson will find some kind of way to make six figures.

The fact is, once a salesperson is a millionaire, this is no reason to offer this salesperson anything less since they have proved to themselves that they can achieve a million dollars. It's all a matter of self-concept.

Another concept to learn, are the ""Key Result Areas"", or KRAs.

**Introduction To Key Result Areas (KRAs)**

KRA's are a strategic factor (either internal to the organization or external), where strong positive results must be realized for the long-term vision of success.

A good analogy used to represent these KRA's and how they work is like dialing a telephone. When you dial, each number you press (in this case, KRA's) is a specific KRA put in a sequence to ahold of another person.

In this case, you need to use specific KRA's in a specific sequence in order for the salesperson to make a sale.

**What Are The Seven KRA's?**

The seven KRA's include:

Prospecting
Building rapport
Identifying Needs
Presenting
Answering objections
Closing the sale
Getting both a resale and/or referral 


You self-concept in these seven areas, determine your success in sales as a salesperson.

Fortunately, everyone who is good at the areas was once poor at it. Every salesperson in the top 20%, started in the bottom 20%.

The good news is, if you can talk to people, you can perfect these seven skills. It simply a matter of learning and practice.

If you maintain a poor self-concept of any of these KRA's, you will avoid that specific key whenever you encounter it. The only reason you feel fear and anxiety when taking a specific action is that you are not good at it...yet.

You haven't mastered the skill.

If you are horrendous at a certain skill, you will be angry. It will be awkward. You will make mistakes. It will be normal and natural for you to avoid it.

**Master That Skill**

Your job is to master all seven skills as a salesperson. Fortunately, there are a lot more books, audio programs, courses, and advice available to you now to help you master each other these skills that will take you forever to learn 80 years ago.

There is absolutely no reason for you to be held back from achieving the top 10%, and the only reason you're held back is that you are weak in a particular area.

You can learn how to close the sale effectively. You also can learn how to present and build rapport effectively.

You can become skilled on how to ask questions - while listening carefully to the answers. Practice + repetition + consistency = success. 

You can become an expert and accurately be identifying the needs of your customers, by asking even more precise questions. You can answer the customer's objects so well; the objections disappear and never come up again.

These are all learnable skills.

**Get Better At What You Do**

The better you get you get at any of these given areas, the better your self-concept will be for yourself. The more confidence you have the ability to do it, the happier you will end up feeling when performing that specific activity.

You can, in fact, shape your sales personality. When has someone felt uneasy doing something that they weren't good at?

Every step you take to improve a specific area raises your self-concept - and your likelihood of success.

**Face Your Fears**

The first time you're trying to perform a sale as a salesperson, your heart is jumping out of your chest and into your throat.

Your heart is pounding so loudly you think your customers can hear it.

Psychologists say when you are afraid of performing something you've never done - this resembles the same feeling as if you were a child soon to get a spanking.

Your self-concept is not based on reality. your self-concept is based on the ideas about yourself, including the same limiting opinions/factors that hold most people back.

Fear and doubt have always been the greatest enemies of human potential. Many people doubt their ability to excel in a certain area. Even though it isn't true, it starts to become true.

Don't sell yourself so short.

Some people think they are absolutely terrible at closing sales. As long as you think that, you will then be forever terrible at closing sales. The fact is, closing is a normal and natural thing to end and close a sale.

**Challenge Your Self Limiting Beliefs**
 
The self-limiting beliefs you put upon yourself is based on idiotic information not based on any kind of facts or reality. These are very often illusions of your own mind.

Because they are unreal, you can easily get rid of them and replace them was new, positive beliefs of confidence and competence.

Self-limiting beliefs actually develop early and easily. When you try something new, like skating, you'll immediately conclude that you're not any good.

For then on, you will sabotage yourself - and soon you'll avoid that area altogether.

We feel as if people doing better than us...are actually better than us. If they are worth more than we are worthless. This is probably the biggest, a fundamental cause of unhappiness in our society.

A person who likes him or her self that has a high self-esteem probably has a positive self-concept about themselves.

When you really like yourself, you perform at your best. The more you like yourself, the more you like other people.

The more you like other people, the more they like you.

The more you like your customers, the more your customers like you. From this, the more willing they are to buy from you and recommend you to their friends.

High self-esteem people meet and marry other high self-esteem people. High self-esteem parents raise high self-esteem children.

High self- esteem bosses enforce high self-esteem employees. They then set higher standards for themselves, and practice higher levels of self-disciple. They are generally happier and more fulfilled than people who don't like themselves too much.

Low self-esteem salespeople who don't like themselves, don't really like other people either. As a result, they have a hard time building high-quality relationships with customers.

**You Are What You Think About**

Happy people think happy thoughts. Successful people think successful thoughts.

Wealthy people think wealthy thoughts. In addition, you become exactly what you say about yourself.

Successful people can control their inner dialogues. They can talk to themselves positively and confidently as they go through their day. 

Saying things like:

""I like myself."" 

""I am the shit.""

""I'm pretty amazing.""

""I'm a great salesperson.""

Will not only improve your self-esteem but actually cause you a chemical change in your brain. You release endorphins that will generally give you a feeling of confidence and well-being.

The more confident you feel, the more confident you perform.

I still repeat this at least 20 times a day until I drove the message deep into my subconscious mind and became locked in.

**The Best Time To Make A Sale**

The best time to make a sale is truly right after you've made a sale. After you've closed a deal - your self-esteem soars.

You feel terrific about yourself as a salesperson. You feel like a winner. You go ahead and talk to the next prospect feeling terrific about yourself, you will perform at a best.

This spike in sales performance is because your self-concept of yourself gone up.

As you sell more and more, you start to convince yourself that you are actually an excellent sales person. When your feeling terrific about yourself, you know you can do anything you can put your mind to.

You feel so good, you need less sleep. You have more enthusiasm. You have more energy. You feel more positive about yourself.

**There Are Only Two Obstacles To Sales Sucess**

There are two major obstacles when opening or closing any sales. This is also all mental. They are:

Fear of failure
Fear of rejection

The fear of failure is actually the biggest reason for failure in adult life. Not failure itself; but the fear of failure.

Fear of failure is actually created and rooted in our minds when we were young. The fear of failure usually stems from receiving destructive criticism from our parents.

If your parents were continually criticising you when you were growing up, then you are experiencing this deep, unconscious fear of failure as an adult - at least until you learn how to get rid of that fear.

The fear of rejection is that the potential buyer might say:

""No.""

The fear of rejection is triggered by the possibility of come across as rude or get criticism and/or disappointment by the potential buyer. The rule is; that 80% of sales approaches will end in a no - for a thousand different reason.

This does not mean there is anything inherently wrong with the product or the salesperson.

People sell ""No"", because they simply: do not need it; do not want it, cannot use it; cannot afford it, or some other reason.

If you're a salesperson and afraid of rejection; you've picked the wrong profession, my friend. Every experience of failure r rejection will affect your self-esteem.

It will hurt your self-image.

It will make you feel bad about yourself, and trigger your worst fear - that you're not good enough. Trust me, if humans were equipt without the fear of rejection, we would all be amazing salespeople. We would definitely all make so much more than we are making now.

Rejection is nothing personal. Great salespeople have built their self-esteem to a point where they no longer feel rejection.

If someone says no to them, it doesn't hurt them or put them off. It does not get them going back to hiding in their offices or cars.

Here is the key to dealing with rejection:

You must realize that rejection it is not personal. It has nothing to do with you. 
Just like it rains outside, or the sun comes up to shine. It just happens, day to day. Rejection is the sale concept.

When you can rise above yourself, and stop taking rejection so seriously, it will remove all fear you have for rejection.

When you get rejected, you'll shrug your shoulders, and immediately move on to the next prospect.

**Never Give Up**

it takes courage to get up every day and face your constant fear of rejection.

It takes courage to maintain the persistence, to come back day after day, in spite of all difficulties and disappointment.

The good news is, courage is a habit. Like a muscle, the more your practice courage, the stronger you become.

Eventually, you'll reach a point where you're virtually unafraid. After that, your sales career takes off.

**You Are Still A Good Person**

When a person says no to you, they are not saying it because of who you are. They are simply saying no to your product or presentation. Potentially your prices. The rejection itself is not personal.

Once you know and understand that saying no is nothing personal, you stop to worry about if someone were to react to your product negatively.

Heres the danger: If you take the no from a rejection of a sale personally, you start to think they are rejecting you as an individual.

When you begin thinking like this, you will soon become discouraged and lose your enthusiasm for selling.

When you organize yourself to make yourself a high self-esteem person with a positive self-concept about themselves, that alone will help contribute more to your income than any other factor.

Hopefully, this helps some of you guys.

167,79ok2p,False,Best Practices,93,"Over the years, I've hired over a hundred freelance contractors. Here are the 3 kinds of freelancers you want to AVOID.",Entrepreneur,"I run a business that depends very, very heavily on freelance contractors. They’re the lifeblood of my business. 

Finding and hiring talented (but affordable) professionals was instrumental in allowing me to scale my business up the way I did. I owe a lot to those guys -- I couldn’t have done it without them.

(If you’re wondering, I basically run a small digital publishing company that publishes on Kindle, iTunes, Nook, Kindle Paperback, ACX audiobooks etc. I outsource pretty much everything including writing, cover design, editing, marketing, and project management...everything)

**It took me a while to figure out what I was doing.** There are good workers out there, and there are bad workers.

And it’s not just a matter of skill.

There are people out there selling their services as “writers” or “designers,” who quite honestly have absolutely no business doing so.

When you post a gig on Upwork, you may find yourself absolutely inundated with shitty proposals from people who suck.

Sorry to be blunt about it, but it’s true.

**But believe it or not, the skill issue isn’t even the biggest problem you’ll run into.**

It’s not just a matter of being good at the job or not. You’ll also run into problems with things like honesty and reliability. And that’s really what can trip you up.

#There’s a Huge Freelance Marketplace Out There. I went through a lot of shitty freelancers before I learned to weed them out.

Upwork has its problems, for clients and for freelancers. But from experience, it’s still the most reliable and widely used bidding platform for this kind of thing. (quick history bit: it used to be oDesk but elance bought them and became upwork)

There’s other platforms too like freelancer.com, guru.com, microwokers, but I like upwork the most. 

I will point out that these platforms are *not* the only way to find freelance contractors. You can also use subreddits like /r/forhire, Fiverr, as well as other resources like 99Designs (for graphic design) and the Problogger job board (for copywriting and content writing).

You can also hire through LinkedIn but it’s a topic for different time because it requires a slightly different strategy. 

But honestly, if you’re on a budget and you’re new to all of this, I’d stick with Upwork at first. One of the biggest benefits, other than a sizable pool of potential candidates, is that **Upwork has an escrow system that protects both clients *and* freelancers.**

So if your writer flakes out, or your seemingly perfect graphic designer turns out to be a faker who swiped someone else’s portfolio to claim as their own, you’ll be able to avoid getting fleeced out of your money.

This also protects workers from not getting paid for their work. Well, at least in theory. For the most part, Upwork has better support for clients than for freelancers.

But if you’re hiring, that’s a good thing, at least for you.

This post is more about shitty freelancers to avoid, but I did want to give at least a quick rundown of how to write the kind of job post that attracts the good ones.

**Be as specific as you can, just in general.** Don’t be vague. Don’t worry. No one’s going to steal your idea. Seriously, they’re not. If they were the kind of people who’d even consider doing that -- much less be able to pull it off -- they wouldn’t be writing or designing for literal pennies on Upwork. Plus, being too vague comes across as unprofessional. This can be a deterrent for experienced freelancers.

**Be specific about your niche and topic.** This may matter more for some things than others. But if you’re having an ebook ghostwritten, you want someone who’s at least somewhat familiar with the subject matter. Tell applicants what it’s about, at least in a general sense. Is it about diet and weight loss? Self-help? The good old perennial “how to make money online” category? Someone who’s a world-class expert on ketogenic diets might not know shit about how to flip antiques on eBay.

**Figure out your budget, and state it up front.** Don’t leave it blank and wait for everyone to haggle their way to the bottom. Now, this approach might be worth considering if you’ve got a little budget to play around with. But look. If you’re willing to pay like $0.01/word for a 5k-10k word ebook, you need to realize that **prices literally don’t even go any lower than that.** If you’re already at the low end of the budget scale, you’re not going to get people to undercut each other even more. Not listing a budget is actually a deterrent for many experienced writers and designers. It comes across as unprofessional, and makes it obvious you don’t know what you’re doing. Just list the price you’re willing to pay. If you’re on a low budget, own it. Give some talented newcomer a shot at their first ever paying gig. 

**Ask for samples of their previous work.** Just about anyone should be able to show you something to prove they can do what you need them to do. Even someone who’s never been paid for writing or designing should be able to at least show you some spec work. 

I may do another post about this at some point that goes into more detail.

But basically, these guidelines can help you put together a good post that attracts good talent.

Well, for the most part. Again, you’ll get proposals that suck.

And sure, if you need a writer and the proposal’s in broken English, you can just toss that out and move on. 

But the contractors that can really, genuinely hurt your business usually make it past that point. They may even interview well. 

The problems don’t become apparent until later on.

#**The 3 Kinds of Bad Contractors That Can Seriously Ruin Your Business**

I’ve had my fair share of bad experiences, that’s for sure. And over time, I’ve run into enough of these situations that I’ve started noticing some patterns.

**Overall, there are 3 different “types” I’ve run into that cause trouble.**

The whole point of making this post is so if you’re new to hiring on Upwork, you’ll have a heads-up about what to keep an eye out for.

So, here they are.

**#1. The Disappearing Act**

Also known as “the flake.”

Their proposal caught your eye immediately. They were a league ahead of everyone else in the game.

The interview was perfect. 

You gave them a paid sample project first (always a good idea, by the way), and it was astounding. 

At what you’re paying, this guy is a steal. 

So you’ve got the money in escrow, he’s ready to start, everything’s good to go.

Then a few days later, with the due date coming up, you send them a quick email asking how it’s coming along.

You never hear from them again.

Eventually, you end up pulling your money out of escrow, scrapping the project, and posting again to find someone else.

Ideally, you won’t lose any money on this guy. But what you do lose is something even more precious: your time.

So what’s this guy’s deal? Why is he such a flake?

Honestly, there are a couple possibilities. **None of these are excuses.**

Depression, alcohol abuse, other mental illnesses. Major depressive disorder can fuck your shit up. None of these things excuse this disappearing act, but they are possible underlying issues. I’m not trying to make you sympathize with The Disappearing Act guy, just pointing out people don’t flake out like that randomly out of spite.
They’re a full time college student, or they have small kids, and they greatly overestimated how much free time they had available for your project. Again, this is not an excuse or anything. Just a potential factor.
They took on too much work at once and overloaded themselves, leading to smaller projects and lower-paying clients falling by the wayside. Again, not your fault, not an excuse, just a reason.
They’ve got performance anxiety. This usually ties into number 1, with some kind of substratum of depression or anxiety going on in there.

Those are just a few of the reasons this shit happens, but none of them are your problem. 

When it comes to The Disappearing Act, you want to have a zero tolerance policy for things like missed due dates or delayed communications. 

Regardless of what’s going on with them, your time and money are too valuable to put them at risk with someone who would waste them.

**How to Avoid The Disappearing Act**

So how do you make sure that great writer or designer you just hired isn’t a flake?

On Upwork, you can simply look at their previous history. 

Check their total hours logged.

As a rough guideline, when you're starting out, don't hire them unless they’ve logged over 100 hours total to reduce turnovers. 

Sure, you can get seasoned workers that are new to upwork that doesn't have many hours logged yet but it can be a homerun or a strikeout because they don't have their feedback at stake. 

When you get a bit more advanced, you can consider working with new workers because you'll know what to look for.  

Also, look a little more closely. What is their history like with long term clients they’ve had in the past?

I recommend going with workers who have worked with a past long term client for at least three months.

How are their ratings? Do they have good reviews?

If you’re not sure, move on to the next candidate.

**#2: The Time Waster**

This guy looks promising at first. Good portfolio, decent work history. So, you hire him.

Next thing you know, he’s blowing up your inbox 24/7 with questions, comments, clarifications, and apparently anything else that pops into his head.

Now, don’t get me wrong here. A few questions from your contractor is a good thing. Freelancers will sometimes need a clarification on something, and that’s fine. In fact, it can be a good thing. It’s a sign of professionalism. It means they take their work seriously.

But this guy takes it to the extreme. 

And yet, for all their many questions, they still end up delivering something that’s way off of what you wanted.

They usually mean well, but they end up costing more time and money than they’re worth.

**How to Avoid The Time Waster**

So how do you keep this from happening?

What I do, is I hold an initial voice call when I hire them. I record and document it. That way, I know what’s been covered, and what hasn’t.

But that’s really just an extra layer of precaution. **The best way to avoid The Time Waster is to only hire contractors who have handled similar jobs in the past.**

I’ve already mentioned looking for someone who understands your niche, but that’s just part of it.

You also want someone who’s done the same type of work before.

Let’s say you’re hiring a writer for an ebook about The Cabbage Soup Diet.

You definitely want someone who knows a thing or two about weight loss, nutrition, and things of that nature.

But you also want someone who has specifically written ebooks before. Someone could be a world class email sales copywriter, but not really quite have a handle on how to style and structure an ebook.

It’s its own format, with its own peculiarities. There’s more to writing a good ebook than just being a good writer in general.

So if you need an ebook, look for someone who does ebooks regularly. The same goes for blog posts, sales letters, logo design, or just about anything else.

**#3: The Fake**

They have impressive reviews. Their profile looks nice, very professional.

And their portfolio is perfect. It’s exactly what you’re looking for.

Sounds great, right? There’s just one problem.

**Everything about them is a lie.**

They scammed someone else into writing some content for them, for which they never paid. So voila, they have a portfolio filled with seemingly legitimate work.

That professional looking headshot? Also stolen. Run it through Google Reverse Image Search, and you’ll realize they stole it from some small town newspaper editor named Frances from Bumhole, Indiana.

You just hired The Fake. 

They may then metamorphose into The Disappearing Act.

But there’s an even more insidious possibility.

They might be, in turn, scamming someone else into doing the actual work for them.

Seriously, that happens. I’ve met writers with some horror stories about that. The Fake may be sourcing work on Upwork, or content mills, or wherever, then posting it as a client.

But either way, The Fake is probably the worst kind of shitty freelancer.

The others may just be kind of hapless, not ill intentioned. The Fake is a straight-up scam artist.

**How to Avoid The Fake**

How do you avoid scammers and fakers?

Hold a Skype call with them. Ask them to explain, in their own words, what your project entails.

You can pretty easily tell who’s a faker and who’s genuine, based on their answers.

#**There are some really crappy freelancers out there. But there are also plenty of gems. You just have to find them. And when you find them, keep them. They will make your life a WHOLE lot easier.**

Most freelancers are sincere, hardworking people with good time management skills and plenty of professionalism.

But by knowing the “warning signs,” you can save yourself a whole lot of headaches and frustrations by avoiding people who suck.

I hope this post was helpful, because hiring freelancers can be a total game changer for your business. It can be the key to scaling up and bringing in more money -- all while reducing the amount of work that you have to do yourself. Also, if you hire overseas, some of these guys will take care of work for you at pennies on the dollar of US workers. 

I hope they improve your business and quality of life as they did to mine. I wish you the best of luck!

132,4crxzx,False,,189,"I'm an SEO/Digital Marketing Consultant...I just helped take a client's eCommerce company from just 3 total sales, to nearly $100,00/mo revenue on a bootstrap budget - in less than 3 months. Here's a long-ass post with some takeaways & strategies I used to get there.",Entrepreneur,"**Warning: Long As Hell (but hopefully informative) Post Coming**


Howdy /r/entrepreneur…long time lurker here but I wanted to finally contribute something hopefully semi-useful. I recently helped one of my clients get his online mattress startup from 3 sales, to high 5 figures in revenue/mo, less than 3 full months into the project. Our growth is now on its way to million + $ year 1 revenue. I wanted to share some takeaways &amp; strategies that helped us succeed on a bootstrap budget in a highly competitive industry. Pre-apologies for the novel (I like to write) – but hopefully you can at least skim through.

For context -I'm a freelance ecommerce development consultant.  For 6 years prior to doing this, I was a full-time analyst/operations specialist for a Private Equity investment firm - where I learned a ton and got a lot of experience launching businesses from the investor/operator side.

A few months back, a college buddy approached me about a startup he recently launched with his fiance’s father. The company was called ""[The Dromma Bed](https://drommabed.com)"" - it was an online “Bed-in-a-Box” memory foam mattress company, similar to Casper. If you're not familiar with this industry...its been blowing up over the last year or so.  The idea is to sell a single high-quality bed design exclusively online, roll-pack it in a box, and ship it directly from the manufacturer to consumer. Cutting out the middle distributors and brick-&amp;-mortar markup allows them to sell much higher quality beds for a much lower price than regular mattress stores.  


When he initially approached me the company had only sold a few beds – all to friends &amp; family.  They had been paying another marketing company to run Google ads that didn’t produce any results after several months and several thousand dollars spent. So he asked me if I could help them overhaul their digital strategy. 


I was skeptical about accepting the project at first.  All they really had so far was the mattress design, contracted factories/sourcing channels, and a Wordpress eCommerce site. They were self-funded with a limited budget.  No big email list or social media following.

Aside from the limitations of the actual business – the competition within the mattress industry is fierce. Its typically thought of an unbreakable Oligopoly, dominated by just a few massive companies. Casper managed to break in with a disruptive business model and the advantage of being the first mover – but they had just secured $70 Million Dollars in VC funding. Several other early competitors with similar products had also secured big-money funding.  

 I honestly had no idea if we could find a large enough gap in the market for them to grow into -and I feared their product wasn’t unique enough to carve out their own niche. If there was no gap – there was no business. I didn’t want to waste my time on a project doomed from the start. 

However, after he explained to me more about the product and company, I could see there was actually something to it.

He told me about the extensive design process they went through with top industry experts.  Some of the big differentiators were that their bed had more advanced features, and used higher quality foams &amp; materials than their competitors. Their foams were eco friendly -> most of the competitors weren’t. . They offered multiple firmness levels, while their competitors only had one. And the most important thing of all to me was that he honestly believed their bed was far more comfortable than every similar bed out there they’d tested.

Aside from the product design, the company’s commitment to operating an ethical business model was a big brand differentiator in that industry.  A primary reason they started the company was to help support the manufacturing industry around their hometown in North Carolina – which had been decimated by Asian outsourcing. They made a pledge to source their product with 100% U.S.-made materials and use local production (Their hometown was fortunately home to some of the oldest foam-manufacturers in the country). They refused to budge on this even though it would have been cheaper to outsource. 

It wasn’t necessarily revolutionary … but they had a better product design than their competitors, a good story, and a strong set of company values. So I agreed to the project, and got to work.

My first order of business (after disabling the useless Adwords program from the other company), was tweaking the website – refining the copy and layout to reinforce the sales funnel. 

Once the website was updated, I planned out the first Facebook ad.  I set it up to run without any targeting initially. Within just a few hours, we had made our first online sale.  

That first month using only Facebook Ads as pretty much our only channel (with some small experiments in Adwords), we did ~$20,000. The second month, we added additional sales channels and reached high 5 figure revenue.  We’re currently well on track over $1 million year one revenue.

Here are some general advice/takeaways &amp; specific initiatives that lead to the success of this project (as well as others I've worked on) – which can be applied to other startups working on a bootstrap budget. 

-------------------------------**Marketing Strategy**-------------------------------------------------

**Our basic strategy was to focus on 2-3 paid channels, and do them well**:  We used 3 primary marketing channels to get to this point -  Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, &amp; Affiliate Marketing.  We decided to go with the channels we knew best, and put all of our effort into optimizing them rather than spread ourselves too thin. We spent very little effort on any organic social media (which I explain a bit farther down).  Now that we know what works, we’ve recently been expanding into new channels. 

**Facebook Ads:**  Facebook Ads have been our primary bread and butter. The first month we spent a couple thousand $ on testing various campaigns, then narrowed it down to just 2 of the top performing ads – and let them run continuously.  We found our most successful conversions actually came from keeping the targeting fairly broad – as our market is fairly spread-out and undefined. The key here was using a compelling image –and compelling ad copy. 

Other than running some promotion-specific variations on occasion and some minor tweaks, we really haven't changed our original performing ad creative much at all. If it aint broke, why fix it?

**Adwords - Bid on Competitor’s Search Terms!:** SERP space for the primary keywords around the mattress industry was insanely competitive – resulting in extremely high CPC for prime positioning (I'm talking $15+ per click!). That is why the original marketing company's campaigns weren't getting any results. 

We were most successful running our ads on the brand keywords of mid-level competitors - and creating customized landing pages directly comparing our beds to that competitor's beds.  This allowed us to get way more bang for our advertising buck. We let our better-funded competitors spend the money to get people to perform a search...then all we needed to do is convince those people that our bed is better. Using customized landing pages for each ad resulted in far more conversions than homepage URL ads.

**Affiliate Marketing**:**  Our first sales were the toughest to get because people obviously wanted to see reviews from other customers before they purchased an $800 bed. We found there are tons of blogs and mattress review sites out there who would post a review of our mattress for free, and also post an affiliate link on their site to drive customers to our store. The only up front cost was the cost of a bed…and it more than pays off in every case.  We’ve also been experimenting with the Share-A-Sale platform to manage a larger scale affiliate program…this channel takes a lot of effort to manage, but we’ve seen moderate success with it.

**Public Relations…Don’t Discount the Value of Local PR!**:  From the beginning I knew press write-ups from big publications would be very hard to get as a late-entry company.  So rather than wasting time pandering to mainstream content producers – we put some effort into reaching out to smaller newspapers &amp; magazines.  Articles we had run in tiny local newspapers regularly resulted in several thousand dollars in sales. Valuable lesson here…don’t neglect local PR!

**Refer-a-friend program**:  We implemented a friend referral program last month, and have seen decent results. There is no better marketing than word-of-mouth.  The good thing about these programs is they’re incredibly easy to set up with pre-built software solutions. And once you set it up, you can let it run and more or less forget it (aside from the occasional maintenance). Downside is that its a rather unpredictable as a sales channel.  Our program offers: “refer a frien dand they get a $75 discount, you get $50 cash”.  Obviously our margins/price point were high enough to support those numbers,  but I’ve implemented refer-a-friend campaigns with rewards as small as $5. 

**Takeaway**:  The number of options for attracting users to your site can be overwhelming. Don’t waste your time trying to implement every new marketing gimmick or technology that pops up…even if everybody says ‘it’s the next big thing”. In the early stages if you spread your brain power and marketing dollars too thin across too many channels, none of them will perform. 


---------------------------------------------------------**General Advice**--------------------------------------------------------

**Set a Realistic Marketing Budget**

Some people working on their first ecommerce businesses dramatically underestimate the budget they need for digital marketing.  Your budget should be directly correlated to your targeted revenue-especially in the early stages. You can’t go into it assuming your marketing campaign will net 300-400% ROI.  Adwords reports that their average campaign nets about $2 Revenue : $1 Spend – and that’s  highly variable.   That means if you need to make $10,000 in revenue on a campaign, the minimum you should plan to spend is $5,000…and you should budget even more for wiggle room.


**Never give up your core values  for the bottom line**
When I first heard the founders were only open to sourcing locally– I admired their integrity, but the Private Equity guy in me winced.  In the PE industry, dealing with other people’s money … everything is about the bottom line. 

But during the course of this project and others I’ve worked on, I’ve seen that the companies' commitment to values has been one of the biggest things that strengthen the brand, and actually ends up driving conversions. Customers really do appreciate things like local sourcing, and knowing we use safe, eco-friendly materials - and sometimes thats the difference between buying from us and a better-known competitor. Sticking to your guns on ethical business practices might sometimes cost you slightly more money in the short term, but you'll end up benefiting with a better performing brand in the long run.

**You don’t need to dump a ton money on your website pre-launch**

For an ecommerce company, your website needs to be decent. But if you’re on a budget – it doesn’t need to win a webby award for you to start driving revenue.  The most important thing about your site is good copy, an efficient checkout process, and making sure you have a strong sales funnel. Don’t waste too much time trying to implement every bell and whistle at first.

The Dromma site is extremely basic, and certainly not the prettiest, but it got us to where we needed so far. Now we’re planning to upgrade to a better site as we have more capital to do so.

**Real consumer behavior trumps a good sales pitch**

Most of our competitors were running on the business model &amp; sales pitch of selling “One bed suits all”. They offered one bed design, with no customization options.   However, the actual researched we did showed that one bed doesn’t suit all – real people have preferences in firmness. Selling “one perfect mattress” is a great sales pitch, but it didn’t match consumer buying habits. 
We found that many customers from our competitors were returning beds because they were too soft or too hard – they were bouncing around to multiple companies trying to find the exact right fit.   So one of the biggest competitive advantages we’ve capitalized on is offering multiple firmness levels. If the first bed a customer tries doesn’t work, we swap it out for the other free of charge.

Takeaway: make sure your sales pitch matches with actual consumer behavior. Don’t just go off “gut instinct” what you think people want to hear…go off what they actually want to buy &amp; use.

**If something isn’t working, cut your losses as soon as possible**

At one point we tried migrating from Wordpress to Shopify. We put a significant amount of time and effort into getting it going. But once we launched, we found an unforeseen problem with it that would take a lot of time &amp; money to fix. Rather than letting our pride get the best of us and stubbornly pushing forward, we cut our losses, and reverted back to the original system. It was disappointing, but we didn’t waste any more time or money than need be. 

Takeaway: If something isn’t working out, cut your losses sooner than later. Don’t try to force something to work just because you’ve put  a lot of effort into it.

**Don’t get lost in targeting (at first)**

When we first launched we had expectations about our primary demographic. Based on our research, we expected our primary market to be young millennials who are  more likely to buy something from a new industry. However, I still decided to run our ads with very broad targeting with no age limits so we could see how the older demos in their mid 30s to late 50s were buying beds. What we found was that those older demos were far more likely to convert than early Millennials. We wouldn’t have discovered this if we only targeted based on our initial expectations.

Takeaway: Do your initial demographic research, but unless you have a very niche product, don’t target your ads too narrowly until you 100% confirm that’s who will be most interested in your product.  

**Good Copy Is Essential**
I managed to start driving initial sales just by making some adjustments to the on-site copy.  We’ve also seen measureable improvements in conversion rates from just making minor text tweaks.
The most common issue I come across with ecommerce startups is that they launch their website with extremely shoddy copy. A lot of these guys are great entrepreneurs – but terrible sales copy writers.

Takeaway: Copy is king – you won’t see nearly the sales you could if its not up to snuff.  Don’t be afraid to get outside help to write for you.

**Traditional Organic Social Media is nearly dead – don’t waste too much time on it**

We spent very little time with organic social. And until we get enough of - its not a priority for us.  
Facebook essentially killed traditional social media marketing when they updated their algorithm to drastically limit organic reach potential to 1-2 percent of your audience.  However, many companies are still dumping countless man-hours trying to grow their pages and get that “free traffic”. Unfortunately, no matter how much time &amp; effort they put into it – most will not see the results they want. Twitter is hit or miss. And Instagram is great for awareness in certain niches – but its extremely hard to drive actual conversions from.

Takeaway: Don’t waste too much time on organic social unless it’s essential for your niche.
 
**SEO is a long term play that won't drive immediate sales – especially in a heavily competitive industry**

I’m saying this as an experienced SEO consultant. Organic search is a slow-growth channel – I don’t care how much link-building you do or structured data you enter - if you’re in a competitive industry with well established companies, you will have a difficult time ranking for many of the primary keywords that will drive sales right off the bat. You should focus more on the secondary keywords that are easiest to obtain. We'll shift our focus to SEO once we get some breathing room.

With limited resources, your immediate initial focus with SEO should be making sure your site is solid from a technical standpoint, ensuring that you rank for your own brand keywords names – and making sure your website displays properly on the SERP.  Be aware of the keywords you want to rank for over time, generate content when you can, and optimize as much as you can…but you don’t need put too much work into it in the very early stages until you have the resources to do so.

**Product First, Brand Second**

The success of many of our competitors came from riding on the initial wave of being a “cool new online company” in a trendy industry. But they were so focused on building a “sexy brand” as quickly as possible – they didn’t care enough about the actual product they were selling. That’s why now, many of the competitor’s sales trends are flattening out, while ours continue to grow.  

We have been successful because the founders put so much effort into creating a great product. That has lead to many happy customers and subsequently many word-of-mouth referral sales.  Great brands can be toppled by selling shitty products. Always make sure you’re putting the thing you’re selling ahead of the brand that’s selling it.

**Ignore the competition when setting your initial goals**
This is an important one. We get inundated by the media with these huge startup success stories, and feel our own smaller accomplishments are inadequate in comparison. . My advice is this - Ignore the competition’s achievements, focus on your own realistic goals.

 Casper had done $30 Million in sales their first year. Our next biggest competitor did $15 Million.  But we were in a different position than those companies - and I knew if we had gone in trying to emulate those numbers, we were setting ourselves up for failure. So one of the first things I did was talk to the founders about realistic expectations for revenue.  We agreed: Coming from 0 sales, If we could get to the point where we were selling 1-2 bed per day, we would consider it a big success. Planning around an achievable goal allowed us to better focus our marketing dollars, and scale the business in a controlled fashion. 

**You Don’t Have To Be A First Mover To Be Successful – Especially if you’re on a tight budget**

So many would-be entrepreneurs (myself included) have been dissuaded from pursuing a great idea when they realize it’s already been done before. But ask yourself this – how many pure monopolies still exist out there?  As a startup on a limited budget, you’re much more likely to be successful coming “fashionably late to the party”.

Our ability to break into the market quickly was the result of our ability to research our competitors, and improve on their strategies and product offerings. We could see how customers responded to their products, what worked, and what didn’t.  

Being the first mover certainly has its advantages. It’s also thought of as ""sexier"" and more exciting than coming late into a trending market.  But being first is generally much riskier and much more expensive.  They have to make all the mistakes themselves…and also spend the money &amp; effort to grow a market from scratch.

Be aware of your competition – but don’t let it scare you off entirely.

**Your Product Differentiation Doesn’t Have To Be Revolutionary To Succeed!**

 Following up with the previous point, your idea doesn't have to be some sort of revolutionary breakthrough for your business to do well. There are actually many advantages to launching a business with already proven and tested products &amp; technologies.

For Dromma, most of the features in the bed can be found on other beds out there – but none of the competitors offered all of those features in a single design.  The technologies have been around for a long time – we just figured out how to apply them in a new way. That approach is far less risky than trying to launch something new and untested.  

The founders also made sure Dromma was more comfortable, and used the highest quality materials possible.  Along with the strong values, that was enough.  They didn’t drain all of their resources trying to re-invent the wheel.


Anyway, I’m super excited about the success of this project, and where we're going to grow from here. Just hope everybody here realizes that success is possible in almost any industry, even on a limited budget.

I’ll leave it there for now. If you have any questions about anything specific, feel free to ama and I’ll try to help you out.

**Edit** Thanks for all of the kind words and great advice/question as! I'm going to try to get back to everyone asap, just give me a bit!   I'm well aware there is still plenty left to do on the site &amp; lots of great marketing opportunities to explore, so all of your suggestions are definitely appreciated.

237,a3zhw6,False,,86,The template I use to write FB ads that tend to get clicks/sales,Entrepreneur,"I audit a lot of Facebook ads accounts, which means I get to see what works and what doesn’t across loads of different industries, countries and ad types.  


By far, the most common area for ‘big potential improvements’ is the copy in their ads.  


***For example*** \- I took on a Gym as a client in the summer who had never managed to make Facebook ads work, despite having all the ‘assets’ in place (nice website, big social following, loads of photos & videos, a good facility, great reviews, admin team to handle leads efficiently…).  


We had a short timeline to get ads out, so all I did was re-use their existing visuals, package up one of their popular classes in a new way, and write new copy.  


That campaign brought in around 120 leads in 3 weeks for under £4 a lead, and then we had to shut it down because the classes were full.  


Here are the most common mistakes that I’ve seen in the accounts I’ve audited this last few months, and then the fairly simple way that I approach writing a new advert.  


*\*Note, I’m not a professional copywriter, I have hired a few great copy guys in my time, who’s ads generally do outperform mine, but what I’ve learnt to do is like the 80/20, 80% of the results for 20% of the time/ money invested.*  
*Most common mistakes:*  


1. **Talking about yourself, not the reader -**   
This is what the gym above were doing, and it’s something that most local businesses do too much“We’ve been operating for 30 years” “We care about our clients” “We are passionate and experience” - your reader just does not care about all that, what they want to know is what’s in it for THEM.  

2. **Not testing variations -**   
Often business owners will latch onto one phrase/headline that seems to work, and just use that for every ad.   
That’s understandable, because they don’t have the time to give FB ads the amount of attention required to do proper testing, but it is a waste.  
An commerce client was spending £300 a day on ads, and they were the primary driver of his sales, but he was relying on just one phrase, and as soon as we tested some other headlines, we found variations that outperformed his.  

3. **Dry copy -**   
This is VERY common in B2B - for example, a business I audited who helped graphic designers build website without having to deal with web developers, they wanted to look professional, or like a bigger business, and so they got all corporate, but the person reading your ad IS A PERSON, and their boring ads weren’t persuading them to do anything.  

4. **Not qualifying the reader -**   
When people are scrolling their news feed, 90% of the time, it’s the visual that gets attention, then the reader is going to scan the ad to see if it’s worth another single second of their day.   
What they’re looking for is relevance -so make it easy for them.A good friend of mine runs a course on investing in property, and this was something he was missing out on.Just starting his ads with a phrase like “For people who’ve wondered how to actually make money from property” helped people self-qualify, and increased clicks immediately.  

5. **No Call To Action -**   
If you want people to sign up with you, then you’ve got to take people by the hand and walk them through each step of the way.   
This was the case for a meditation coach I audited, her ads were interesting and engaging, but because she wasn’t telling people exactly what to do next i.e. “Click the button to download it now” or “Hit Learn More and fill in the quick form, one of our team will then call you to arrange an intro session” she was missing out on a lot of clicks.  

6. **Features over Benefits -**   
This is such a big one, and a current SEO agency client were guilty of it.   
They would talk about the technical aspects of SEO and what was included in the services, rather than what that would actually mean for the client (more traffic, more leads, more clients, more money)  

7. **Not telling stories -**   
Us human-folk like a story. It’s fundamental to our society as a race that was pass on information through stories.   
Yet many businesses are hesitant to use them.I audited a driving instructor instructor (he taught people how to become an instructor), and he had the potential for great stories “Bob was bored of office life and hated the rigid hours of his corporate job, but after he qualified with me, he’s now in charge of his working hours and doesn’t answer to anyone but his wife""  


**So HOW DO YOU WRITE ADS?**

  
Copywriting is a thing that people spend decades trying to master, so don’t worry about emulating the pros, and instead keep it simple and follow a few rules.   


It’s not about writing award winning ad copy, it’s about being able to come up with a functional group of words that connect with the reader and get them to take action  


**My favourite ‘template' for quickly writing ad copy (or any copy) is the 4 why’s:** 

*(This I learnt from the wonderful Colin Theriot, who runs a FB group called the Cult of Copy)*  


Answer these questions (in order) that the reader is asking in their heads.

1. Why me? (How do I know that this is for ME specifically?)
2. Why you? (Who the fuck are YOU? Why are you the person telling me this?)
3. Why this? (Why is THIS AD/OFFER relevant and interesting to me and my set of circumstances?)
4. Why now? (Why do I need to pay attention/ take action RIGHT NOW? Can I ignore this until later?) 

  
That is going to cover your bases.  
From there, here are some specific tips to help add a bit of shine.

* Make sure you have a VERY clear avatar defined. If you don’t know who you’re talking to, it will come through in your copy.
* One problem, one solution - focus on one thing per ad, don’t try to sell 8 different things.
* Use testimonials wherever you can, they make easy, meaningful stories to tell.
* Speak naturally - read the ad out loud and make sure it doesn’t sound clanky or awkward.
* Avoid big blocks of text and break up your ad into different sentence/paragraph lengths.
* If you run a local business, then start your ad with the name of the place - i.e. “BRISTOL pet owners…""
* Get someone else to read the ad and ask them if it makes sense, it’s easy to get lost in the finer details and end up with something that doesn’t actually communicate what you want it to, or explain the offer properly.
* And finally, read back every sentence of you ad, and ask yourself “So What?” This will help keep you on track and avoid waffling on.

248,9q5oxg,False,,133,Step by Step Guide on How to Manufacture Products in China,Entrepreneur,"I have written this tutorial on my [blog](http://garlicpressseller.com). But I figured loads of people on here source, or are planning to source from China as well. So hopefully this will be helpful for loads of people. These are the steps I take when I want to manufacture a new product from China. There are loads of different ways of course, but this is simply how I do it.

&#x200B;

If this is the first time you manufacture a product in China, this process might seems very scary. And you have all the right to be! You are pretty much handing a huge sum of money to someone in China to produce the product you want! A lot of things that can go wrong! However, once you have done it a couple of times, you will realise it is actually quite easy.

# 1). Contacting Suppliers

The main website to find Chinese suppliers is: [Alibaba.com](https://www.alibaba.com/)You simply search for the product you want to manufacture and you will find loads of suppliers that will manufacture this product for you!

I am a big fan of the “shotgun approach”. This means you send out the same standard email to as many suppliers as possible. With this email you want to ask some basic questions, and reach as many potential suppliers as possible. I simply copy & paste 1 email template and send them to as many suppliers on Alibaba as I can find. Below you can check out the template I use.

>*Hi, I am looking to manufacture product X. I have attached a picture as a reference.*  
>  
>*Specifications:*\- *Color: x– Size: x– Material: xCan you manufacture this product?Do you have similar products?Can you send your catalog if you have one.What is the lead time?What is the FOB price for x amount of units?Can I customise the product by adding my logo on it?How is the product currently packaged?Thank you and have a nice day,<Name>*

Based on these reactions you can already make your first selection. Some suppliers will reply very late, or some won’t even reply at all. Some will reply with very high price. To those suppliers I simply reply that I have received better prices, and if they want to be considered as my supplier they should lower their prices. Once I have received all replies, I usually compile all suppliers in a spread sheet to make things easy to compare.

## 2). Samples

Based on the reactions from the suppliers I have gathered above, I can select the top suppliers and request samples from them. Now I don’t request samples from just one supplier, I usually request samples from the top 5 suppliers. This gives me options to pick the best suppliers based on the sample quality and negotiate prices between them.

Normally the sample cost is free and you only have to pay for shipping. Now if you have to pay shipping to your home country for each sample your order ( x5 ) this can add up quickly. That is why I always have them ship all my samples to 1 address in China ( which is usually free, as shipping within China is very cheap ), then I combine all the shipments there, and ship it as 1 package. This way I can save massively on shipping. There are a couple of companies who provide this service, but I use Tip Trans

# 3). Negotiating price

Now before we even start talking about the price we have to know about Incoterms:

## Incoterms: FOB vs EXW

If you start dealing with Alibaba suppliers and discussing the price you will run into Incoterms. Incoterms define how you goods are transported and when the ownership of the goods are transferred. There are a lot more Incoterms, and the most common ones you will run into are: FOB & EXW.

**FOB: Free On Board**

This means the supplier will delivery the goods from their warehouse to the port and load them on your freight forwarders ship.

**EXW: Ex Works**

Ex works simply means the supplier will manufacture the goods and have them ready for pick at their factory.

So the very important difference between these Incoterms is that when you request your supplier a FOB quote: The supplier will pay shipping from their factory to the port. And when you request a EXW quote, your forwarder will have to pick up the goods at the factory ( resulting in a higher fee from the forwarder ).

So now that we know about Incoterms we can start negotiating about the price! Once we have received our samples, I pick the best ones. I make a top three of the best suppliers ( based on quality & price) , and negotiate between them. A very good negotiating tactic that I have learned is simply to tell them you have a better offer from another supplier. Even if this is not the case, I can always skim a little bit of the price with a simple email like:

>*Thank you for quote, I really like your product. However, my boss demands I get the lowest price as possible. And we have received a price $1,3 from supplier x. Since this is lower than your quote my boss wants to go with supplier X. Please let me know if we can negotiate the price, else I am afraid we have to go with supplier X*

You will find out that you can negotiate a lot with Chinese suppliers, and I personally think this is a very interesting game. Now after going back and forward with my top suppliers, I pick the best one based on price & product quality.

# 4). Payment & Production

In order for the supplier to start with the production it will usually require some sort of a deposit. From my experience it is normal to pay 30% upfront, and 70% once the production is finished. This will also be referred to as 30/70 tt.

&#x200B;

# 5). Quality control

I ALWAYS have my production process inspected by a 3rd party. It doesn’t matter if I have been ordering from them for a couple of years, I always check the quality of the product while it is still in the factory! If you do a bit of research you will find plenty of horror stories about people who received a great quality sample, have the supplier produce their product, and then get ripped of by their supplier who produces a sub-par product. I had this happen myself as well, and I can tell you right now: If you find out in the USA you have a bad quality product it is too late!

I personally use an inspection company in China. I let them schedule a date with the supplier when almost all the products are done. They go to the factory, take out a sample size of the production and inspect every detail of it.They send me the report on the same day with pictures and all the details. They also highlight any possible defects the shipment might have. Once I have received the quality control report and approved this, I can pay the remaining 70%.

# 6). Shipping

You will have a couple of options when shipping your products from China to the USA. Each option has it’s own advantages and I will cover each one:

**Ocean**

\- Slow: Average shipping time 30 days

\+ Cheap!

**Air**

\+ Fast, average 7 day shipping

\- More expensive than ocean shipping

**Air Express**

Air express is pretty much a faster and more expensive version of Air shipping. Air express will be the services such as DHL & UPS. They will charge you an extremely high rate, however you product will arrive very quickly. I also believe that import duties are already included in the price with Air Express. However, you should double check that as I have not shipped with air express for a while.

My choice I ship 90% of my products by ocean. This is simply the most cost effective way of shipping your products. There are a couple of occasions when I prefer to ship my goods via Air:

– **Quick restock**: If I am doing my stock forecast and notice I will run out of stock before I am able to restock with ocean shipping. In this case I will gladly ship by Air or even Air express as you never want to run out of stock .

– **Quick launch**: If I am really excited about a product, and want to launch it as quickly as possible. In this case I will ship a couple of carton by Air Express that I will use to get started with promo's & photography.

275,9altw3,False,,231,"No education, was almost homeless, battled depression; now Co-founder of 2 nearly 7 figure annual businesses with only 3 employees. If I can do it, so can you!",Entrepreneur,"Was thinking through my entrepreneurial journey last night and felt compelled to share this in case it may help some budding entrepreneur somewhere. I feel incredibly blessed in seeing how far I’ve come in my life and hope this would encourage others. 

To start things off, I have no degree (other than a High school diploma) and about 10 years ago I was nearly homeless making between $200-$400/month. If I had no family in the area with whom I could live, I would have been homeless, so I’m thankful every day for them. 

I have been a lifelong entrepreneur but never really realized it until about 10 years ago. When I was 5 I would take drawings I made to the grocery store with my mom and ‘sell’ them to grandmas for 5 or 10 cents. I had a great pitch, I’d ask if they wanted the drawing, they would of course say yes, to which I would reply, “that will be 5 cents,” or 10 cents or whatever I felt like charging at the time. Ran paper routes, shoveled snow from driveways, and mowed lawns for extra money throughout Jr. High and High School. All this to say, I always wanted to do my own thing, start my own business but never knew how. 

8 years ago I started a web design & development company with a friend, when I knew literally nothing about web dev. Like nothing. We sold websites for $100 per page but we didn’t ask what the pages needed to be or do or anything. We were so dumb. 

After about 6 months of that I got hired at a web development and marketing firm as a project manager. Turns out I’m a really (really really) shitty project manager but I’m great at sales. Was promoted to director of channel sales in 1 year. 1 year after that I was fired. Long story with that but in short my inner entrepreneur was dying and I needed out, the management saw that and fired me.

That put me in a period of depression for about 2 years because I felt like a massive failure. I had helped build that company from 12 employees to over 100 in 2 years, and being fired really, really hurt. I then bounced around jobs for awhile, wanting to start my own thing but again, was depressed & felt like a failure. As anyone who has (or does) deal with depression knows, finding motivation to do anything is insanely hard- when it feels like waking up and getting out of bed is an accomplishment, reaching to start a business seems like walking on water. 

4.5 years ago I started my own web dev & marketing agency with a friend mainly because at that web dev & marketing firm I was fired from a few years prior I had done an good job of networking in the local community and I was known as the guy to talk to when it came to web development and digital marketing. We actually did ok, made some money, and through this I started to realize I wasn’t as big of a failure I thought I was. More importantly I began to learn a bit about running my own company and how much work that took. We weren’t doing super well tho, I had to work nights waiting tables to barely pay the bills. 

3 years ago I started a baby brand with my wife and launched our products on Amazon. This was a HUGE leap for us. Started the whole business on credit while trying to start my web dev/marketing agency and working nights as a waiter. Day 1 we had 9 sales. 9. Whole. Sales. May not sound like a lot but those 9 sales were from perfect strangers and it was so much more validating than anything to date. 

Things slowly progressed and 2 years ago I stopped the web dev company and quit working as a waiter cos I was making about $25k/month online in the business I started with my wife (to date the best month we had in the web dev company was $9k).

Along the way I have learned a lot more about marketing and getting good press and have been invited to speak all over the US and internationally. Sometimes I even get paid to speak, which is crazy and cool. So far this year in that eComm business I started 3 years ago I’ve grossed almost $480k, up 40% over my sales last year over the same time period. 

In May this year I started another business online with two partners I met through eComm and speaking and so far we’ve made $170k in that new business (in 3 months!), plus as a result of that I’ve been offered to consult for a company starting at $10k/month. 

All this to say- if you bet on yourself, are a perpetual self-educator, and learn how to develop and sell solutions to problems that people have you’ll do far better than you ever will if you work for someone else. That and if you are in a shitty season of life and battle depression like I have, you can do it. 

I wouldn’t say I’ve arrived but I would say I’m at a more pleasant spot in my journey than I was 10 years ago. 

TL:DR- I went from literally nothing, battled through depression and now am a Co-Founder of two successful 6 (nearly 7) figure businesses. You can do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9altw3/no_education_was_almost_homeless_battled/,788,"This is great man. I have one question, what is meant by “a baby brand”?

I was the first to hit the market and I was the first to acquire the majority of available shelf space in the US. It was a hemp product. I sold the business a few years ago and have been living comfortably ever since, but it wasn’t enough to retire.

Recently, my loved one(s) are irking me to move. Their urgency and my financial situation meant I had to get a job, which means I might feel like killing myself.. so I took a step back, and I rolled 10 joints, and I sat on my back porch for 36 hours. I didn’t use the bathroom, eat, or even stand. I smoked weed, started into the tree line, and thought about how I could solve the problem of wanting to be near my family without selling my soul to an employer. 

After a well earned sleep, I woke up and began working. I worked for 75 hours straight 😂 I built a new website. A few hours a day I worked on the website and nothing to big happened with it until a few of my content pieces went viral. I built this website for about 45 days before I started to make money from it.

The website is a niche that reports news pertaining to products like I used to sell. 

I built the website user base to over 100,000 monthly users, and as long as my traffic remains the same, and the law doesn’t change too much, I have enough advertising contracts to comfortably last me the rest of my life.

I closed a sponsorship deal with a company that equates to over 6 figures of income annually by itself. After the meeting, I went back to the same spot on my back porch with a single celebratory joint, and I cried before I lit it.

520,2qpxz4,False,,142,The 5 books I read before starting a profitable business that replaced my day job.,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

A little over a year ago I started a new business and saw some pretty incredible growth, allowing me to quit my day job, travel, work from anywhere I pleased, and feel great about the work I do every single day.  I imagine many people are thinking about starting a business as a New Year’s resolution, and I thought it might be a good time to share some light reading that I felt was key to my early planning stages.  For veterans of this forum you likely won’t see anything new, but I hope this will help a few people along the way.  For reference, my business is called Executive Drafts, a career consulting and resume writing company based out of Austin, Texas.  (www.ExecutiveDrafts.com)

Here’s my recommended reading list, arranged in the order I think they’d be most useful to someone starting out.

**The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime**

Excellent book, cheesy title.  A perfect “first book”, this really helped me to understand my own definition of “rich”, what my actual goals were, and whether or not I knew the steps involved in getting there.  It offered excellent insight into evaluating the potential of a business, understanding what I wanted to avoid (shipping physical goods, and hiring dedicated employees were two things I wanted to avoid if possible).  This got the wheels turning.  Instead of saying “I like X, I think I’ll make a business out of it!”, I started actively evaluating and formulating business ideas.

**The 4-hour Workweek**

Very well-known, this book is an absolute must read if you want to learn how to have ""full time"" pay on a part time schedule. It has so many potential uses. The author used it to travel the world and streamline his businesses to require as little hands-on time as possible. I used it to create a six figure business working 8 hours a week DURING my 40-hour work week. I firmly believe my happiness depends on working between 10-20 hours a week while enjoying life, traveling, and spending time with family.  This book was monumental in showing both practical ways of accomplishing this, and theoretical ways of approaching career decisions.

**The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups**

Y combinator is a famous startup incubator that helped launch companies like Dropbox and Airbnb. It's heavily geared towards software (which is where I want to build my next business) and is a superb""documentary"" that follows several companies inside a single class of Ycom. Awesome for watching how the young hot tech startups are operating, what their failures were, and giving you insight into the way venture capitalists think. A must read if you find yourself dreaming of being the next big thing. Educational AND entertaining.

**The Lean Startup**

This is sort of the bible for new business ventures. Regardless of the business you build, this will teach you the mindset of creating quick ""minimum viable products"" and using the feedback loop to quickly change your product based on user input. The theory is practically accepted as truth nowadays, since so many new businesses operate under this methodology. It gets you out of the mindset of ""I want the product to be perfect before launching it to the world!"" and into ""lets make something that barely works then let users tell us how to build the rest"".

**Rework**

A really interesting read into corporate counterculture. This company hates meetings and other time-wasters, and offers tons of eclectic/strange but work-changing practices that keep people productive. It makes fun of the typical hour-long meeting, and dives into the practices of a company that operates with primarily remote employees. An excellent foray into efficiency in the startup workplace.

Hey all,

&nbsp;

Happy New Year! My [last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3n8w60/from_2k_to_3k_per_month_blogging_income_report/) was about growing a blog from $2k to $3k per month.

&nbsp;

In that post, I estimated 2015 revenue:

&nbsp;

> Projecting out, I estimate the site will generate around $33,500 this year.

&nbsp;

I'm happy to report that this estimate was surpassed. Total revenue for 2015 was $36,566.

&nbsp;

I've been writing [quarterly income reports](http://www.themodestman.com/category/resources/income-reports/) on my blog, and I just finished a full [2015 year in review](http://www.themodestman.com/2015-review/), but I'll give you the breakdown here in this post:

&nbsp;

Q1: $5,832

Q2: $7,905

Q3: $8,964

Q4: $13,866

&nbsp;

Why was Q4 so high? Well, especially in this industry (menswear/fashion/retail), advertisers spend way more money during the Q4 holiday season.

&nbsp;

This means everything from affiliate revenue to banner ads to sponsorships was up. Sponsored posts were a huge part of the business during this part of the year.

&nbsp;

I also formed a couple of key partnerships that have been really successful, most notably with a company called [AdThrive](http://www.adthrive.com/).

&nbsp;

The handle all of the automatically served media (banner/video) ads on my site, using a combination of different ad networks (AdSense, etc.).

&nbsp;

With their help, the site's advertising **RPM has more than tripled** (to just over $5).

&nbsp;

*If you have unsold ad inventory, or are willing to put additional ad placements on your site, I highly recommend checking out AdThrive.*

&nbsp;

I'm not an affiliate or employee, just a fan of their service.

&nbsp;

Traffic was also up from 2014 - it more than doubled (up 118%), and it's almost all organic.

&nbsp;

This is due to making sure basic on-page SEO is done correctly for every single post. It's really simple stuff, but so many bloggers ignore it - especially when it comes to writing titles for blog posts.

&nbsp;

If you follow [this guide](http://backlinko.com/on-page-seo), you'll be way ahead of most bloggers.

&nbsp;

*Side note: I've learned that I have no idea which content will do well, and which content won't. The top three posts of 2015 were completely unrelated. The only unifying theme was that they all did well in search. Even seasoned bloggers tell me that they're still just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.*

I'm hoping to double traffic again in 2016, and increase revenue to a consistent $10k/month.

I also want to grow [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbfoD1o7sV0VxErpxTCpyw), which only has about 1,200 subscribers right now. I just haven't made it a priority to focus on it, but that will change this year.

The past few 3-4 months have convinced me that this site *can* generate ""full-time"" income. That's why I post these reports on this sub - to show any other fledgling or struggling bloggers that it is, in fact possible.

301,31qvv0,False,,177,What I'd tell myself about startups if I could go back 5 years.,Entrepreneur,"(I'm not the author)

This is, in no particular order, what I'd tell myself about startups if I could go back in time to when I first got involved. Which is probably the same as what I've learned. This is most definitely not advice, the ""you"" here is directed at me. So is ""I"". Grammar is hard.

 1. You're definitely going to end up building too much and shipping too late. Be obsessive about avoiding this
 - Someone's always already working on the same idea and that's not a bad thing
 - Always refuse if someone asks you to sign an NDA before hearing their idea
 - Like it or not, most networking in London is focused around drinking. Find a way to deal with that without having a constant hangover
 - The people who are really getting somewhere aren't the people who are always out for drinks
 - Linear growth can be worse than no growth
 - Most people who talk about failing fast, aren't actually practicing this
 - It's really easy to kid yourself that you're ""doing customer development"" when actually you're finding ways to make what your customers are saying fit with what you want to build
 - Everyone has a hidden stash of domains they've never used
 - It's really easy to become hyper-critical and respond to every idea with ""yeah but that won't work because of x"". This is lazy, don't do it.
 - Be especially careful to avoid the above when talking to people who are new to the scene. Call out other people who do it
 - It's really hard to listen to someone pitching an idea you've seen fail several times already and focus on working out if there's something slightly different and interesting there
 - Someone being a technically competent developer does not mean they know how to ship things. I'd always rather work with someone who ships over someone who's technically brilliant
 - The programming language/ framework wars are great fun in the pub, but of limited value in real life
 - A good developer can pick up any language or platform in a few weeks
 - I still don't know any real investors
 - Constantly exaggerating how well you're doing can be very tiring. It makes it harder to publicly celebrate the real victories
 - It's really hard to build a product if you don't have a big personal investment in the problem it solves
 - Falling in love with a product (rather than the problem) is really dangerous
 - You can get away without knowing how a hash table works, but it's really satisfying when you eventually learn it
 - Same goes for Big O notation
 - Overnight success isn't a thing. The Social Network is still a great movie
 - I still don't understand PR
 - Most technical solutions are trivial compared to how you get the product into peoples hands
 - Make something people want is probably a less useful heuristic than make something you want
 - But you wanting it doesn't mean enough people want it for it to be a business
 - If you don't have first hand experience of an industry, you're probably wrong about how it works, what problems they have and so how they should be solved. Talk to people
 - ""Ads"" are where business models go to die
 - ""We'll monetize the data"" is the new ""Ads""
 - The people you end up wanting to work with (and help) are the ones who always try and work out how they can help you. Be more like them
 - But get really good at asking for things. Most people will give you a discount for no reason other than you asked. If you see someone important and influential, introduce yourself
 - Get good at saying no to things, from people asking you for discounts to interesting projects you really don't have enough time for
 - Think hard about a pivot which makes good business sense but leads to a product you no longer care about
 - Writing (blogging, books, journaling) is a really positive experience
 - Don't pay too much attention to internet comments about something you've written, there's always someone who didn't like one particular sentence (see point about trolls below)
 - One troll can wipe out a hundred positive interactions, be ruthless in keeping them out of your communities
 - If you end up pitching to someone over coffee, ask to hear their pitch afterwards
 - Only say you're going to introduce someone or send them something if you're actually going to do it. People quickly get a reputation for never following through
 - Show don't tell. ""I'm going to build this amazing thing"" is a LOT less interesting than ""I've built this slightly crappy thing that actually does something"". EVERYONE is GOING to build something, most people never do
 - Building things is awesome, don't get too caught up with the whole ""Lean Startup Landing Page"" mindset
 - Lean Startup is awesome, but it's a pamphlet not a book, read the first few chapters and you'll get the idea. Four steps to the epiphany is more technical and probably a better book
 - Most startup advice is terrible and the good advice is usually obvious. Everyone will give different advice, trust your gut
 - Except when it comes to what your customers want, then ignore your gut and trust them
 - No-one has ever used a Bitcoin ATM for practical reasons
 - Do back of napkin financial forecasts for every potential business model you come up with, just to see if it's in the right ballpark to a couple of orders of magnitude
 - It's really easy to automatically dismiss everyone who starts a conversation with ""I'm looking for a technical co-founder"". Doing this means you miss talking to some interesting people. But be upfront that you're not that co-founder so no-one feels like their time is wasted
 - Trying to raise money and apply to accelerators is a full time job. You're probably either building or fund raising. Not both. If in doubt, choose building
 - The solution to many, many problems, is not technical. That won't stop people trying solve them with apps
 - Facebook is the Facebook for X
 - The idea you laughed at when you saw them pitch at a hackathon may well be the one that's still alive and kicking long after whatever you pitched fails
 - If there are people who genuinely like failing, I've never met them
 - That was not ""your idea"" unless you shipped something, otherwise I invented Facebook, Nest and Oculus Rift
 - People don't steal ideas. Tell as many people as possible. Never ask someone to sign an NDA before hearing your idea, you'll instantly lose all credibility
 - Being friends with somebody is not the same as being able to work well with them
 - Small teams can move VERY fast, be really careful getting extra people involved in any project where agility is important
 - Multi-tasking isn't a thing, switching costs are huge, do one thing at a time and do it really well. Find a way to block out interruptions
 - [Read every essay Paul Graham has written](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
 - Tech news (and news is general) has a very low return on time invested. Prefer books and conversations
 - Read Founders Stories, Fooled By Randomness and The Four Steps to the Ephiphany
 - The logo doesn't matter at the start, find a simple text based logo you can re-use for different projects
 - If you possibly can, open source and write up any side project. Every now and then you'll meet somebody really interesting as a result
 - Regularly working 12 hour days is probably never a good idea. If this is happening a lot, find a way to optimise
 - Talk to everybody

875,4ydmpu,False,Case Study,53,"Selling $5,000 on Reddit and Instagram in 48 hours without being Spammy [Case Study]",Entrepreneur,"An interesting interview with an ecommerce entrepreneur (selling soy candles) who had success engaging people on Reddit and Instagram to drive sales without being pushy and spammy. They Sold $5,000 within 48 hours just from the engagement they got on very niche subreddits. 

It's a great podcast, so if you have time listen to the whole thing here :

https://www.shopify.ca/blog/122652997-wax-and-wick-reddit-for-marketing

and I have also timestamped the interesting parts below.

If you've ever tried or witnessed someone planting links in a subreddit, you'll know what happens next (the pitchforks come out).  

They sell soy candles (super niche product), and it was interesting to read how they actually engaged redditors to get feedback on their idea and product, and actually improved their products based on that feedback.

They had some pretty insightful things to say about reddit, because here you're more like to hurt your brand than drive traffic if you look at it as a marketing channel more than a community.

It's not crazy amount of sales, but the fact they engaged people to improve their product and build trust was an interesting part of the podcast.  It's kind of obvious that you need to be real.  But it's cool to see the *results* of being real on reddit on here.

Thought this would be of interest to the folks here.

Cheers!

190,50i591,False,,120,Marketing is Not Hard. Let's cut the BS and talk about a strategy that works every time,Entrepreneur,"# Introduction
Hi. Sit down. Let’s talk about Marketing. Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell you an Ah-ma-zing $1.000 marketing course. I wrote this because all the misinformation and 'advice' about marketing makes me sad.  It’s like nobody has a clear view of *what* tools to use for *which* effect.. I see a lot of sources on how to use  tools (which is awesome!) but no mention on *how* this fits into a marketing strategy for your business. **How can you use tools if you have no idea if they’ll fit your market or have the desired effect on your business?**

I’ve run my own company for the last 5 years. We create online software products to make our customers lives easier. I studied international marketing and am a software engineer. The past year I have focused on developing a process to create/execute marketing strategies. **The goal of this post is to explain that process and to show that it’s easy to do marketing**. You’ll be able to create a marketing strategy and have a clear idea where to grow your business.

If any of you can chime in on the ideas I’m presenting, please respond below. The process will always be a work in progress, any feedback is welcome! Most of my marketing experience is online but the ideas also apply to ‘the real world’.

Let’s begin, grab some coffee, this’ll take around 10 minutes to read.

# Customer Lifecycle Marketing


The process involves a CRM principle called Customer Lifecycle Management. It’s nothing new. It’s been around longer than the internet. And there have been many books written about it. The idea is that by using CLM you **become a customer-centric business**. In other words *the customer is king*. Your main focus becomes building  **long-term customer relationships**. I think we can all agree focusing on nurturing customer relationships is a good thing.

## Lifecycle stages

The main idea of CLM is that every (potential) customer fits into one of five stages;

* Reach
* Acquire
* Convert
* Retain
* Loyalty

A clear marketing strategy will have an answer for every stage of the customer lifecycle. Each stage has a measurable goal you’re trying to achieve. 

For example, Reach focuses on *reaching* your customer. Making them aware of your business. Every customer starts in the Reach stage. The goal is to push them through to the Acquire stage.

How are you going to achieve that? That’s completely up to you. If you want potential customers, you should focus on ad clicks/website visits. All your activities and selected tools should be about reaching that goal. Every potential customer who completed the goal progresses to the next stage. Which has it’s own goal and different tools.

**How you determine which stage a customer is in is important and specific to your business**. Make sure to write down which metrics you analyse for every stage. We’re going to go over each stage and look at the goals you can set for them. I will also mention tools you can use, so you have an idea where they fit into this framework. 

NOTE: Searching online for 'Customer Lifecycle' can be misleading. Images often show the lifecycle as a loop. This is confusing and doesn’t make a lot of sense. In my experience Loyal customer don't progress back to the Reach stage.

Try to think of the Customer Lifecycle as a timeline. Everybody starts out at Reach and your marketing strategy will push them to Loyalty. You can find visualizations of this by searching for 'Customer Funnel' or 'Customer Journey'. 

### Reach

The Reach stage is all about getting your potential customer’s attention. In case of an online product/service you’re going to be looking at website visits. With that in mind it becomes easy to visualize how to become better at reaching people. **Just increase the amount of website visits!**

There’s a whole host of ways you can grab people’s attention and direct it to your website. When selecting tools for this stage keep in mind that every tool needs to help you achieve the goal. This means you have to track how well each tool performs. Discard any that don’t create more website visits, or figure out how to make them more effective.

It can help to do research before starting. I  call this the Pre-Reach stage. You can develop a Persona or Customer Archetype based on your customer segment. If there’s interest I will post  how I create Personas. For now I encourage you to use one of the many online resources. I’ve included some links below.

Thinking of tools with a goal in mind makes it easier to select which ones work for your business. It also gives you a clear way of determining which tools you should continue using and which ones need to go. Think about which tools would reach more of your potential customers. Instagram could drive traffic for your sunglasses store but won’t work for airconditioning repair.

**Goal:** Get your potential customer to notice you and get them to your website.  
**Metric:** Website visits/Ad Clicks.   
**Tools:** SEO, Facebook Ads, Google Adwords, Instagram, Twitter, Blogs, Podcasts, Content Marketing, Youtube.

### Acquire

Now that you have the customer’s attention you need to start focussing on building trust. **On average it takes around seven interactions before a customer trusts you**. Only then do customers feel comfortable enough to buy anything from you. An interaction can be anything from receiving an e-mail to visiting your website.

The Acquire stage is all about getting your customer to make that first interaction. You can think of interactions like;

* Signing up for a newsletter
* Taking a survey
* Joining a discussion
* Requesting a demo

After their first interaction potential customers move on to the Convert stage. Establishing trust starts in the Acquire stage and concludes in the Convert stage with a sale.

Visiting your website is an interaction but doesn’t have to be an expression of interest. You should find a different interaction that you can track. As a rule, the end result should make the customer known to you. They should give you some form of personal information, an e-mail address for example.

Since the name of the game is building trust you should include trust elements on your website. These will also work well in the  Convert stage.

**Goal:** Get the customer to interact with you for the first time.   
**Metric:** Newsletter/Email signups, Twitter Retweets, Instagram Comments.
**Tools:** OptinMonster, HoldOnStranger, Intercom

### Convert
The next stage is a two-part’er. First you’re going to have to solidify trust then you have to make your sales process as easy as possible.

#### Trust
As discussed in the previous stage it takes seven interactions to establish trust. You need a plan on how every potential customer is going to have those interactions.

A beautiful example is a Nurture email campaign;

* Potential customer gives you their email address. 
* You send them an email every day.
* Talk about something interesting to them.

For example, you’re selling a book about traveling through Asia. You send them 7 emails about your favorite places to see. Which are also included in the book. Link to your website in each email and that’s seven interactions.

It is also possible to start a blog, create videos or have an active social media presence. Do everything to make yourself known as an authority in the field. When a potential customer looks at your business they should perceive you as ‘the real deal’.

**It’s all about making potential customers associate your company with the product.**

Another way of gaining trust is by having a great website. Design can have a noticeable effect on what potential customers think of your business. There’s 1.001 resources you can find about how to create websites that are awesome. 

#### Sales process

If everything goes well your potential customer is now ready to buy from you. It is vital(!) that you make the process to buy from you as easy as possible. Focus on creating the perfect buying experience. 

For an e-commerce website reduce the clicks/actions potential customers have to make. Look at information you don’t need to collect and remove it from your forms. 

Potential customers that don’t convert into paying customers will abandon your business. This means that somewhere in your process  the customers are not engaged. It is your responsibility to find these ‘trust leaks’. Fix them and come up with a ‘last resort’ to convert almost abandoned customers. 

On e-commerce websites you can do this with Cart Abandonment campaigns. When a potential customer forgets to checkout their cart. You can send them an automated email to remind them to come back later. Reminding potential customers will give you a better conversion rate.

**Goal:** Get the customer to trust you and make a sale.  
**Metric:** Revenue, Cart abandonment.  
**Tools:** Shopify, Woocommerce, Magento, InfusionSoft, Mailchimp, Klaviyo

### Retain
Congratulations! Your potential customer has converted and is now an actual customer. Your goal now is to stay at this level of trust and get the customer to come back. This stage is harder to track since we’re going to have to include a timeframe. When do you expect the customer to buy again? This depends on what kind of product/service you offer. Someone who buys a car isn’t likely to come back within a year. While someone who bought cleaning services from you is likely returning soon.

Since the customer is now familiar with your business he/she might make direct contact. This is the first time in the Customer Lifecycle where communication will go both ways. It is a good idea to have some form of Customer Service to keep that level of trust.

Next to that we can adapt our Nurture campaign from the Acquire stage, and use it to keep customers. This campaign will show customers that we *care* about them. And haven’t forgotten that they bought from us. 

In the case of the Asian travel book, you might write about your next adventure in a weekly email. Or send them beautiful new pictures of places described in the book. When your new book comes out, you are sure to keep some of those customers.

**The idea is that you keep your customers interested in interacting with you.**

When a customer doesn’t come back it means they went to the competition or they don’t need you anymore. It’s completely normal to lose a few customers this way but it is possible to minimise the effect.

**Goal:** Keep customer trust and get another sale within a given period.  
**Metric:** Amount of purchases per customer.  
**Tools:** InfusionSoft, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Zendesk

### Loyalty

The final stage of the Customer Lifecycle describes customers who keep coming back. This stage is only attained when all the other stages work well. 

These customers are passionate about your business and are willing to promote you. They’ll post on their social media and tell their friends. Make sure you interact with them! Think about organizing events. And creating merchandise so they can show appreciation for the company. Your branding can go a long way to help these customers express their loyalty.

How you measure who your most loyal customer are is up to you. Is it after five sales? or maybe after two? Or maybe you want to look at time spent on your website. Pick a metric and find those customer that are special.

With the Asian travel book you could interact when your social media accounts are tagged. Instagram and Twitter are great channels to do this on. It shows your customers that you care. And it exposes you to more potential customers.

If done well these customers will become customers for life and help you grow your business.

**Goal:** Make customers feel valued.  
**Metric:** Amount of purchases per customer, amount of time spent on site.  
**Tools:** Meetups, Events, Merchandise.

## Conclusion
With these pointers you can create your own marketing strategy. It is also a great framework by which you can determine the bottleneck in your business. Are you reaching enough potential customers? or are you just not converting them? Are you tying people to your business or losing them to your competitors?

I hope this gives you insight into how you can improve your own business. If anybody would like me to write up a post with best pracices for each stage and/or how to make personas. Please comment below, and I’ll see what I can do.

People don't click and browse through hashtags. Most hashtags you see while researching hashtags are brand hashtags for people trying to get featured on bigger pages. Random people are NOT discovering pages through them.

Bots and automated behavior are getting accounts shut down left and right.

You aren't going to get on the Explore page unless you're ""popular"" (There's a subtle way around this further on in this guide for small accounts) 

Fear not though weary Instagram user because in this guide I'll show you how to wake up in the morning to loads of fresh followers, multiple real comments, and tons of likes without even having to post frequently so here you go:

Instagram has changed greatly since that guy whose guide you read on the internet wrote it and will always change. 

There is only one practical mechanic to use for account growth without wanting to pull your hair out before your page gets big enough that people naturally mention you and you show up places so....

Research pages in your niche that have as few followers as possible but no fewer than 2,500 and no more than 50k and start manually following their followers. I've noticed for some reason adding the followers of bigger or massive pages doesn't result in as many followbacks.

If you get a followback whose page is in the same niche as you go to their followers and start following them manually on your phone. 

There's a cool little bonus when their followers check out your page they are going to see a little message appear below your @ handle that says ""Followed by (bigger account that they follow)"" it's a nice little social proof boost that results in more follow backs. 

Don't follow more than 275 to 375 accounts per day and no more than 100 in one sitting (per hour) or you risk a temporary penalty on your account where you can't follow anymore accounts for a day or two.

When you get a follower immediately or as quickly as possible go to their page and leave a quality comment. The bar is really low. Always tag them in the comment and write a couple lines about what you like about a picture on their page. Sometimes it helps to comment on their caption.

Whatever you do don't comment something about a woman's appearance unless it's ironic or written in a non-sexual way. 

I've also noticed that putting emojis in your comment actually hurts your chances of getting your comment noticed as well, I suspect because people think emojis look spammy. 

The vast majority of your engagement in the early days of your account (dozens of likes and lots of comments per photo) will come from following people and/or leaving a comment that shows that you're a real person. Some people will sprinkle likes all over your page sometimes on every photo.

*If someone likes many of the photos on your page you'll have a high chance of appearing on their explore page(s) every time you post.* 

You'll notice some followers liking every photo you post within 30 minutes to an hour and half of posting it and this is probably why.

Post 3 times a day until you get to 30-33ish posts to make your page looks full and active. Then post once a week until you hit 10k. 

No point in working hard to come up with high quality curated or original content and posting 3x a day when virtually no one is going to see it. Save yourself the trouble in the beginning then post the usual 3 times per day and profit. 

**On dealing with ghost followers:** Don't use hashtags they don't matter. That alone will eliminate 80+% of them. This goes against most advice but, most people haven't started their Instagram accounts recently I'm not knocking them. It's a different ball game nowadays.

If an account follows you out of the blue and their profile actually looks put together like they're trying to promote themselves as a public figure, model , actor, brand page etc. assume it's a ghost follower until your account is bigger.

They're going to unfollow you in t-minus 15 to 36 hours (although some have lasted a week). So don't bother interacting with them they don't look at their comments. 

Do not follow them back. Let them sit in your followers and add to your social proof. If they're in your niche follow their followers and enjoy the social proof boost I talked about above.

**On the Instagram strategy that circulates entrepreneur Reddit every so often (not calling him out just sharing my experience):** I've tried going to random commenting user's pages through top pics on hashtags and leaving high quality comments but this doesn't result in follows and most people's pages are so typical and near identical (or downright not pleasing to the eye to say the least)  that I found myself struggling to come up with anything authentic to comment about them anyway ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/a2vl2t/how_i_predictably_grow_instagram_brand_accounts/,579,"We have started to use http://skimic.com to manage some of our client's accounts.

892,f1tp7h,False,,101,How do you deal with feelings of inadequacy when working for yourself?,Entrepreneur,"One of the biggest challenges I encounter regularly is my mood. I'm pretty critical of myself and don't know how not to be. I'm sure also being diagnosed with major depression doesn't help. 

I often feel like I'm not doing enough in my day or that I'm not reaching enough of my goals. It's really bizarre and upsetting. 

When I'm employed my bosses always praise me for my work and my skill set. It feels good and it really helps hearing that. I don't know how to replicate this while being an entrepreneur. 

Is this a sign that maybe being self-employed isn't right for me? Is this a hump that all entrepreneurs eventually get over? How did you get over it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/f1tp7h/how_do_you_deal_with_feelings_of_inadequacy_when/,413,"I like to have a few other things going on that I can do. One is, I like to read, when my anxiety gets so high I can't function I can go read for a while and calm back down. After a while I don't HAVE to read so much for that anymore. 

Once, during an incredibly difficult time a friend invited me to go play tennis. Such an intense exercise where I basically burned through the horror of what had happened. This was a major turning point in working through that terrible mess. Still felt awful for several months but could tell it was getting better. 

Other times I go deeper into the inadequacy and use that pain to come up with better ways to do things. But mostly it seems that I just get bet at doing what I don't know what I am doing. 

Fake it, 'til you make it. I just pretend and start to feel like I think I am confident at something until I get it down. It feels like the chicken and the egg problem. I can't get better until I am confident I can but I won't feel confident at it until I feel better. Ha! Short circuit this over thinking by simply doing something and getting lost in the enjoyment of it. 

What I have been doing recently is embracing/accepting that my negative emotional base keeps me motivated. This one sucked a bit for me because it basically means that I won't move forward until I feel crappy first. In my case, it is pure unadulterated raw terror. Ha! That gets me to do something about it. Method actors do this a bit too with positive or negative emotions, of course. 

If you are positive motivated, then go do something you are good at first. Feel good about it. Now hold on to that feeling of confidence when you go to do what you feel inadequate about. This is the practice of learning to associate different feelings with different types of activities. 

Stay motivated to follow through by reminding yourself of why you are doing it. 

Your comfort zone grows and adapts over time. ",2020-02-10 17:35:18

The amount of trust & goodwill Trump lost in 3 years was staggering but with the US handling of Covid that loss has exponentially increased well past a point where even bringing in a rational government in November can fix it.

Some accounts feel like they are created by sweatystartup's marketing team just so u/sweatystartup can reply to their ""willing to put in the work, but don't know how to start"" post.

Seriously if you look at the history on some of those 'users' it looks like their account is brand new and their message is worded in such a perfect way for u/sweatystartup to swoop right in and market their website and podcast. I appreciate their message, but it's the same thing over and over again, and surprise, surprise, it's not the single best way to start out as an entrepreneur. But these days sweatystartup doesn't care whether a budding entrepreneur starts a successful service-based business, as long as they are listening to the sweaty startup podcast.

For everyone who is saying ""But his ideas are really helpful"" : annoying advertising is annoying advertising. If we're gonna have equal opportunity here we have to have equal treatment. Just because he advocates doing 'dirty work' doesn't excuse him from using scummy practices.

Also you guys don't think it's weird that for a brand that advocates working hard doing service work, they sure spend a lot of time and effort marketing on Reddit? Sweaty startups just saw a niche on here ripe for marketing and ran with it. You guys are all getting marketed to.

This is no different than a bunch of Gary Vee fanboys defending him. (except there's not as much money behind sweaty startups, let's just be honest)

Results in 6 months: 1000 email subscribers, 30K visits, $736 (affiliate), and most importantly… KNOWLEDGE + EXPERIENCE",Entrepreneur,"I'm tired of all the click-bait success stories in many marketing guides, stuff like this:

[\[IMGUR LINK: Unrealistic claims\]](http://imgur.com/z313Rft)

Or this...

[\[IMGUR LINK: Very unrealistic claims...\]](http://imgur.com/mJ80z3Z)

If it were as easy as those guides *claim*, we'd all be millionaires by now. 

These so-called ""success stories"" are normally created by people who are either already marketing experts, or have a pre-existing audience. That's because if you already have 100,000 monthly visitors, it's relatively easy to obtain an extra 1000 users.

That's why I want to share with you a case study on Niklas Goeke (click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngoeke) for his Linkedin). 

##Background

Niklas graduated university in 2014 and wanted to learn online marketing. He realized that the best way to learn something, is to actually do it.

It took him **6 months** to acquire his first 1000 users. But by applying his lessons learned, it only took Niklas 3 months to get the next 1000.

###Here's the proof
[\[IMGUR LINK: email subscribers\]](http://imgur.com/pb3MXdn)

[\[IMGUR LINK: traffic\]](http://imgur.com/hslBT6Q)

[\[IMGUR LINK: revenue\]](http://imgur.com/29dShNH)

He did this by creating an affiliate marketing website (selling books) and drove traffic to it by creating an efficient content creation framework. 

By doing so, he was able to create **content every single day** (~4 hours/day). Since he created so much content, he was able to rank for specific keywords and would also promote the content like crazy.

###Want to do the same thing? 

I'll be honest with you, even if you work hard and apply the lessons learned in this guide, success isn't guaranteed. That's why if you're a beginner, I recommend you approach this with a goal to **learn** and **to gain experience**.

For the full in-depth (7000+ words) guide with tons of supporting GIFs/images, check it out by [**clicking here**](https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation?src=reddit-https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation).

Otherwise, you can continue reading here for a summary:

##Step 1: Figure out your ""why"" --> crunch the numbers to meet the goal --> validate

Niklas' goal was **""$1000/month in passive income""** and to meet it, he decided to pursue affiliate marketing.

**He would sell books and make a commission for each one he sold.**

Validating which books to promote/sell is tricky. To choose the best books to sell, he used two methods:

**Method 1)** Using a tool called NerdyData, he could see a list of other affiliate marketers promoting his product. He would then look for the affiliate marketers who *pay* to promote (e.g. banner ads) the affiliate product. By searching for the banner's web archives, he could see how long the banner ads were up. If the banner ads are up for a few months, it must be selling enough to justify the banner ad costs.

For example, Mike Vardy had this banner ad for the same affiliate product up for several months:

[\[IMGUR LINK - competitor banner ad validation\]](http://imgur.com/dyeX4N7)

**Method 2)** Told his friends about the product, and for the friends who were interested, he'd send them the affiliate link. He made 3 sales by doing this, which was enough to validate.

Once it was validated, he now spent the time to build a website and drive traffic to it.

##Step 2: Build a content log and streamline SEO, email collection and your promotion process.

To sell his affiliate book products, Niklas created a site that would provide short book summaries and reviews. There were four parts to it:

###Part 1: Content Creation
Niklas wanted to publish content everyday to promote his affiliate books. To do so, he'd limit each article to <1000 words by following a framework:

[\[IMGUR LINK - content framework\]](http://imgur.com/zXiPBdu)

###Part 2: SEO

Since he was creating a piece of content each day (30/month), he started to rank for certain keywords by using Google's Keyword Planner. He would then add targeted keywords into his content headlines.

[\[IMGUR LINK - keyword research\]](http://imgur.com/shOzOiv)

He would then make sure the keyword were in the meta descriptions, url slug, and inside the body of the content.

[\[IMGUR LINK - keyword input strategy\]](http://imgur.com/yRtPzWa)

###Part 3: Email Collection
Niklas was now creating a bunch of content, and several of the content pieces started to rank in the first page of google on popular keywords. He was starting to see quite a bit of traffic going to the website.

He would make the most of the website visitors by collecting emails using SumoMe.

[\[IMGUR LINK - email collection\]](http://imgur.com/9Y4YBv8)

###Part 4: Promotion

Every day, Niklas would spend ~1.5 hours writing the content piece, and another 90 minutes promoting it.

He would distribute his content on:

* Stumbleupon
* HackerNews
* SlackGroups
* Email Outreach
* Twitter
* Answering Quora Questions 

##Step 3: Publish every day until you hit your goal.

Create content every single day. By doing so, eventually you'll have several articles that start to rank high in google. Create a content creation structure so you publish at the same time everyday.

[\[IMGUR LINK - content calendar\]](http://imgur.com/qY5DI5q)

And that's how Niklas eventually achieved his first 1000 email subscribers and $736.

If this summary didn't cut it: [**Here's a 7000+ word guide of Niklas' exact blueprint to grow an online business from scratch.**](https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation?src=reddit-https://sumome.com/stories/content-creation)

In it, it'll go into greater in each step along the way with tons of pictures, and tutorial GIFs so you'll know exactly how he did it. He also includes all the spreadsheets and tools so you can do the same thing.

###Any questions, comments, or feedback?

Niklas will be around here to answer :)

593,4zd8sh,False,,813,How to run facebook ads for any business: Comment your business and I'll tell you how,Entrepreneur,"Alright so I am a co-owner of a digital marketing company that specializes in facebook ads. Every single person or business I have worked with has explained to me that they have tried facebook ads and ""it just doesn't work"" for their type of business. They claim that facebook ads are real easy and they knew what they were doing, but it's just not right for their type of business. It takes everything I have in me to not laugh at them.

Without fail, all of these people that explained to me that facebook ads don't work for their ""type of business"", I am able to get them a positive ROI on the ads. Turns our they didn't know what they were doing, which I can understand. I'm a loser and sit at the computer pretty much all day every day creating facebook ads and I'm a member of a handful of private groups that contain some of the world's top spenders on facebook and get advice from them all the time, so I understand that a profitable facebook campaign doesn't come as easily to others as it does for me, but that's why I'm here to help!

**So what I would like to do is have anyone interested in trying facebook ads (or has tried in the past) to comment their type of business or what they are trying to sell, and I will explain how I would approach things.**


**Things to consider:**

* 1.) Type of ad: conversions, post engagement, video views, website clicks, leads...
The objective of your ad can make an insane impact on how well your ads perform. You can optimize for many different objectives and the different objectives will get you different results. Example: If you want your business to bring in new leads, then you don't want to be optimizing for post engagements. 

* 2.) Targeting: broad audiences, behaviors, job titles, education level, income and/or salary, interests, highly target multi-layer audiences, demographics, etc.
Specialty products or services require a much more dialed in audience. For things that aren't specialty, you are better off using a large audience and letting facebook optimize to show your ads to the people most similar to people who have already purchased.

* 3.) Placement: Destop or mobile? News feed or right column? Instagram?
People have different intentions when they are sitting at a computer and when they are on their phone. People are on their phones when they are sitting in cabs or at a restaurant or the gym. Is that the best place to get them to watch a 10 minute video? Probably not. 

**Here are some examples of types of businesses I have worked with:**

**Photography company -** They though facebook ads couldn't work for their business and I set them up with a campaign that was bringing them in wedding photo leads for $9 a peice (average wedding job for them was $3000)


**Realtors -** Buyer leads for $4, Highly motivated seller leads for $15, and less motivated seller leads for $2. Video walkthrough ads are killer and using facebook live to do virtual open houses is the future of real estate


**Musician -** Helped an artist get 100,000 views on her first single in a few days for $30. It also got her page a ton of likes.


**Bars -** Ran carousel ads promoting their craft beer selection and the prices during happy hour to get the bar consistently packed during that time of the day. Facebook ads also work fantastically with bars for events. You can also run ads to people's phones who are at other bars telling them to come to your bar. 


**E-commerce companies -** Helped many ecommerce companies (as well as run one myself) to run highly profitable ads while tracking everything to ensure all ads have a positive ROI when scaling the ones with the best ROI. Examples: jewelry, apparel brands, a store that sold ice molds for whiskey drinkers, pet products and more


**Online Personal Trainer/fitness coach -** Built an email list of 800 leads of people looking for a fitness coach for .60 a piece in just 1 week. 


**Other businesses we've had great success with:**

* Printing company
* Wine and painting company
* Watch company
* Beauty product company
* Bridal shop
* Specialty olive oil store
* Golf course
* Software company
* Antique store
* Gym
* Boat dealership
* Digital cookbooks

250,6fp751,False,,217,1 year ago we had the dream of creating the IMDb equivalent for podcasts. Now that dream is nearly a reality and we hope to raise money to quit our jobs. We need your help to do it right.,Entrepreneur,"Cole here with Podchaser! I'm responsible for sales and growth of our new website launching this weekend, and we need your help.

**What we are:**
Nine months ago, we posted on reddit asking if an IMDb equivalent for podcasts existed -- see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/64tjic/introducing_podchaser_the_imdb_of_podcasts_were_a/). A flurry of responses and grievances came about, and it was clear that such a concept was desired. So, a team of five of us from the US and Australia have all banded together to create [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com). Podcast discovery is an ongoing problem for podcast listeners. Some recommendation algorithms exist, but they’re generally based off podcast show preferences, rather than episode preference. Generally, the same 10 or so podcasts are recommended and remain on top charts. So, we are building a system around individual episode ratings and reviews. Our front page will feature the hottest episodes rather than podcasts, allowing users to discover a broader array of content. Users can also check out reviews on individual episodes before diving in. Some podcasts have shows with varying degrees of quality, and now you can just check out feedback in one place rather than googling around fan forums and subreddits.

Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/bqibL1M.png).

**Where we are:**
Our development team is employed full time and cannot dedicate the time necessary to make Podchaser grow as fast as we want with our other obligations. We've worked long nights and weekends across time zones to build this dream, and now our developers are ready to work full time to take the next step! When we send our [pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lhaY43yAmXYjJaQ2ZyS1BQOW8/view?usp=sharing) to investors, we will ask for convertible notes for this seed round of investment to last ~12-16 months. 

The closed beta launches June 10th, and you can register today at [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com)! Registration ends on June 10th until the site goes live to the public.

**How you can help:**
We’d love some feedback from this subreddit on our [pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3lhaY43yAmXYjJaQ2ZyS1BQOW8/view?usp=sharing) before we approach investors. Also, we'd like to opinions on your suggested strategies to find the right investors and get funded.

If you happen to host your own podcast, we'd love to get you involved! Podcast hosts can get a [mega key](http://imgur.com/a/OE3wI) for their listeners to access the closed beta after June 10th. When your listeners rate and review your episodes in the beta, you'll be much more likely to appear in our trending section and find some new listeners. Shoot us a PM for details.

We also will need your precious data (ratings and reviews). Please head over to [podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com) to sign up. Invites will be going out June 10th to all subscribers.

We will hang out here for a few hours.

TL;DR
We're making a cool podcast website and want to raise money. We've never done it on this scale and need your advice!

The end result is an extreme feeling of loneliness. I GENUINELY think I’ve found why this is.",Entrepreneur,"**About this post:** I’m just an average entrepreneur who finds certain marketing, advertising and business stuff fascinating. This post (along with all others) is nothing more than a fun little project for myself where I write about stuff I find cool. 

Today’s post is one I wrote following listening to a very cool Alan Watts lecture. I’ve found him, along with a few others have helped balance me with the constant striving for more of entrepreneurship.

There is NOTHING wrong when you strive for more for your own personal benefit. But I’ve come to realise that’s not always the primary reason we strive for more…

This post was originally written on my blog where it's accompanied by pics I can't include here due to reddit's limitation. To read the article in its original glory click [here]( http://ganonmakesmoney.com/why-most-entrepreneurs-dont-enjoy-entrepreneurship-ugly-truths/) (I personally recommend it).
Anyway without further ado here’s the post…

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

##**Why Most Entrepreneurs Don't Enjoy Being an Entrepreneur**

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship has become a burden as of late. I constantly worry about money and the future. My brain never shuts off and enjoys what I have. I can’t switch off. Not even in the company of friends, family or my own wife.

&nbsp;

It’s become a constant battle for some goal in the future. And when it’s hit, it’s time to upgrade it to another goal. This sort of thinking and striving whilst popular in the entrepreneur-sphere is the very thing I quit my job for four years ago to avoid.

&nbsp;

I have  a feeling many of you know what I’m talking about. And luckily for you, your boy Ganon has found the root of the problem. Buckle up and let me explain…

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship was supposed to be our rebellion. To earn our freedom and live life on our own terms.

&nbsp;

However instead what many of us dream about is to be millionaires…

&nbsp;

Think about that for a second. Why do you want to be a millionaire? What not a $857,303-eraire? Or a $1,493,344.84-eraire?

&nbsp;

Again think about that. Think deeply.

&nbsp;

Wanting to be a millionaire is the self-employed equivalent of the office worker who dreams to gain the beloved title vice-president of another man’s company and vision. That moron wants the fancy title even more than he wants the money. So he can hold his head up high as his mother gloats to the community, friends and neighbours how important he is.

&nbsp;

Striving to be a millionaire is the same. It’s meaningless status. And fellas my gut and heart tell me it’s something to be avoided.

&nbsp;

Entrepreneurship has become a burden as of late. I constantly worry about money and the future. My brain never shuts off and enjoys what I have. I can’t switch off. Not even in the company of friends, family or my own wife.

&nbsp;

And why is that?

&nbsp;

I’m always trying to earn more. Do more. Be better.

&nbsp;

Not for myself, but to get the approval of my wife, my mum and my dad. So that my aunts, uncles and cousins secretly admire and envy me. So I can attend school reunions have everyone think I’m some bigshot.

&nbsp;

This my friend is the source of unhappiness. The poison which sucks the natural joy of being alive.

&nbsp;

I’d want to clear up that this is in NO WAY a post against the acquisition of money. Not at all.

&nbsp;

I’m a FIRM believer that money is a beautiful thing, and you should go after everything you need to live the most luxurious, action-packed adventure of a life ever lived.

&nbsp;

But for god sake don’t pursue money to appease others.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

706,befto5,False,,85,"A real small business story. 170k gross, profit 42k. 1 owner, 1 employee. Brick and mortar store. My profit loss statement and story.",Entrepreneur,"Hey guys, I created a new account for this but I wondered if you would at all be interested in hearing a real Entrepreneur story. Not these grossing 500 million whatever stories. I promise you I'm selling you nothing, there are no links in my post I'm just here to share a story and answer any questions you might have. 

Like most of my generation I was told you had to go to college, leave home, and then you'd have the good life. After doing that sometime in my mid 20s when with in a week of each other both of my parents got very ill I decided I needed to get back home. I'm an only child, they needed help. My Mom had cancer and with in a week finding out my Dad had a massive heart attack. Then the next year my Mom got a rare blockage in the artery of her stomach, and my Dad then got cancer. They are both doing well now, but the massive hospital bills have left them in pretty rough shape financially. 

So I came home and of course jobs are few and far between in rural America. However I was making a go of it working two jobs. At my main job the owner of the small business was aging and had no children that were interested in the business. I had a conversation with her about the future and she was willing to sell the business when she retired. That would be about 8 years later. I saved as much money as I could and when it was all said and done I bought the business for 60k. I had to get a loan to help with this. The business at the time had the owner, myself, and another employee. 

Things were going great and I took that business from grossing 88k the last year of the old owners ownership to a high of 179k two years ago. My take home has been pretty consistently around 40k give or take a thousand or two. 

Initial Growth: came from advertising, of which the owner did non before, only word of mouth. In my small town the local radio station had great reach so I hit that hard and I would occasionally (once a month) do an ad in the local newspaper. Without getting into specifics my customer demographic is older, usually above 55 so this hit those targets. 

Bumps in the road: For the first few years it was all coming up roses. It seemed like we could do no wrong. Then one day while working in our shop part of the roof collapsed during a rain storm. The owner of the building also owned the building and business next door so I went to talk to him. Basically he said he's not fixing it and I better look for another place to have my business. By luck (or curse) a pretty good place came available. It had room to grow, was nicer, and was in an ok location. I was able to secure some low interest loans through our local economic development agency. If you are looking for help definitely see if your community has something like that. 

The move was tricky, there was nearly 3 weeks that we were basically shut down doing production work, but we still were doing sales. However we only took about a 7% dip in business that year so it could have been worse. Year two at the new location was my best ever. 

Then there was a major bump in the road. My key employee who basically handled all of my shop production got into some major legal trouble and was gone. 

Stumbling all the way: The next year was a revolving door of employees. It's hard to get people to take pride in their work like you do. I dealt with the typical no shows, showing up late, and I heard every excuse in the book. To out right stealing and screwing my business over. Honestly after about a year of that I just wanted out but I didn't have a business, I owned a job. Finally I was able to find some stability in an employee who works hard and shows up, but is damn frustrating to work with. Still the last year or so has been ok and in fact I felt confident enough to open another sales location. Now it's commission based and the sales people own a small business of their own. We just set up a display there and they sell our product as well as their own related but not the same product. That location last year grossed about 15k of which about 6k of it was profit for me. Nothing to write home about but it's money in the bank. 

Then Goliath came: Just this winter some serious competition came to town. This town can definitely not support two of what I do, but they came anyway. This is their 5th location and it's pretty clear they think they can run me out of business, which may be the case. 

My problem is this is still a job and I feel like I can't afford to make it a business. Realistically I need to make two hires. A sales person, and my shop foreman. Then I could ""run the business' and float between the sales and the shop to make sure everything is working. So great, why don't I just do that. Well here is my profit loss statement for 2018.

New Sales: 163,000
odd jobs: 2075
repairs: 1090
Total Income: 166165
Cost of goods sold: 63391
Gross Profit: 102773

labor 20634
shop supplies 9851
office supplies 323
repair parts 764
fabrication 1426
laser 150

insurance 4799
shipping 1089
utilities 5601
misc 838
ads 5384
com mortgage interest 6345

Total Expenses: 61494
Net Income: 41279

My take home is quite a bit less than that net income as the actual mortgage payments for my building come out of that. 

So anyway, I hope some of you glean something out of that. Running a small business is hard and it's extremely stressful. I took about 10 days off all last year just trying to keep things going. It's a strain on my family and myself mentally and physically. I'm not sure in my case if it's worth it but where I live it's the best shot of not working some terrible service industry job with weird hours and shifts that I'd never see my family.  So here I am feeling perpetually stuck between this is going to work and I'll make it and I'm stuck here and this isn't worth it but I don't have an option.

101,gf52xm,False,Case Study,123,21 tips for great copywriting,Entrepreneur,"**1) Write with your eraser**

You get 100 bucks for every word you rub out from your title:

*Trello lets you work more collaboratively and get more done => Work collaboratively. Get more done*

**2) No one cares what you can do**

Everyone cares what you can do *for them*

*The worlds first portable digital media player => 1,000 songs in your pocket*

**3) Avoid the passive voice**

It's indirect and awkward:

B*igger fish will be fried by me => I've got bigger fish to fry*

**4) Speak with conviction**

* Don't say “We help” say “It's how”
* Don't say “alternative” say “replaces”

***We help*** *you make a podcast =>* ***It's how*** *you make a podcastAn email* ***alternative*** *inside your company => Slack* ***replaces*** *email inside your company*

**5) Avoid “landing page words”**

*Unlock*, *unleash*, *enhance*, *exceed*, *empower*, *supercharge*, etc.

Real people don't use them.

**6) Find the tension**

“Pleasant” gets forgotten. Conflict creates interest:

*Insurance for the digital revolution => Forget everything you know about insurance*

**7) Write how you talk**

Casual. Colloquial. Full of pronouns:

*Before Basecamp:* ***You’re*** *wondering how* ***you’ll*** *quickly transition* ***your*** *team to remote work.* ***People*** *are stressed, work feels* ***scattered***, projects are ***slipping***, and it’s tough to see + manage everything.

**8) Don't exaggerate**

An honest line always feels warmer:

*The new Volkswagen. More space. More comfort. => If you run out of gas, it's easy to push.*

**9) Avoid “contained” titles**

Write something that pulls your reader down your page:

*Social media intelligence for your startup => Do you know the value of your Facebook content?*

**10) Think “Call-to-value” not “Call-to-action”**

Buttons which amplify **“value”** over **“action”** usually perform better.

* *Sign up now => Create your website*
* *Get started => Hire top designers*

**11) Don't kill your personality**

The best brands feel “real”:

*As efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, we hope you’re supported in taking every measure to protect your health. => Melanie here, CEO of Andie. I'm writing to you from my living room as my dog Sara proofreads — we're both working from home today.*

**12) More periods, fewer commas.**

Periods mean short sentences. We like short sentences.

Commas mean long, painful sentences, like this one, which *New Yorker* writers think are clever, but real people find torturous, because they wind on and on without actually saying anything.

**13) Use value based messaging**

People don’t want a **better toothbrush**. They want a **brighter smile**:

*Introducing the new and improved Colgate => Smile like you've never smiled before*

**14) Kill adverbs.**

They're flowery. They're vague. They try too hard:

*Effortlessly create email lists from LinkedIn => Create email lists from LinkedIn*

**15) Think slippery slide**

Every line of copy should lead to the next. All the way down to your CTA. Watch [this ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXL2YukS6Sc&feature=emb_title). You won't be able to stop.

**16) Get specific**

You can’t bullshit specifics:

*Save more on your AWS bill => Save an average of 33.7% on your AWS bill*

**17) Fence sitters don't buy**

Go to the edge:

*Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. In event of success honour and recognition — Ernest Shackleton*

**18) Your first line is crucial**

The first line of your copy is crucial. If people don’t read it, they’re not going to read your second line either. Make it short.

*We focus on nearly every muscle in our body, yet neglect the one area we value most, our face. => Your face has 43 muscles.*

**19) Call out the customer you serve**

People pay attention when they know something is specifically **for them.**

*A creative hub for anyone and everyone => A creative hub for 150,000 authors*

**20) You're on a speed date**

The majority of people look at your site for 30 seconds and never return. If you can't make your **product** interesting in six words sell the **benefits** instead:

*All-in-one social automation => Turn followers into customers*

**21) Copywriting is selling**

Don’t romanticize it. The goal isn't to be clever or cute. The goal is to inspire action:

*Request a demo => See Drift on your site*

Thanks for reading. Hope you enjoyed it. Before anyone jumps in these are heuristics, not universals. *Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.*

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

Set up a website on WordPress. Pay someone on a freelancing site to create a simple logo for you and some marketing material. Here is my [full guide](http://sweatystartup.com/essential-tools/) to setting up your business.

Make sure your flyer has great copy. This is an example of what you want to say:

>Predict your home utility bills with affordable thermal imaging  
>  
>Where is your home leaking heat?  
>  
>Understand your home utility bills BEFORE you buy  
>  
>Protect your investment with a thermal imaging analysis  
>  
>Affordable energy auditing

Buy $100 worth of door hanging flyers created on UPrinting or your local print shop. Make sure your phone number and web address is on the bottom of the flyer.

That weekend go on Zillow or Realtor.com and get in your car. Drive around and hang a flyer on the door of every home for sale within 10 miles of where you live.

Why would someone who is about to move utilize a service to analyze their utilities? They won't for this house. But they are moving somewhere. They'll want to spend a few dollars to learn about their next house. Thats the play.

Read and learn about thermal imaging by watching videos [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYERTgD3ldA). Take one of the many online classes. Consider getting certified. Watch an [updated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYERTgD3ldA) on equipment so you can decide what camera to buy. Study the industry and learn as much as possible. Buy a camera for under $350. You can upgrade later.

Create a report template that you will use to report back to customers. Use the [many many examples](https://www.carsondunlop.com/assets/inspection/Carson-Dunlop-Thermal-Imaging-Sample-Report.pdf) out on the internet and take what you love from each of them.

Your phone will start to ring. Get out and service some customers at heavy discounts. Learn a lot. Provide professional reports for them to use.

As you gain momentum start to grow your marketing channels. Partner with realtors to send you referrals and pay them a cut if necessary. Watch the MLS. Show up at open houses and hand out business cards. [Get creative with your marketing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pressurewasherporn/comments/97hig7/saw_this_otw_home_from_work_today/?st=JRCWGDFL&sh=dfddde91) Find local real estate investors and offer your services to them for free at first to gain trust. Word will get out about your work and business will start flowing.

Invest in a nicer camera. Get licensed. Learn to understand the house or structure as a system. 

You’ll start to bring in $150+ per service and it will take you about an hour. Begin to partner with contractors who want the leads you have for new windows, roofs, insulation, doors, etc. Tons of opportunity here.

As soon as your weekends and evenings are full and you are bringing in enough money to replace your 9-5 quit your job and get serious.

Invest in some equipment like a drone and get certified to fly it. Start doing [big commercial thermal imaging](http://blog.uasthermals.com/how-to-build-a-profitable-uas-infrared-thermal-imaging-business) projects. Maybe expand to be a full on building inspector.

55,gzr9p4,False,,131,Quit my corporate slave job to save the family business. Ended up increasing family business monthly revenue by 110% — in 60 days.,Entrepreneur,"I’m starting to see more and more purpose in sharing my story.


Long time lurker, first time posting. Never liked long paragraphs filled with tons of fluff - so I’m gonna keep it short and meaningful. 

**Background**:
 
Parents own your typical brick-and-mortar, service-based storefront. Was financially struggling for quite some time and was on the verge of collapsing altogether, due to not evolving along with the world and adopting digital ways of business.

Me, a former finance professional at a Corporate-America company, quit my passionless job — to save the family business. 

Knew the ways to revive the business was through:

- **Digital transformation** 
- **Deploying digital marketing and leverages**   

I picked up and learned everything I could about digital marketing and digital leverages in hopes of saving the business with them. 


The milestones along the journey: 


**Market research**:

Learned from competitors' strength and capitalized on their weaknesses.

**Marketing strategizing and planning**: 

1. Identified competitive edge — what's the our biggest selling point, something that we do better than everybody around
 
2. Embraced and completely owned this edge 

3. Sharpened and repackaged it

4. Delivered it with the right channels and copy to the right audience.



**Recreated website using UX/UI principles**:

Knew website was where all my digital efforts --- pivot off of. Spent endless hours polishing and fine-tuning this step with the developers I hired. 

User-friendly and aesthetically captivating. Purchases and bookings are made effortlessly --- unlike my competitors’ sites that had users running around in a maze, only to give up on searching for their desired product/service/information.  

**Incorporated automation**: 

Incorporated online point of sales, self-scheduling, self-checkout system, and unique egift-card system.

**Deployed digital marketing**: 

- Google Ads 
- Instagram
- Facebook 
- Waze

**After 60 days**:

- +110% monthly revenue

- Consistently booked out 2 months out

- Achieved the following metrics: 

1. 550% ROI
2. 800% ROAS
 


**Me aftermath**:

Discovered I loved doing marketing so much more than finance, so:

I'm in the process of leveraging myself into a marketing managerial position with the experience I gathered and the results produced from this endeavor.

Wish me luck, friends!

**Moral of the story**

Business completely revived from the brink of dying; from consistently letting staff go to hiring new ones to meet the explosion of demands and traffic.

Unexpectedly, I went from working an passionless job in corporate to producing monumental digital marketing results that set me up for an exciting career in marketing

It’s mind-blowing how fast and sharp your fate can change, when you take a leap and dig deep when the going gets tough. 

**The Message**:

I know times aren’t looking good and most of you are discouraged to take the leap —

the road ahead looks dark and you can’t help but feel drained and exhausted, I know the feeling, I’ve been there —

but there’s always a way out of the dark tunnel as long as you keep digging and strive for that one glimpse of light.

Good luck friends

678,fw15o2,False,,119,How I Made $8794.50 By Sending Out 1300 Postcards - Marketing Experiment,Entrepreneur,"In this experiment I'm sending out 1000 post cards to homes recently listed for sale in my area in attempt to gain more sales for my moving company. I will cover design, my tactics, the total expense, the results. 

&#x200B;

## Flyer Design

 I have done a slight redesign to my flyer. I did away with discounts and replaced the spot that used to be a coupons with a smiling face. In services I find smiling faces and a friendly look matter a whole lot more than technical details. You can't touch or hold a service like you can a product but you can ""feel"" its impression. 

&#x200B;

## Why I Like Postcard Flyers

1. They are cheaper to send than regular mail. Post card stamps are currently $0.35. This really adds up as you send hundreds of flyers out. 
2. It's an easy activity for admin staff to do during downtime.

&#x200B;

## Total Cost

After sending out the initial 1000 post cards I noticed that there were still a few hundred houses left in the area so I decided to hit them all, resulting in 1300 total flyers sent. This is the total expense. 

 Postage $455 (1300 at $0.35 a piece) 

 Labor $120  

 Flyers $39 ($0.03 a piece) 

 Total $614 

&#x200B;

## Results

We sent the flyers and waited about 6 weeks to tabulate the results. A certain number of flyers are always returned to sender. In this case 300 of the 1300 flyers were returned due to vacancies or address issues.  

 Of the 1000 that were actually sent we ended up booking 6 jobs. That doesn't sound like a whole lot but the caveat here is we only sent flyers to homes for sale for over $400,000 so each job is of significant size. 

This is proven with the first job we landed for a whopping $4600. This single job paid for every single flyer PLUS some. 

The total revenue from sending 1300 flyers was $8794.50! 

At a 20% year end profit margin that comes out to $1758.90 in net profit on $614 in expense. A 286% return on investment! 

&#x200B;

## What I Attribute the Results To

1. The flyer design. On the first in-home estimate we did the customer said ""we just loved your flyer"" and when I heard that I knew this would work well
2. We have great reviews online. I don't believe our results would be nearly as impressive if we didn't already have a great online presence.
3. My office staff is trained and relentless. I have 3 salespeople who book jobs for me and they are very good at closing sales and following up with customers. They don't leave anything on the table. 

&#x200B;

The best marketing plan is only as good as the company behind it. The best form of advertisement for your service is simply being a wonderfully ran service.

94,7zvsnv,False,,119,Harvard Research Gives Clues On How to Be Successful And Have Fun Doing It,Entrepreneur,"Chances are you want to be more successful.    
Chances are you realise success takes a lot of work.    
Chances are you wish there was a scientifically proven method that made success a little bit more... fun. 

Well, Shawn Achor, bestselling author of The Happiness Advantage, studied for years at Harvard to try and find just that, and his solution was incredibly interesting.

What's even more interesting than his findings is that his cutting-edge research is incredibly similar to many ideas in the Philosophy of Stoicism.


#Prefer to watch? [Watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPCFviNl_Rc)

Shawn Achor gave a TED talk that accumulated over 20 million views.    
He was even interviewed by Oprah.    

What makes Shawn so interesting is that during his research he would ignore the trend and only study the outliers. 

>""Instead of deleting those people that are weirdos in the data what we do is we intentionally study them. We try and find out why it is that while an entire sales force has low numbers, we’re finding three or four people whose sales are skyrocketing. Or we’re looking at a low socioeconomic school in Chicago, where the academic scores are below average, there are a couple students whose grades are skyrocketing. By studying those outliers, what we’re doing is we’re gleaning information not on how to move subpar performers up toward that average point, but how to move people from average to superior."" - Shawn Achor

After years of Harvard research, Shawn came to the conclusion that **success doesn't bring happiness - happiness brings success.**

Shawn's research proved that there are four things that will make you happier whilst being more successful as a by product.

#Realise that Success Doesn't Bring Happiness.

My parents tell me the story about how I sat in front of the TV mesmerised by the advert for the new Xbox games console. It was better, faster and newer than the old one - it even had a wireless controller! I begged and begged my parents to buy me it and when they refused I made it my goal to buy it with my own money.

I spent the next few months doing extra chores and saving my pocket money so I could buy it. It was all I could think about. All I needed was the new Xbox and then I would be happy.

Two months later I had enough money. 

I rushed to the nearest GAME store.

I proudly handed over my money and bought the brand new games console.

As I ran home I treasured what I thought was the cure to all of my problems.

When I unboxed it and started playing I realised I was right! All my problems were gone and I was completely happy...

For a week or so. After that I started dreaming about the next biggest thing.

You may laugh at my naivety but we've all fallen prey to similar thoughts:

* I'll be happy when I earn X amount
* I'll be happy when I lose 10 pounds
* I'll be happy when I buy a new car

You see, due to something called the Hedonic Treadmill we return to our default level of happiness soon after something external increases or decreases out level of happiness.

This is not even a new theory - 2,000 years ago philosophers came to the same conclusion:

>“True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.” — Seneca

Shawn's research supported this further:

>""If we can get somebody to raise their levels of optimism or deepen their social connection or raise happiness, turns out every single business and educational outcome we know how to test for improves dramatically. You can increase your success rates for the rest of your life and your happiness levels will flatline, but if you raise your level of happiness and deepen optimism it turns out every single one of your success rates rises dramatically compared to what it would have been at negative, neutral, or stressed."" - Shawn Achor

Some companies, such as MET Life believed in this so strongly they started hiring salespeople based on optimism. 

The results were incredible: 

>""It turns out that the optimistic group outsold their more pessimistic counterparts by 19% in year one and 57% in year two.""

When I read this I thought: ""wait a minute.. so you're telling me that being happy is the only decider on the performance of sales people? Surely not"".

I was right: happiness is not the **only** decider on performance - but it is a damn big decider.

>""If we know the intelligence and technical skills of an employee, we can actually only predict about 25% of their job success. 75% of long term job success is predicted not by intelligence and technical skills, which is normally how we hire, educate and train, but it’s predicted by three other umbrella categories. It’s optimism (which is the belief that your behavior matters in the midst of challenge), your social connection (whether or not you have depth and breadth in your social relationships), and the way that you perceive stress."" - Shawn Achor

The moral of the story is we should worry just a little bit less about grades and a little bit more about optimism.

Breaking this down further, what was the most powerful thing Shawn learned from looking at these happy, superhero-like outliers?

#No Problem is a Threat, Just a Challenge 

As I'm sure you are all aware, there was a huge financial crash in 2008. Soon after, Shawn did a study of many bankers. As you can imagine, many of them were incredibly stressed. But a few were as happy as ever.

Following Shawn's normal strategy he ignored the trend and focused on the outliers.

What did they have in common? What separated these men from the crowd? What secret did these men hold that the others clearly didn't?

**They never saw problems as threats; they saw them as challenges to overcome.**

>What these positive outliers do is that when there are changes that occur in the economic landscape or the political landscape or at an educational institution, they see those changes not as threats, but as challenges. - Shawn Achor

Damn. Those luckily people. I wish I could be wired like that.

It's your lucky day - you can.

Shawn discovered through further experiments that this attitude can be learned.

Shawn showed the normal bankers a video explaining exactly how to see stress as a challenge.

>And we watched those groups of people over the next three to six weeks, and what we found was if we could move people to view stress as enhancing, a challenge instead of as a threat, we saw a 23% drop in their stress-related symptoms. It produced a significant increase not only in levels of happiness, but a dramatic improvement in their levels of engagement at work as well. - Shawn Achor

And once again, ancient philosophers agreed. Epictetus was a huge influencer in the [Philosophy of Stoicism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhQDnpf-ad0&t=3s).

>Difficulties are the things that show what men are. Henceforth, when some difficulty befalls you, remember that god, like a wrestling-master, has matched you with a rough young man. - Epictetus

Some of you might be hoping I give you a more definitive answer on how you can get happier, taking success gladly as a side effect.

Well the answer is simpler than you think.

#3. Send a Thank-You Email

Contrary to public opinion, research shows that the little things in life are more important to our happiness than the big wins.

Shawn's research proved that it is smarter to build small, repetitive habits instead of doing things like going on vacation. 

But what small, repetitive habits will increase your happiness?

>""The simplest thing you can do is a two-minute email praising or thanking one person that you know. We’ve done this at Facebook, at US Foods, we’ve done this at Microsoft. We had them write a two-minute email praising or thanking one person they know, and a different person each day for 21 days in a row. That’s it. What we find is this dramatically increases their social connection which is the greatest predictor of happiness we have in organizations. It also improves teamwork. We’ve measured the collective IQ of teams and the collective years of experience of teams but both of those metrics are trumped by social cohesion."" - Shawn Achor

On top of this there are a few other daily habits I recommend you to start doing to increase your default level of happiness:

* Meditate
* Exercise Voluntary Discomfort
* Other-Size

The numbers say that around 70% of you will read this article, consume the information, feel like you're becoming better, then not do anything with it.

Stoicism has something to say to you: 

>“Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be One.” – Marcus Aurelius

Shawn has made this easier for you.

#4. Make Habits Easier With the 20-Second Rule

Shawn says that the thing stopping you from making the changes that you know you should is ""activation energy"". 

When doing something that doesn't give you an instant sense of gratification the hardest part is always the most difficult. 

When going to the gym the hardest part is getting out of bed and into your clothes.

The 20 second rule states that if you make it 20 seconds easier to start a task you significantly reduce the amount of activation energy required to follow out the task.

Tough things become easy.

Shawn would sleep in his gym clothes and put his shoes right next to his bed. At that point it is easier to follow out the habit as it takes a mental decision to get undressed and not go.

>""If you can make the positive habit three to 20 seconds easier to start, your likelihood of doing it rises dramatically. And you can do the same thing by flipping it for negative habits. Watching too much television? Merely take out the batteries of the remote control creating a 20 second delay and it dramatically decreases the amount of television people will watch."" - Shawn Achor

Shawn and his research definitely has some incredible research. What is more incredible is that philosophy came up with very similar ideas 2,000 years ago. I made a whole YouTube channel about the practical, tangible, scientifically proven, benefits of philosophy.

So many people think that out happiness is set in stone and can only be decided by external events and genetics. If there was one misconception I could change in people it would be this.

>Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view which they take of them."" - Epictetus

Also, remember

* Success doesn't bring happiness. Happiness brings success.
* All problems are challenges, not threats.
* Send a ""thank you"" email.
* Use the 20-second rule to build habits.

>""When you look at outliers on the graph, you find people who actually break the tyranny of genes and environment by creating these conscious positive habits that actually cause them to interact with life in a more positive way with higher levels of success, lower levels of stress, and higher levels of resilience. They do it by changing their mindset and changing their habits, and by doing so they actually trump their genes.

>Most people accept that they’re just born some way and that’s how they’re going to be the rest of their life, and whatever they were last year is what they’re going to be this year. I think positive psychology shows us that that doesn’t actually have to be the case."" - Shawn Achor

#Action Step

Go write an email/text/comment to someone thanking them for something. I promise your mood will increase after. Turn this into a habit to gradually increase your default level of happiness.

427,2z8riy,False,,228,Let's Talk Consulting: How I Built A $250K Consulting Business In Two Years,Entrepreneur,"G’Day folks - I’ve taken a lot from this community. 


Whether it was /r/entrepreneur or /r/marketing – I’ve been taking notes and keeping track of insights shared here for quite some time now. Specifically, I’ve taken posts from users like /u/bandholz, /u/localcasestudy and /u/brian604 and used their expertise and insights to grow professionally. Now, I know I’m from an entirely different industry but I like to find inspiration from anyone and any thing... I think we all can learn from one another and the folks here at /r/entrepreneur are some of the best for aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from. 


Beyond that, I think some people here would do great work in the service industry. As such, I feel like its time for me to give back to this community by sharing some lessons… 

First, let’s rewind back to where it all began. I was employed at a small advertising agency for two years and while I thoroughly enjoyed my work, I always wanted to (1) work for myself and (2) have flexibility to travel when I want. And while it’s not something entrepreneurs say very often, I really just wanted to (3) make more money. While at this agency, I started my first blog all about marketing – Here’s what it looked [like](http://i.imgur.com/c0HCQ1h.png). 


2013 was my first year out on my own doing consulting and I earned a little over $160,000 in revenue. For me, this was awesome. I tripled what I was making as an employee and couldn’t be happier with the results. At the time, I was terrified that I would be struggling for the entire year. After expenses (my salary excluded), I sat with about $120,000 profit… At the end of last year, I was able to generate more than $250k in my second year of business.


Here are a couple of the key insights I gathered from my first two years as a consultant:

    
**Work With The Right Clients & The Right Partners**

At the moment, I’m working on two significant technology projects, writing my second book and preparing for a handful of presentations. I would likely go insane if I didn’t have such a great group of people surrounding me and in my corner. I don’t know how to give much advice on this because I really feel as if I’m just starting to figure it out but this [Venn Diagram sums it up well](http://i.imgur.com/pk9Y1Mh.png). 

I’ve made mistakes in the past of working with poor clients but I feel I’ve figured it out. I’m now picky with who I work with and solely work with clients who believe in accountability and are not interested in me telling them what they already know. 

I’ve stopped responding to RFPs and have a focus on working with B2B, startups and enterprise brands. I make some exceptions when the client has a culture fit but if it’s not something I believe in or an amazing opportunity – I pass it along to others.

Finding the right clients can be challenging. The first thing that most freelancers think they should do is set up a Facebook page and possibly a website to promote their business. If you build it, they will not come. It’s not enough to put up a website and Facebook page and call it a day for your marketing efforts. 

As a freelancer, the majority of your work will come from referrals and through word of mouth on the back of clients, friends, colleagues and acquaintances It’s more going to be important to make an effort to develop and nurture relationships with people in industries and organizations that would be interested in your services.

Here are a few of my most profitable tactics for generating new business:

**Say Yes To Great Opportunities Early On**
In the service industry, you’re only as good as your last project. If you’re not a freelancer or haven’t worked in service before – your challenge is going to be achieving credibility. If I was to rewind back to my early days of consulting, I said yes to every and any project that came across my desk. I was young, hungry and had no portfolio. Saying yes to these projects allowed me to build a quality portfolio along with a handful of case studies and references that I could leverage for future business development.

Look for potential clients who are struggling in an area you can help out in. If it’s something that you can sweep in and provide a quick win – do it! Helping potential clients achieve success early can lead to longer and bigger contracts down the road. And if you’re not already crazy busy servicing your clients; building a reputation and generating case studies at this stage will be very valuable down the road. 

**Speaking at Events**
The majority of the events that I’ve spoken at has been local or within a 10hr drive. Public speaking is one of those skills that I truly believe allowed me to separate myself from the competition. I always aim to leave an event as being the speaker that dropped jaws and left people wanting more. 

Few tips & reasons why I encourage you to get into the speaking game:

**Personal Branding On Steroids**
If you’re speaking at an event, you immediately are considered an expert in a field. As you deliver your presentation, you can either gain more credibility or lose it bit by bit. If you give a captivating presentation that turns heads and delivers value; people will take notice. People will follow you on Twitter, subscribe to your newsletter, ask for your card and associate you with your expertise or industry.

**New People = New Opportunities**
This one is pretty straightforward. The more people you meet, the better chances you will find new opportunities. If you hang out with the same people at conferences, you’re doing it wrong. Do research by looking at conference hashtags before the event and try to follow some people who will be attending. If you see someone using the hashtag that you HAVE to meet – Send them a tweet before the event and lock in some time for lunch or coffee in between sessions.

How can you find these events and conferences? Here are two of my favourite places: www.lanyrd.com/2015 and www.eventbrite.com

**Write About What You Do – Position Yourself As An Expert**

Between 2013 and 2014 I wrote more than 500k words on marketing, startups and technology. Writing has been one of my biggest generators of new business, has helped me develop my skills and has accelerated my ability to build a quality network. 

Creating content and sharing my ideas on marketing has allowed me to connect with people all over the world and help organizations across the globe achieve meaningful results for their business. Whether it’s through the writings of my recent book or through content published on various industry blogs or seeded in various networks – writing has been a driving force behind the growth of my business and existing network. 

**Strategic Coffee Meetings**

Lots of people will ask you for your time; it’s important to take the meetings that matter. When you’re starting out, the coffee meetings you take will make a huge difference down the road. It might be just an hour today but it could be the beginning of a relationship that fuels a portion of your business. 

How can you find the right people to meet with? One of the best approaches I’ve found is surrounding yourself with likeminded people. Attend events and always follow up with them after you meet. Follow up is key. From there, don’t hesitate to reach out when you’re looking for advice or have the ability to deliver them with something of value. When you meet with someone, find out how you can help him or her and then follow up trying to do exactly that. 

For example, one of my early contacts said that they were looking for someone who could help with their website redesign. So I sent them a detailed email highlighting how easy it was to use a site like 99designs.com for the design elements along with the emails of 4 contacts I found locally by using dribble and Behance. Fast forward two months later and they hired me to develop an entire content strategy.

**Join Associations or Create A Group**

A great way to generate leads and find new business opportunities is to become a member of a professional association or group. Whether you’re a member of a local chamber of commerce, industry association or volunteer on the board for a charity – all of these actions can act as a direct lane to new customers. 

If you’re not able to find an association or group that seems relevant to you; create one. I’m a member of 3 or 4 groups on Facebook where the members discuss business and share leads with one another. I’ve seen people collaborate on projects and even go from contracting each other on the side to joining forces full time.  

**Get The Right Processes & Technologies Behind You**

One of the first steps to starting a consulting business is ensuring you have the right processes and technologies behind you. Processes and technologies both play different roles but are the backbone of being able to run a consulting business effectively. 

For me, the processes and technologies I leverage daily have played a key role in allowing for sanity, growth and productivity. Here are some of them:

**KEY PROCESSES:**

* **New Business Onboarding:** Develop a standard process for the approach you take when onboarding new customers. It could be as simple as sending them a timeline that requires approval followed by the estimate. Either way, having this structure locked down ensures trust in the early days of your business.

* **Standard Project Steps:** The best thing you can do for your business is productize it by breaking out each step into chunks. For me, every project starts with “Discovery” which is when I get to know the client followed by “Planning” which is when I develop a plan (obviously) and then “Execution” which is when the creation, delivery or distribution of deliverables takes place.
* **Standard Pricing For Services:** No one likes it when you stumble over your prices. Know what you're worth and communicate it with confidence. 

Great resource is Brennan Dunn’s blog: [Double Your Freelancing Rate](http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/)

**KEY TECHNOLOGIES**

* **Freshbooks for Invoicing**: This is a service I’ve been using since I started. It’s a great service that makes it easy for sending invoices to your client and generating reports for bookkeepers and accountants. 

* **Slack For Communications**: Once you start working with other freelancers, it’s important to communicate. Slack is one of my favourite tools for communication although I’ve also used Basecamp in the past. A combination of these two tools are great for managing your projects and knowing what’s going on. 
* **Wordpress For Blogging**: This is how you build your reputation as an expert or a homebase that you can drive people to for conversion. No matter whether you’re selling dog walking services or plumbing services; Wordpress has the plugins and themes that will help you create a compelling and engaging site. 
*  **Gmail (And Plugins) For Email**: Sounds simple but Gmail and the various plugins are the key to my sanity. First and foremost, the set up is easy and managing it is a walk in the park. The plugins are the gold mine in my books. While Rapporative isn’t as good as it once was, tools like Boomerang, Canned Responses, Sidekick and my recent favourite: MixMax are amazing. 



I don’t know if you folks will find this valuable or not but I hope someone does. If just one person can take a few of these lessons and apply them to their life to get closer to financial freedom – I’ve done my job. While I’m still consulting, my focus is now shifting towards product development - one project called Hustle & Grind another called Crate.  Both are going to be very challenging for me and will push me to learn some new tricks. 

I’m excited and terrified all at the same time.  

There are a lot of more details that I can talk about, but I’ve already written a mini-novel. It's probably best that you ask questions and I'll answer them as soon as I can!

***


**FACT: You can put your ad in front of 10,000 people that need whatever you're selling for about $100-200.**


Facebook allows you to laser target people, to the extent that you can target cat-loving single moms who listen to Coldplay and play volleyball in their free time.


Whatever (almost) your market is, you can laser target them on Facebook and put your message in front of them. 

The problem is, advertising on Facebook is a bit different than on other platforms.

Unlike on Google AdWords where you can directly sell your stuff, people on Facebook are not that ready and eager to buy right away, and you need to nurture them a bit more.

But while you're going to pay $5-100/click on AdWords , if you're paying more than $3/click on Facebook, you're doing something wrong. This allows for much higher returns on ad spend. 

There are some ridiculous examples - my buddy once got something like $55,000 in sales with $150-200 spent on a campaign. Now that was 95% luck, as his client was a roofing company, there was a huge storm in the area and leads closed fast. Don't expect this kind of results to be the norm. 

But - in my (strongly biased) opinion Facebook is the best way to get new business, when done right.


**I hear a lot of ""But Facebook ads don't work for my business"" statements.** In 99% of the times, there's somebody who's doing the exact same thing that you are doing, and is absolutely killing it with Facebook ads. 

Why most of the people fail with FB usually falls in one of these 3 categories (or all 3 at once):  
1. They don't understand what goes into a successful Facebook campaign  
2. They quit to early  
3. They hire the wrong person/company  


All these problems can be avoided by educating yourself first. Even if you don't fall into the service business category, read this post as it will help you understand how advertising on Facebook works in general.


What I'm going to show you is a specific process for getting new business for service type businesses, that's working right now.




  

These types of campaigns, when optimized, generally bring in 3x-20x ROI - I know this is a huge range, but the rule of thumb is, the bigger your ticket is, the ROI will be bigger. So if you're selling a $5000 service, your ROI will be bigger than somebody who's selling a $500 service. It will also depend on **how good you are in sales (or your salespeople)**, because the sale usually happens on the phone, or in person.

This is by no means a magic-pill - it takes hard work, but I'm about  to make it a lot easier for you, and if you apply it, your business is going to be very thankful. 

**I'd not advise you to get into paid traffic if you don't have at least $2k-3k/month to put aside to invest** - paid traffic is awesome and brings fast results (unlike SEO) but you need to spend money first for testing and finding what works. If you're on a tight budget and can't afford to lose some money, you could get yourself in trouble.

Let's get into it.

#Intro to Facebook Ads

First thing to understand is that with Facebook ads (and with any online/offline marketing channel) the **actual ad mechanics are just 10-20% of what goes into a successful campaign**. By mechanics I mean the actual ad setup, bidding, all the little clicks you need to do in Facebook ads manager.  

(I'm not going to describe the little clicks and steps you need to take in Ads Manager/Power Editor here - you can easily find that on Youtube and some of it in the links I provide on the bottom of the post.)  

What really makes the most impact is the **actual psychology behind it,** and what happens after someone clicks on your ad.
That's the difference between a losing campaign, and a 20x ROI campaign. 


Second thing to understand is CONTEXT of Facebook:


1. Facebook is a content platform. Which means that people are there to consume, create and share content.  

2. Facebook is a social platform. Which means that people are there to interact, communicate with and enjoy their friends and family.


Meaning that if you crack the code, your ads will be successful, AND you'll get free traffic and endorsement.  
Here's a good example: http://imgur.com/a/Ki4Pj   


This was a really successful ad that gone somewhat viral (credit repair niche) - most of the comments are people inquiring and tagging other people. That means, FREE traffic. Free traffic=free money.

 If you treat Facebook for what it is (content+social), Facebook will treat you well right back.



#**Here's how the method works in short (simplified):**



So how this works in practice is (oversimplified): 

1. Targeted people (potential customers) are going to see your ads in their news feed
2. They are going to click and read an educational/promotional article that you created 
3. Some of those people will be interested in your service and will give you your info in exchange for a ""hook"" right away
4. You're going to use Retargeting to send people who read your article to your Lead Capture page where they will turn into leads.
5. You will followup with the leads and a good percentage of them will become your clients/customers.

The moving parts of this method are:  

* Offer/hook
* Lead Capture page  
* An educational article related to your service
* Facebook ads


***

##**Step 1. Do the research and dial in on your ideal customer**  

If you don't have a deep understanding of your audiences problems, desires and needs, you can't make this work. I consistently see people failing with Facebook and saying that it doesn't work - It works, but you have to understand your audience/ideal customer first.  

This is where a lot of people fail or skip this step altogether. **Before creating a successful marketing campaign on any channel, you have to know how your customer thinks, breathes, and acts.** Use websites like Google, quantcast and Facebook's audience insights. Here the things you should know before even starting to execute a marketing campaign:

* Age  
* Gender  
* Relationship status  
* Kids/no kids  
* Net worth  
* Home Value  
* Renters/Owners  
* Interests  
* Income  
* Why do they need your service  
* When do they need your service  
* Their fears and desires  
* When do they use internet
* Do they access internet via desktop or mobile
* What kind of words they use when describing the problem your service solves
* What do they hate about your and similar services and how could you get them rid of that?
  
  
This is crucial. The research will help you with targeting your customers, crafting the actual messaging and coming up with a converting offer. 
***


##**Step 2. Come up with 3 different hooks/magnets for attracting leads**    
  
Now that you have the actual knowledge on who is going to buy, you need to come up with an angle of approach, an actual ""hook"" that's going to make them leave their data/inquire about your services.  
  
This is the most important part of your strategy. You can make amazing ads, have the best targeting and service in the world, but if your hook does not make them bite, you will fail. 

##Job of the hook is to get people to **leave their information and express their interest** in exchange for something.
Job of the hook is not to sell the service (Just yet). 


Hook can be either **direct** or **indirect**. If you're using a direct hook, you're usually going to spend more per lead, but the transition to sale will be more direct as well. 


Since we have such a variety of businesses here, there's no hard rule but here are some examples that I found work as a hook: 

Direct:  

* Free estimate  
* $XXX Discount 
* Straight up pushing the sale ( eg. Looking for a new roof? Get it done by professionals, submit your info and we'll call you back)

Indirect:

* Free part of the service
* Free consultation
* Lower end service for free (if you have a range of services)

Industry-specific examples to get your creativity flowing:

* Free teeth checkup
* 15 minutes consultation on improving your credit score
* $50 Hairstylist discount

Be creative here - if you have a hair salon you can offer a lower end service for FREE, to get them trough the door and then upsell.  

For niches like **Home Remodeling, Loans, HVAC, Roofing a more direct approach will usually do - get an estimate or a discount** You'll also have a more direct path to a sale. 
 But TEST everything, it will make a difference between paying $20 or $200 for a lead.


***
##**Step 3. Create 3 Lead Capture pages, one for each hook**   
***
Lead Capture page is a page that you're going to send your traffic (Facebook clicks) to. A lot of business owners make the mistake of sending people to their homepage.  You should NEVER do that, as the homepage usually has too many distractions, and is not designed (usually) to convert visitors to leads. 

Here's an example of a great looking lead capture page: http://imgur.com/a/vD7Ty  
It's clean, it has a clear purpose and the next step, it's benefit driven.


Here's a perfect example of what a lead capture page shouldn't look like: http://imgur.com/a/CoDqd   
It looks like it's from 1995, it's ugly, there's no social proof, there's no clear direction, everything.

##** Only goal** of the lead capture page is to **turn visitors into leads** aka make them leave their information in exchange for your ""hook""(free estimate, discount, etc.).  

Since you have 3 different hooks - you will need 3 separate lead capture pages. The design can be practically the same, but you will use different copy (text) and/or images to match different hooks. Luckily, you don't have to pay $100s or $1000s for each - you can easily create one yourself using https://www.clickfunnels.com/ or https://www.leadpages.net/.



Here's what your Lead Capture page **has** to have for maximum conversion: 

##1. Powerful benefits based headline  

The headline should clearly and **specifically** tell visitors what's in it for them, nothing more. Don't talk about yourself, talk about what's in it for them.  

Bad headline: Top #1 Dentist in Canada  (You can use this as social proof/subheadline though)

Good Headline: Get a Professional $250 Teeth Checkup for Free
##2. Form for data submission (phone,email,name, etc)  

These are the blank fields where visitors enter their contact and other info. Don't ask for more than you need! Every extra step will lower the conversion rate. Caveat: I had a few situations where my clients told me that the leads were not qualified enough - in that case ADD a few extra qualifying questions to the form. 

##3. Clear and visible call to action button  

Call to action button and headline need to be the **2 most visible things on your lead capture page.** First things the visitors need to notice are 1. What will they get and 2. What to do next.  

Call to action button should specifically state what to do next - people need to be instructed (you'd be amazed by the extent of this).

P.S. I just started testing a first person button with one of my clients - it seems to work great. Instead of ""Click here to get XXX"" test ""Yes, I want XXX"".


##4. Contact number  

Some people just prefer to use the phone - don't let them drop off and give them that option. Put it in the upper right corner or beneath the call to action button. 

If you don't, you're going to lose sales - a few months ago I forgot to put a number on a client lead capture page, and after fixing the mistake, we got an increase of $1000-2000 in  **extra sales from the calls** each month, while the adspend stayed the same. 

##5. Urgency/Scarcity

The less there is of something, the more valuable it is. Much more people will take you up on your hook/offer if it's limited. You can limit it by a) time and b) quantity. 




##6. Social Proof (Testimonials and the likes)  

This is yet another of 6 principles of influence - and it will drastically improve your conversions. 

**People trust products and services other people use and find helpful**, that's hardwired into our brain (Social Feedback). 

Add a couple of testimonials under your form and CTA button. You can also add a sub-headline that says something like ""Trusted by 4483 happy customers"" - works like a charm.  


##Make it mobile optimized - a lot of the traffic will come from mobile. 
Clickfunnels does this for you automatically.

##Put a Facebook Pixel on your Lead Capture page and on your Thank you page ( a simple page that says Thank You, after visitors submit their info). You'll need this for tracking conversions. You can find instructions on youtube. 











***

##**Step 4. Create an educational article directly related to your offer/service** 


Since we know that people on Facebook love content, that's exactly what we're going to give them (at first).


For this, you're going to need a promotional/educational article that is ***directly related to your service.***

The goal of the article is to educate people, position your company as the authority on the subject and to bring people closer to the desired outcome - sale. It serves as the first ""bridge"" between the sale. We're also going to use an article as a tool for improving your targeting (more on that in the ads section).


Here are a few formats that work well for the article:  

1. How to get xxx (positive result your customers want)  

2. How to avoid/solve xxx (problem your potential customers have)  

3. How Jane Doe (your customer) got xxx (positive result)  
4. How Jane Doe (your customer) solved xxx (problem)  
5. Top 5 Benefits of solving xxx (problem your customers have)  
6. How solving problem xxx improves your life  
7. How achieving xxx result improves your life  
8. Number #1 thing to avoid to avoid when hiring xxx (service provider)  


Think about what your potential customers **would be interested in reading.** Actual examples (""case studies"" (3 and 4)) are usually best because they are actual testimonials in disguise, and you demonstrate how you already helped someone. 

Get creative with the headlines - think mild clickbait.


##The more specific you are about the problems being solved and for whom - you'll get better results.

If you can make it fun - even better.
If you're not good with this, just hire a writer to do it for you. Even better - hire a direct response copywriter, he'll know exactly what to do.

#When you write the article, add a soft call to action linking to your lead capture page at the bottom of your article.

We need to get people from reading content, **to taking some kind of action**. A small percentage of people will be ready to take you up on your hook right away. Most of them won't - but we will use retargeting to show ads to them and convert them later.


**Add a Facebook pixel from your account to this page.** 





***

















#Step 5. Create kick-ass ads and show them to the right people 

And only NOW you can proceed to the actual ad creation. 

##Goal of your ad is to get people's attention and make qualified people CLICK.

Job of the ad is not to sell your service, the goal of the ad is to sell the click.

There are 3 elements that make an ad successful: 

##1. Targeting 


There are 4 general ""categories"" you can target: Interests, demographics, behaviors, and location. I know a lot of people struggle with targeting - but if you understand your customers it's really not that hard. Here's a look inside Facebook's Audience Insights,  tool that you can use to help you with your targeting: http://imgur.com/a/ebBfl 
 
Now I'm going to make targeting MUCH easier for you and make it better at the same time. 

Facebook spent and spends millions of dollars on developing their algorithm - and you're going to leverage it using **Lookalike Audiences**. Lookalike audiences are audiences of people that are similar (based on MASSIVE amount of data Facebook has about you and everybody else) to your customers/leads. Here's what to do:

1. If you have a customer list(Phone Numbers or Emails) , upload it to Facebook, and create a Lookalike Audience off of that.
2. If you don't have a customer list use Facebook's basic targeting (based on your customer profile) to send 250-500 clicks to your pixeled educational article, and create a Lookalike audience from those people (who clicked on your ad and read the article). If your article is directly related to your offer, that will be people who are laser targeted.

(This takes a couple of clicks in ads manager, you can find it on Google/Youtube)

Based on this, you will get a big targeted list of people that are potential customers for your business. You can not do this better than Facebook's own algorithm (unless you're an expert). If you're a location-based business, you'll need to narrow it down by your location. Pretty common sense. 

Now, if you want to get all NINJA (not necessary), you can target even more - by narrowing down your Lookalike Audience by an interest/behavior/demographics. For example, you can use your Lookalike Audience as a base for targeting, but say only show ads to people that are in your Lookalike Audience AND are homeowners.

##2. Copy (Ad and headline text)

This will vary based on the type of ads and your business, but here are some directions: 

* Check your grammar - make sure it's perfect
* Make it BENEFIT based, instead of FEATURE based
* Try starting your ads with questions
* Specifically address your potential customer
* Try to use language your customers use when describing your service/their problems
* Explicitly instruct customer to click
* Check out Facebook Ad Guidelines to know what words you can use (so you don't get your acc banned)
* Make sure the copy (wording etc.) is CONSISTENT with pages where you send traffic to

Before creating ads - go to [Adespresso's ad library](https://adespresso.com/academy/ads-examples/). You can find great examples there from almost all industries that will help you craft your ads.

##3. Images

Images are super important - if the image sucks, people will just scroll over your ad without noticing it. Now, the thing about images is that you can't know what works before you test it. So with any campaign you start - start with testing 5 images. 

Make sure your images are **related to your service** and **consistent with your landing page**. Images that are in contrast with Facebook's colours usually work better. Using smiling people (especially women) helps (if it's related to your service). 

Stay away from obvious stock photos.

You'll need to set of ads - one to send people to your article, and one to send people who saw the article to your lead capture page. 

Write at least 2 different copy variations, and pick 5 images for each set.

You will place your ads in the NEWS FEED, where all the attention is. Both mobile newsfeed and desktop newsfeed: http://imgur.com/a/z5mUc

#Ads 1 - Sending people to your article

First batch of ads should be optimized for Website Clicks. (http://imgur.com/a/OHp0A). You'll choose that in Ads Manager when creating the campaign (http://imgur.com/a/tVKul) - instead of ""Conversion"", pick ""Website Clicks"". That means that Facebook will show your ads to people that are most likely to click.

#Ads 2 - Sending people to your lead capture page

This batch of ads should be optimized for Website Conversions using the FB pixel. Conversion will mean that somebody has seen your Thank You page, meaning that they submitted their info.  For this campaign - **you will only target people who have read your article.**

##After the campaign spends $50-200, check what ads are performing the best and turn off the other ones. When increasing budgets, DON'T increase for more than 15-20%/day, it will mess up your click and lead costs. 

From time to time you will need to switch up your ad copy and images, because people get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. In your ad stats you can see the **frequency** - that's a number that shows how many times on average your ad was shown to the same person. Track that and don't let it go over 5-10. 

Some metrics you can keep an eye on:  

1. Click trough rate (CTR)  
2. Cost per 1000 views (CPM)  
3. Cost per click  
4. Cost per conversion  
5. Frequency (how many times your ad has been shown to the same person on avg)  

While these will be a good indicator on which ads are performing -**the only important metric, in the end, is are you making more money than you're spending.**
 

***

#Step 6. Follow-up and close ($$$)


Now that people are reading your article and converting into qualified leads - it's time for you to follow up and close!

Depending on whether you used a direct or indirect hook, and what you used as a hook, this process will be different for everyone, but you need to follow-up and make the sale/upsell happen. 

One really important thing here: **The longer you wait to contact the lead, the colder it becomes. Money loves speed.**

Here's a **SUPER COOL** trick to massively help you with this.

Using https://www.eztexting.com/ (or similar services)  you can set up Automatic SMS messages. 

What you want to do is make the software, every time a lead is submitted, sends a message saying (depending on your hook/context) eg: ""Hey - thanks for showing your interest in XXX. When is the best time to call you/do whatever the hook was? YourNameYourCompany""

**Make it personal**, people want to communicate with people, not computers.

791,7inu7t,False,AMA,315,"Will Earn $120k This Year from Blog and YT Channel - What To Do With Extra Cash? Also, AMA You Want!",Entrepreneur,"Some of you might know me from my [income report posts here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/59baw8/finally_hit_10kmonth_revenue_with_my_blog_income/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit) on /r/Entrepreneur ... Here's the quick tl;dr ↓

I run a style blog and YT channel called The Modest Man. It took a few years for it to become a ""full time"" operation, and the growth has been really cool to see since 2013:

- 2013: $2k
- 2014: $8k
- 2015: $36k
- 2016: $89k
- 2017: $120k
- 2018: $170k (projected)

September of this year was a record month for revenue at a little over $12k. Looking at [Q3 2017](https://www.themodestman.com/income-report-q3-2017/), after expenses and taxes, the business put about $6,250 in my pocket each month.

So, I'm by no means rich, but I'm almost at the point where I could hire someone (I have a part-time assistant now), and I have extra cash to put back into the business, which is really interesting. Up until this year, I was just trying to make a living and survive. Now the question, ""What's the best way to use this extra cash?""

Some options are:

- Ramp up the existing model (hire writers, social media people, video editors, etc.)
- Create physical products (clothing line, merch, accessories, etc.)
- Invest in real estate (rental properties, developers)
- Sock it away in retirement accounts (I have an IRA that I max out, but I could - open a SEP or a non-retirement investment account)
- Buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
- Start another, completely different business
- Upgrade my lifestyle (probably wouldn't do this, but it *is* an option that's worth mentioning)

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, especially if you've been in this situation with your business and have some experience/advice.

Also, I'd love to answer any questions you have about blogging, getting traffic, SEO, monetization, sponsorships and creating content.

\- No refunds on tickets that are cancelled even though I am pretty sure that the artists and event organizers (in some cases) have not been paid.

\- No way to get real time feedback on how the event is until you buy the tickets and walk in to find it empty or just a bad experience.

A few months ago I ended up at the [very top of the frontage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3pj9d5/i_started_a_mens_underwear_company_selling_over/) for r/entrepreneur when I launched my second Kickstarter campaign for my comfortable boxer briefs.

Many enjoyed reading the story and how-to’s… so, in the spirit of sharing, I thought i’d tell you how things have moved along since then.

I’ve since relaunched with 9 different product lines, refined the products extensively, improved the manufacturing process, replaced my platforms, completely changed the branding, and reached $500k in total sales. I'm stocked up on inventory for the rest of the year and I have a growth plan in place.

This post explains exactly how I got here, what tools i’m using, and what i’m planning on doing next. I urge you to keep the conversation productive, asking any questions you may have, big or small, and please keep the criticism polite. Suggestions and critiques are always welcome! 

First, a quick background:

**Milestones in the Past 8 months**

* [First Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/premium-boxer-briefs-ridiculous-comfort-at-a-fair) - $142k - July 2015
* [Second Kickstarter Launch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/comfortableboxers/ultra-comfortable-mens-underwear-at-a-fair-price) - $219k - October 2015
* [New Branding, Website, and Product Launch](https://comfortableclub.com/) - January 2016

**The Refined Concept Behind Comfortable Club**

We started off naming the company The Comfortable Boxers Co.  It works well for SEO and gave it a nice unbranded feel to it, which resonated with those not willing to pay premiums. After striking the underwear market on a fairly significant level and with intentions of expanding our product line, a lot of thought went into a re-branding. In planning for monthly subscriptions services for our apparel, we’ve opted for a lifestyle brand with a primary focus on quality, comfort, and pricing. We arrived at [Comfortable Club.](https://comfortableclub.com) 

The whole theme revolves around the idea that we shouldn’t have to overpay for premium apparel, so, quite realistically, the product line can expand into many areas. For now, though, we’re mainly focused on underwear, undershirts, and lounge products. 

Our name says it all. We make a premium line of obsessively engineered, ridiculously cozy underwear and lounge apparel – and deliver them at half the price of retail. Harry’s did it for razors. Casper did it for mattresses. Now, at Comfortable Club, we’re doing it for underwear and loungewear: building a great, premium brand that reflects the things that customers care about today: quality, cost, convenience and, of course, comfort. 

**Premium at a Fair Price**

An immediate reaction from some of you will be: ""Why would I pay $16 for a pair of underwear? I can buy X and Y for Z."" My job since the very beginning was to convince customers why modal fabric is worth it, because your day absolutely changes when you're wearing these bad boys. Except this time, you won't be paying Calvin Klein or other brands over $35 for a pair. But I won't go into too much marketing lingo here, because the point of this post is to show you just how I managed to cut the price and built a sustainable business around the concept. Let's begin:

**Bridging the Sourcing Gap**

Quality underwear requires quality craft, so we partnered with the the best factory and fabric engineering experts we could find. The process was extremely long and patience was essential. First off, shy away from resellers and agents (aka Alibaba), do your research, find a sourcing partner, and go straight to the factory, the same ones used by high-end brands.

Our relationships with the manufacturing plants are very close. So close, in fact, that during the peak manufacturing timeline we actually LIVE in the factory. This is part of our quality control program, which we’ll describe later. You see, the tricky part about sourcing is making sure you get a consistently high-quality product. Apart from a lack of organization, this is precisely the problem that plagues small businesses. Because small businesses usually don’t follow-up with recurring orders to the factory, the supplier is usually hands off once the product is on the boat. If you can establish a clear, long-term relationship, set your requirements up front, and have a presence in the process, you're set. 

We learned this when sourcing metal sheet rolls for a multinational roofing company, so we opted for a closer relationship with the supplier. We established a permanent presence in Shanghai in partnership with a small sourcing office. This means we have feet on the ground in the factory, can supervise every step, and we establish our own quality control programs (at our expense of course).

**Building Something Beautiful Through Manufacturing**

Early in our research (of which I also mean shopping around and trying everything out there), I learned there are three key factors that impact comfort: the stitching, fit, and fabrics. So in creating our underwear, we put a meticulous -- some might say, obsessive -- amount of attention into each of those areas.

The devil, as they say, is in the details, and when it comes to underwear, stitching is one that tends to get overlooked. We use a more robust, sturdier stitching in our products that make them last, while maintaining their comfort. But we shied away from traditional threads and opted for fluffy threads reserved only for the most luxurious winter apparel for a completely itch-free experience. Look closely at any pair of Comfortable Club undergarments, you can see the uniquely intricate, tight knit puffy stitch. 

We opted for 92% modal fabric, an eco-friendly microfiber that enfolds the body in a light embrace. Modal is smooth, soft, and breathable, and its luscious texture feels similar to silk. It’s cool to the touch, super absorbent, and resistant to shrinkage and fading. In short, it’s the perfect microfiber fabric for body-hugging underwear.

Stitching, fit, fabrics. It’s a relatively simple formula, but the result is something pretty spectacular: underwear that looks great -- and feels even better.  

**The Actual Manufacturing Process**

Here’s a generalized model of the prototype and final manufacturing process for a new product:

* Initial size, die-cut, stitching, waistband & fabric specifications created
* Textile production for prototypes
* Dyeing process for prototypes
* Prototype testing with real-world use
* Revisions for prototypes
* Revised prototypes created using same textile
* Prototype testing under more scenarios
* Sizing trials
* Final exact manufacturing specifications created
* Demand planning
* Manufacturing order created
* Quality control program created and programmed. Hiring process for quality control specialists begins.
* Textile production - depending on the factory, this is done in-house or outsourced
* Dyeing process
* Waistband production
* Quality control runs
* Lab testing for fabric weight, color fastness, and shrinkage
* Fabric cutting
* Quality control runs
* Revisions, if needed
* Packaging specs created
* Packaging order created
* Stitching and crafting
* Final quality control runs
* Revisions, if needed
* Ironing and folding
* Packaging and labeling
* Final check and count
* Loading onto container
* Freight shipping - FOB to door
* Receiving at the warehouse

Prototype as many times as you have to. Each round takes over a month of work, but the version you take to market has to be as perfect as possible. It's important to specify exact sizing guidelines and templates for every aspect of the product. Design specific packaging guidelines, including product tagging, warning messages on bags, SKU and UPC labels, and specify items per case. Color codes must be clearly stated. Fabric weight, fade, and shrinkage minimums and maximums be specified and tested. As an example, we raised our fabric weight to 190g/m2, and lowered our fade and shrinkage ceiling to 1%.

**Quality Control**

When you’re manufacturing thousands and thousands of items that involve a manual process, you can’t rely on a ‘set-and-forget’ attitude. Our quality control process involves actual third-party lab testing with SGS. We also send our own personnel to the factory.

After finalizing the prototype phase and finalizing specs, we establish a strict defect-rate ceiling at 1% and randomly test up to 10% of the products to control for this. The sample size is large enough to be a good representation of the entire product. Of course, some defective items sneak through the cracks, but as long as you can keep it below 1%, you’re golden.

To reach this rate, however, we tripled our quality control staff and rejected every anomaly. We ended up rejecting a whole blue textile batch that led to a few delays.

**Demand Planning**

Quantities to produce depend highly on your demand model. With our initial Kickstarter campaign, we produced the amount pre-ordered on the campaign and at least an additional 50% for recurring orders. Problem is, we ran out of inventory within the first month! Lesson learned.

For our second Kickstarter campaign, we produced an additional 800% of total items spread out through 9 different product lines. For this reason, the transition into e-commerce was smoothly executed. Being out of stock is probably the most dangerous thing for your business.

As for quantities per size and color, black and gray are always the most popular ones by about 50% more than other colors. Sizing usually goes as follows:

* S - 15%
* M - 45%
* L - 25%
* XL - 10%
* 2XL - 5%

This, of course, depends on your target market. But this model has done rather well for us so far. We also extended our offerings to include Lounge Pants, Undershirts, and a Women's Underwear line. The same model applies for all.

**Presenting Your Product**

In presenting our product to the world, we could’ve opted for any local model and called it a day. we also could’ve sent our products over to a photographer that specializes in this type of photography. We truly believe we wouldn’t be here, telling you our story, if we had done this. 

We instead researched the LA market for the best models we could find. They did cost us quite a bit, but the results speak for themselves. We personally flew to California, brought our own trustworthy photographer with us, rented a beautiful house on Airbnb, got some studio space, and ran the whole photoshoot ourselves. 

For any product you sell online, you’ll need to create lifestyle images, e-commerce images, and product images. The theme around the lifestyle images depend on how you want your brand to be perceived.

As for [retail packaging,](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Comfortable_Club_Packaging-10.jpg?6884464036085610274) these were created as a showcase and ‘show off’ concept. More on that later.

**Optimize Your Storefront**

The [Comfortable Club](https://comfortableclub.com) shopping experience starts the minute customers hit our website. The landing page says exactly what we do and transitions into our whole product catalogue. For this and many other reasons, we’ve built and designed the site for unlimited growth potential and scalability using Shopify’s excellent platform. 

Optimized for conversion? You bet it is. We’ve removed tiny roadblocks that shave off seconds from the shopping experience, like custom developed color and size swatches instead of drop down menus, as well as plus and minus selectors instead of a number input form. [Every little improvement counts.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Buybox.jpg?4437860519955730119)

We’ve also made the navigation menu sticky and always visible for easy browsing. On top of that, the mega nav menu (the pop-up that shows up after hovering over SHOP) helps customers understand how our products are categorized and allows for easy browsing at any time, regardless of which page you’re on.

The website is always a work in progress. We’re constantly fixing tiny bit that improve the experience ever so lightly. After-all, it's all a numbers and psychology game.

**Automated E-mail Flows**

E-mail is a beautiful art. It’s also the highest converting platform out there. I’ve set-up my platform using [Klaviyo](http://klaviyo.com/) and pop-ups using [Privy.](http://www.privy.om) They integrate very nicely with Shopify and pull in a great deal of data that allows you to segment e-mails and create flows rather easily. As for e-mail design, [here's an example of an abandoned cart e-mail.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/email.jpg?1514475351117951741)

Cart abandonment e-mails are what some people call ‘low hanging fruit’ and are huge drivers for conversion rates. It’s important to reassure your customer that you have his back.

**The Enterprise Resource Planning System**

Our ERP and information systems are designed to maintain exact inventory counts in every warehouse, with real-time visibility that allows us to plan our manufacturing requirements ahead of time, so we can grow with demand, instead of behind it. 

A lot of testing went into choosing the right platform. The first and most important criteria is integration abilities with my other platforms. Second, automation functionality. We opted for the beautifully operated [Stitch Labs](http://stitchlabs.com/) inventory management platform as my centralized hub. It handles all my sales channels, including Shopify and upcoming Amazon and eBay openings. We then assign a fulfillment warehouse to each one, and using the new 3PL integration functionality, orders flow back and forth. We designed workflows and established flow parameters like shipment mappings based on weight and destination. Stitch Labs handles the rest, including a complete accounting integration with Quickbooks. 

A new feature i'm probably going to end-up using is product bundling, which means I can finally build a virtual SKU composed of multiple existing SKU's. Stitch reports an inventory level of the SKU with the lowest availability. This will serve well for ‘packs’. 

Reporting is robust enough to handle manufacturing requirements planning (MRP) and deep level sales insights, including customer loyalty and variant splits. I’m completely in love with it.

**Automated Freight Logistics**

Our logistics partner, Flexport, combines the power of the cloud and uses a proprietary bidding technology that guarantees the best rates and shipping times from our factory, all while streamlining the online-only process that eliminates paperwork and errors. 

I go with [FOB to Door.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/IMG_1033.jpg?10601425246704194831) Customs, paperwork, and communications are handled entirely by the Flexport team.

**Automated Fulfillment and the Science of Shipping**

If you run a small operation in the hundreds of items of total inventory and can find the time to spend a couple of hours a day picking, packing, sealing, labeling, and dropping off orders at the post office, by all means, do so and use Shipstation for this. If you have a small amount of SKU’s but a couple thousand items, you can upgrade to a 3PL like Fulfillrite. On the other hand, when inventory counts start getting into the tens of thousands with hundreds of SKU’s, when you expect significant growth, and when you start requiring advanced order routing, you move into a larger, more established, 3PL with advanced connectivity features.

We opted for the latter with DCL Logistics.

We have the capacity to store, pick, pack, and ship any volume with same-day fulfillment and an optimized arrangement that places the popular items closer to the picking line. We also use special bar-coding in every single item to guarantee order accuracy -- making order confusion or missing items a thing of the past. In short, we moved in with the big boys!

We have 180 SKU’s over 9 product lines. Keeping track of each one is hard, but our 3PL handles it beautifully. Bear in mind, an organized inventory is crucial and begins from the factory, especially in regards to proper tagging an labeling. [Registration with GS1](http://www.gs1us.org/) for a proper UPC code was crucial for the process, especially if we want to expand to retailers or Amazon. 

The implementation process with a logistics provider of their caliber does require quite a bit of customization and know-how. The way we have it set-up is:

* Order received on sales channel
* Order pushed to Stitch Labs
* Invoice pushed to Quickbooks for immediate realization of income
* Order pushed to respective warehouse with mapped shipping
* 30 minute grace period for order changes
* Items picked, packed, and shipped
* Shipping notice sent back to Stitch Labs with packing list
* Stitch Labs triggers the shipment notification e-mail according to packing list
* Stitch Labs sends Costs of Goods sold info to Quickbooks to immediately realization of expense

The 3PL receive orders from Stitch Labs through the custom-developed API, granting a 30 minute window before the order is locked from any changes (for customers that make mistakes in their orders). They've since published this 3PL connectivity feature to all customers. They pick and pack, ship, and spit back tracking information to Stitch which triggers the shipment confirmation e-mail on Shopify. If yout can't develop an API between Stitch and your 3PL, you can bridge this connection via Shipstation.

The result? [Same-day shipping](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/100_0213.JPG?8245723273761910188) on orders placed before 12:30PM EST. That’s unheard of for a small business!

The implementation process took about 2 months, which I consider to be a good thing. One-click 3PL's are very limited in functionality, whereas custom designed connectors have given me the ability to process returns, handle special rules like box sizing, and perfectly expandable features like EDI’s with large retailers. As an example, the new Amazon competitor Jet.com handles most of their sales through EDI connections with other merchants.

As for shipping providers, USPS is always the best way to go with average shipping times of 1 to 4 days. Our competitors use Fedex Smartpost or UPS Mail Innovations, services that save a few cents over USPS. The twist? They sort the packages and hand over the pre-sorted bulk to USPS anyways, except this time USPS has no incentive to deliver quickly.

**Accounting**

Last, but of course not least: accounting. Yes, you guessed it: also automated. Stitch Labs spits out all invoices in one single format, regardless of the sales channel it received it from, and then sends out costs of goods sold to Quickbooks once the item is shipped. All we're left to do is match bank transactions and deposits with the appropriate group of invoices.

Accounting takes us about 1 hour a week. Bear in mind, the implementation and work-flow design process took months. But remember, [preparation is key!](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280)

Take the time to learn accounting. Take a quick course or read an accounting book. It's worth the effort, as this is the base by which your business runs. It's not as simple as how much cash you have in the bank. When long-term inventory planning is involved, knowing your numbers on a deep level is crucial. 

**[THE WHOLE PICTURE](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/Macro_Operations_Diagram.001.jpeg?4487767735057772902)**

So, can we agree that automation is your best friend. What it comes down to is this: at Comfortable Club, we have the logistics of a Fortune 500 company -- without the Fortune 500 overhead. You might ask, what does all this streamlining, automating and general process-hacking get us?

It gets us the ability to run our entire operation -- thousands of dollars of orders across multiple SKUs every month --  as a one-man show. That’s right: the “we” we’ve been talking about this whole time? Well, it’s mostly just me. More on that in a minute.

**Platforms I Use**

All of my platforms have been carefully selected to be compatible with each other. It took months of work to get them talking in such a way that requires minimal maintenance:

* Inventory, Planning, and Sales: [Stitch Labs](http://www.stitchlabs.com/)
* Ecommerce: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/)
* Custom development: [Codementor](http://codementor.io/) and [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/)
* E-mail flows: [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) - Much much better than any other platform I’ve tried
* E-mail Pop-ups: [Privy](http://www.privy.com) - Connects beautifully with Klaviyo
* Sales Taxes: [Taxjar](http://www.taxjar.com/) - Counts taxes from every sales channel and creates a beautiful liability report
* Accounting: [Quickbooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/move-to-quickbooks-online/)
* Kickstarter Order Organization: [Backerkit](http://backerkit.com/)
* Kickstarter Shipments Pushed to 3PL: [Shipstation](http://www.shipstation.com/)
* Packaging: [Pakible](https://pakible.com/) (not connected but awesome supplier nonetheless)
* Freight: [Flexport](http://flexport.com/)

Getting them to communicate is a matter of understanding accounting on a basic level, maintaining organized information, and mapping things correctly. In making them work, I've developed wonderful relationships with the support teams from all of these platforms.

**The Almighty Profit Margin**

I’ve noticed that the topic always goes into a heated discussion, and I have a few things to say about this: some markets require a deep commitment to an aggressive pricing strategy before you can start poking around looking for customers. And no, not anyone can price something low and sell thousands.

We required heavy investments in advertising to get noticed. It's only when you have validated your product, carrying a loyal fanbase of users, when you notice a strong rate of repeat customers, and when you can convince new ones easily that you can demonstrate long-term value and can start realizing healthy streaming profits.

This is the point at which i’m in. I’ve invested every single profitable dollar, funneling it into better photography, product prototyping, new product development, improved quality control programs, new advertising methods, and the development of my automated platforms. 

Here’s the breakdown of factors you have to consider in your profit margins:

* Item cost - this cost is realized once it leaves the warehouse to the customer. In the meantime, it’s considered an asset in your balance sheet.
* Packaging 
* Quality Control 
* Freight
* Import duties 
* Commissions & Credit Card Processing Fees
* Kickstarter Fee
* Receiving and unloading
* Storage and warehouse space
* Insurance
* Picking and packing per item charges
* Per order fulfillment charges
* Actual shipping charges
* Advertising with Google PPC, Facebook, and Retargeting (starting mid-May)
* Photography and Models
* Influencer Marketing
* Video Production, although I handled all the video production myself, including the editing
* Cloud platforms and monthly charges
* Payroll for any employees
* Travel expenses

**Social Proof and Reviews are Key**

Like we said, we had a hunch that we weren’t alone in our quest for better, more comfortable underwear. So rather than waste time and money on expensive validation studies and market tests, we took it straight to the market -- and the results were beyond what even we expected. 

In Summer ‘15, we launched our first crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. Less than a month later, we’d raised more than $142,000 and sold over 15,000 pairs of boxer briefs. So, being common-sense people, we launched a second, follow-on campaign, which went on to sell an additional $219,000.

All told, we have attained over 7,000 customers in less than 6 months and shipped over 30,000 items -- providing powerful proof that Comfortable Club has [struck a chord with customers.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1059/8984/files/reviews001-udmlmgwsvx.jpeg?12664222863729221570)

Next steps are opening up the Amazon sales channel and getting in on PR outreach. As I mentioned on my previous posts, I’m shying away from expensive PR agencies and handling the outreach myself. It’s all about convincing influencers, bloggers, and publications to try on your product. And who better to do that than yourself?

**About Me**

The inspiration for Comfortable Club came after I tried my first pair of premium underwear. I believed in the premium aspect, but couldn’t quite reconcile myself to the idea of shelling out $300 to replenish my underwear supply. Having worked as a supply chain and planning director for a multinational company, I knew only too well that problems with product pricing start upstream, so I put my supply chain and sourcing experience to work to develop a better, more budget-friendly solution. I also worked as director for an SAP implementation initiative on a 500-large multinational company - being the main driver for my knowledge in accounting, systems, and integrations.

The pizza parlor dude likely couldn't afford a business manager, an accountant, an attorney, a bookeeper, a marketing team, and still run the pizza parlor effectively..... let alone experience as a chef.

Or do you just think it's as simple as following a recipe and producing cookie cutter pizzas to perfection every time?

I understand your point and all the dreamers in here will likely downvote me but anyone who has started a successful business can tell you that you need to be the one running the company and have the experience and knowledge to do so.

I'm working in a growth marketing agency. Marketing tools are 30% of what we do, so we use them a lot and experiment with the new ones as much as possible.

There are thousands of tools and it's easy to get lost, so I wanted to share the tools we use most on a daily basis. And divide the list into 14 categories.

I thought this could be handy for Entrepreneurs subreddit.

Why adopt tools? I see marketing tools as tireless colleagues. If you can't hire an employee, choosing the right tool can solve your problems, because they

* Are super cheap.
* Work 7/24 for you.
* Don’t make mistakes.
* Don’t need management. (or needless management)
* Help you to automate the majority of your lead gen process.

Onwards to the list.

845,935gqx,False,,88,"9 months ago I posted that I wanted to start my own craft gin brand on a pretty small budget. Well, we did it! Our first gin launched last month and is going well.",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit, 

[Here is the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/77dk7f/i_am_two_weeks_into_starting_a_gin_brand_yes_the/). 

Our first gin is Earl Grey & Cucumber flavoured and we launched last month. So far we've entered one spirit awards and were [finalist for best-flavoured gin](http://www.theginguide.com/2018-gin-awards-winners.html). Which for our first attempt is pretty awesome!

Here is our website: [PipehouseGin.com](https://pipehousegin.com/). You can [get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pipehouse-Earl-Grey-Cucumber-Gin/dp/B07BY4GVWX) (UK only I'm afraid).

The plan was to try and launch for under £10k (about $14k). Well we went over budget, but not by too much. It cost £12k to get our first 250 bottles made. And then we put in another £4k to help pay for another 250. 

In our first month, we got through 500 bottles. Of which 256 were at markets, 110 to trade, 48 online and the rest given away in samples or drunk at our launch party.

**How we started the business**

There is a lot to talk about but I will try and highlight the interesting stuff.

* We came up with some recipe ideas and emailed every distillery in the country (over 100) to try and find one who would work with us. Only about 3 were willing. It then took quite a few months to perfect our recipe. 
* Because we had no money we did all the branding/website etc ourselves.
* Alcohol duty is a killer. It's about £10 a bottle with VAT which we need to pay upfront. 
* The legal stuff of selling alcohol is a minefield, but once you get your head around it isn't that difficult. We did it all with just two licenses. A personal license which let us sell at markets and an AWRS license which let us sell wholesale. Both were easy to get.
* We store our stock in my garage, a third-party warehouse with an alcohol license so they can deliver and at Amazon FBA warehouse.
* Local businesses have been really helpful and we have got a lot of help. Lots of introductions and orders.
* Markets have worked really well for us. 
* We have been focusing on local PR and got into a bunch of small-town newspapers. This has worked quite well because most people in our small town of Tunbridge Wells have now heard of us. And is much easier than getting into national news.
* We made a lot of pretty amateur mistakes. One of which was to forget to add VAT to our costings, which upped all our costs by 20%.
* The plan originally was to focus on online sales. But the costs of getting the gin to the final customer is pretty prohibitive. It's still work it but wholesale to distributors seems like a better long term plan at the moment.


I posted about the process [live on my personal blog](https://sampriestley.com/project/gin-brand). 

If you have any questions please ask away. I am by no means an expert but will do my best.


**What are our plans?**
There is still a lot we can do and have loads of plans. The thing that is holding us up is time. 

* We have a lot of markets lined up. 
* We are canvassing local bars to try and get them to stock us.
* We need to get in with some distributors, currently we are doing it ourselves.
* I want to look at international expansion. Earl Grey & Cucumber is a very English flavour and I think it could be popular with expats.
* I have some more flavour ideas. Next up an autumnal one for winter. And possibly some gift sets for Christmas.
* We are planning to raise some money to build our own distillery. Maybe through crowdfunding. 

**Questions for you drinks business experts**

* Do you think there is anything else I should be spending my time on?
* Do you have any advice for international expansion?
* Any bars out there want to buy our gin?

**Summary**

I don't think we're far enough through to label it as a success just yet. But I am incredibly proud and still haven't got over the novelty of being able to go into a bar and order my own gin.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/935gqx/9_months_ago_i_posted_that_i_wanted_to_start_my/,429,"Goddamn I hate gin!

It's Excel. Or Google Sheets or AirTable or any other similar product. I'd like to tell you a story of how one of my clients saved money with Google Sheets and just a little bit of spreadsheet magic

A while back I made my first post on automation ( [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)) and got a fantastic response (And, full disclosure, a few leads too). Today I'd like to talk about my favorite automation story.

Disclosure: Together with my father I run three small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

This is a recent story. I got approached by a client whose business was struggling under the recent COVID-19 pandemic and were looking to cut costs. They told me that one of their biggest cost points was a part-time virtual assistant that they were paying $20 an hour for about 10 hours of work a week, which works out to about $800 a month (Well, slightly more).

The assistant's job? The client received orders through a variety of platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc) and many of the orders (But not all) were subscriptions. The assistant's role was to pull orders from all these websites and create a 'Daily Deliveries' entry in a spreadsheet listing out when a product needs to go out. They'd then create an associated entry in ShipStation (A very popular shipping tool).

So for example if somebody ordered a 9 month subscription through Shopify, they would first create 9 different entries in a spreadsheet then create corresponding entries in ShipStation.

They'd also spend time inputting other info into the 'Master Spreadsheet'
___
So that's what they were spending $800 a month on. Now, how do you automate this? There's a bunch of components here:

1. Pulling data from Amazon, Shopify etc
2. Splitting subscriptions into individual shipments
3. Creating a daily list of shipments that need to go out
4. Sending that info to ShipStation

Okay! Four steps. Can we automate it? Yes! Luckily ShipStation provides us an easy to use API ( [What is an API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api)) but Amazon obviously doesn't (For our purposes that is). But we can still create software that automatically pulls data from Amazon's orders page

Using a combination of Node.JS, The Google Sheets API and the Protractor Framework and at a cost of about $600, i was able to automate it
___
But that's just the automation, you've heard it a billion times, yada yada yadda, automation beats manual labor. The future is automation, bla bla bla. What's the point of this post? Well, here's the thing. For $800 a week, you got the basics done. But I'm yet to describe the real power of spreadsheets.

I was also able to design a spreadsheet for the client that purely using existing formulas, was able to give them an exact overview of each day, week, month and year.

For $800 a month with an assistant, you didn't get that data. You'd have to pay extra to get that data since it'd take them hours of effort. But with a spreadsheet that takes nanoseconds to compute that data, you get it for free.

And in the future, data is king. The more data you have on your business, the better you can forecast the future.

422,bkt1g1,False,Young Entrepreneur,197,Harsh Truth About Young Entrepreneurship,Entrepreneur,"Something you'll notice is that the vast majority of self made young entrepreneurs who struck it big before 30 were doing some sort of online/low barrier of entry business. This is why everyone talks about eccommerce, copywriting, digital marketing, dropshipping..... And then bragging about $40k monthly revenue selling colorful socks online. It's much easier to scale.

Most real life businesses require significant financial capital plus industry knowledge and experience that a young man could not easily obtain unless he were born into it. Take manufacturing for example. A 21 year old out of college does not stand a chance compared to a 40 year old with years of experience/credibility and an established network. Ask yourself which one you trust more? Which of these two would you invest in?

**It's a catch 22. We aspire to get rich as young as possible so that we can enjoy that wealth for the rest of our lives. But without industry expertise and significant startup capital, we're stuck with dropshipping or selling t-shirts. Yet if you spend a decade working in an industry, you will see massive loopholes that the average 20 year old guy cannot.**

It's a complete myth that the average startup owner is a 20 year old dude. That is a tech stereotype. You only hear about these 20 year old's because of how rare they are. Which is why they get so much publicity. The average 30/40 something year old is much more confident, mature, experienced and financially grounded than the average 20 year old.

Your social background is also important. Your average Joe from Akron, Ohio has access to significantly less opportunity than Tony from Long Island who attends a top school and his parents are wealthy and have a strong network. Therefore he is going to have to pull himself entirely from his bootstraps. Whereas Tony is given the option between working at the investment bank that his uncle manages or being 100% financially supported by his family while he builds his startup.

Everyone sees the Kardashians and Dan Bilzerian living these crazy lives. Nobody bothers to mention that their fathers worked themselves into death and prison so that their children could have amazing lives that seem impossible for the average man to even fathom. Gurus like Grant Cardone won't tell the young men that watch his content every detail. He didn't start seeing the fruits of his labor until his 30's. And it took him a lot longer than 30 to become a private jet rich.

**I'm not saying any of this to persuade you into quitting.** I myself am a struggling entrepreneur who has been knocked in the head a couple of times so take my words for what they are. Back when I was 18 I was always so hyped about getting rich and dating models and having a fancy car. Then when I started to get more life experience I realized that if I was going to make it I was going to have to be a lot more humble. It could take a lot longer than I anticipated.

If you're struggling, don't focus too much on the 0.0000001% of 23 year olds with 8 figure eCommerce stores. Not only is it bad for your self esteem. But those guys are also exceptionally rare, and either very talented or very well connected. You will probably never even meet those guys outside of the internet.

For guys out there like me, we just got to do the best with what we have. Maybe you didn't hit one million dollars by 30. SO WHAT. You could still have 50+ years of life left. Most male hollywood actors' careers don't take off until 30's. If it takes me until my 40's, 50's, or EVEN 60's to make it, that doesn't mean I can't have an amazing life with what time I have left. And if I never make it big at least I can die knowing I gave it a shot.

This is the end of my rant about entrepreneurship. I feel like aspiring entrepreneurs do a good job of talking about the positive sides of entrepreneurship. But there needs to be more discussion about the sacrifices and harsh truths that come along with entrepreneurship. It's a lonely road out there. I remember all those times my friends were out partying and I blew them off to work. They thought I was crazy and they were probably right.

628,6nsx69,False,,122,Two months ago I posted about hitting my first of three business goals after quitting my job to go full-time on a business. I completed the second goal a month early: 100 paying customers.,Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit (and my fellow entrepreneurs),

Two months ago I submitted a [Reddit post detailing my journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6c3t83/two_months_ago_i_lost_my_job_instead_of_getting/) from leaving a cushy corporate job and starting a business.

Directly after leaving, I worked out three business goals with my wife that I had to hit, or I would have to go back and find a job. The goals are:

1. One sale within the first two months (which I hit on the very last day)
2. 100 paying customers by August 13th
3. Grow at 10% per month for six months

Today I am proud to say that **I accomplished the second goal a month early**. 

**What has changed since then?**

Quite a bit!

Most of the great feedback from the prior post pointed out how broad my original business idea was. Visitors would come to the site and not have a clue where to start. 

The prior website slogan was ""Automation and Spreadsheet Vault for Entrepreneurs."" Automation for what? My morning routine? What kind of spreadsheets? What does vault mean?

*And they were absolutely right.*

Around the same time, the digital currency market and blockchain were absolutely exploding. I saw it as an opportunity to not only get much more targeted, but to enter a space that was hot (and I believe to be on an unstoppable path.)

**The Pivot**

After doing some rigorous keyword research, I saw that a large portion of blockchain related terms were getting huge amounts of traffic, but the competition was less than stellar. I took this as an opportunity to take a great portion of my current skillset (finance, trading, analysis) and create something very valuable for people interested in digital currency and blockchain. At the same time, I became crystal clear on my message and vision, and it goes like this:

""For investors and developers in digital currency and blockchain, who are dissatisfied with unreliable, messy data, [Spreadstreet](https://spreadstreet.io) is a data-delivery service that provides dependable, documented data sets with multiple avenues of delivery (such as Excel, and web download). Unlike existing options, we plan to focus on expanding our delivery options, and providing an affordable foundation for developers looking to build blockchain apps, or investors looking to build analysis models.""

**How has initial traction been?**

So far, the website has had the following:

- ~17k pageviews, ~5k unique sessions
- 612 registered users
- 102 paid users (yay!)

While not a huge amount, it feels good that it is finally gaining some traction.

**What has the initial feedback been?**

The most important thing in business is to listen to your customers. I have implemented Intercom again, as I believe the chat function is extremely well done. It has provided an avenue to talk to customers, and I have been happy with the results so far.

I also created a user onboarding survey that has a 69% completion rate, with the first question garnering 100%. That feedback is very valuable as far as modifying the website to fit exactly what our users are asking for. The following has been some great feedback from users:

- Current datasets are lacking (had to start somewhere!)
- Users are extremely hesitant to install an Excel plugin, as the Cryptocurrency space seems to be ripe with scammers. My goal is to ease that concern as much as possible, and one of those avenues is through our (currently in development) API and a Google Sheets plugin
- Current datasets could use more customization (such as date ranges)

After hearing all of this great feedback, answering customers, working on product development, marketing, finance, accounting, I realized something very important...

**What's next?**

A one-and-a-half man operation (one part-time developer) is not enough. I will be seeking the following help:

- Technical Co-Founder/CTO
- Web Designer/UX Expert

And since I need this help, I recently finished a pitch deck to present to investors. So far I have received a few initial offers (that were honestly terrible), and am extremely excited for what the future holds.

These individuals will be instrumental in getting Spreadstreet to my ultimate vision.

**Products I currently use (not affiliated with any of the listed products)**

Last time I gave a run-down of products I currently use, and here is an update:

- **Wordpress**: Site is still on Wordpress, and I expect it to be there at least in the short-term. However our API is currently being developed on a Node.js server. In the future I fully expect a custom built solution, but for now it serves it's purpose
- **Divi Theme**: Still awesome, I would recommend to ANYONE using a Wordpress site. It could not be easier to use for non-technical people
- **Vultr and Microsoft Azure**: Vultr houses the Wordpress site, Azure has been selected as our option for the API to handle scaling needs. We will be using a Node.js/Blob Storage/PostgreSQL stack. 
- **Canva**: Awesome for coming up with graphics for anything you can think of. $13 per month
- **Namecheap**: Where I purchased the domain name. Negligible cost, not worth noting. If you go with a less used TLD (such as .club instead of .com) it comes out to $0.88 a YEAR
- **Cloudflare**: Great for speeding up websites, however the current website is pretty light load so this may be overkill…but it’s free
- **Blockspring**: Awesome Excel/Google Sheets add-in that makes calling APIs extremely easy.
- **Zapier**: Automation tool. $20 per month. Currently used to fill up my…
- **Buffer**. Scheduling tool for social media profiles. $10 per month
- **Upwork**: I have one developer on staff who I sourced from Upwork. She is amazing, and has been extremely helpful in initial development I was unable to do. Ranges from $200 to $400 per month. I do not have the link at the moment, but someone on this subreddit had a great write-up on sourcing talent from Upwork
- **Data feed**: I anticipate this to be one of the most expensive pieces of the business going forward, depending upon the landscape. Certain companies will want to offer their current data for sale, so licensing and agreements will be a part of the model going forward. 
- **Intercom**: Last post I noted how I stopped using it due to cost. I came back to it. The product is just too damn good, even though I still do not agree with the pricing. But alas, here I am. Talking with customers is so damn important, and they have the best product on the market.

**New Skills Gained**

I continue to accumulate new skills every day, so this acts as a great buffer in case I am forced to go back to work at some time in the future. 

- I now have an intermediate understanding of how the funding world works. Extremely interesting and exciting
- Beginner PHP, although I stopped this as it seems to be quite hated within the developer community (not entirely sure why...) and because my time must be spent elsewhere
- Basic UX - my website was honestly a mess two months ago. It is still not great, but much much better than what it used to be (doing such things as making sure the content is above the fold on multiple devices, creating a user onboarding experience, etc.)
- Blockspring
- Zapier marketing automation
- My technology lingo is a bit better
- Differences between types of databases, such as document storage, key-value, relational, etc.
- Best practices for API development. While I am not creating it myself, I need to know what I am talking about so my developer knows what to build

**Don't be shy, say hi!**

I will end this here as it is getting to be a bit long, but I love meeting new or current entrepreneurs. Please send me a message, I would love to get to know you. I am located in the DC/Baltimore area, and in-person meetings are even better.

(Read time: ~15 minutes).  
  
Grab a cup of coffee and get comfy!  I’ll get right to it. 
 
 
**THE INNER WORKINGS OF A SUBSCRIPTION BOX COMPANY.**
 
So about 6 months ago, I came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1zn089/i_am_looking_for_some_advice_on_selling_a_website/) from a guy looking to sell a website he owned: 
 
I contacted him and found out that it was [wetshaveclub.com](http://www.wetshaveclub.com/), a wet shaving subscription box. I felt like I could make it work given the fact that dollar shave club had proven out the model. “Ok, Let’s do it!”  This was the extent of my analysis on this. The site owner sent me a screenshot of his revenue, I offered about 15X his monthly profits, and we wrapped everything up that same weekend.  We skipped the usual back and forth dance people go through when they’re buying websites.  I sent over the money, he sent over the passwords, and that was that.
 
I reached out to redditor u/kaster who I had been talking to on skype for some time. He had read [my original series of posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/comments/tltuy/day_26_from_zero_to_website_launcha_recap_of/), followed it to launch and grow a local business to 40k/month, sold it, and spent a few months in Costa Rica on vacation. We had never met, but I felt like he would be the perfect person to work on this with me.  This is a guy that does not play around when an opportunity presents itself.  Case in point: A few weeks later he was in his car for a 5-day drive from California to the east coast so we could work on this. ([Kevin’s Facebook post as he was hitting the road](http://imgur.com/rMYvzJU)).
 
Ok, so here’s what we did to get moving:
   
**Step 1: Website Rebranding**  
The original website needed some work and we set out to change the look and feel of it.  Design is critical, and even more so with a consumer product where emotion is a large component of the buying decision.  [Click to see of our branding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/HZJqP)
 
**Step 2: Expanding the Product line and raising prices**  
So the original service only delivered soaps and at a price of $12 per month.  We felt that we had to double that price to make this worthwhile.  In order to do this we had to expand the product line and provide more value.  [Click to see how we expanded our product line.](http://imgur.com/a/CBzSZ)
 
**Step 3: Box Rebranding**  
Since we were now shipping more products (and we had rebranded the site), the next effort was to find a box that worked.  We called around to different box suppliers and had them send us samples.  We settled on Salazar packaging.  We sent them our box design and they got on it.  [Click to see our box rebranding efforts.](http://imgur.com/a/sR1mN)
 
**Step 4: Increasing prices and adding annual option**    
Everything so far took us about 2 months of balls-to-the-wall work, but things were starting to shape up.  We were then able to increase prices to $29 for the monthly box instead of $12.  We also added an annual version at a reduced monthly rate to see if people would prepay for an entire year.  And they did.  [Click to see our new pricing options](http://imgur.com/Q7Lwyit).
 
**Step 5: Marketing**  
So with our conversion rates up, and our box at a higher price point we were able to unleash the hounds.  You’ll see that most of what we do is completely free marketing mixed in with a few paid sources.  [Click to see how we drive traffic.](http://imgur.com/a/CUDIH)
 
**Step 6: Ordering, Warehouse and Shipping**  
So with the results of our efforts, we needed space.  We were shipping from our living room and while I had a small office, there was no way we could do it from there any longer.  So we found an office/warehouse, moved in 10 days later and got everything set up.  [Click to peep the warehouse](http://imgur.com/a/Gf3LP).
 
**Bonus**: [Our new office](http://imgur.com/a/ojqCT).
 

So the result of all this work:
We’re going to hit $100K in revenue in the next 30 days, and just passed $78K ([Obligatory screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/PBmXMxs.png)).  We did $22K last month ([Cratejoy screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FDhitpp.png))-They have pretty awesome analytics btw, and we’re on pace to do $35K in September.  We think we can hit our first $100K month in 6-12 months and join the ranks of /u/bandholz from beardbrand.com. Dude knows his stuff and I respect how much he shares with the community.  In some ways I think we’re cut from the same cloth, he’s just smarter and better looking!  
 
What Comes Next:  We’re launching an accompanying ecommerce store.  This way, when folks find products that they like in the box, they can order more of them.  In addition, we can expand the product line a bit to include additional grooming products and other men’s accessories. [Click for a sneak peak of the upcoming store](http://imgur.com/a/J4kpq).
 
**TAKEAWAYS FROM ALL OF THIS!**
 
This is hard work and we made a lot of mistakes and will continue to make more.  We’re working every day on providing a better customer experience and trying to improve the product line.  We went into this not knowing a thing about selling and shipping products, logistics, inventory, warehousing, or even wet shaving for that matter.  But we live in the information age.  Anything under the sun can be figured out if you’re resourceful enough and willing to bust your ass until you make yourself an expert in that thing.  We’re not well connected, nor do we access to a gazillion dollars in VC funding.  We just work.  Hard. And we’re just getting started.
 
**The companies that made this happen:** 
 
Cratejoy.com for our subscription box web platform.  (Awesome service and Amir rocks!)  
Salazarpackaging.com for our box (Great to work with)  
Sonicprint.com for our inserts (Karen is the bomb)  
99designs.com for our design work (I wish I owned this company)  
Uline.com for our warehouse shelving and box fill (Their delivery speed is insane)  
Shipstation.com: (Integrates with cratejoy to handle our shipping. This gives us life!!)  
Endicia.com: (Integrates with Shipstation so we just print labels from our computer. The truth!)  
Stripe.com: Payment processor (You already know)  
Perfectaudience.com: Re-targeting (Works. Well! ROI positive and helps with branding too)  
Kabbage.com: $15,000 Line of credit (Surprisingly smooth experience)  
Gleam.io: Contests (Super awesome set up and easy to add virality to your contests through sharing)  
TeamBeachBody.com: (haha, we do insanity every morning before work! Thanks Sean T)

If you’ve made it this far, props.  

**This is where the case study ends!**
******
 
  
But if you’re interested in taking a look at the mindset that has gotten us to this point, read on.
 
Launching something:  
I read almost every front-page thread on r/entrepreneur and have done so for the past 2 years, so I know a lot of folks are stuck right now with coming up with something to launch.  Here’s what I would do if I wanted to start a new business today and had no idea what to do next:
 
1) Check your bank account for something you’ve spent money on in the last 12 months. Bonus points if it’s a recurring service of some sort (Your customer lifetime value is instantly boosted, and you can thrive even with a high customer acquisition cost).   Either way, you know it’s something that people already spend money on.  This simple rule eliminates fantasy ideas: “If I get enough members I’ll figure out how to monetize it later.”  Later never comes, so ideas like these don’t get a minute of my time.  **The only things I work on are things where I can make money starting on DAY ONE!**  
  
2)Narrow down the list to things where a lot of people are making money in that industry.  Competition is good.  I know, this goes against everything you’ve learned somewhere.  But the more **thriving** competition you find, the more money is being made, and the larger the market.  Join the party, throw your hat in the ring, and be at least as smart as somebody there.  **Most people search for a great idea with no competition without realizing that this makes it almost impossible to start something.**  
  
3) Narrow things further to something that can be delivered with a simple but well designed website that cost no more than a month’s salary.  If it’s a product, you’ll then have to find someone that will let you re-sell his or her product.  If it’s a service, you simply have to find someone that already provides that service.  In both cases (product or service) you’re just re-selling something, and with a well-designed website, you’ll double your chances that your supplier will feel comfortable enough to let you resell their thing.  Yes, good design is important for both your customers and your suppliers!  **Don't launch with bad design!!! MVP or not!**   
   
4) When you get that “Yes” from a supplier, make sure you set things up so that you’re not in the customer’s way.   Make things as easy as possible for them to do business with you.  Seriously, remove all hoops.  **They should be able to do business with you as easily as they do business with Amazon.**  If you don’t need that extra field on the form, get rid of that shit.  As easy as humanly possible! 
   
5) Market your thing until you pass out.  If your thing is something that really speaks to a person’s identity like grooming, fashion, makeup, fitness, etc. [you can kill on social media](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/steal-your-competitions-followers/) (twitter, instagram, Facebook, YouTube).  If your thing is more detached from a person’s identity like say a car wash or home cleaning, your best conversions will come through search (adwords, seo, yelp).  
******  
**A few additional thoughts:**  
I think that a lot of “startup best practices” work well for people that have access to funding.  For the rest of us, some of the generally accepted ideas end up pushing folks further away from launching something.  Consider:
 
**Validation:** Validation in my opinion is for fantasy ideas.  If you stay away from having to come up with an awesome idea, you won’t need validation in the first place. There are plenty of things you can do that other companies have already validated for you.  And when you find that thing, stop worrying about competition.  **Competition IS the validation.**  
 
**Competition:** Stop measuring this by quantity.  One of the first things you’ll hear is “the market is oversaturated”!  This is meaningless, yet this single phrase has stopped more potential entrepreneurs in their tracks than…well I honestly can’t think of anything that beats this.  Start looking at the quality of the competition instead, and you’ll often find that the market is saturated with a LOT of bad players, and they’re making a LOT of money despite being so bad.** This is the perfect situation.   
 
**Business plans:** This often ends up being a way to push action further down the road.  If It’s longer than one page you’re wasting your time.  [Download something like this](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf), fill that bad boy out, and get to work.
 
**LLC/incorporation:** Unless the company can pay for it, it’s not happening.  So this only happens AFTER the company is making money.  One more excuse...GONE!
 
**Business Analysis:** Demographic data, market analysis, the economic outlook... blah blah blah. More ways to kick the can down the road and to feel that you’re doing something when you’re really not.  I just get to work. If a lot of people are making money doing this thing, the startup cost is low, and there is no sorcery involved, it can be done!
 
**Fear of your idea being stolen:** Ideas hold little intrinsic value without execution. However, you can start to extract value when you get feedback on it, massaging it, push and poke it, and really run it through the wringer.  And the only way to do this is to tell people about it.  This goes against our most basic instincts because we’re fearful that our ideas might be stolen.  Well the reality is, most people are sitting on the bench with a gazillion ideas of their own that they are not executing on.  You just added one more to that list.  Either way, if an idea cannot survive competition it’s probably not that good in the first place.  In addition, what happens when you launch?  You can’t run a business without telling anybody about it.   You’ll often get this response, “ But I’ll lose my first-mover’s advantage?”. Well good.  I would never want to be the first mover anyhow.  First movers bare a tremendous cost in educating customers.  Most of us don’t have the money to bare that cost.  The folks that are second and onwards, can just slide in and benefit from all of that work.  For example, I don’t have to explain the concept of a subscription box service sending you shaving equipment every month.  Most people already know what this is, thanks to Dollar Shave Club.  Bottom line: Try to get over this stuff.
 
**Find something you’re passionate about:**  Nah son.  Find something that is viable.  I’m passionate about table tennis, but I’m not looking to turn that passion into a business.  When it comes to business, I’m far more passionate about providing a good product/service that has good margins, than about being able to marry that business to any hobby or other exciting pursuit I may have in my regular life.   This way, I’m free to work on the best opportunity that arises without limitation.  And honestly, quite often the least sexy industries are where the big money is being made.  So while most of the brainpower is busy chasing sexy mobile apps and such, you can make bank by selling ugly widgets or providing basic services.  It’s tough to pay bills with app downloads.
 
**A note to Engineers and consultants:** Resist the urge to complicate things.  For technical folks, it seems like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming.  So a problem like “find people that need lawn service and connect them with people that provide lawn service” becomes, “well how about we use Zillow’s APi to pull a picture of the lawn, and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the area to be serviced and we tie that into Google maps and feed everything into a pricing algorithm”.... and on and on.  Unfortunately, many of these guys do not make it.  More often than not simplicity wins.  Get out of the customer’s way.
 
**Start something small to get practice:**  You don’t get good at running marathons by reading about running marathons.  And you don’t get good at business by reading about business.  You get good by doing. And doing it over and over again.  But just like you wouldn’t expect to win the first marathon you entered, why put so much pressure on yourself to win at the first company you start?   Or worse yet, paralyze yourself with fear into never running at all because you’re afraid you won’t win? It doesn’t make sense with marathons and it doesn’t make sense with business.  So while a lot of folks over-analyze every minutia about the thing, people like Kevin and me would have already downloaded a training regiment, bought a pair of shoes, and hit the bricks.
 
**What if I fail?** Nothing happens!  It’s literally the most mundane non-event imaginable.  I spend a day or two wrapping up any loose ends, head to the movies or do something fun, and by the next day I’m already figuring out what the next thing is.  My personal experience hasn’t been “Try->Win”, it has been more like “try, fail, try, fail, try, fail, try, fail win, win, win, win.”   With each failure you get better, and then things just start to come easy.  Don’t be afraid of failing, it’s like the best and cheapest MBA you’ll ever get.  
 
**Naysayers:** If you’re doing something...I mean anything, you’ll meet them.  Whether it’s in real life, on the Internet, or wherever else.  Sometimes it’s even your friends and family.  I keep an imgur album of the best ones I come across.   Sometimes for a little motivation, and sometimes just to look back and smile.    For example, recently I mentioned in passing that my next big project will be a restaurant, and I already have a list of comment screenshots explaining why I won’t succeed.  :-)
 
Here’s [one of my favorite ones](http://i.imgur.com/UNNyS0F.png) from a few years back when I was making $4k per month, from what was a new company at the time.  This was the top comment on Hacker News.
 
That little company now pays me a 6 figure salary.  What intrigued me about this comment was the fact that it was so thoughtfully written.  This wasn’t a troll.  This was someone that provided a seemingly well-reasoned analysis of where he thought I would be in 12 months, complete with business school type analysis: barriers to entry, competitive landscape, etc.   
 
So why is this important?  Because **this is exactly what many of us do to ourselves.**
 
We have a naysayer living permanently inside our heads that is constantly appraising and analyzing every business idea we entertain.  And the analysis sounds just as reasoned, and well thought-out and measured as the one I posted above.  Not a bad thing on its face, but **the guy in our head typically skews negative.** Shut that dude up! Or you’ll analyze and over think and what-if every single idea until you convince yourself it won’t work.  Over time this messes with your confidence, and you end up paralyzed.  Say what you want about the guy, but Kanye was right about this: [Most people are held back by their perception of themselves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx3X4r-eCYQ&t=6m59s)  It’s a brutal feedback loop.
 
At some point we have to just say “Fuck It” and get to work!

387,cty4xu,False,,78,Just taking a few minutes to write down your goals for the day can be a huge boost to productivity,Entrepreneur,"I'm not a big planner. I don't meticulously block out on my time on apps and daily planners, and I only use my calendar app for a few important events and appointments. Planning your day is a useful habit, but for those of us who don't have the discipline or desire to plan out our lives in detail, just taking a minute or two to jot down a few tasks you want to accomplish for the day can make all the difference in the world. For those of us who set our own schedules and have to be our own boss, some of us all too often let a day slip by without getting much work done. We know what needs to get done, but we just put it off for tomorrow. 

Something about simply writing down your goals for the day has a huge psychological effect on whether or not you actually do them. At any given time we might have 20 things we need to do, and we can't get to all of them in one day. At the beginning of the day pick just a handful of those 20 tasks that you think could reasonably be accomplished that day. The order and the exact time allotted to each task doesn't matter so much as the fact that you actually write them down. All of this might take no longer than a minute or two, but at the end of the day you most likely will have accomplished much more than you would have if you had no written plan at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cty4xu/just_taking_a_few_minutes_to_write_down_your/,674,I started planning the most important tasks for the next day morning the night before.

Two years ago, I posted about our move into much larger location - https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2yz1b6/i_got_60_days_to_turn_my_local_business_around/ 

When we signed the lease, we knew we were taking a huge risk. It was like betting your life's saving on black in roulette. The space was in reality way too big for us at the time, and wasn't something we should have took. 

**Today, we are generating roughly $65,000/mo** in revenue, we our eyes on sight of the magical $83.3k ($1m/yr). We have grown the spa more than 10x since the day we bought it. It hasn't been the easiest journey, to say the least.  

That image where they show you what a real entrepreneur's life is like? Yeah, it's true. We have grown, stumbled, fell flat on our face, stood back up. 

The worst of this was in May of 2016, we walked into our spa under 6"" of water. A 1"" line broke in the middle of the night, and left our entire spa flooded. The damages were so bad that we literally had to close our business for 3 weeks to ""remodel"". 

On top of all of that, we were just exiting the season. Typically you want to have a great May to sustain your June/July. Yeah, that wasn't happening.

Yet, we fought back, and continued to grow. 

##My 3 Biggest Keys to Success

###Inspect Everything.
Don't ever assume anything. If you aren't growing your business the way you want to, inspect the full process. Turn over every detail. Secret shop yourself. Sometimes, there are things that you are missing. 

In September, I was looking at our numbers and was kind of bummed out we haven't grown much year over year. I knew that we should have, but something wasn't right. I looked at our schedules, we seemed to be filling up nicely. We seemed to have plenty of appointments on the books. Our room utilization was a bit low though. 

I had our front desk start tracking how many appointments we were rejecting, and why. 

It turns out that I was understaffed. I had assumed we were running perfectly. I had assume that we were only rejecting maybe 1-2 appointments per day. Turns out that we were rejecting 4-6 appointments on a weekday and 8-10 on a weekend day. 

This is a huge KPI for us to monitor now.

###The Emyth is Right -- Create Processes so you can work ON your business, not IN your business.

In October of 2015, my grandfather passed away in Poland. I had to go over there to take care of his things. I had a small irrational temporary fear of flying at the time because of the last flight I took, I had a huge anxiety attack. My wife asked me if she should go with. 

At this time in my business life, our day spa's doors were never open unless we were there. We were approaching our season, and no way we were going to close for a week. So in 5 business days, we trained two of our staff members to handle the front desk + operations for a week. 

Since that day, we have started creating processes for everything. Everytime an issue arises, we write up a protocol on how we would handle it. Occasionally, we will throw out random ""homework"" to the staff to see how they would handle the situation.

Just last week, we had a major sewage backup into the spa. We had to close the spa for the day to clean up the waste from the floors (thank god it was all on tile). The very next thing we did once the issue was rectified, we typed up a ""memo"" on how to handle such a situation. Each time we type one of these documents up, we share it will all the staff and put it into a Binder.

The other huge side benefit of this is that when you have processes, inspecting your progress is much easier. It's also much easier to train & hire, as well as explaining the expectations.


###Lean Startup's Philosophy - Pivot Fast & Often.
Every single month, I try to change some part of our spa in an effort to increase revenue. We make assumptions on what should improve and how, and we test it. 

For example, we built a relatively well known promotion for two hours at the spa for just $99. It was and still is the staple of our business. Saturdays & Sundays are our busiest days. They tend to fill up rapidly. 

Somewhere in November, we realized that we were filling up way too quickly on those days, and we were leaving much to be desired in the middle of the week. So we came up with a pivot -- $119  for Sat/Sun, $99 Mon-Fri. 

Turns out, that the higher price was still more than acceptable. From November, we have tested different pricing each month and slowly have increased our average service hour from $52 to $57. 

You should be able to test any part of your business to see if there is an improvement.

# 5 Lessons from 2 Failed Startups

7years ago, on my last year in university, I unwittingly embarked on a startup journey. Here are the five most important lessons that I picked up the hard way.

*(comic 1)*

The main reason I wrote this piece is so that I don’t repeat the mistakes I list below, but I’m publishing it in hopes that my experience will have a positive externality — that someone out there will internalize these lessons without paying the cost of money, time, and tears.

    FIRST STARTUP
    What it was: the first premium educational platform for a popular competitive video game (Dota 2);
    My role: main content guy — I wrote most of the content and worked directly with our influencer partners, but with time got more and more involved;
    Timeline: created platform and developed content; launched successfully and found decent traction; slowly faded into obscurity due to lack of sufficient funding;

# LESSON 1: Be prepared for different levels of success

Naturally, when we started the project we had great expectations for its future financial performance. We also kept in mind that it could crash and burn, as we knew most innovative products fail.

The two options in our heads were either:

1. great success — the business supports itself just fine and grows
2. or total failure — we close down and search for “real” jobs.

What we failed to anticipate is the vast land in between those two extremes. That’s where we ended up. When we launched we started making enough money to indicate we are onto something, but not enough to fully support and grow the business.

*(comic 2)*

When you hear something along the line of “90% of startups fail”, you imagine that 10% of startups hit the jackpot while the other 90% lose their money and close their doors instantly. However, **this statement lacks a time dimension and a grayscale between the whiteness of success and the blackness of failure. It could be useful to investors, but it** **is misleading if you are a founder.**

I’m sure some startups lose their money very fast and are left with no choice but to close operations. Yet, I’d wager a big chunk of the unsuccessful 90% spend a long time trying to navigate mixed signals from the market. The problem is that in such conditions decision-making is not straightforward. Are you wasting your time, or are you on the brink of something worthwhile? Not an easy call to make.

When faced with such decisions, pessimists quit too early, while optimists tend to believe success is just behind the corner perpetually. Both mindsets are wrong.

If you quit too early, you are cutting short the chances that you’ll hit a lucky breakthrough.

But if you fight for too long, it could get you stuck in a terrible limbo people in the startup community call *“the land of the living dead”*. You make ends meet, barely, but in reality, you are just wasting your time, potential, and **testing the patience of all the people with a stake in your success or failure** (people in both your personal and professional life). A business is, generally speaking, not a worthy cause for martyrdom.

In our case, we ended up in the second option. We had over-promised so our investors and business partners were unhappy with the performance, yet we were not ready to give up yet because we still saw a lot of potential.

At the same time, without the full support of the inventors and partners, we had no chances to succeed. We spend over a year in this state. You need to be realistic about these things, and in startups, the business of selling dreams, this is harder than it sounds.

**Plan for success, plan for failure, plan for everything in between.**

Retrospectively, what we had was a successful proof of concept which required further funding to grow and become a real business. Our failure to anticipate this outcome meant that neither we nor our partners or investors were prepared, which spelled the slow and agonizing death of the project.

**If you’re a founder,** **you need to be granular in defining success and failure**. You need to have a timeline everyone agrees upon (not only the founders but all stakeholders) and a definition of different levels of success so that nobody quits too early or leads a lost war for too long.

    For example:
    
    Great outcome: X months after launch, we’re making enough money to support the business. We agree to reinvest and grow it slowly to avoid dilution (lifestyle business route) or to fundraise to grow fast and search for an exit (startup route).
    
    Good outcome: X months after launch, we’re making money, but not enough to support the business. This is expected — proof of concept. We’re in the process of fundraising. If we succeed to fundraise until month Y (money runs out) — great. If not — we close the business.
    
    Bad outcome: X months after launch we’re making very little (if any) money. We pivot if we still have resources, if not — we close the business.

# LESSON 2: Find a mentor

The three main components people talk about when evaluating startups are usually the **team**, the **product**, and the **market**.

It’s hard to argue if any of the three is more important than the others. Usually, you need all three to be good enough to reach success.

In our case, we were lucky enough to have a favorable market — demand for what we were offering and lack of any real competition.

The product was so-so: it could have been much, much better considering our lack of experience & resources, but it was good enough to attract the early adopters and with time it could have evolved.

**The team, however, had 0 experience.**

We did this straight out of university (I worked on the project part-time until I finished my masters). The founder was the technical guy and he was a junior developer at best. I was the content marketing guy and even though I had some marketing courses in uni (which mostly focus on traditional, big businesses), I had 0 real-world experience.

**Our lack of technical/marketing experience** **proved not to be fatal** — we were learning on the go and managed to push out a working product and to reach our customers. We had vision, passion, some domain knowledge, and the willingness to work hard.

What was fatal, however, was that we had 0 experience running a business. Honestly, we had close to no knowledge about startups and what to expect of these kinds of projects. **Doing the actual work takes thousands of hours, and** **the minutes spent making a bad decision can easily invalidate all your efforts.**

If present-day-me could advise and mentor this startup, I’m certain it would have become a successful business.

*(comic 3)*

**If you are a young entrepreneur, you need a mentor.** An official one, with a small share in the business in order to have skin in the game. Ideally — an entrepreneur who has some startup experience behind his back or at least someone who has been deeply involved in such businesses. Turn to your local startup community and it won’t be that hard finding someone interested: after all, most people like giving advice as well as getting free shares in companies.

*\[If you don’t have an official mentor, at least make sure you’re getting mentorship from other places intimately familiar with your business (investors, startup groups or communities, etc.).\]*

Embarking on your first startup journey without a mentor is like trying to become an MBA star without ever having a basketball coach. Unless you are incredibly lucky, you will simply fail. You’ll make fatal mistakes like the one above (and many more I can list, but it would take forever). Frankly, even nowadays, being much more experienced, I doubt I’ll ever work on anything innovative without a mentor.

    SECOND STARTUP
    What it is was: a monetization platform for video game influencers and content creators in the same niche
    My role in it: founder
    Timeline: fundraised (a bit more ambitiously this time, $90k); created platform and developed content; launched and found 0 traction; turned the website into a profitable gaming blog for a year; tried to pivot in the meantime, unsuccessfully;

# LESSON 3: Market expertise doesn’t trump startup common sense

As you’ve probably noticed, startup one and startup two are connected. What happened is that the founder of startup one finally had enough and bailed. I still had a chip on my shoulder, however, and managed to convince one of the old investors (and a few new ones) that there is merit in having another go at the market with a new (more ambitious) concept. Naturally, things didn’t turn out as planned.

>**“Fail fast, fail cheap, and leave yourself time to pivot.”**

That’s probably the most frequently repeated startup advice. And probably the most valuable one you can get. The one that you need tattooed on your forehead if you’re a founder.

So, even though I was aware that the biggest startup mistake is to spend all your resources developing something no one needs, I made exactly that mistake. **Like many a startup, I burned through 90% of our bank to acquire the validated learning that there’s no demand for the product we’re making.**

What led me astray was the belief that I was an expert on this particular market niche and knew intimately its needs.

*(comic 4)*

The confidence I had, obviously, was false.

What’s true is that the previous startup validated that the market actually exists, which is a good start.

What’s not true is that the previous startup validated in any meaningful way the new product we’re developing. We had a new concept, a new marketing approach, etc. Equally importantly, the market had changed since the first project — competition was starting to pop up, etc. I was probably one of a handful of people on the planet intimately familiar with this small market niche, and yet my ideas weren’t bulletproof anyway.

After we launched and saw 0 traction, I tried to pivot with a new idea based on the market feedback. The problem was that I had to validate it on my own with no budget and no team. I couldn’t do it properly, and I still don’t know to this day if this idea would have worked out if I had more resources to test it.

Looking back, if I had focused on being an expert on running a startup as much as I did on being an expert on the market, things could have turned out quite differently. I could have tested the waters for plan A with 20% of the budget. That would have left me with enough resources to try out at least three more different approaches. We were working from Eastern Europe (Sofia, Bulgaria) and mainly with freelancers, which meant that our burn rate was quite low.

Failing fast and cheap would have made the company four or five times more likely to succeed. I suspect that this number is even higher because the accumulated expertise by smashing your head into the wall (market) repeatedly means that plan B is usually better than plan A, plan C would probably be better than plan B, and so on.

**Every startup needs to be lean** (test your assumptions with minimal resource investment) **and agile** (be ready to continually change your concept/priorities base on market feedback)**. This is simply not negotiable if you want to succeed no matter how much of an expert you believe yourself to be.**

>*“Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don’t assume when this happens that you’ve failed. That’s normal for startups. But don’t sit around doing nothing. Iterate.” — Paul Graham*

# LESSON 4: Don’t regret correct decisions that didn’t turn out your way

After launching and finding 0 traction with almost no money left in the bank the realization where things are headed hit me hard. I wasn’t ready for a second failure just yet, however, so I poured all my efforts into finding a source of income for the business to give us some breathing room.

Content marketing was my biggest strength, so I made a [content strategy](https://medium.com/@KyrilKotashev/how-i-grew-my-gaming-blog-from-0-to-500k-monthly-pageviews-in-6-months-72f97f32514) and started churning out articles. I managed to grow the traffic of the website significantly (reached 240k unique monthly visitors at its peak), and at the same time, I was doing cold outreach to any viable business that might want to advertise with us long-term.

*(Google Analytics Screenshot)*

I deliberately made some of the content well suited to advertise a certain type of business in our niche. Eventually, I managed to close a deal with such a business, which gave us just enough income to keep our head above water.

During this time, an unexpected opportunity presented itself. A new game closely related to the one I was writing about pupped up and started gaining popularity (Auto Chess, which later turned into Dota Underlords). I was in a great situation to start writing about it and to turn our website into the main authority site on the subject, and slowly but surely I managed to rank our website in the first place in Google SERPs for most relevant keywords.

*(SERP screenshot)*

The hope was that the game was going to continue to grow (and our traffic along with it). This, in turn, would allow me to land bigger advertising contracts, giving me the needed funds to bootstrap a team and continue the validation experiments related to this new market and our newly acquired audience (I was trying to get the business into a positive feedback loop).

Then this happened:

*(steam charts screenshot, player base falls)*

Dota Underlords (the game we attached ourselves to, our market) fell from over 200k to about 10k concurrent players. Naturally, as I had invested most of my time into Dota Underlords content, our traffic started falling as well, which invalidated the authority site plans and made new advertising sales much, much harder.

You could argue I should have diversified our content to avoid this situation, but the reality is that you have limited resources and you need to plan how to use them. The business was created as a startup, it had investors, which by definition demands at least some level of ambition. Surviving as a niche gaming blog wasn’t going to cut it for the people involved, so I decided to go all-in on the opportunity I saw.

It didn’t work out, but that’s OK. As mentioned, most startups fail. Sometimes they fail because of avoidable mistakes (as demonstrated above), but sometimes they fail because the educated bets they make don’t work out.

Making educated but risky bets is what startups do, so don’t regret the second kind of failure when the risk is anticipated.

# LESSON 5: Accept full responsibility

*(comic 5, this one's not that funny :( )*

It’s quite easy to blame the circumstances when you’re looking back at past failures. It’s a great way to protect your ego. Going back to my own journey as an example:

* **Startup environment**: access to mentorship, funding, and know-how would have been much better if I was located in Silicon Valley. Yet, I tried to play the game of startups in Eastern Europe. Paul Graham sometimes mentions the concept of the [Milanese Leonardo](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html). In two words — there is no such thing, all great 15th century painters come from Florence, not Milan. So where are the Milanese painters? The theory is that the environment in which you develop trumps any kind of talent and probably even hard work. *Maybe I’m a hardworking genius, but simply failed because of the unfavorable environment half-a-planet away from the Valley.*
* **Influencer partners:** our two key influencer partners for the 2nd startup project bailed just before we launched. *Surely they are to blame for the failure at launch, not me?*
* **Crisis in Ukraine:** speaking of partners, our main business partners for the first startup were a Ukrainian esports organization. Shortly after launch, the political crisis in Ukraine happened and naturally, they were unable to fulfill all of their promises related to our project (they had bigger problems of their own). *Surely we couldn’t have predicted geopolitical events while managing an esports startup?*

I could go on, we’re all masters at making excuses. However, **this is a fool’s game.** Analyzing your past circumstances is important, but only in the light of taking valuable lessons into the future. An excuse means you learned nothing from an important event.

All of the above seems like it’s something I don’t have control over, but I’d argue that’s not true.

* **Environment:** I didn’t want to move to SV, but there are other ways to solve this problem at least partially. E.g. I could have reached out to people to ask for remote mentorship. “We have funding, we’re building this product, we want mentorship (weekly/monthly Skype calls) and we’re ready to give you a small share in the company to commit.” That’s not a bad offer and a viable way to make a connection to the real startup world.
* **Partners:** I could have done a thousand things to keep them more interested or involved in the project to minimize the chance they’ll quit. Even that aside, I could have made sure we’re not as reliant just on those two and involved more partners in advance.
* **Crisis:** sure, I couldn’t have predicted the geopolitical events, but I could have prepared for potential problems with our partners (same point as above). If someone is so important for your business that you fail if they underperform, you better have some plan to mitigate this risk. As a startup founder, you constantly operate in a high-risk environment. It’s your job to protect the project against the most critical and most likely of those risks.

Past failures are a blessing — put them on your shoulders and they will make you stronger.

Future failures are the ones you want to avoid, and your past failures are the best tool for the job.

630,c7jfdc,False,Young Entrepreneur,236,Started my own company,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys - Matthew Walters here - founder of a new footwear startup called CODDI™ ([www.coddi.co](https://www.coddi.co)).

&#x200B;

Thought I'd share my 2-year story / some of my #'s with you guys. Happy to answer any questions as well - always here to help when I can!

&#x200B;

**Story:**

* I was a professional footwear designer for Under Armour for just under 5 years (2013-2017)
* I left in the summer of 2017 to start my own footwear company. The number 1 question I get is 'Why did you leave your dream job?'...and I always answer it the same way: I became comfortable. A lot of people strive for comfort. Comfort to me is my worst nightmare. I want something new each day. Something challenging. I know it sounds silly and/or cliche, but in a weird way I like when I fail. I always learn 10x more when I fail then when I succeed. I also love control. Under Armour was amazing, but it's a multi-billion dollar company...in any company of that size, you quickly learn how small of a fish you really are.
* While creating this company, money was (and still is!) very tight. In the course of 2 years I've held 3 jobs in addition to starting my own thing (freelance design jobs, creative agency work, tennis coach. I chose each of these jobs because A: I have skills in them and B: they allowed me to have super flexible hours.)
* In order to be efficient with my time, I altered my sleep schedule to 3am-10am sleep. This allowed me to work directly with my overseas factory for almost 100% of their workday. 
* After 1.5 years of developing the boot, I launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coddifootwear/codditm-boots-for-your-next-adventure) in January 2019 for 2 reasons: 1. footwear has really high mold costs...there's no way I could afford this myself and 2. the community that comes with launching on Kickstarter.
* After 30 days on Kickstarter, I was successfully funded with over 61K
* This summer (2019), the entire shipment made it to my parents house [(aka the warehouse haha)](https://imgur.com/a/lIpKcyQ)
* One by one my parents, wife and I fulfilled each and every order. Every box came with a handwritten note, a sticker, and of course the boots
* For the rest of the summer, I will be focused on customer service, continuing to work and grow our small Instagram affiliate program, and plan out our first official marketing campaign which will launch this fall.

&#x200B;

**Some fun stats:**

* Launched: June 2019
* Location: Chicago
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1 (+ my parents who help with fulfillment since the warehouse is their house!)

&#x200B;

* Kickstarter Goal: $30,000
* Raised with Kickstarter: $61,316 (Kickstarter keeps 5%...credit card transaction fee keeps another 3-5%)
* Pairs sold via Kickstarter: 365
* MOQ with factory: 1000 pairs
* Price per mold: \~$1.5K
* Maximum colors set by factory: 3
* Maximum sizes set by factory: 10

&#x200B;

* First month selling on our website (June 2019): 3.6K in sales

&#x200B;

**Timeline:**

* Summer 2017: Initial sketch
* Fall 2017: Reached out to factory to get sample made
* Fall 2017-Fall 2018: 10+ rounds of samples and wear testing
* January 2019: Launched a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coddifootwear/codditm-boots-for-your-next-adventure) campaign
* February 2019: Campaign successfully funded
* Feb-May 2019: Ordered materials, built boots, shipped boots overseas
* June 2019: Fulfilled all Kickstarter and post-kickstarter orders
* July-Aug 2019: Plan for fall campaign
* Fall 2019: Fall campaign launches
* January 2020: Sell out of our initial 1000 order

&#x200B;

**Biggest hurdles:**

* finding a reputable factory
* coming up with a name
* dealing with a trademark issue (which set me back 3 months)
* building my brand months before Kickstarter so the initial Kickstarter launch would be as big as possible
* doing quality control on 1000 pairs
* living 1 hour away from my warehouse
* writing 400+ personalized hand-written notes haha

&#x200B;

**Best things to come from this experience thus far:**

* the feedback and reviews from everyone wearing my boots
* the insane amount of amazing people I would have never met
* learning something outside of footwear design. Every. Single. Day.
* I'm now immune to failure. Not saying I don't fail...I fail all the time. But I'm now immune to letting failure affect me. We all need to change how we view failure. Let failures be your greatest weapon. Use them to learn and grow.

&#x200B;

Last thing as well: Thank you to everyone in the community - I'm here lurking all the time learning something new every single day. Keep posting! Keep sharing! Such a great place to learn.

408,5qgobq,False,,311,"Lifestyle entrepreneur with multiple sources of income that are four or five figures a month. 6 mil views on YouTube, 4 mil on Quora. AMA",Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit. My name is Sam Priestley, and I’m a bit of cliche really. Location independent (currently in Malta) with multiple online businesses. Yeah, so feel free to hate on me.

Where I’m a bit less of a cliche, is that I don’t ‘hustle’ or work 100 hour weeks. I’d probably have more money if I did, but I find it difficult to motivate myself to do the unpleasant jobs and I’m guilty of normally taking the most interesting path. Which has led me to having tried out most online business fads and abandoning projects I probably shouldn’t have. Some worked out, most didn’t.

I’m also an introvert and don’t really like talking about myself - overcoming that is one of the reasons I’m doing this AMA and why I started a blog a few years back. If you met me you’d probably assume I was an accountant or some other equally mainstream middle-class job.

I’ve been working for myself for the last 9 years or so, ever since my second year of university. Here are my current businesses and how they’re doing:

**Amazon FBA** - Five figures a month profit. [Here’s a screenshot of November's income report for UK and USA](http://imgur.com/a/HZeut). (I’ve chosen November because December and Christmas isn’t an accurate reflection on how much it makes).

Amazon FBA has a bad name because a lot of people use it to resell crap from China and then sell a training course on how to do the same thing. But really Amazon FBA is just the name of the logistics and fulfilment service that Amazon provide, meaning they handle all your warehousing and postage. Companies have been doing that for hundreds of years, Amazon have just put it online and greatly lowered the barrier of entry.

I focus on building my table tennis brand and making it the best there is. I don’t mind telling you I sell table tennis equipment because I’m trying to build the brand... so go out and buy some Eastfield or PalioxETT table tennis equipment please. I guarantee they’ll be better than anything else in the price range. I’ve been working on it for years and spent a fortune on research and development.

We sell on our own websites, on Amazon, eBay and a bit wholesale. But Amazon is by far the biggest market. Personally I never buy stuff online from anywhere but Amazon, and that is becoming more and more common. So Amazon is where I want to be.

**Blog** - Averaged a bit over £3k a month over the last six months. That’s revenue, but profit is pretty similar as my only cost is hosting and my time. [This post breaks down how it makes money](https://sampriestley.com/two-year-blog-earning-report/).

I’ve been working on the blog for about two years now. The only way I really marketed it is through writing long form answers on Quora and referencing back to my blog. I have a little over 4 million views on Quora now.

The blog makes its money through affiliate links. Affiliate links get a bad rap because the writer has a bit of a conflict of interest. Can you write a truly unbiased review if you get commission for every sale? I have my own moral standard that I adhere to: I only look for affiliate links after I’ve written the post. If the companies I talk about don’t have one that’s fine - I leave it and don’t go checking the competition.

An example of that is Upwork. I haven’t been able to find an affiliate program for them, but still refer people to them because I think they’re better than Freelancer - who do have an aff network. 

I leave a lot of money on the table as a result. But I think it makes the site better in the long term.

I’m not a very good writer (another reason I started the blog), so I try and make my posts as useful as possible. It seems that people don’t mind wading through bad grammar and bad spelling if they get some value out of the post.

**YouTube** - I have a YouTube video with 6.4 million views that gets a few hundred thousand extra every month. It is a time-lapse of me learning table tennis. It makes hardly anything. Like $100 a month. [Here is it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y21uwFUgkE).

**Self-publishing** - I have one book on a very niche subject (me learning table tennis). And another novella I wrote as an experiment. The table tennis book does alright and sells a couple of hundred copies a month making about £500.

**Coffee shop** - I started a coffee shop in London. It doesn’t really earn any money. Just about pays the staff and is slowly paying off the money borrowed to start it. Highly recommend staying away from opening a coffee shop unless you really know what you’re doing. Plus it’s a not-for-profit so even if it did earn loads I wouldn’t benefit. It's called [The Wren](https://www.facebook.com/TheWrenCoffee/?fref=ts).  If you're in London go and check it out!

**Property** - I jointly own four properties. They don’t make much money. Currently looking to get out of three.

P2P lending and investment - I put any extra money I make into p2p lending or an index tracker. Been doing it a while now so make £1k-£2k a month in interest/dividends/equity increase.

Previous projects:

**Tech Startup** - I spent most of 2012 pumping money into and working all day every day on a tech startup. It was a comparison website for a financial product. Eventually sold to a big market maker in London for a small profit. I hated it. I’m a rubbish manager, didn’t really have any interest in the product and found it really stressful. It’s what convinced me to go into more lifestyle entrepreneur stuff and stay away from startups.

I’m afraid I can’t answer questions about the sale price or the company that bought it or the name of the product. That’s all covered by an NDA.

**Gambling** - The first thing I ever did that actually made money. Quite a roller coaster really. First few years involved a lot of programming and huddling over a computer. Final phase ended up with with our team running round bookmakers in London with wads of cash, wearing wigs and placing arbitrage bets on horse racing. 

Outside of business and money making:
I currently spend a lot of time learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I spent a year training every day with a coach at table tennis. And I am trying to learn Spanish. In March this year, I got all my businesses to the point where I don’t need to be on site and have been travelling the world with my fiance ever since.

To help get out of my comfort zone, become less introverted and deal with conflict better, I volunteered as a part-time police officer in London from 2013 until I left the UK to travel this year.

**Why am I doing an AMA?** Well, for one I like the community here. I read it most days and among the crap there are some really interesting discussions. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2w4kkj/guy_plays_table_tennis_every_day_for_a_year/) (not posted by me) is what made my YouTube video go viral. So yeah, thanks!

Secondly, I want you to read my blog. It’s called [The Arbing Blog](https://sampriestley.com/). It makes money through affiliate links. Yeah, it’s for-profit, so shoot me. But there are no courses or annoying popups or anything like that. I talk about all the above stuff and whatever else I happen to be up to. 

So.. ask me anything!

740,en7wp6,False,Case Study,99,Automation #7: How one business went from 10 hours of work a day to complete autopilot,Entrepreneur,"A while back i made my first post on automation ( [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)) and got a fantastic response (And, full disclosure, a few leads too). Today I'd like to talk more about three short examples that are some of my favorite projects.

Disclosure: I own three small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

If you'd like to read some of my previous posts, please check them out here:

* [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)
* [Automation: Three short examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aqilju/automation_three_short_examples/)
* [Automation #5: How one client made themselves unemployed](https://new.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/anrhbl/automation_5_how_one_client_made_themselves/)
* [Why Automation Matters #3: How i achieved a temporary monopoly overnight](https://new.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9azsbx/why_automation_matters_3_how_i_achieved_a/)

Today, I'd like to talk about a client who worked hard for their business. 10 hours a day! Their job? They would scour over 14 different mediums for trade alerts (Alerts for potentially good trades). These 14 were through different services. Some were over E-Mail, some over SMS, some on Slack chatrooms and others posted on websites.

Their day job was to filter through these alerts, find the most worthwhile ones and forward them on to their own users. On top of this they'd end up spending 1-2 hours a day just managing overhead. Subscriptions, adding them to their own E-Mail, SMS lists, verifying that the people already on the lists have paid for their subscription etc. Quite a tiresome process!

# The automation

One problem with the automation here was that the client needed to hand-pick the alerts that finally went out. They couldn't provide a simple algorithm to do it, their customers were paying for 20 years of experience!

The job was simple. Build a bot that automatically: Reads E-Mails, SMS, Slack channels & constantly updating websites. Okay, maybe not so simple. An algorithm would then filter out the worst of these leads based on a few objective criteria. This'd eliminate about 70-80% of the alerts.

For the rest? They would get a notification on their mobile phone. The notification would have an 'accept' and 'reject' button right there in the notification bar. Accept it and the alert is forwarded to all their subscribers.

Their entire subscription management was also automated. A script would automatically add & remove subscribers and verify payments received.

# Lessons learned

Many of the times i work with clients, i end up automating 10-30% of their workload. Maybe some tool that allows them to pursue a new line of work that was previously too time consuming. Rarely do i have the opportunity to automate 80-90% of the work!

With one tool, this man got his life back. An entire workday spent monitoring different websites, E-Mail, slack and SMS changed to just going about your day and responding to mobile notifications every 5-10 minutes (Remember, most of the alerts are automatically filtered out, only a few actually go to him for review).

That's the real power of automation. It gives you your life back. One day you're working hard on your business. The next day you're thinking hard about your next side hustle. Automation doesn't just give you wings, it gives you an entire jet engine. Think hard about how much work you do for your business. Unless it requires that 'insight' garnered over years of experience, i could probably automate it. And even if it does, automation can take away most of the work as in this example.

601,43kszm,False,,139,How to Wake up at 5AM and Build Your Startup,Entrepreneur,"Hi, last week I reached the [2nd most popular post on Medium](https://medium.com/life-learning/how-to-wake-up-at-5am-and-build-your-startup-7e1cff3a7f3f#.wnabeoxy6)!  
I'm posting the entire post here on Reddit. Proof [imgur](http://imgur.com/47RtxCk)  
Tried to format it the best I can. Links are missing.  
  
**TLDR:**
Build your startup before your day job, use a smarter alarm, drink coffee as early as possible, and break your startup into micro-startups.  
  
**How to Wake up at 5AM and Build Your Startup**  
What does your morning routine look like? Mine used to be waking up at 7AM, sleep walking to the shower, frantically getting dressed into socially acceptable clothes, pouring myself a cup of caffeine, and walking amongst drones of zombies to a crowded bus station.  
  
Of course, getting out of this hellish cycle is quite the “Catch-22.” The last thing you want to do after working eight-hours is to work on your startup. Yet,if you don’t spend time building your own business, you’ll be trapped in an endless loop of corporations. Racing to the office before 9AM. Managers breathing down your neck. An eternity of smiling at your coworker’s snide comments. Which is a horror movie in and of itself.  
  
**Rise of the Morning Superheroes**  
So I decided to wake up at 5AM and build my startup before the soul sucking day of a gleeful employee started. And he lived happily ever after… would have been great! If I managed to wake up early the moment I decided to become a morning person. I quickly found that my half-awake zombified determination could power-through any obstacle blocking my sleep. On the lucky days I did manage to wake up, I would just sit there and stare into the abyss.  
  
Productivity blogs make it look easy. You’re constantly bombarded with amazing feats that only these mythical morning people can achieve: 8 Things Every Person Should Do Before 8 AM, and 7 Things Morning People Do Differently, and Why Productive People Get Up Insanely Early. Watching these superheros catch falling airplanes before 8AM somehow makes you feel guilty for oversleeping. I mean are they even human?  
  
>Square/Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey  
>Wakes up at 5:30 to meditate and go for a six-mile jog. He kept up that routine during a period where he shuttled back and forth between Square and Twitter, spending around 8 hours a day at both companies.  
  
The truth is waking up at 5AM is hell. Your “morning self” is not the friendliest of people. Mr. Morning Jekyll will subconsciously turn your alarm off before early morning meetings and snooze your alarm when you have to catch the morning train. You can’t trust yourself in the morning. So let’sappease your morning demon by changing how you wake up.  
  
**Find an Alarm Smarter than You**  
I’m not sure when the trend of being violently shocked awake took hold, but we seem quite content with our morning shock therapy. Instead of willingly accepting a blitzkrieg of violent noises, find an alarm that gradually wakes you up. Waking up slowly allows your body to accept the fact you’re waking up. So when your mind actually does wake up, you’ll be less in the mood of killing your innocent alarm.  
  
You can use a coffee alarm that masterfully brews coffee to match the time you wake up. A light-up alarm that gently emits artificial light on your face while you reflect on how man has conquered the Sun. A vibrating wrist alarmto wake up early without having your spouse wanting to murder you every morning. Having a dog/cat/small-human walk over your face at 5AM is also a good option.  
  
Personally, I use the “Warmly” alarm app alongside the default smartphone alarm. Slowly waking up to 5 minutes of birds chirping in your ear, before opening my eyes to Yo-Yo Ma’s Cello vibrating through the air is quite the morning experience. Outsmart your morning demon starting with your alarm clock.  
  
**Have a Long-Distance Relationship with Your Alarm**  
Building a habit isn’t rocket science. A simple model of building positive habits (reading, exercising, socializing) and discarding negative habits (drinking, smoking, junk food) is through “Perverse Accordances.”  
  
>In design, you create affordances when you want your user to do something, and disturbances when you want them to not do something. Thus you encourage desired behaviors by making them easier, and discourage undesired behaviors by making them harder.  
  
If you want to build a habit of “not” turning off your alarm, make turning off your alarm as difficult as possible. Set multiple alarms, download a puzzle alarm app, or place your smartphone in a jar. While I would love to cuddle my smartphone before I fall asleep and glance into its lovely glass screen the moment I wake. If you want to wake up early, move your smartphone far away and have a long-distance relationship.  
  
**Force Yourself to Drink Coffee**  
For those who survived the Hunger Games and actually woke up, staying awake is another problem. I mean you did just wake up at 5AM, why not go back to sleep? You have all the time in the world! You can always wake up early “tomorrow.” All the while regretting having listened to my morning temptations after falling back asleep. I’m simply a terrible person before my first cup of coffee. So let’s get caffeinated.  
  
You can’t treat your 5AM coffee like a normal cup of coffee. It doesn’t matter if you painstakingly prepared a cup of hand-dripped Guatemala Starbucks coffee. If coffee is not part of your waking process Mr. Morning Jekyll will just ignore it. Don’t rely on your morning self to go out of his way to wake up. He’ll try everything to go back to bed.  
  
Find a way to directly integrate your coffee into your morning routine. The goal is to make your alarm a”trigger” for your coffee drinking habit. “If” the alarm rings, “then” you drink coffee. Experiment on different ways to automate the coffee drinking process.  
  
Initially, I planned on brewing a cup of coffee the first thing in the morning. I didn’t even make it to the kitchen. Then, I tried preparing a cup of ice-coffee the night before and placing it on my desk. I didn’t make it to my desk. Eventually, I placed the cup of coffee on my alarm (smartphone). So in order to turn my alarm off, I had to literally pick up a cup of coffee. Once the coffee is in your hand, you might as well drink it. Not drinking coffee at this point is just cheating. Treat 5AM as the start of your work-day, drink some coffee and build your startup.  
  
**Procrastinate Yourself Awake**  
Still not awake? A little procrastination never hurt anyone. Then again, self-professed Internet addicts don’t provide the best productivity tips.  
  
I spend a ridiculous amount of time looking at funny cat pictures on Reddit, Imgur, and 9gag. Hopelessly dependent on my next viral fix. I just can’t help myself. Visiting the same website over and over again in hopes of new content. Consciously knowing there isn’t anything there.  
  
So let’s justify our procrastination under a more productive light. While looking at funny cat pictures before you sleep, gives you temporary insomnia.Looking at your smartphone/computer first thing in the morning can actually help you wake up.  
  
>Why Screens Ruin Your Sleep  
>“Exposure to blue light of LED screens affects melanopsin, which leads to a suppression of melatonin, and ultimately keeps our bodies from feeling sleepy.”*  
  
If you can’t bear the thought of working on your startup first thing in the morning. Spend a few minutes procrastinating until your morning demons settle down. Remember, you’re fighting a two-front battle. Waking up at a freakishly early time “and” working on your startup.  
  
**Break Your Startup into Micro-Startups**  
When I can barely turn my alarm off, I’m not going to start my day debugging a server destroying bug. Your morning self is an asshole. Starting the day with a daunting task just provides extra incentive to go back to sleep.  
  
By now I’m going to assume your New Years Resolutions has failed, like thenormal 88% of us. One reason you probably failed is you chose too BIG of a goal. “I want to end world hunger” “I want to have six-pack” despite never having exercised in my life. This isn’t a Miss Universe pageant.  
  
“The Art of Manliness” shows how using micro-habits can help build towards a macro-habit. The goal is not to build your entire startup first thing in the morning, but to simply “start.” Once you get the engine rolling it’s easier to switch to a higher gear.  
  
>If you want to floss your teeth, just floss one tooth. Commit to flossing just ONE tooth — and make that your goal for the day. If you are able to do that, you’ve accomplished your goal. You can check it off your list. But here’s the trick: Once you perform the micro-habit enough times, it becomes muchharder NOT to complete the entire habit than to simply do the whole thing.  
  
Break your startup into micro-startups that you can work on in the half-awake hours of the morning. Build your app by writing one line of code a day. Start your blog by writing one paragraph a day. Build your portfolio by sketching one design a day. Build your startup in 100 small increments rather than spending 100 full-time days. Every work doesn’t have to be a Picasso. By decreasing the barrier to entry, you’re more likely to follow through and stay awake.  
  
**Build a Lean Startup**  
It’s hard to admit, but no one really knows what they’re doing at first. Even the largest startup unicorns in the world, took a long time to find their footing.AirBnb survived by selling political themed cereal Obama O’s and Cap’n McCain’s. #Slack came out of a failed game “Glitch.” Even YouTube began as a video dating service “Tune in Hook Up.”  
  
Micro-startups work well with the Lean Startup methodology (The Lean Startup by Eric Ries). Not only are micro-startups easier to implement, but provide a shorter feedback loop that keeps you more in touch with your audience. With 75% of all startups failing, would you rather spend 100 days in a basement building a product your customers “might” like or connect with your audience everyday “while” you adapt your startup to address your customer’s pain-points? Don’t build another Blockbuster.  
  
Start with the assumption that you’re wrong. Constantly validate your theories through micro-experiments. When I first started “Krown.io”. I explained the service as an “Annotation Blogging Platform.” That was, until I found out the majority of people have no idea what “Annotations” are. We tried a variation of “Smart Blogging,” “Highlight Blogging,” “Feedback Blogs,” and “Contextual Blogging Platform.” Which surprise, surprise. People still had no idea what we were talking about. So we added a bare-to-the-bones explanation, “Highlight a text and add comments directly on the highlighted text.” Validate your hypothesis.  
  
**Make Your Work Public**  
We all have that irrational fear the moment you publish your work, trolls all over the world will unite and make it their life’s mission to downvote you tooblivion. The truth is they don’t really care. In a world with 2 million blog posts published daily. Getting discovered is the bigger challenge. You really need stand out.  
  
If you can’t even get yourself to wake up early and build your startup. Why worry about your content’s likability? That’s the same as worrying if you study too much you might become a Harvard Professor. If you’ve been struggling with your masterpiece for a while. The simple act of public accountability can help you wake up early and build your startup. Don’t just take my word. It’s supported by scientific evidence!  
  
>Our findings are of relevance to those interested in changing their behavior and achieving their goals, as well as to those who want to help them, like weight loss programs, money advice agencies or sport coaches. Prompting people to monitor their progress can help them to achieve their goals, but some methods of monitoring are better than others. Specifically, we would recommend that people be encouraged to record, report or make public what they find out as they assess their progress.  
  
You don’t have to build a interstellar satellite to broadcast your progress, simple tools like Twitter can help you wake up. Thomas Frank from the “College Info Geek” uses Twitter and Buffer in an ingenious way to force himself awake. Basically he sets an automated Tweet about donating $25 and has to wake up early to prevent himself losing $25. Trust yourself. Your work is interesting.  
  
**Be Obsessed with Productivity**  
Try to hit two birds with one stone and kill the third bird from shock. Making your micro-startup more productive provides extra incentive to wake up early. I start my day by writing a public journal. If I were just writing public journal for the sake of writing a journal, I probably wouldn’t be as diligent. A single journal helps build my startup in three ways.  
  
First, writing a morning journal helps me reflect on my progress. How do I increase engagement with my audience? Should I switch over from Wordpress comments to Disqus Comments? Are Adsense ads still viable against the rising climate of Adblock? What is the best time to publish a blog post? What tasks can I automate? Am I crazy for starting a business?  
  
Secondly, writing a daily journal builds content for my blog “TechMob.”Building a niche blog takes time. You need at least 1,000 short articles to begin gaining substantial organic traffic from Google. Writing a daily journal helps build the necessary content foundation.  
  
Lastly, writing a public journal promotes my Contextual Blogging Platform “Krown.” TechMob is built on Krown and uses sentence-level comments to add contextual information. Every post on TechMob promotes Krown through the sub-domain “techmob.krown.io” and the CTA at the bottom of each post.  
  
**Prepare to Run a Marathon**  
Starting from 7AM completely switch gears to accommodate your 9–5 day job.While I would love to work on my startup full-time. Sadly humans are trapped in biological prisons where you to have to constantly eat, drink, and feel the urge to sleep with other people. Damn you Darwin. Working in micro-startups sprints in the morning, opens the possibility to continue working at your day job.  
  
Be smart. Don’t bet your entire life on a single game of Poker. Allocate a portion of your assets to a life-changing Poker game, while working at the casino itself. Startups take time and you need to eat.  
  
Based on Nassim Taleb’s Barbell Strategy (Anti-Fragile) you should allocate 20% of your resources to high-risk/high-return anti-fragile activities (ie. startups, bungee-jumping), and invest the remaining 80% in low-risk/low-return assets (ie. school, day job, family dinners). Experience the best of both worlds. Build your startup as a side-project first, gain validation, then jump into the unknown when you’re ready.  
  
**Wake up Early and Build Your Startup**  
Every morning startup routine will be different. Try to find a routine that fits your goals. If you’re going to spend 8 hours doing something you hate, at least invest 1 hour on something you love. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is madness. Don’t let your current “reality” drag you in the wrong direction. Face the odds, try to live the life you were meant to live. Wake up early and build your startup.

923,57405j,False,,196,"Wantrepreneur Wednesday: How to live rent-free (or make an extra $19,000/yr) by sitting on your ass.",Entrepreneur,"Hi r/Entrepreneur! I'm new here but discovered you guys just in time to offer up some advice and experience for Wantrepreneur Wednesday on how to spend $0 on rent OR make over $19,000+/yr doing basically nothing. For background I'm a serial micro-entrepreneur. I've never had a traditional job, and have been starting up small businesses to support my lifestyle since I was 17. A year ago money started getting tight and I could no longer afford (with good conscience) to keep paying over $1900 for an oversized living space for myself, so I found a solution that would allow me to live in a pretty nice place for $0/m with some elbow grease. 

One of the best tools, by far, used to make money without lifting a finger is airbnb, or other space-sharing websites. Before I used these services, and had any experience with them I thought they were a horrible way to earn or save money. When I first began to ponder about the idea I immediately jumped the gun and tried to sell access to my 2400sq. creative loft space. I lived in a hip neighborhood, and never once thought that the lack of walls (therefore, privacy) would be an issue. That is, until I found myself with no bookings, and decided that airbnb and sites like it were a scam. Then I moved to Vegas.    

## Going from paying $1200/m in rent to $0  

When I moved to Vegas I did so because the rent was cheaper, the weather weas nicer, and it's a city that's filled with opportunity to grow my main business. I found a nice 2bedroom apartment in a low-key part of town for a reasonable price. It's 1200sqf and I pay $1200/m for it. Upon signing the lease I immediately started planning to rent the smaller room out. I bought ~$400 (platform bed, comfortable mattress) worth of furniture, $200 on housewares (everything from towels to silverware), and another $100 on refreshments for my guests. By the first week I had gotten my first reservation, and by the week six I had made back my initial investment, and then some. Gross profit for the first 30 days was $1765 and has been steadily climbing as I raise my nightly rate and fees.     

## My motivation  

I simply didn't want to work hard, anymore. I have a small business that brings in money irregularly, and I didn't want to rely on it to survive or live paycheck by paycheck because I didn't feel like getting up in the morning. Some unwarranted advice for depressed people in this sub: You can be successful. You just have to work around your shortcomings, instead of letting them run YOU. Also be realistic. If you know you get down often, plan for that shit. The fact that 12-15 days out of a month I feel like shit was a MAJOR motivator for me. Not just the money, and small profit, but also the social aspects of it. I now have to keep my home clean, and I have to interact with strangers on a daily basis. It did wonders for my social skills. Also, moving to a more affordable city meant I was saving an average of $600/m on rent. That was motivation enough if I'm being honest.

## Your motivation  
I say this with the utmost respect: If you're thinking of this, don't get into it to profit. Get into it to save money, and to save time spent getting a job. Think to yourself: *If I had all of my basic expenses paid for, what could I do? What could I create? What business could I build?*  There are people that create side gigs, and full-fledged businesses while working a day job. If you decide to go rent free using an airbnb-like service, you will have alot of time on your hands. Use that time to make more money, and save the money you have now in case of an emergency. Or, in case your landlord finds out, but let's hope that's not gonna happen for awhile. (That was a joke. Please find out if your landlord is cool with this before renting. Or at least consult with an attorney. It'll be the best $250 you spend that month.)

## My start-up costs:  

* Security deposit + first months - $2500   
* Various utilities - $350  
* Furniture - $375  
* Housewares - $200  
* Snacks - $100   
 
 

## 5 must-haves of doing airbnb:  

### 1) You have to live in a large city. Period.  
It's possible to make money in smaller cities, but if you're trying to live rent-free so you can save, or start a business, or become a full-time painter, you're going to have to live in a large city, and if you don't already you have to move.    

### 2) You need enough space. Period.  
You'll need a 2b/2bth apartment, with enough room for at least 3 people to live comfortably (you, your guest, and their wife or husband). Cramped spaces often lead to people feeling uncomfortable, and it makes it impossible for your guests to enjoy themselves. 

### 3) You need the basic living necessities.   
The basics include things you'd normally have access to in hotel rooms: A bed. A dresser or closet. A night stand. Wireless *and* wired internet. A tv. A phone. Towels. Shampoo. Soap. (Not needed but good-to-have extras: Eating utensils, cups, plates, skillets, ect)  

### 4) You must have snacks. Lots of snacks.  
One thing that a ton of hosts get wrong is snacks. I spent less than $1.5/person for snacks. This includes canned soda, breakfast bars, and chips. A big part of these savings is the use of Sams club, and other discount stores. I provide snacks for my guest for two reasons: 1) because I've been a guest with airbnb hosts that didn't give me snacks, and I had to resort to late night trips to White Castle to feed my late-night hunger. 2) It's *very* rare that someone will eat your snacks, drink your expensive coffee and leave you a bad or lackluster review. Sometimes you make a mistake and give them the wrong key. Sometimes you forget to put extra towels in the bathroom and the guest ends up looking for them in your laundry room. Shit happens, and nothing will ever be perfect. But if you have snacks, and correct your mistakes with a smile, people will typically view you favorably and give you a positive review.  

### 5) You must shut the hell up.  
If you're an extrovert I sincerely feel bad for you. You can skip this part if the subheading made you cringe. Now, for introverts or those that are quiet, you have to keep up the silence. Don't stomp around at 9AM in the morning. Don't  sit in your kitchen at 2AM, eating cheetos and bonbons. Don't let your cat or dog roam around, meowing or barking all night. Shut the hell up, because people are trying to sleep and *they're paying you for that privilege.*    

## One last word of advice (and an invitation for questions!)  
One of the most disgusting things I've learned about as an airbnb host is how most rooms are rarely cleaned properly. Most hosts will vacumm, and clean towels, but a lot of them fail to clean bed linens, comforters, and bathrooms that are only slightly dingy. This is the *wrong* way to go about cleaning a space for anyone, and it is repulsive. When someone books your place, I recommend minimum $50 cleaning fee. For this fee, you should provide them with a clean room, clean bed linens, cleans towels, and a completely spotless bathroom regardless of how the last guest left your space. If you want, you can give that $50+ to pay someone to come in after each guest and clean the entire place. Or, if you'd rather keep the extra cash (like I do...) you can do it yourself. Cleaning an entire room, plus the bathroom takes less than 20 minutes if you work quickly. (this time doesnt include the minutes spent eating bonbons, waiting for the washer to finish a load.) Cleaning is fairly simple, and easy to outsource. Do not skimp on this. If not for the good reviews, do it for the sake of caring for another human being.   

Now that Im done with that warning, If anyone has any questions about using airbnb or not working for a living, feel free to ask them here.  

## Obligatory ""plz dont do something illegal and blame me"" edit:  
My situation is different than most random people that use airbnb. My landlord knows what Im doing. He also signed an agreement that basically states I can sublet the room or apartment for short periods of time. With that said, legally, airbnb falls in a grey area most of the time, and you should consult with a lawyer. Pay the couple hundred bucks to ask questions and have them do a little research to find out if what you're planning to do is legal, in a grey area of the law, or illegal and if so what kinds of fines you could have to pay.   

More info on my situation:    

> I told my landlord up front what I'd be doing, and he was very clear that as long as there was no excessive noise he didn't care if I sublet the room or the whole apartment. I had an additional leasing agreement drafted by my attorney for this very purpose. I got a great deal on my place (it is very cheap for the area.), and I was lucky enough to be introduced to a laid back landlord through prior business connections.

133,3avuhg,False,,304,"I created DicksByMail.com, went viral, and sold the company before even shipping out my second round of orders. AMA",Entrepreneur,"I wanted to wait to post this because 

A) I didn't want to seem like I was simply promoting my own company

B) I wanted to be done with it all

C) Im kinda lazy

Here's the brief rundown of what was definitely the most exciting/stressful month of my life.

At the end of February I had a bit of an... issue... with a girl I was seeing. This prompted me to to joke with some of my regular customers (I'm a bartender) about wanting to send her a dildo with the message 'Go Fuck Yourself'... we laughed and I was aware of the spark it created in my head because the idea stuck with me. 

A few days later while looking for cheap dildos online, I started seeing dick shaped candies and thats when the idea hit me; I could literally tell her to eat a bag of dicks. I joked with the same people about the idea and they thought it was brilliant, and everyone laughed it off - except me. a few days later (on what would ultimately be one of my few days off for months to come), I sat down with a few glasses of whisky and browsed through the shopify templates and confirmed pricing, then took the plunge to posting the site itself.

It was terribly bad, but it was funny. and I knew that I could actually provide the products, at the price and make a few dollars. 

Initial costs were **$8** for www.dicksbymail.com as my domain name, that would later become a big trend (I'll share a funny story about that later if you remind me).

A bag of gummy dicks was about **$6** at the time including shipping when i bought 2 dozen orders... I didn't buy anything until I had my first few sales. I'd worked shipping out to be about $**8** too hit the states through canada, and $**7** for most of Canada. 

I set the price at $19.99 feeling that $20 was an easy amount for people to part with, and I was right.

Price to Customer - $19.99

My Shipping - $8

Cost of Product - $6

Shopify rate - $1/product credit card processing fees

This left me with about $5 profit from every bag of dicks I sent out, not too bad.

I started to show the website to friends, the customers I chatted with and some of my family that has a good sense of humor.I even did some paid reddit ads that resulted in traffic but no sales.  I ended up getting a few orders, and I knew everyones name that I got (both the buyer and the victim). After about 6 orders in 5 days, I decided to order the product and ship some out. After about a week, my product arrived in the mail and i started to assemble the packages, but the first person to receive a package  was going to be someone special, no not the girl from the top of the post, someone that was actually more important - My best friend. I put together the package, even adding postage, but personally went over and put it in his mailbox.

I got a text from him later saying it was one of the funniest things ever, and that he was going to post it on imgur - which he did [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/6Ldtx).

Within 24 hours this was on the front page of imgur with about a half million views, that ended up translating into about a thousand dollars in sales, this day was coincidentally St Paddys day. 

$1000 was roughly 50 orders most of which came from the US, of all the things I scrambled to do, changing from CAD to USD was one of the best decisions I'd made that day. 

Blogs started to use the pictures and link to the site and hundreds of orders started to pour in. I went from thinking that I had to order a few hundred bags and get stuffing, to looking to order a few thousand and get a fulfillment company. At the end of the day, over $30,000 was spent on my site. and I still needed to make a phonecall.

Ordering the dicks in bulk wasn't much of an issue, I called the distributor directly from the box that I received in my first order. I asked for 6000 units of well, units based on the orders that were still rolling in. The price quote went from $6/bag to under $2. 

Cha Ching.

The next thing I did was [post this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2zl4y9/i_created_dicksbymailcom_yesterday_we_sold_2000/) on reddit because I was in a bind, I know I needed someone to fulfill the orders, but had no idea who, or how. A few people PM'd me with the services they used and I decided to go with www.monthlyboxer.com . The person running the show over there is Alex and he is a down to earth guy that was a genuine help in the first few weeks.

Fulfillment costs were $2 flat per unit that shipped out. Now I was already saving money on the whole deal with buying the dicks at a huge volume, so the extra cost wasn't bad. It was great, I didn't have to look at another bag of dicks for a long time if I chose not to. And the extra bonus was that now since I was shipping from the states, I could use a much cheaper option than shipping from Canada.

Now my costs looked like this:

Price to Customer -$19.99

My Shipping - $3

Fulfillment Costs - $2

Cost of Product - $1.75

Shopify Rates - $1 /order (apparently I could have dropped this down by upgrading my account - oops)

This put about $12 in profits into my pocket on each order, more than double what I was doing before... This also was the day the internet lost its mind and collectively spent $78,000 within 24 hours on sending bags of dicks to each other.

These first few days I did very little media, but did talk to both a local person (friend of a friend) and a BuzzFeed 'journalist' because I knew how big that exposure was going to be. The reason I stayed off media was simply because I wanted to focus on selling the products, I had dicks on order and on back order to meet the needs of the people, setting up the system was the #1 priority in my mind and I friggen did it.

The next few days saw more sales, (averaging $15k in sales per day for the following week) but I had a dilemma on my hands, I 'd been so focused on making this work that I was now a $100k+ business that was not registered/incorporated/insured or anything that a real business should be. So the natural question came up - should I go the glitter bomb route and sell out while the selling is good.

I contacted Flippa, and worked with the good people there to let someone else take over the dick empire that I created. Flippa works by taking 10% of the sale and then has a few extras built it to make more money. I was working with someone there to get the information that they needed and was basically told that they would run the auction and had several 'registered bidders' that were already verified. Within a few days the auction had shot up to the reserve price of $100k, remember this wasnt just for a domain, this was including the orders that were days away from shipping and they would have gotten all that revenue as well.

I was happy. Someone was going to buy the site, and then they could take on the orders, the headaches, the media and we would both make quite a bit. 

Less than 24 hours before the auction ended, the 'verified bidder' pulled out. People were pointing fingers and blaming each other, lots of people were calling me fake implying I had done that myself (I didn't). The bids slowly creeped up from $10-$20k but the auction ended without getting back up to that reserve price again.

In the days leading up to the auction debacle, I had been contacted from someone outside the auction that wished to buy the site. They asked a bunch of questions, and were pretty interested and fairly engaging, they understood the reality - I was a guy that did something big and wanted to see it succeed, make myself some money, and let someone else make money too. 

They drafted an offer that not only paid me out 6 figures right away, but also royalties over time as well. 

I took the offer, they took control of the site, and we all made money. In the days leading up to the sale I had lawyered up and got everything legally transferred to a company I started, and made the sale from there. 

As the dust settles, do I regret anything I did? No, I feel I handled everything pretty well and though I could have made more money if I kept the company, I wanted to make sure that the house of cards I was building didn't just topple down on me and have me end up with nothing. In asking the people that bought the site, they seem pretty happy with the whole thing as well. And really, Thats what I wanted - I want people to be happy with the whole damn thing. The customers, the 'victims', the new owners and myself. 

I think I've learned enough that if I do it again, I'll keep everything for myself next time. But I want to focus on a few other projects for now, things nearer to my heart than my dick.

Hi Guys,

I started a small web development company this year in January and I wanted to document my journey from making nothing for the first few months up to a steady income of over $10,000 a month. This isn’t all profit as I will explain but it’s been good so far and my best month was $17,000+.  Apologies for my rant-ish writing and hopefully some of you get some value out of this.

*** This isn't some magic get rich formula but it is a great way to learn some useful skills and get paid decent money to help people’s businesses. Also the profit and skills can be quickly used to start your own business. It takes a lot of work though and plenty of hours sitting at your computer – just want to be realistic from the start! ***


Backstory:
I used to work as a drilling engineer in Alberta, Canada (I am Irish) but when oil crashed I was let go pretty fast. I decided to travel in South America for a month, which I loved, but I had to go back to Canada and try find some more work. Even though I had made some good money in oil I spent it as fast as I made it and I was back to very little savings. I worked some odds jobs including moving furniture for an events company and other things. I got pretty sick of it and decided to risk it all and sell everything I owned non-essential and move back to South America. I moved just before Christmas last year and rented a small apartment in a quiet neighborhood. I slept on the ground on a mattress and basically had nothing but a desk, laptop and Wi-Fi connection. I had never successfully made money online before and I had no idea where to start. I tried Instagram marketing for a month and failure miserably. I did get some comments from Gary Vaynerchuk though which was cool. 

I ended up doing a Udemy course to build a website for a product I was working on. I actually really liked the website and I found coding kind of fun. I decided to give this a go and went to work. 

Months 2-5:
First stop was UpWork, which was brutal. I did about 3-4 months on here in total and it was pretty rough. I got some good clients but most were dicks and after some kid changed his mind for the 20th time on a $100 website I quit. I never made more than $200 and most websites took me two weeks to build (multiple changes, clients were slow, kept changing their mind). 

Months 5-6:
After that I decided to just start approaching people I knew and I did some websites for $200-500. They were mostly for small businesses that didn’t have much cash flow and could not afford to pay me much. The websites were okay but they weren’t getting great results for their owners so I didn’t feel like I could charge much. 

Months 6+:

At the time I was doing some legal work for Canada and the person I was working with had a terrible website. One day I asked her if she would want me to fix it (broken pages, terrible design) and she immediately said yes. She said she had been meaning to do it for years and badly needed it done. She said name my price. I picked the highest figure I could think of since I knew she had a very profitable business -$2,000!

It took me about 4 weeks to finish but I felt super happy about it. I spent a LOT of time on having it look great and making sure the images and copy (text) was perfect. When I gave it to her she loved it. Afterwards I asked her if she had gone with a real web design company what price would she have been happy to pay for the exact same website. Her answer… $5,000-6,000. Whoops. 

After this job I figured out a lot of what I had been doing wrong. I had been trying to get smaller companies to pay for websites that they would see very little ROI on. They would never be able to pay much because they just don’t make much. Or they do make a bit but having a good website doesn’t help them make more (good example is a gym - you just go to the nearest gym or the one someone recommends, a cool website won't help *too* much). 

I completely changed my strategy and started approaching larger companies that made a lot of money and were losing A LOT by having a terrible website. These are actually not too hard to find (if people want I can cover this is another post) and after a lot of cold calls and emails I started to get traction. I moved from $2,000 to $4,000 to $6,500 and after a few more up to $15,000. I read a lot on sales, marketing, design but I still only knew basic HTML and CSS. I would start off with a basic theme (around $30) and make a lot of changes to come up with a great design. 

Now I know people might be saying that isn’t the best coding practice  (and it is not) but I added a lot of value in other areas and everyone was super happy with their websites. They are simple static designs (these owners don’t want to edit anything again for a long time) but the results were really powerful. 

-	One business got a over 10 times increase in bookings (value 40-90k a month in future clients)
-	Directly helped an oil company close a contract for over 1 million with a great new website (portfolio, downloadable brochure)
-	Helped a pro athlete increase his sponsors and also get more recognition

These are just a few examples but I am really happy with every one so far and my clients love to rave about the websites and the success. 

Quick recap:
- I started with zero coding knowledge in January of this year. I didn't know how to host a website, I didn't know what HTML or CSS was, I made a tonne of really basic mistakes and figured it all out by myself. I didn't take any expensive courses, had no mentors and probably only spent a few hundred dollars getting set up. 

It took me a while to refine my niche but what I now focus on now is building simple yet powerful websites that get huge results. 
I usually charge between 4-15k and usually have a waiting list of 2-3 websites. 

While I made good money on these websites its nice to know that the value I added is many times more and all my clients have been very satisfied. 

I am still in the early stages of figuring this all out though so I will continue to add to this post with more lessons if people want. 


So my humble advice on how to begin:

*** I only build ""custom"" HTML websites, I don't know/use wordpress except in some rare cases for add on blog/news sections to my sites. Why? Most of my clients are very busy, non-tech people. They don't want or have time to update their websites. They want it built well and they want it to run itself. HTML is a lot better for this and when done right looks way more professional and requires less maintenance (IMO). I don't have anything against WordPress just that I prefer to use HTML and both work fine for what I am doing. ***


How to quickly begin with HTML:

Take the HTML and CSS lessons on https://www.codecademy.com/. 
You can also do the JS section but I didn't and have been just fine. 


Next take the following UDEMY course (non affiliate):
https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/


After this you will now know how to edit and work with HTML themes. What does that mean?

Well there is no point creating a website from scratch. That takes years of coding experience and a lot of time for each new clients. Luckily enough people have gone and created HTML themes - its an already coded website where you just rearrange, switch out the pictures and text and add in a few extra bits. I am making this sound simpler than it is but its still quiet simple. 

An example of a theme is here... (again non affiliate)

https://themeforest.net/item/foundry-multipurpose-html-variant-page-builder/11562108?s_rank=9

It just a blank slate with a certain style that you work with. While this may seem like strange or cheating (I thought this was how to learn to build websites!??) its not. Anyone with an Internet connection can create a website these days so that is not where I try to add value. I add value by building a website with a purpose. I aim to build websites that get results and make money, or whatever they are trying to achieve, for the owner. Its not about code, its about how it helps the owner. 

*** I hope this doesn’t piss off the obviously good coders on here, I do my best to code well but I am still learning ***


So how do you build a website that gets great results?

Good question. 

So first important thing is your clients want sales not a website. 
They don’t want a website that looks amazing, has cool videos and sections, talks about the companies recent golf tournament or how they really wanted to do X since they were 5 UNLESS it helps gets sales. Everything must be about getting a result. 

Every page, link, click and action on the website is to help facilitate the growth of the company and sales. 

Lets take for example an immigration lawyer website...

Is the goal of the site to teach you about immigration law?
Is it to show you stats of work, trade and education within the country?
Is it to teach you about what to do when you first arrive, what to pack, what to expect?

No.

The whole purpose of that website is for the user to either book a consultation or contact them regarding their services. Which both lead to that person hiring them as their immigration lawyer. 

Now it might use some of the above points to help with that goal but it only has one main purpose. Everything we do for that client must help with that goal or if it doesn't help... be removed. 



Once you sell results there is no limit to what you can charge and achieve. 


So where do a lot of people go wrong?

The types of clients you help. 

Imagine for a second the website you build will only ever generate one sale per year. Maybe only one sale ever. 



Now lets go over some businesses you could build a website for...

Client one: Jimmy & Friends Coffee Shop.
One sale is a cup of coffee or maybe if they are lucky a lunch special. One sale profit: $3-10 profit maybe.

Client Two: Jimmy & Co Travel Agency.
Maybe that one sale is a trip to Paris, or maybe even a round the world one year break. Profits on travel are slim though and the internet is really driving down those juice margins. One sale profit: $150- $1,000 profit maybe.

Client Three: Jimmy Inc. Industrial Clean Up Services.
Now this website is not on the sexy side of things. It won't exact be winning website of the year award or going viral on FB but...
One sale of a large scale clean up at that oil refinery this winter... Maybe $500,000 to $4 million. Maybe more.

Now when it comes time to sell websites you always want to aim to get your clients ten times the results that they invest in you.

So lets do the maths...

Client One: You can justify 30c - $1
Client Two: You can justify $15 - $100
Client Three: You can justify $50k to $400,000.


It’s the same amount of time dealing with the client, same amount of time coding, same amount of time hiring a pro photographer. Very different result. 

Now what you charge is your own choice. But the above example should clearly show who to build for:

- Construction
- Industrial Services
- Engineering
- Oil
- Legal
- Medical
- Other Blue Collar niches

The first four are my favorite. Unsexy, boring, aggressive clients (people are scared to call them which I like!), potnetial large contracts.


""Hey but what about tech start ups and that new app, they are making a zillion dollars. Lets go build for them!!!""

No way and here is why...

- They are in the design and internet business, they know guys already or have minimum wage slaves to work round the clock on design and websites
- There is no shortage of guys trying to approach the ""cool"" companies for web design
- You will always be replaceable and undercut by others
- They won't see your value

Your aim is to become a problem solver for large, boring, industrial companies that know nothing about the internet and want to deal with a ""regular guy"" to fix that website.



*** Disclaimer ***

While $15k+ a month (sales) might sound like a lot it’s not really. It’s enough. Enough to invest in my real businesses and cover my basic living costs. Not every month is clean profit. I reinvest a lot of money into education, design and growing. Things go wrong and learning from scratch is hard work. Some jobs run overtime, some things I have to do twice, or three times or more. 

I am not sipping cocktails on some beach while I go code once or twice a week on a hammock. 
I have since got a bed but I still live quite humble. I code 8 - 10 hours a day and also spend half the morning at Uni trying to learn Spanish. 

This is a crash course on entrepreneurship while you earn money. You have to learn to sell, cold call, manage, outsource, and so on. Everyday. 
Coding websites is time intensive by nature. 

If you are looking for easy money this probably isn't it. If you are looking to learn about business really fast though while funding and learning how to grow your own business this is excellent. Just want to add that in before someone thinks this is some overnight hack plan.

Next year I am going to focus on scaling more and bringing on some part time staff. At the moment I have some copywriters and use some people off UpWork and Fiverr. There is a lot more I could talk about but this post is huge. I have posted some of this info on another forum before but I wanted to added it here since I have got a lot of value from a few posts on this sub reddit before.

I will answer whatever questions you might have. I also have a little FB group where we help each other out... https://www.facebook.com/groups/makemoneywithwebdesign/  (no business or spamming please - its just to help each other)

Thanks for reading, hopefully not too many typos. 


1st Edit:

Thanks for all the positive comments and feedback. I will try get to everyone soon.

I got through maybe half those comments and I will hit up more later after work. Sales seems to be a common theme so Ill expand on that too.

Hope this advice helps. I won't be ""proving"" anything but hopefully my advice shows I know what I am talking about. I definitely am not a great coder but the work I do has added a lot of value and revenue to my clients so I feel great about what I have done. This and other forums (fastlane forum) have helped me a lot over the years so its great to give back. I actually had some doubts about posting here since its a big wilder than other threads but I like the pressure and it helps me step up my game. 
Ill be back later tonight to post more. Thanks.


2nd and final part: Sales

Side intro note: This was a simple AMA, I am not out to prove or convince anyone. If you think 10K a month is some huge figure you will approach it as such. It is not, its 2 big sales, or 1 small sale. There are a billion terrible websites. Learn to sell (from real resources not a quick reddit thread) and you can get in on this action. I know guys doing 40-50K a month with this stuff as a small team, and I know people doing 100-200k a month in ecommerce. 10k is small. When I started it seemed huge but its better to try focus on how little sales really make up that figure. I won't be responding to any more 20 point lists. I don't care and particular posters failures or bitterness doesn't change my reality. Anyway its only like 5 people but they keep posting - use that energy and pick up a phone!

How to find jobs when you are first starting: Google

As for finding companies that could need a new website its very easy. In fact its probably one of the easiest services to find potential customers for.

Job formula: Google... ""niche industry"" + ""local town"" and go through the first few pages of results. Anything that looks below par is suitable. I try go for companies that are clearly doing well but haven't updated the website in 3-6 years. You can usually tell by the date in the footer.

For example I google ""Carpet search Calgary"", Within the first few searches this site came up...

http://envirosurfaceremovers.com/

Probably a 4k job. Nice thing is he is ranked high on Google but has a poorly converting site. I don't have to focus on SEO or convincing him people will visit since its already on the first page. All he needs now is good copy, images and a clear path of desired action for customers to take. I would probably start the phone call off with that.

You could do that all day and not run out of companies that need a better website.

I go for certain niches - guys that probably don't like to deal with web companies. A lot of the companies outside of bug cities are run by red blooded, blue collar guys. The last thing they want is some ""nerd"" ( I am a secret nerd) they have to deal with. I run a no-bullshit web design company and know the way these people like to do deals and communicate. I don't talk about ""migrating hosting"" I just simply say the website has to be moved etc. I have 3 years experience on the oil rigs and grew up in a construction family so I know how to get on well with these guys. I think thats one main area that sets me apart. 

I hear a lot of ""our current web guy is impossible to deal with, he is really weird / annoying /lazy / arrogant "". Its not a tough game to be better than the rest and Im only getting started. You can see by some posters on any coding/business forum that their attitude is not helping - be ""cool"", friends, helpful and useful. If you are stuck on this read How to Win Friends and Influence People. It works. 

Now let me show you how this works in realtime (don't all call this person at once ha)...
Today (like right now) this guy is using Adwords for ""Immigration Lawyer Canada"" ...
http://www.somjen.com/
Thats an expensive search. Go check out that site. Easy sale. Already spending money, you just need to redirect it.

Web design is the easiest business in the world to find new sales - you have a full list of them anytime you search anything. 

I have already covered what to say when they pick up in the comments below. If you can't sell to people with sites this bad then please go work on that, its key to making bigger money.  

Once you do a few websites, and get great results, it is even easier to sell. Slowly move up to larger and larger businesses. As you move up you will need to improve on some things like invoices, email communication, information request forms etc but you can learn it all as it goes. 

Ways to even boost more sales...
- Sales guys on commission (covered below)
- 10% referral or free work for businesses that promote you
- Working the network - Lets say you do a website for X Service in New York, then when its done call every other X Service in nearby cities. Show them your results OR call every other different business that is geographically close to X service. Work the connections
- Believe in what you do. I love helping people and I love my websites. If you treat this as some money scheme or scam people will be able to tell and you get sales. If you look at this thread its like 90% upvoted because I gave a lot of value upfront and people responded, its the same with companies. Not everyone will respond (just like this thread ha) but you only need 2/3 a month. 

***********************
AIM BIG
***********************

I did just as much work for $150 a month as I did for $15,000. Well maybe a little more work now but not much. Sales for a HUGE site and a small one takes the same amount of time, so does emails, so do calls, so does hosting, so does invoicing, so does 100 other things. The only bid difference is design and code but that is only 30% of a job. 

My point is it is easier to aim big. Aiming big pushes you harder and gives you the reward to keep going. Aiming small sucks and everyday is a drag. I have been there. So instead of dialing the small cafe dial Jimmys Tow Truck company, believe in what you can do and what you can achieve. 

Well that is it. This wasn't a ""here are the super secrets to $$$"", it was an AMA. These are my best answers and I hope you enjoyed them. I am still learning and still growing. I mess up all the time still but I keep the show on the road. If you think I am definitely wrong about X - maybe I am, but enough of this works to hold it all together. I got a lot of great responses and I am very grateful. If I was starting again I would have loved to see something like this and it probably would have saved months of time. Scarysaturday if you ever come to South America Ill buy you a beer to cheer you up. 

Thanks everyone.

Today's interview is with Cory Stout of [Woodies](https://www.woodies.com), a brand that sells wood sunglasses.

*Cory is a very active redditor - /u/sigmaschmooz - and he'll be in the comments to answer your questions*

**Some stats:**

* Product: Wood sunglasses.
* Revenue/mo: $250,000
* Started: August 2012
* Location: Venice, CA
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 1

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

I’m Cory Stout, Captain of [Woodies](https://www.woodies.com/).  I started a wood sunglasses brand when I was 28 years old.

Our main product is walnut wood sunglasses that I sell for $25 on Amazon and Woodies.com  I hired one employee (my dear mother) and she’s won Employee of the Year for 3 years in a row ;)

In 2018, I topped 3.5 million in revenue and somehow ended the year with less money than when I started!  I bought a Bentley to celebrate…



### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I studied Economics at the University of Florida but the real education was scalping football tickets outside of the stadium. I really learned my lessons on those streets...

I mean sure he needs to make money but perhaps hire local designers or part assemble locally or something.

In fact I'm willing to bet we will see a HUGE surge in made in the USA or hand made locally type requests within ten years.  ,2019-02-18 17:15:05
924,4ukvcf,False,,135,7 common mistakes seen when reviewing 20+ redditors websites (x-post smallbusiness),Entrepreneur,"Cross-posted from /r/smallbusiness 

One of the top questions I get from small business owners is: ""Why isn't my website making sales?""

Recently I [offered to review a whole bunch of /r/smallbusiness websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/4oepz6/free_professional_website_reviews_here_in_thread/) for free in order to get some business intelligence, and to generate some reciprocation so I could get some surveys completed (if you haven't done it, it's a real pain to try to get survey completes).

In total, twenty-two websites were put forward for review during the 2 days the offer was open. Twenty included an answer to the simple question I asked (and I reviewed one that hadn't by accident). So this is not a massive study, and it certainly won't meet academic statistical rigour, but you should find the results interesting and helpful if you're a website owner.

I found 7 critical website mistakes:

**No. 1: Does The Site Have a Compelling Email Opt-in?**

While all of the sites reviewed had an email opt-in somewhere, not one of them had a compelling incentive to have visitors opt-in. 

In general, email newsletters are not a good opt-in incentive, that's just not compelling enough:
> ""Sign up for our newsletter"" is code for ""We know you get loads of email, but if you subscribe here we'll fill your inbox with even more email you don't want to read"".

You could test using a discount coupon – but save your profit margin, you can do better than that!

Recommendations

* Offer the visitor something that solves a problem they have, ideally directly related to your business. ""Free Guide to XYZ"": guides, checklists and cheat-sheets are great.
* They must actually provide genuine value, but they don't have to be very long – in fact it's better if they're quick to consume.
* Then start offering them valuable advice and building your credibility with them through their inbox via your autoresponder sequence

**No. 2: Does The Site Have a Clear, Obvious Purpose and Visitor Benefits?**

The first thing visitors look for is something to let them know they're in the right place. Usually this a clear statement of purpose, or visitor benefits.

    ""What's In It For Me?""

Of the review group, 30% made the website purpose very obvious and clear via a tagline or headline what the site was about. 25% less so, and a whole 45% of the sites didn't make it clear at all.

Recommendations

* Have a tagline or headline front and center so that visitors know what they're looking at.
* Read ""Don't Make Me Think"" by Steve Krug to get a better understanding of what website visitors are looking for.

**No. 3: Does The Site Have a Strong, Clear Call-to-Action?**

After a clear purpose, the next thing to look for is the Call-to-Action. What action should I take? What does the site owner want people to do? Around 1/3rd of the sites did this well, with a strong, clear call to action (CTA), e.g. Book Now, Add to Cart, Contact Us, that stood out from the page content and told me what to do next. 25% had a weak call to action and 40% had none at all.

Recommendation

* ensure every page on your site has at least one clear, strong call to action that stands out visually from the rest of the page content.

**No. 4: Does The Site Have a Quality ""About"" Page?**

The About Page is the 2nd most visited page on a website – after the homepage – and crucial in building trust with a potential customer.

Only 10% of the sites reviewed had a good About page that included photos of the business owners/staff, names and a bit of background. The rest had far less, usually just a block of generic text that could be copied and pasted onto a competitor's site.

You're asking people to trust you with their hard earned cash, so you have to include more information than that.

Recommendations

* Include details of why you want to serve your particular customers and what you do for them
* Include the business owner and staff photos
* Include your street address and photos of the business location if possible

**No. 5: Does The Site Load Quickly?**

The slowest sites were WordPress based, probably due to lack of caching, the fastest were Shopify and one of the custom builds.

Recommendations

* If you use WordPress, enable caching.
* Reduce your image sizes
* Move to a better hosting company.

**No. 6: Does The Site Have Good Design Aesthetic?**

It's somewhat subjective, but most visitors recognise a professional design when they see it, even if they can't articulate the details. And it's a big factor in generating online sales. Visitors will spend money on a site they trust, and design aesthetic is crucial in building that trust.

There was a mixed-bag in the review group when it came to design aesthetic: almost a 3-way tie between good, average and poor designs.

Recommendation

* If you can, get a professional designer to tweak your site design.
* Reduce the number of fonts, colours and textures.

**No. 7: Does The Site Have a Responsive Design?**

In this study, thankfully the vast majority of sites were responsive. If you're one of the few who doesn't have a responsive website, you need to get to work on updating your website, or say goodbye to 50%+ of your traffic.

Recommendation

* If your site is not responsive, it's past time for an upgrade. Start looking for a responsive theme or talk to a web design company.

--

**The sites**

Here's some background information on the type of sites by type:

* Product or service: There was an almost even split of product to service business
* Customer type: also equally split between business-to-consumer (B2B) and business-to-business (B2C).
* The website platform or content management system (CMS) breakdown was 67% on self-hosted WordPress (.org), 14% Shopify, 14% custom CMS, and 5% Wix.
* Domain TLD: 75% were on .com domains, the rest were .com.au, .co.uk and .io.

613,82qupr,False,,111,"This Exact Process Got 1.4 M Views and 1,200 Email Leads in 48 Hours! (And Got Us Contacted By SharkTank!)",Entrepreneur,"Hey All! 


I’ve been asked about this several times - so I decided to create a short guide to share how my team and I got one of our clients 1.4 M views and generated over 1,200 email leads in 48 hours ---> And picked up by SharkTank!


This will probably be super useful to many of you - but realistically I cannot cover every technique in total detail (way tooooo long for a post!), so please ASK QUESTIONS FOR DETAIL ON ANY PROCESS. 


First off - I lied.


We did generate a ton of traffic and leads in 48 hours, but all of that was the result of a 3-4 month PR campaign. This means a lot of testing and modifying of our strategy to get the killer results and high ROI for our outreach.

---

Some background ---> 

We have a client that sells a simple, yet unique and useful product - an electric jacket warmer that can be installed on any coat to keep you toasty on those cold winter nights. 

Like most people with a product-based business, they want to sell more product. Part of his challenge was that his company was fairly new and his product was fairly unique (so not a lot of search activity). He wanted to build awareness around his brand and product, get some SEO backlinks to his site, and ultimately - sell more product.

---

The Challenge --->

Part of the problem with product-based PR is that a pitch like “Hey, I have a really cool product, will you please write about it?” straight-up sucks. 

Unless you have a pocket-rocket that will fly you to Mars and back - most of the time journalists will ignore your pitch. 

A pitch needs to have more than a product-summary to be successful and this can be really hard to figure out at times. However, using creativity and data - it is possible!

---

The Strategy ---> 

With his goals in mind - Exposure, Backlinks, Sell More - we began to lay out a strategy that would help him get there. We settled on two approaches:

1) Hard Pitches to the Press

2) Guest Posting

This is nothing new to PR - but I think the results of the campaign speak to the power of these strategies.

I’ll give some detail on both of these strategies, but first some numbers from our outreach to put this all in context.

In 4 Months:

-198 Pitches Sent

-110 Opened 

-38 Replies

-9 Successful Media Placements

This can give you some idea about how much work goes into pitching - you can send a lot of pitches and you will only get so much. Yes - it’s a numbers game, but you also need to have a solid strategy behind it to get anything.

Let’s look at the strategies in more detail…

---

Hard Pitches To Press --->

Pitching writers isn’t easy. Most good writers at decent publications get 30-50 pitches a day and don’t even read them all.

This means two things in order to get a response:

1) You have to have a great subject line.

2) You have to have a solid pitch that follows it.
 
This is an article I wrote on B2C that some may find useful: https://www.business2community.com/public-relations/create-pr-story-grabs-attention-01870169

In general - I think the best pitches are short (100-150 words Max!), straight to the point, personal (ie. human talking to human, not a PR machine blasting the whole world), and contain something that is relatable, interesting, or useful (data, research, etc.) to the writer.

The worst pitches are a copy and pasted press release that sounds like a fax machine wrote it.

There are two basic elements to pitching press:

1) Creating pitch angles

2) Creating target lists

Let your pitch angle guide your target list. You want to qualify the people you are pitching by sending them something relevant to their interests. 

Don’t be married to just one pitch angle - if you are not getting replies - then you need to change that angle!

---

Guest Posting ---> 

This is another solid strategy that gives you a little more opportunity to guide the content since you are creating it.

However, to be successful with this - you should always lead with value. People want great content, so don’t be a spammy backlink, re-hashed content kind-of-person. Editors and readers will love you if you create content that is actually useful.

I could talk for days about guest posting - but for the sake of brevity...

I wrote a super extensive guide on how to guest post here: https://powerfuloutreach.com/guest-post-anywhere-every-time/

Everything you need to know on how to do it successfully is there.

---

The Process ---> 

To be honest, the first month of our outreach sucked :(
Our pitch was very product-centric and we got very little response.

However, there is always learning in failure!

We started to tweak our pitch to focus more on the unique offering of his product and how it fit in to different winter lifestyle niches (skiing, hiking/camping, watching hockey, etc.)

We ran through 5 pitches before we got one that really started to work. That’s when we started to hammer down features in gift guides, reviews, guest posts, etc. 

The elements that helped our pitch become successful was:

1) Willingness to adapt based on results

2) Willingness to send out sample product (great for follow ups!)

3) Willingness to take all press opportunities

4) Pitch angles that had more than “hey, here’s my product!”


---

The 48 Hour Madness --->

We didn’t really hit a huge success until we got featured on a YouTube review.

If you have doubts about what I am saying - check the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCK-h-xXk3k&feature=youtu.be

This one video got almost 1.4 million views and the client received over 1,200 emails in 48 hours. He didn’t even have the stock to support the rush!

The bottom line here is - If a company can pull off a hit like this once every 4 months, it can make a huge difference on the annual revenue.

---

SharkTank Reaches Out ---> 

Our second huge win - came as a surprise. 

One of our early articles that didn’t have a big impact at first was seen by someone from SharkTank, who then reached out to our client to set up a call.

I admit - hard to replicate this, but goes to show that when you have press mentions out there - you can never be sure who will see it.

---

The Lessons To Take Away --->

Press is an insanely powerful way to get exposure and drive traffic, but it’s not easy to get the type of media mention that blows things up. 

It takes, testing, modifying, and persistence to get there.

The bottom line is - if you can get your company out there, it will start to bring insane traffic, but it takes time to get there.

Not every media mention will be a huge hit, but when one clicks the right way - it is a game changer for any company.

The ROI on a campaign like this is clear. The client spent around $1000 for 4 months of outreach. With 1,200 email leads for a $99 product - that’s $120,000 in potential revenue. Even if you cut the conversion rate to 20% ---> That’s 24x in ROI.

---

I hope this was useful to some of you! If you want detail on any process (target list building, pitch writing, guest posting, etc.) please let me know!

If there is enough demand for it - I can create a guide on some of these techniques and share some useful tools!

536,h7va0w,False,,130,I'm gonna do it- I'm going to go all in with my Knife-making company.,Entrepreneur,"I started making knives when I was in high-school and kept it up for fun through college as I got my BS in Mechanical Engineering.  Been working in manufacturing for some time and had a lot of success and learned a ton about business, but it just hit me earlier this week that the time to do it is now.  I'm a young homeowner with minimal debt, no kids,and a job I'm getting tired of.

What I do:  
Like I said, I'm a blacksmith and knife maker and I've been steadily growing for the last several years, until about 10 months ago when things just started exploding and now I'm struggling to keep up.  I specialize in rustic looking hunting/survival/camp knives but I've also done plenty of swords and historical reproductions and domestic products like wall brackets and hooks.

Finances:  
I usually make about $1500/day at special events and festivals and do another $2000/mo in custom work and online sales while spending only about 10 hrs/week in the workshop.  Doing this full time would let me go to more shows and build my brand so that I think it's feasible to make $50-60k PBIT in the first year.  My expenses have been high over the last couple years as I've invested in better equipment, but now I'm coasting at less than 10% materials cost.  

Growth:  
I recognize the potential risks of being self-employed doing work that depends on good health, so I'd like to eventually diversifying into less physically demanding services like teaching classes, renting out maker spaces, etc and hiring staff in the form of other smiths and support staff.

Timeline:  
I'm setting the tentative launch date to be February 1st 2022.  This is kind of a long way off, but I need to get my house in order and build the infrastructure needed to make an effective transition.  I also need to make absolutely sure that COVID isn't going to make a surprise return and shut down all my big shows and events.  I need to develop mailing lists, build a youtube channel, and secure more brick-and-mortar stores that want to carry my work.

&#x200B;

What else should I consider?  Has anyone else done something similar?  Hoping to get some good insight from this community.  Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/h7va0w/im_gonna_do_it_im_going_to_go_all_in_with_my/,571,"I fear you don't know your customer.  You will most likely only be successful if you have a very high profit margin where people are paying a premium for your skill. But, you are selling to spontaneous buyers at events. Also, you will likely only be successful if you can sell multiple knives to the same person and grow through referrals, again, not events. You need an online presence. It doesn't need to be fancy. Focus on social media and build a Shopify store or something similar is my advice. ",2020-06-12 23:04:00
311,65eybi,False,,287,"How I’m making $3,500+ per month selling dirt",Entrepreneur,"Yes, you read that correctly. I’m *literally* selling dirt and making a solid chunk of change. My name is Nick and I founded www.DirtByMail.com March 1st with my best friend Ryan. We anonymously send a bag of dirt to the dirtbag of your choice. The recipient receives the bag of dirt accompanied by a “You’re a dirtbag” card.


Ryan pitched the idea to me in the middle of February and I loved the idea. Ryan and I each agreed to put in a few hundred bucks to get us started. I created our website, ordered the “You’re a dirtbag” cards, set up a manufacturer in China for our bags, and talked with Ryan about how we would get the dirt, boxes, and other miscellaneous stuff. We figured out a plan, ordered the first couple hundred units, and decided to do a soft launch through my University. I sent some out to random people and watched as they opened up the packages, put it on social media, and laughed at the hilarious experience.

With that small success, we agreed the best way to officially launch the website would be through an Instagram Influencer, or someone who has a few hundred thousand/million followers. For a few hundred dollars, we got our ad in front of hundreds of thousands of people. We made sure to work with an Instagram account that posts funny memes since our audience is people who have a sense of humor. The ad was a success and we got a great return on that investment.

We continued to put up other ads with other accounts and have some great successes and great failures. The problems occur when you work with Instagram accounts that have bought millions of followers. You quickly learn that if an account with 10 million followers is offering you an ad for $40, it’s too good to be true.

In 45 days, we have taken in just over $7,500. After covering our costs for shipping and cogs, a good amount was profit but we're reinvesting everything right back into Instagram ads. An example of an Instagram post: An account with 2 million followers cost about $400 which caused about 4,000 unique visits to the site which turned into about $800 worth of sales. We usually get a 2x return on our investment with these ads.

Ryan and I are continuing to advertise with legit Instagram accounts and are having continued success. We are growing at a steady pace and have had over 1,000 happy customers in just under 45 days. We are really enjoying the whole process of working with our customers, fulfilling all the orders, and running a dirt company.

We would love to hear what you think of DirtByMail! We especially would love any fun/different ideas how we can market it. Thanks :)

604,bag663,False,,82,37yo- 17 years in business- Some more of what I've learned,Entrepreneur,"I made a couple of posts a while back and they got me thinking.

Ive become quite introspective recently, probably because Im going through a lot in life including a major home renovation while trying to bring up 2 young kids, a couple of changes in my business/career and running another business which sells online in another country.

As I mentioned briefly in those other posts, I’ve learned mostly from direct experience and practise but also from observing those others I have worked with and for. I learned a little from books but I advise mostly against it now if Im being honest.

Don’t get me wrong, books are invaluable and learning from the past experiences of others is the only way to truly learn about and navigate our way through life and business without taking too long about it. But that said- not one of the people I know reads business books- I know these guys very well and know it for certain (helped by the fact that a couple of them CANT read!)

Todays little post then is just to provide some advice that relate to a common theme I’ve seen on here and others more so than usual recently.

**Instead of asking ‘Which Business(es) Should I start’….. ask yourself ‘What Strengths and Skills do I want to build and use for the rest of my life?’**

Well let me start by saying that while wanting to start a business is both a noble and worthy aim- I think you’re better off trying to figure what skill set you would like to develop AND THEN go and start the business.

There is no one particular industry that you will fare better in over an other when you boil it down. My own successes and that of the people in my social and proffesional circles are quite varied and have changed over the course of our lives so you can probably really just choose any other than something that is obviously in its sunset years.

I try to avoid using specific examples of high achievers but when you look at successful people across all the spectrums from 100k a year mortgage free guy through to billionaire, many of them have had their fingers in several pies over the years and have often had success in a couple or more different industries.

What they mostly have done is developed a particular skill set- they figured out at some stage (not always early on either) what they could make money from. They didn’t always enjoy it and they weren’t always that good at it (trust me- several of the most successful people I know are not the best at what they do by a long way but they nearly always have a good work ethic and they don’t mind asking for the higher price- Im going to cover these and a few other mental models in another post)

\- One of them is a marketer and has made millions from selling waste removal services- he’s never driven a truck or emptied a dumpster by hand but he knows how to find people that need it doing and get someone there to do it for them. He learned his trade as an employee for a bank. He wasnt a marketer at the time but he became one and got good at it. He often says all successful banks do is market themselves better than the rest at their ideal customer.

\- One of them is a salesman- he can’t market for toffee but he will gladly turn up at peoples stores and restaurants without an invite and get them to buy the ice cream he sells. He then turns up a month later and gets them to buy some more.

He drives the freezer van himself and loads the customers freezer by hand. He’s now in his fifties and became a millionaire from it in his early forties. He used the difference between his credit line from his suppliers and his cash on delivery terms with this customers to buy properties in the mid to late 2000’s. He sold some of them at the peak and used the funds to pay some of the others off. He still rents the rest out to this day. He learned his trade from a national wholesale company and left to buy his own first van in his twenties.

\- One of them is an accountant, a bean counter. He’s bought and sold several businesses- his recent venture was a haulage firm, he’s in his seventies and this is likely his last one. He bought a large share of it with no money of his own down for around a couple of million. He sold off the trucks and leased them back.

He used the cash to buy a rival in the lower half of the country and did the same with that one. He then stopped supplying services to the bad payers/ too much hassle accounts and used the spare capacity to do more work for the better ones- He sold his share to a bigger rival a not quite 3 years later and made 2 million profit for himself. He doubled the wealth of the remaining partner in 3 years!

His first 20 years of work was schlepping up the ranks of a mid sized accountancy firm.

\- One of them is a programmer- He used to write/ edit automation software for manufacturing/ oil and gas companies and charged as much as he could on each job. He saved hard and put the money into shares and houses. He became a millionaire in his forties and then sold the company. He now works a few hours here and there and charges 1k a day when he does. He now plays a lot of golf but again spent his first 10 to 15 years working for an employer- skilling up & refining his programming skills.

\- One of them is a logistics guy that specialises in chemical storing and transport. He started out at the floor level of a chemical company and left about 5 years later to work for one of their customers. Just before he was about to leave he had the idea to suggest to the owner of the company he was going to that he would remortgage his house and put up half the capital to start a small offshoot company providing the service to his new employer but as half owner.

The owner agreed and they started the company- basically storing chemicals for theirs and other companies. He also became a millionaire in his late thirties/ early forties. The previous owner and he have started several other ‘offshoots’.

He’s uneducated and relies heavily on accountants etc- he’s a logistics guy though and knows it inside out.

One of them is an engineer- He’s dyslexic and doesn’t use email/ smart phone etc. He’s just retired after doing his last job on site. Its my pleasure that I was on that job with him and it is to him who I owe a good chunk of gratitude for my own success. Its his business that created the opportunity for me to create mine.

He worked hard and charged for it for 4 decades- he’s now hanging up his tools and is living from his stocks, pensions and property income- he is a low singles millionaire. He lives in a small but nice house in a nice area and spends most of the year on holiday with his wife. He’s a very happy guy.

His first 15 years were working for others in the mines and steel mills. He started out on his own when one of the big recessions hit (80’s I think) and he was let go. He approached his own mill to work here and there as contractor and did the same with others in the region. He built a steady customer base and served them and others around the country for the next 40 years.

I could go on to write about 30 or more people I know either personally or proffessionally (a lot more through business etc) but it would more or less be the same for all of them- they have a strength and use it.

The only difference between them and the rest of the people I know is:

1. They know and use their strengths wisely- all of them do this consciously I think.
2. They own the business they work for and hence get to keep the profit margin.
3. They are ‘good workers’. ie They do long days and put work first. They dont hide or shy away from the dog work, they just get it done and out of the way every time.

When I see people say things like ‘should I start an amazon/ drop ship/ other ecommerce store’, or should I do pressure washing, should I open a store/ coffee van etc etc etc- My first thought is ‘What about that do you want to do?’

If you are thinking of starting something online, I seriously think you could do well with just about any product you cared hard enough about to learn about- but the main point is what skills will you apply to you online business.

What you should be thinking about is: What are you personally going to apply to the problem as your own particular advantage. Are you going to be an excellent marketer/ logistics guy/ accountant/ purchaser/ salesman/ engineer etc.

You can only do so much yourself so what are you going to do and what are you going to farm out?

**Proof:**  
Ad Account 1: imgur.com/a/jQLCcer  
Ad Account 2: imgur.com/a/KMG14xT

Side Note: That may seem like a huge dollar figure to some, but others that's a daily/monthly budget. That said, I'm not bragging or presenting that figure as being HUGE. In fact, last year, I sat next to a guy in Dallas TX who spends $50,000 - $100,000 PER DAY! The rest of those sitting at that same dinner table was spending similar amounts. Okay, onto the lessons!

👨‍🏫 LESSON 1: A Compelling Offer - This may sound obvious, but you'll be surprised at how many people (including myself) push an offer that the market doesn't want or need. I don't care how seasoned you are at marketing, at the end of the day you can't polish a turd. In other words, if the offer sucks, it's not going to sell! I've even had zero response to offers I gave away for free!

Before you give up on your offer though, make sure that you've done a thorough job at testing (I cover more on testing in Lesson 3 below.) The main thing is to look at how you package your product/service. People must view your offer as having more value than the money their trading for it.

To boost the perceived value you may need to test different price points, and/or add extra bonuses offers that complement the offer. In some cases, it may even mean raising the price because people may decide ""it's too good to be true"" and conclude it's a scam. Believe me, when I say, people hand that word out like it's candy. Either way, make sure your offer is a no-brainer decision for the audience your targeting.

Another big mistake is creating an offer that is too broad for any specific audience to target. It's a lot more difficult (and expensive) to sell a generic product or service to a broad audience. Instead, get more strategic by creating your offer around a specific niche.

For example: If you sell a workout program it's smart to frame it around mothers who want to lose weight by doing yoga. In Facebook™, you can target moms who also like yoga.

Another niche could be future brides who want to lose 10lbs before their wedding. You could target engaged women who like 'Weight Watchers' or other weight-loss programs that they most likely failed at.

If you offer a sales guide, you can get more niche by framing it around Realtors.

Before creating an offer and kicking off a Facebook™ ad campaign, I'd recommend testing to see if sells or not to your existing email list. If it doesn't sell to people who know, like and trust you then you can bet it won't with ice-cold traffic!

The Bottom Line: If your offer is proven to sell and targets a specific niche audience, the bigger your chances for Facebook™ advertising success.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 2: Stick To Copy Principles - It's easy to overload your brain with ""new and improved"" strategies that sell. Truth is, not much has changed since the mid-1900's on Madison Avenue when advertisers were sipping on an Old Fashioned and writing copy. The only difference is the platforms we have to sell on.

For example, Photography has the same core lighting/posing principles whether you shoot with film or digital. Again, the difference is the tools we have available.

The most effective copy strategies that get people to take action the most is fear. Not saying you should scare the hell out of your audience, but instead teach them.

I just paid a guy $150 to do a radon test for a house inspection. I asked him to sell me on why I should do it...his answer? ""Because of high levels of radon cause lung cancer."" SOLD!

Another way is through urgency and scarcity. That's why I ALWAYS include a deadline to register for a webinar or to take advantage of a deal. Humans procrastinate, and until you give them a reason to pull out their credit card right now they'll have already moved onto something different.

Whenever I feel like I'm trembling away from copy principles, I'll flip on QVC or HSN and watch how they sell. These shows have been selling products the same way for many decades and haven't changed since. It just works!

Another bonus tip is that controversy sells and works well with social media. Dan Kennedy said it best, ""If you haven't offended somebody by noon every day, then you're not marketing hard enough."" I apply this in most of my Facebook™ ad campaigns and frame it as ""us against them"".

For example, if you sell design work you could talk about how they should fire their designers. Believe me, the designers will show up in your ads ready to throw rocks. ""Okay Brandon, I don't want rocks thrown at me!"" - It's a good thing because no publicity is bad publicity. And also, because now it becomes a movement for your buyers to prove to their now-enemies that they stand for what they believe. I mean...how do you think Trump won?

The Bottom Line: Stop falling for the shiny new techniques for selling, and focus solely on the principles of selling that have worked for many decades and more to come! I could write for days on various copy tricks (like how emojis grab attention). More importantly, before flipping on an ad I recommend learning how the consumer thinks with these two books that are packed-full of copywriting principles: 'Cashvertising' by Drew Eric Whitman and 'Expert Secrets' by Russell Brunson.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 3: Always Be Testing - Failing is an important part of success no matter what you do in life, and it's no different when it comes to Facebook™ advertising.

I CONSTANTLY fail a ton and often times it leaves me scratching my head and wondering if I'm even cut out to be a marketer in the first place 😂 But...I never give up, and no matter how months pass by I keep pushing forward. To put that in perspective, I've spent almost a year on one campaign that's just now starting to convert. That's worse case scenario but enough tweaking and you can truly turn ideas into long-term businesses. That's why I'm willing to spend that much time; because I know it can result in yearly salaries once it's dialed in.

I'm going to break down what's necessary to test, based on my personal experience...

Ad Creatives: The image of the ad is what grabs the attention most, and that's why I recommend a thick red border with a baby crying hysterically...just kidding! It's not necessary to be obnoxiously loud. What's more important is to is an ad that resonates with your audience.

My personal experience has been keeping the ad creatives real and relevant. Ad creatives that work well are collages, amateur-looking (NOT stock photos), testimonials, hyper-speed videos. Turn images b&w and they may perform better too.

Ad creatives constantly burn out, and do so weekly! NEVER be afraid to add new ones. I've made the mistake of getting emotionally attached to an ad image because it WAS performing but fizzled out. I kept trying different audiences and copy and wasted so much money. Now I'm constantly testing new images/videos and always finding new winners. Pretty exciting stuff and a big hurdle I had to overcome.

The Landing Page: This goes hand to hand with the ad itself. When someone clicks on your ad, they want to feel confident that the landing page matches what the ad states. Otherwise, it's called 'bait and switch' when they land on your page. If you invited them to a webinar in your ad, it must take them to a webinar registration page. If you offer a product in your ad, it must take them to a sales page for that specific offer. If there's any disconnection (words, imagery...etc.) then this is going to put a huge dent in your conversion rate.

I've read many split-testing books and here's what I've personally found to be the most effective on sales pages:

a.) The Headline: The headline sets the tone for the entire page. When someone reads the headline they should know exactly know what pain points they have, what your offering, and how your offer will benefit them. You'd be surprised at how many sales pages I've seen that I've reached the bottom of the page and still have no idea what they're offering. So be clear about that!

b.) The Price Point: Once I have the headline dialed in, I focus on the price. When I'm sending traffic to an offer I like to keep it under $50 so I try to make sure the value exceeds that cost.  
I'll split test prices at: $47, $37, $27, and $17. If it doesn't sell at those price points I'll even go down as low as $7.

A recent campaign I did just this, and as soon as I did that it started to sell. I'm averaging $9.38 CPA's (cost per action) which means I'm only losing $2.38 per sale which can easily be made up on the backend. I call that a success!

Side note: I put a lot of hours into thinking, creating, and marketing this product, but I don't allow emotion to get involved when it comes to reducing the price of my product. I'd rather have a product that sells 10x as much at $7 than not sell at all at $17. All I care is about being profitable so I can scale to the moon.

Also when it comes to pricing, don't give them too many options to choose from. Too many choices result in no choice at all.

If you're driving an immense amount of traffic then I recommend testing other things, like moving different sections around, button text, button color but personally I haven't seen much of an effect by testing this.

The Bottom Line: Test ad creatives, headlines, and price points.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 4: Avoid Overlapping - This is more on the tech side of ads, but when advertising you should have an ad that shows to a cold audience ONCE. Then set up a separate ad that retargets those who clicked but didn't' buy.

If you neglect this, you run the risk of what's called: Overlapping. This will depend on your audience size, and your daily budget. However, when overlapping occurs you're essentially showing the same ads to the same audience which may cause ad spend to hike because you're competing with yourself. It could also prevent your ads from spending at all.

The Bottom line: Avoid overlapping by excluding people who've visited your landing page and people who purchased from your cold traffic.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 5: Follow Up (Advertising Is Just The Beginning) - Some advertisers collect leads by giving away freebies like eBooks, cheat sheets...etc. Instead, I choose to send traffic directly to an offer (under $50) or send them to a webinar registration page. The reason is it sets the tone that indeed I have an offer and that I am NOT a charity for freebie-seekers.

Once you have a buyer, they're more inclined to buy more. Whether you're profitable, break-even, or in the red with your Facebook™ ad campaign you can scale even more by up-selling, or cross-selling through email marketing.

I try to email my buyers every day and it's proven to be profitable. I've also created businesses within my business by partnering with people and selling their product, as well as adding a phone salesman to sell higher priced offers.

The Bottom line: View Facebook™ advertising as only the beginning, because the money is in the back-end of your business.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 6: Have An End Date - Most advertisers (including me) want to flip an ad on and just let it keep going. That used to work in the earlier days but now it's about scheduling an end date on your ad set because of 2 reasons...

1.) It forces Facebook's™ algo to optimize faster and find similar people that resonate with your ad.

2.) It adds urgency which gets people to take action!

I'll notice with my campaigns 33% of sales will come in the last day during a week long campaign.

The Bottom Line: Facebook™ algo optimizes more effectively when you schedule an end date at the ad set level. Also people take action when there's an end date.

👨‍🏫 LESSON 7: Mix In Other Ad Platforms - A lot of my Facebook™ advertising success comes from integrating other ad platforms. My 2 favorites are YouTube, and Perfect Audience and use both for retargeting purposes.

When someone lands on my sales page and leaves without taking action I'll stock them as they surf the web.

Creepy? Absolutely. Profitable? Yes, here's a Y.T.D. screenshot of a YouTube campaign I'm currently running: imgur.com/a/lzQbehd

When someone visits YouTube after they leave my sales page without buying, a video ad of me teaching/pitching will play before their video (they can skip it of course!)

Perfect Audience allows me to put banner ads on websites they visit after they leave without buying.

Bottom Line: Retarget your Facebook traffic using other ad platforms.

👨‍🏫 BONUS LESSON 8: Get Your Rewards! - If you find yourself spending big on Facebook™, get a business credit card of some sort that will offer cashback or travel rewards.

That was a mistake I made all throughout 2017. Now I have the U.S. Bank Edge Select card attached to my ads account which earns me 3 points per $1 spent on Facebook™ advertising. I set it and forget it, and then by the time I remember I have around $2k - $3k in cash rewards that pay for one hell of a vacation :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/91hq5m/7_lessons_ive_learned_from_spending_15201053_of/,544,">I just paid a guy $150 to do a radon test for a house inspection. I asked him to sell me on why I should do it...his answer? ""Because of high levels of radon cause lung cancer."" SOLD!

222,4x3fwx,False,,108,Pro tip... online sites like Legal Zoom are a ripoff for things like simple LLC formation/EIN applications in the US. You can generally do it yourself on your state's business portal in a few minutes and save several hundred dollars.,Entrepreneur,"I hear lots of entrepreneurs/independent workers suggest sites like Legal Zoom or NOLO for things like LLC formation. I can't speak for all of them...but in my experience these are complete ripoffs for basic business formation in most cases, unless you're doing something particularly complicated.  You'll end up paying $300-$700+ dollars for something you could have done fairly easily for free + your state filing fee. 

Rather than paying LegalZoom $150 to register your business...nearly every state has a free online registration portal that walks you through the exact same step by step process, and usually takes less than 15 minutes. 

Then you avoid all of the other BS upcharges legalzoom/NOLO try to tack on.

 For example...on top of the base service rate, LZ tries to charge you $80 for ""EIN number obtainment""...which is something that takes ~2 minutes to obtain for free through the IRS site. 

They try to charge you $150 per year to serve as a registered agent.  However, you can put anybody in your filing state as a registered agent...including yourself. If you're registering something like an out of state Delaware LLC, there are usually lawyers that will do your whole registration for $50, and serve as your in-state registered agent for $25-$50/year. 
**edit: note on this....the registered agent's address gets published publicly. They're also technically expected to be at the listed address during business hours to receive official correspondence if you get sued or something. So it may be best to choose an actual office location (have any lawyer friends?) rather than your own address. But even if you pay a 3rd party agent it should be a lot cheaper than $150.**

They'll try to charge you $100 for a ""business license compliance report"". Which basically just tells you what business licenses you'll need. However, this can also be discovered for free with a very quick Googling ""*my state* business license requirements""...or a usually painless call to your state revenue department. 

$60-$120/year for ""Compliance Reminder Service"". i.e...emailing you once or twice a year when your filing forms are due. Just set a calendar notice and you're set. 

Then all of the other crap like $200 for ""expedited service"" or it will take 30 days. BS...it takes 20 mins start to finish.

If you need actual legal consulting advice, I suggest looking into something like AVVO. Many of their lawyers are listed with fixed fees for basic services like business registration consulting. Often cheaper than what the generic legal sites offer...and you're dealing with a real person.

2. Uninstall and remove all unnecessary plugins and apps - Often times, once a plugin is installed, it's never removed even if it no longer serves a useful function. Take your time and make sure to use only what you really need.
3. Use a content delivery network (CDN) - A content delivery network caches your images on its globally distributed network of servers. If a customer from the middle east visits your website that is hosted in the US, your website will load fast.

826,997kpi,False,,72,"""Window Cleaning Guy"" with an August update on my ""Race to $400,000""",Entrepreneur,"Hi guys.  It's been a while since I've given an update (lazy).  

&#x200B;

Quick back story for those that dont know.  The last week of Jan 2017 I found out that my corporate job of 10 yers was being eliminated.   On a whim I decided to start a window cleaning business to pay the bills until I figured out what I wanted to do.  My son (17 at the time) wanted to start the business with me so we went in as partners.  Around August of 2017 we added pressure washing to our business.  We closed out right at 140k in revenue in 2017.

&#x200B;

This years goal is $400,000 in revenue.  We are currently setting at $222,812 of completed or scheduled work which puts us 16k behind pace to achieve our 2018 goal.  October, November and December are the big months in my area so we have a reasonable chance at still achieving this.  

&#x200B;

For the last 4ish months I have been almost completely out of the field as my son is the crew leader of our truck with a tech working with him.  This has allowed me to focus on sales and also building systems to help us grow/scale.

&#x200B;

Aside from the day to day marketing/sales efforts my time over the last 45 days has been focused on creating technician training systems.  I'm documenting everything that I can think of:  how to turn our equipment on, how to do preventative maintenance, how to perform the services that we offer....  I've also been creating training videos and uploading them to a learning management system (Talent LMS for those curious).  I think that technician training systems is my current most important system to be working on as it will be my biggest issue for the next two years of growth as most of my staff will consist of technicians.  This area will be an ongoing effort.

&#x200B;

I just extended an offer to a new tech that will be our tech staffing to a total of three.  This will have our second truck on the road sometime next month.  I am currently recruiting for my 4th technician with the goal of finding the right fit by the second week of September.  

&#x200B;

After MUCH time spent dragging my feet I have finally found a commercial real estate agent to get me a commercial space.  We have submitted a LOI for a location and expect to be able to be in it in the next 30-45 days (fingers crossed).

&#x200B;

I've mentioned many times in my previous posts that accounting and bookkeeping are my biggest weakness.  I'm ashamed to admit that I have done such a poor job in this department.   Early this month I hired a full service accountant/bookkeeper.  He has already 'slapped me on the wrist' but said that all is well and that all lose ends will be tied up shortly.  This is a HUGE relief to finally have under control.

&#x200B;

Biggest challenges currently:  

Cash Flow.  I've spent a lot of money on equipment (truck for cash, skids, machines...).   I only pay myself a salary of $50,000 but its still a big drag especially considering that we are just now finishing up our slow months of summer (the summer was tough);  

Obviously finding good employees is difficult.  I'm having success with this but it takes a lot of time to weed out the bad ones;  

Just growing in general.  I could put a lot more money in my pocket if I wasn't putting it towards future growth.   

&#x200B;

Best things that I've done to date:  

implement an automated followup system with email, voicemail and post card automation.  I didnt get this in place until a year ago this week.  It has paid off already but is starting to get me even more repeat customers now that some time has passed;  

Creating and implementing a google review system.  We have almost 5  times the amount of reviews (almost 150 google reviews) as the second place company in my area and then there is a drastic drop off after those guys.  This generates a lot of calls for us and gives us credibility.  On a regular basis I am told ""We usually get multiple quotes but since your reviews are so great we are just getting one from you"".  The reviews make a bigger impact for our target customers (high end, expensive homes) as they are more concerned with the overall experience than just price;

Being purposeful and consistent with my inbound calls script and my sales appointment script.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The past 19 months have been an adventure.  My life has changed in so many ways for the best.  I've had some dark moments but I would not change anything because I love who I'm becoming and I am very excited about what the future holds for my family and me.   We have plotted out our revenue goals through 2020:  2019 goal is $800,000 and 2020 goal is $1,100,000.  I'm not positive that I am going to achieve my $400,000 goal this year but that is not changing our goals for 2019 and 2020.

3) Turning the documentations / learnings / systems into a paid community site could give you great margins and scalability. Back of napkin math:

1000 Interested community members, paying you $500/year is 500k/year with probably around 85%+ margins. You could be doing what you are doing here in the subreddit: Continuously teach, maybe with photos/videos/scripts/strategies/best practices/showing exactly which tools you used/where you bought them etc.

### Founding Stories Are Myths

Company founding stories are almost always non-malicious lies. Take Netflix:

Reed Hastings has [said](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/02/07-reed-hastings) [many](http://archive.fortune.com/2009/01/27/news/newsmakers/hastings_netflix.fortune/index.html) [times](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/2746816142?lang=en) [that](https://www.wired.com/2002/12/netflix-6/) [he got the](http://www.evancarmichael.com/library/reed-hastings/Reed-Hastings-Quotes.html) [idea](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/reed-hastings-innovator-year-81514) for Netflix because he once was charged a $40 late fee on Apollo 13.

That didn't actually happen. 

It's unfortunate because it will inevitably mislead anyone learning how to start a company. 

### Sam Walton's Overnight Success
Sam was already 44(!) when he opened the first Walmart and had been running his own retail stores for over 15 years.

He wondered why people focused on the beginning of Walmart: 
> **Somehow over the years folks have gotten the impression that Walmart was something I dreamed up out of the blue as a middle-aged man, and that it was just this great idea that turned into an overnight success... 

> Like most overnight successes, it was about 20 years in the making**

If you're trying to build your own thing & you want to learn from ""the founder of Walmart"", looking at the start of the company itself is stupid because at that point he already had 15 years of experience

So let's start with Sam's very first store.

### The Biggest Mistake Of Sam's Professional Life
Sam started his retail career at 27 buying his 1st store, a ""Ben Franklin"" variety store franchise. 

As a beginner he relied on the franchise's playbook but also incorporated his own experiments. 

Things like:

* **putting popcorn & ice cream machines in front of the store to drive traffic**
* **doing huge discounts but actually making it up in volume (i.e. not ironically)**
* **buying directly from manufactures instead of going through the franchise (which allowed for cheaper prices)**

He worked hard on that single store for 5 years, grew sales 3.5x to $250k/year and became the #1 Ben Franklin franchisee in his six-state region.

But then he found out he'd made a gigantic mistake.

***When he signed the store lease he didn't include an option to renew it.***
 
The owner (a local department store competitor) saw his success & refused to renew the lease at any price, thereby forcing Sam to shut down the store.

Imagine working on something for 5 years straight, becoming the best at it, and then having a single person end it all.

Sam was devastated:
> **It was the lowpoint of my business life. I felt sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe it was happening to me... I had built the best variety store in the whole region and worked hard in the community - done everything right - and now I was being kicked out of town. It didn't seem fair. I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord.**

He was mad, but he accepted responsibility:

> **I've always thought of problems as challenges, and this one wasn't any different... I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time.**

If Facebook or Google change their algorithms you at least get to keep your old customer base and your business assets.

But with a retail store you have none of that. 

And because of the structure of the town they couldn't just open another store somewhere nearby.

The Waltons literally had to pack up their family of 6 and go find a new town.

If he'd wanted to Sam had plenty of reasons to sulk: they were starting all over in a *smaller* town (Bentonville) that also had its fair share of competition (3 other variety stores). 

**But Sam said ""it didn't matter much because I had big plans.""**
 
### Unsexy Determination
Sam spent the next 12 years in what I call *narrative lingo*.

It's the crucial part of any ""overnight success"" that doesn't get covered in the Successful Entrepreneur genre.

No one writes about all the random tangents and mistakes you make here.

Like, say, that time Sam tried to start a shopping mall 10 years too early and lost $25,000? 

Or what about the time a tornado destroyed his best performing store? All he had to say was ""we just rebuilt it and got back at it.""

This is important to know if you're trying to learn from Sam, but it doesn't fit into any narrative.

The lesson here is that there will be mistakes and problems on any path to success. As a recent book title says, [those obstacles are the way itself.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00G3L1B8K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

A coworker said Sam excelled here because he woke up every day ""determined to improve something"", and that he was

> **less afraid of being wrong than anyone I've ever known...Once he sees he's wrong, he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.**

You don't get any of this from Reed Hastings when he talks about $40 late fees. You think ""oh I need a great idea"" when the reality is the idea is nothing and your psychology & persistence is everything.

Eventually Sam got to 15 stores & by 1960 was the largest independent variety store operator in the US, doing a a total of ~$12M (in 2018 dollars) in annual revenue.

### It Would Seem Obvious
It was here that Sam finally saw the opportunity for much bigger discount stores and got to work on the 1st Walmart.

He was the most successful independent operator in the US & had 15 years of experience in retail, surely it should have been easy for him to raise money from investors...?

Wrong.

Sam asked other store owners, entrepreneurs, competitors... basically everyone said no.

He got a measily 5% from his own brother & a store manager and had to borrow the other 95% (signing their house and all their other stores as collatoral).

***Even the great Sam Walton couldn't find investors to start the 1st Walmart, on the back of a near-perfect record in retail.***

### The 1st Wal-Mart
Finally, the point where most people look at to learn, is the end of our story.

The 1st Walmart was an ugly retail store (8-foot ceilings, concrete floor, wooden fixtures) but it worked because Walmart's prices always beat competitors. 

(Even the name ""Walmart"" was selected with customer prices in mind: it was cheaper to buy neon signs for 7 letters than the longer names Sam considered.)

And you think Sam cared 2 cents about what anyone else thought about his stores? 

The New York Times doesn't mention Sam or Walmart until 1969, 7 years after the 1st store opening, and he's just one random quote in the back of the paper.

And the Walmart 1970 IPO got a *single* mention on page 44 of the Times

165,9xw88i,False,,128,"Don't rely on Social media and Google ads, there are lots of other low cost ways to market your company.",Entrepreneur,"Full disclaimer, I'm not trying to sell anyone anything, I see too much of that now and I don't want to add to it. This is a short list of ways I've marketed my company outside the normal social media and google ads that everyone seems to be so caught up in. I've run several business now, mostly services, including a pressure washing company and a commercial refrigeration company. I've since sold the pressure washing company and am trying to get a energy management company off the ground. For most of you, this stuff is common knowledge, however I see a lot of new entrepreneurs here that only want to deal with online marketing.

&#x200B;

**1: Don't forget the basics.**

This one isn't too special, but I find people forget that not everyone is glued to the internet 24/7, and a lot of people straight up ignore Facebook ads. So this summer I payed my brothers kid to go door to door in several neighborhoods (1 per weekend) and drop an informative flyer along with a ""save the tax"" coupon in people's mail boxes. On average, for every 100 flyers (one weekends worth usually) I'd get roughly 10 new leads, half of which lead to paying jobs, each job averaged $250 and it cost me around $150 for 100 flyers and paying the kid $50 cash to deliver them. $1250 for $150 is a around a 833% return. The reason this worked so well for me is for two reasons, one is people don't think about ""extra"" services like, in my case, pressure washing. They see the flyer, look at their walk way and decide that they should have it cleaned. Secondly, timing is everything, I sent the flyers out in late spring before people had a chance to clean their own walkways, driveways etc. Honestly I never looked into mail delivery, I looked at it as a way to help a kid out with some summer spending money and keep my costs low. Another key point here is location, are the people in this area your usual clients? If not, then you might be wasting your time. Again, I don't think this is news to anyone but I was surprised by how many other business owners I've spoken to that have completely given up on physical marketing and switched to 100% digital.

Overall: $150 in material and labour, average of $1250 return after finding the correct market and time.

&#x200B;

**2: Your car is a billboard.**

I'm sure 90% of you have some sort of decal on your car or truck promoting your business, but when you stop into the market where do you park? I made a habit of anyways parking somewhere that stood out. If I go to the mall in my company truck I'll park at the very back near the exit away from everyone else. If I'm between two other cars in the center of the parking lot my logo isn't visible. Parking away from everyone else allows people to see, read and remember my decals as they drive out. On top of this I made sure to drive my company truck as much as I could, you're paying to own your car and you paid to have your name plastered on it, get it out there. Another key tip here is keep it clean, people are more likely to call a company with a clean, professional appearance than some rusty old pick up that hasn't been washed in two years.

Overall: $700 for custom decals on my truck, unknown ROI but I can account for at least $3000 in jobs from people seeing my truck. I wish I had a better way to track this other than asking people ""how did you hear about me"".

&#x200B;

**3: Sponsoring events, sports teams etc.**

When ever I mention this I always get the ""But I can't afford that"" response. Truth is, you probably can't afford to have your company name tossed around at a NFL game, but you can almost always afford to sponsor a youth league or other small local event. Be smart, if you run a clothing store geared towards young females, look for a dance studio or gymnastics club that would be willing to plug your store all season for $1000 and a member discount. You'd be amazed how many small organization will go for this and it gives you a whole year of advertising. Obviously, do some research, if that dance studio only had 15 kids, and the same 50 people coming to each event it probably isn't worth it. The other side is sponsoring specific events. In my case, I found out about a 1/8th mile mud drag racing event about an hour from my city, I called the organizers and offered to give away a few $250 gift certificates as well as wash one of the trucks on site to show off my mobile services. All in it cost me around $700, but I landed two commercial jobs cleaning heavy equipment. Again, this comes back to knowing your market, I also lost money twice sponsoring events, one was car show and one was a small county fair.

&#x200B;

Overall: If you can find your clients this is a great way to gain some business, however research is key. I figured that a county fair was the best way to pitch my business to farmers, turns out they're too busy doing their own thing. However if you catch them knee deep in mud when their in a great mood, you get to go wash some tractors.

&#x200B;

**4: Always leave a business card.**

This one is super simple but so many people forget about this. Business cards are dirt cheap and very professional looking. Every time I see a cork board in the entrance of a restaurant or a shop I ALWAYS take the time to put one of my cards on it. Every time I do a job I make sure to leave a card. The more cards you have floating around the more chances you have of being seen. This past summer I went through over a 1000 business cards for my pressure washing company. I hand those things out like candy, even if I'm just giving someone my number for an unrelated reason I'll always give them a card. I've heard so many people say ""I ordered 1000 business cards and they lasted me years!"", thats wrong, they shouldn't last you years they should be distributed as fast as possible.

Overall: This one is a no brainer, but people only seem to hand out cards to people they've already sold to. Everyone could be a customer or a client, everyone gets a business card.

&#x200B;

**5: If no ones talking about you, start the conversation.**

Alright, I've been called shady, manipulative and a whole list of other things for this one. But it works, and it's currently my number on marketing tacit with my energy management company. I've had no problem landing commercial clients, however I've struggled a lot with residential clients. So what I did was start a second Facebook account under a different name, join a big local Facebook group and make a post about how high my heating bill was and what I can do to fix it, once the conversation got started I got my wife to plug my company and explain a bit about what we offer without making it sound like a sales pitch. It was something like ""You know you can get company X to come over a audit your house for fairly cheap, it's a lot better than throwing money at things you don't need"". It. Blew. Up. I had over 20 inboxs from people who were commenting on that post and got several jobs from it. It was by far the best method I've ever used to kick start a business. Those jobs landed me other jobs via word of mouth and most of those people who comment on the original posts are heavy Facebook users and they're constantly tagging me in similar posts. It's been the holy grail of marketing for me in term of residential work. For some, it's a little too deceitful, but oh well, it works. I think it's because people don't like being sold to, we're flooded with advertisements all the time and more and more people want real recommendation from other people rather than a Facebook ad. I've retired my fake social media accounts, but it was a excellent way to kick start my company after I sold my pressure washing business.

Overall: This, in my opinion, is gold. It's been my best campaign so far and it keeps on giving. Social media is good for much more than traditional paid ads.

&#x200B;

In the end, most of you seasoned business owners will know a lot of this little tips and tricks and probably more that I don't know about. But I spend a lot of time creeping this sub reddit and everyone is so caught up in SEO this and Facebook pixel that. Those are excellent ways to attract business, I use them, but it never hurts to get back to basics.

916,2seo0w,False,My Success Story,227,"Here's what SEO, Wordpress and lead generation can do for you",Entrepreneur,"I have been working a side hustle for the last 2 years using some local SEO techniques to gather leads for a major corporate office developer. After 2 years of selling them 2-30 leads/month on the ""boston office space"" type traffic they brought me in 2 weeks ago and asked if I would be interested in developing a similar site for them or revamping their website. 

I thought about it for 5 minutes as I excused myself to goto the bathroom.

Really it was a stall tactic to think about how much I should charge them. But then I said why does a $Billion valued developer in the Boston MA area ask a guy to ""make us a website too""? I was looking for the angle.

Then I thought ""how many leads have I given them in the last 24 months?"" and ""how many total leads have they received on there own with me?""

The first I could answer myself. I looked in my gmail account and brought up the last monthly report invoice I've sent them and figured it was about 400 leads in the 24 months we've worked together. If an office space went for $15 per square foot/year and the average space was 2200 sqft. Then that's $33,000 per year they're making 1 of my $30-$75 lead. If I sent them about 400 leads and if they closed even 10% of them then that's $1.3 million in revenue I bought in to them in 24 months.

So I walked back into the meeting (checking my pants zipper to be sure it was closed) and thought of a number to develop the same thing I had made. I was about to tell them $50,000 to make the same site and I would basically do the same thing I did with my own site.

Right before I got to that part I mentioned to them in small talk about what I did and the SEO stuff and one of the executive type guys asks me about the means I've been using to generate leads. I told them I had some websites that I sold leads to to a few clients in the ""boston office space"" industry. 

The guys face dropped and he said ""You're selling to other companies too?"" 

I told him yes because the contract we had in place said each lead can not be resold and they were not exclusive. Long story short they wanted exclusivity to all the leads and for me to cut out the other clients. I told them I would have to work some numbers and get back to them.

Trying to read their faces in the room to see if they were pissed or greedy for all my leads, I know how lazy I am at times and another long term contract with this client seemed boring to me. I threw out the idea of just selling them the site I had and do minimal maintenance on it for them.

They asked me to step outside and I was sweating myself thinking I just fucked up. After about 10 minutes they brought me back in and talked and BS'ed for about 20 minutes and all I can think about is what they were thinking. I checked my phone 3 or 4 times as I got texts and it seemed to make some of them nervous. One guy sat up and said ""Would you be willing to sell your site to us for $50k and help us maintain it?""

A got a lump in my throat and thought ""SHIT what do I do""

Trying to seem cool I said I would have to think about it. I knew that I billed them a little under $30k for those 24 month and both years around november - january it was all but dried up.

Some more talk and they said they're weren't going to let me leave without making a deal so what would it take. I said ""If you want to part with $100k I can deliver the site this week"" They seemed to jump at that and we all shook hands and I kicked myself quietly in the ass for not saying at least double that. The way I look at it now a few days later is that I don't have to put in a few hours/day to maintain, report, invoice and make sure the assistant I email leads to gets everything. AND I got about 3 years revenue coming in now without having to do any more of that work.

[check please](http://imgur.com/bOVNxyz)

Oh and I also wanted to say that I DID NOT post that photo to show off. I just wanted to share what I could and let you guys know what's possible with the right website in the right industry.

I've got websites in industries that you would laugh at. Stupid ideas of mine that went no where. Most I get lucky on but I'd like to think I have a better business sense within the last few years where I can figure out if an idea of mine would be profitable.

Just a little motivation for you guys.

683,4aaeer,False,,43,Study reveals the pitch deck that will land you millions,Entrepreneur,"Full text with slides can be found [here](http://startupfundraising.com/study-reveals-the-pitch-deck-that-will-land-you-millions/).


This study from DocSend gathers data from over 200 pitch decks. Most of these slides are from early stage startups executing at a Seed and Series A stage.


It takes on average 58 investors that a startup needs to contact in order to secure at least 40 meetings. This is obviously 59 investors where there is a warm introduction. VCs never pay much attention to cold calls or call emails. For them warm introductions act as a way to perform social proof or validation on the individual that is looking to connect with them.


In addition, the average length of the pitch decks averages 19 slides with an estimated time of 3.44 minutes that investors allocate to them on average. VCs and other investors that are sophisticated will probably meet with an average of 1,000 entrepreneurs on a yearly basis in person. This does not event count the pitch decks reviewed. In my modest opinion, 3.44 minutes seams high and for that reason you want to be able to capture the investor‘s attention on the first couple of slides of your pitch deck.


In terms of design and slides that entrepreneurs should include on their pitch deck, the study shows that successfully funded pitch decks included the following slides:


-Product

-Team

-Business Model

-Market Size

-Company Purpose


Other slides that are also included with less frequency are solution, why now, competition, and financials.


In terms of the order of the slides it is very similar to the order that Sequoia has on its recommendation that can be viewed here. In summary, the order of the slides is as follows:


-Company Purpose

-Problem

-Solution

-Why Now

-Market Size

-Product

-Team

-Business Model

-Competition

-Financials


The most important slide in this regard is the financials. Here you are showing the investor what kind of traction you have been able to generate and also the type of projections that you expect a few years down the line. In this slide there is no need to go into detail but a clear summary with a few lines showing revenue streams would be ideal.


The other slides that make the top 3 of the pitch deck are the Team and the Competition. The team is critical as you want to demonstrate the investor that you have the right people on your team. 


In terms of timeline, the study shows it takes for a Seed round on average around 12 and a half weeks to close from start to finish. This is obviously different from what I have seen in Series A rounds that take on average 3 to 6 months to close.


There are certain factors that influence the amount of time it takes for the closing of a round of financing. These factors are for the most part related to the way the financing is structured. If you are raising on a convertible debt it will take less time as there are just two documents that need to be signed and only 3 things where the investor and the company need to be aligned. These are the interest, the discount and the cap. However, if you are raising capital via the sale of equity then it will take 3 times the amount of time.


In addition, if you are doing a seed round you will be dealing for the most part with individuals where the due diligence process is much faster. In Series A rounds of financing you will have institutions like Venture Capital firms involved where they have a specific procedure to follow and where you will need the approval from more than just one person. In this regard, Venture Capital firms are investing the money of their investors as opposed to angel investors that are investing their own money.


As always in life it is more important the quality than the quantity. The quality of the connection will increase your chances of getting funded after your investor meeting. Contacting more investors will get you more meetings. However, more meetings does not necessarily mean more money in the bank. The key to fundraising success is to get the money in the bank ASAP and for that reason you need to be as effective as possible with your time and strategy.


In terms of verticals the study determines the easiest ones are consumer, business, marketplace, and hardware. The average amount of funding raised across the board is $1.7M. Interesting factor is that marketplaces tempt to be the ones with the most amount of success. However, marketplaces are more difficult to find due to the famous egg and the chicken issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4aaeer/study_reveals_the_pitch_deck_that_will_land_you/,492,"This is the same thing as saying ""Study reveals using a digital SLR camera makes you a professional photographer.""

Business 1: I had a great idea. I listened to this podcast on Shopify where someone who produced mouse mats for the gaming community was interviewed. The founder told his story, explained how he got started and with no marketing, through Reddit found his [first adopters](https://rykovmedia.com/2019/11/12/finding-the-first-adopters-clients-for-your-startup/).

I thought: “What a sucker. I can do better.” So, what did I do? Well, I decided to follow in his footsteps. I found suppliers on AliBaba, narrowed it down to two manufacturers, and made a modified mouse pad. It was huge and awesome, with a cool logo. I created a Shopify website, and set everything up.

I then proceeded to post an image of the pad on Reddit asking for feedback, thoughts, etc, thinking orders will pour in soon - two random comments would also be chosen, and I would offer a free mousepad to those people. I got the post to go to the top under the subreddit and I felt like things were really going my way. And then I read feedback.

“Adjust this”, “change colour”, and even worse “i hope I win”. Very useful that last one…

Sigh.

I contacted the manufacturer again, asked to make adjustments and then proceeded to order a full batch, as another sample on its own would have cost too much per piece. **MISTAKES WERE MADE.**

After I ordered the batch, and it arrived, I posted a new image on reddit. Got more engagement, and selected two winners.

At the same time I began to spend money on Facebook Ads. FACEPALM. (I didn’t have a lot of money, so I literally could only give this 2–3 tries, and then I was broke).

Feedback from the two winners - great material, awesome design… not very convenient. Turns out you need more space for your mouse…

After running ads for 2 weeks and getting **0 orders,** I had to rethink my idea completely and pivot business into a completely different field.

—

What can you learn from my failure?

**Don’t stop with the feedback**. I decided after the first feedback to go ahead and order a full BATCH, without asking for customers’ opinion again. **ASK FIRST**. Don’t commit until you know you got something all of your potential clients want.

**Marketing comes second**. Look for free ways to advertise. I failed, but Reddit was a great source of essentially [free marketing ](https://rykovmedia.com/2019/11/27/how-to-advertise-for-free/)(excluding the price of samples and delivery costs). Add marketing afterwards - good advertising and marketing goes a long way, but you don’t have to spend £100s initially. Hussle.

**Small improvements do not matter**. If you think you can make small improvements to your competitor’s product and immediately convert their clients to yours… think again. There is a reason their clients are loyal to them. It’s not always about the product. And people DO NOT CARE about small improvements. Do your own thing, make sure it’s 10x, 100x better or the market will destroy you.

Going back to feedback - before starting anything, ask yourself **would I use this, and would other people use this.**

Good luck, and avoid some of the mistakes I have made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/g5hyry/dont_do_this_if_you_are_starting_a_business/,385,"So here's my issues with the whole internet drop shipping business. The market is soooo saturated.. It doesn't matter if you succeed or if you fail. Shopify/Alibaba/Facebook (ads) make money regardless. It sort of allows people to attempt to create businesses lazily.

My key takeaway is if you've seen it done already you're already too late. Good example is the minimalist watch brands (people try to become like Daniel Wellington because they cost $2 to make and sell for $200). I've seen so many shopify stores for silly watch brands now it drives me crazy.

**I wish** people made businesses the old fashioned way - find a problem and solve it. Good old innovation will get you far. Good lesson learned and I hope you didn't spend a fortune

Side note - On my blog I talk about how I'm starting a business from absolutely nothing and I'd love your feedback! In fact I rant about shopify in my first post hahaha. If you want take a look I'd love the feedback!

I just want to make enough to live comfortably and be able to pay my expenses while having enough money to use for entertainment and leisure. I'm not a materialistic person so the super expensive things in life don't really appeal to me.

I would be content with just making $50,000 every year from whatever business venture I decide to embark on. I don't plan on getting married and having kids because it's just not fit for me.

Is it possible to reach this goal of mines, and how long do you think it would take to make $50,000 every year as an entrepreneur?

288,a2d99l,False,Feedback Please,279,Did you ever get frustrated when you decided to travel to a new country? I made a website to help you with that by finding visa requirements for 200+ countries,Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit!

I spent the last 6 months trying to build [Visalist](https://visalist.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=entrepreneur). Now your quest for tension free visa requirements research is over.

Here's why I made this web app:  A year back I became a digital nomad and started traveling. I wanted to visit all the countries that I fancied. Soon I realized that you need a visa to most of these countries, few have VOA(Visa on Arrival) and for others, you have to get it through their embassy in your home country(in my case India). So now I wanted to see the countries I could go without waiting for 3 weeks to get a visa, did some research. After few blogs and websites finally got the list. Traveled to a new country. After few months I wanted to go to another country. I had to do the same search, couldn't find the old one, found a new site which had more countries offering VOA. One of my friends told me that when he researching for Vietnam visa, he found almost 10 websites with .gov and it was really confusing. Many blogs don't have links to official websites of embassies.

To summarize the problems:

* No aggregated info of visa related info shown in a useful way.
* Most of the existing blogs and website has very less info and are usually outdated.
* Lot of research is needed even to go to a single country and this needs to be done every single time.
* Difficult to find the official website and data on many websites is outdated.
* Pay more than required money to visa agent's

So I took the matter into my own hands and decided to aggregate this info, organize and present it in a useful way to the user and so [Visalist](https://visalist.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=entrepreneur) was born. While I was talking to my friends about this, I realized many people wanted something similar from a long time. So what this has is

* A simple way to find the basic requirements for all the countries you want to travel
* Simplified visa requirements like visa-free, visa on arrival, visa not required, evisa, visa required and visa refused (Yes! For North Korea)
* A simple map color-coded with visa requirements across the world so you can easily see which countries around you can easily travel to
* Visa Requirement details like duration, documents checklist and other requirements for the stay
* Which is the official website for that information

I coded, designed and built Visa List using VueJS with NuxtJS for the frontend, MySQL for backend using Golang. I was originally an android developer and learned these just to build Visa List.

I believe every person who wants to explore the world around them and would have faced the problem I faced, so could find value in what I have built. So I would love to know what you think of this and would be more than happy to hear your suggestions and feature requests. Let me know what you want to be added or removed or do I need to build something entirely!

702,71qixe,False,,201,"TIFU By going to a ""Free"" 3 day seminar on Millionaire Mindset.",Entrepreneur,"So a few months ago I signed up to a 3 day seminar by T Harv Eker called 'Millionaire Mind Intensive'

I didn't know what to expect, haven't read any of his books but I figured it was free and I had nothing to lose. Turns out ""Nothing is this world is free"" rings true.

Like many people in this sub, I read many books, watch tutorials and do courses to increase my knowledge,  but this was my first seminar of this kind, and it was BULLSHIT.

Now don't get me wrong, there was information to be gained and the Guy doing the seminar was very funny and charming, but the whole thing was just a slimey sales pitched aimed at making money of vulnerable and unsuspecting people.

It was filled with "" GIVE THE GUY NEXT TO YOU A HIGH FIVE AND SAY YOU'VE GOT THE MILLIONAIRE MINDSET!"" and ""SCREAM LOUD IF YOU'RE READY TO BECOME WEALTHY!""

I  decided to go with my gut and leave at the first break due to a number of red flags and the fact that I couldn't take anymore

**Red Flag 1.** We were all messaged before the event to bring 100 pounds in cash for ""activities""
**Red Flag 2** The Speaker went from sleeping on his brothers floor and £100,000 in debt to financially free in a few years and didn't explain any details how.
**Red Flag 3** The speaker would barely touch on a subject and then say "" we do this really good course which goes into this a lot more""
**Red Flag 4** One of his courses will teach you how to consistently earn 25-30% returns from investing in the stock market. I've done enough reading and investing to know that is complete bullshit.
**Red Flag 5**  Sctrict no videos or photos of the event because "" this is a safe environment and people won't feel comfortable participating if cameras are around.
**Red Flag 6** All three people I had met in the time I was there had read T Harv Eker's book and it had said to attend the event when it's in your town.
**Final Red Flag** In  2.5 hours of sitting there, the only thing that was taught is Passive Income streams which I already knew.

I felt like a sucker for even going, but decided to cut my losses and leave as I couldn't handle another 9 hours of it ( The event is 12 hours a day and over three days!)

This begs the question, are there any genuine events these days not aimed at taking your money for very little valuable information?

TLDR : I fucked up traveling an hour to  go to a Millioionare Mindset event which turned out to be one big sales pitch.

Edit: I'm treating this now as a good thing as some of you have mentioned that it might save other people from signing up to these style of events!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/71qixe/tifu_by_going_to_a_free_3_day_seminar_on/,487,Sounds like Trump University  ,2017-09-22 12:02:21
749,85k3gp,False,Startup Help,111,How To Build Awesome Landing Pages / Websites - A Noob Guide by Me,Entrepreneur,"I've been heavily involved with 3 startup businesses each with six figure revenues in the past 2 years. I wanted to make a video series that gives practical, no bullshit advice. It's partly a way to challenge myself to make content in my spare time (rather than play video games), but I also think I can offer some lessons that others can genuinely learn from. I'm not claiming to be hugely successful, yet.

One of the things that I always see, on this subreddit and elsewhere, is people who think starting a business has to cost a lot of money. My approach is always to do as much as possible in-house, at least at the start. We make our own websites, do all of our own branding, run all our ads etc.

So I've decided to make a series on creating successful websites using WordPress. The series might evolve to include other types of videos as I go along. The focus will always be teaching ""quick and dirty"" methods. Not the most professional, but methods that give you quick results and help you to launch a lot quicker.

The hardest part about running a business is always (from my experience) getting customers. So I always try to get my product out as quick as possible. I can build the perfect website later on, once I've actually got customers.

This first video is showing how to make landing pages - but the skills can be applied to make any kind of page. If you don't think you have the skill to make a website, I'd recommend watching. If you dedicate a week of your time to learning how to make basic WordPress websites, getting new websites out becomes a much smaller task, which is awesome when you're starting up.

Very little coding knowledge required (a bit of CSS and HTML might help).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYKqUNgLjjM

tl;dr I'm making a video series based on practical advice for starting a business. The focus is on WordPress websites. I want to show people that doing a lot of work in-house can be fast, cheap and help you to launch much quicker.

257,a3ppu2,False,,317,Do not use GoDaddy to Register your Domain,Entrepreneur,"Other Domain registrars may do this, but it seems to be the most prevalent with GoDaddy, I'll just get right to it. They buy domains you are searching for and then try to re-sell them back to you as a ""Premium Domain"" for %1000 more or a lot of times even more, I normally see it go to the base ""Premium Domain"" of $2,500. They offer domains for $1 as a deal a lot of the times to get you searching for a domain on their website, through this I assume they check for trends and buy high trending word uses and popular phrases. This is such a dirty practice for a company who is there to offer an easy solution to purchase a domain for a lot of times peoples first company, website, and hosting plan.

The competition is weak. The market is growing. The costs and risks are low. The odds are good. You can analyze the market and make accurate decisions on where to enter. You can win.

Start small. Start low skilled and low risk if you don’t have any capital or experience. As the opportunities grow and you get momentum your business can evolve. If you have capital and are willing to invest the time and money you can find very profitable niche services. The more specialized you can get the better the margins and the better the chances of success.

These are not commodities. You can always add more value and avoid competing on price and racing to the bottom. There will always be customers willing to pay a premium for better and faster services. The biggest gap in most of these industries is speed. Service providers are overloaded so they are booked out 1-2 weeks. They have more business than they can handle. If you can deliver a consistent service tomorrow you can charge 50%-100% more.

If you have a tech background or can apply basic tech you have a huge competitive advantage in these spaces. The companies that currently dominate don’t have the tech to get you quick quotes. They don’t have the tech to manage employees or schedules or billing.

One of my co-founders u/millionaire_ made a quick [AMA a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ad6ht3/thinking_about_doing_an_amamaybe_this_will_be_it/) which seemed to get a lot of interest. I wanted to expand on some of  the successes he talked about and make a few posts around our marketing  strategies! If you haven't feel free to check out the AMA he did. There are some useful nuggets in there :).  
I've been following the r/entrepreneur and r/startups for  the past 4 years and have received some amazing advice, read some great  stories, and have contributed some of my knowledge here and there. I started my company a little over 3 years ago and have had great mentors along the way. Now I would like to give back a little and share some of  my own experiences.  
**Background**  


I’m one of 3 founders. We’ve grown our company to 20+ employees, 2 outstanding products, millions of dollars of revenue, and an 8 figure  valuation. We have a long ways to go and still have a lot to learn.  Every day is a grind and we’re all putting in about 10 hours a day. Are we burnt out? Not even close. We have a huge opportunity in front of us  and we’re all on the same page as to what our vision is.  


I'd  like to make a post every week going over different platform algorithms, destroying competition, understanding how to monetize your market, high level marketing, and much more! I'll start this first post off with a bang and cover some key things to consider in the competitive marketing landscape.  


**Marketing 101!**  


Sales and marketing are arguably the 2 most important things in business. They go hand in hand. If you have a product market fit and test enough marketing tactics, you will find tactics that work for your business. This allows you to scale a business at an extremely fast rate. Really understanding your metrics, customer's needs, retention, and other factors are key for any growing company. There are a few things that you need to consider before marketing.  


**1. Who are your target customers?**  


**2. Where do your target customers go?**  


**3. Who are the decision makers from these companies and where do they go? (For B2B)**  


**4. Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  


**5. Where do those existing relationships go?**

**Who are your target customers?**  


Identifying your target customer is very important. For my company, we focus primarily on home service companies. There are thousands of home service companies so we narrowed down to home service companies who have  websites. Then it turned into focusing on plumbing, HVAC, and electrical companies. Next, how do we know a company can afford marketing or technology products? We narrowed down to companies who have at least 5 service technicians. As we grew, we started to focus on companies who have 10+ technicians. Larger companies tend to be more stable, willing to spend more, and are easier to retain and build a relationship with. If they have between 5-9 technicians they should be spending money on  Google ads, Facebook ads, billboards, etc. If not, we don't waste our  time, or their time.   


This was just the beginning and how we started with our first product which was a lead gen product. As we grew an ancillary AI chat product that can cater to multiple industries, we expanded our target market with similar requirements. Now we target home service companies, dental practices, medical practices, attorneys, real estate companies, home builders, and larger enterprise deals.  


It's important to pinpoint who your target customer is so that you don't waste time and money on the wrong people. Your target customer might change as time goes on (it definitely has for us). Be mindful of deals that you are closing and try to recognize similarities between them all.  


**Where do your potential customers go? Primarily the decision makers!**  


First  you need to identify who the decision makers are from the company! In our case, the decision makers for both of our products are typically the marketing managers and sometimes the owners/CEOs. It's not always the CEO so be mindful of this. So where do we reach these people?  


**Are they on Facebook?**  


**Are they on Instagram?**  


**Are they on Reddit? (Most of our clients don't even know what Reddit is haha)**  


**Are they on LinkedIn?**  


**Do they check their emails? How do we even get their emails?!**  


**How can we get in front of them in person?**  


**How do they make their purchasing decisions? Online, in person, via demos...**  


These  are all questions you need to ask yourself. A lot of times you will know where your target customer DOES NOT go, so you can eliminate those from the list. For example, a lot of our customers are 40+ years old and have very specific purchasing patterns. Because of this, we didn't invest our time into marketing on Instagram.  


For  us, our most successful marketing campaigns come from in person events, email marketing, LinkedIn marketing (paid and organic), and retargeting on Facebook.  


Trade shows and conferences are huge for us. We typically bring 5 people from our team to have 2 people at our booth and the other 3 running around the event grounds talking to ANYONE THEY CAN. Clients, other vendors for partnerships, manufactures, literally anyone. We close deals on the spot, schedule demos for the upcoming weeks, and begin partnership conversations. Not only that, but people start to recognize our brand.  


After the event, we had collect so many emails, schedule meetings, and always purchase the event email list if we could. This is used to email market and our sales team would call everyone and say something like ""we were the booth with the nerf guns and gave away the free bags.""  By the way, free bags at events are HUGE because everyone becomes a walking billboard for you. ;)  


Now that they have seen us in person, we would add EVERYONE on LinkedIn (if  they had one) and set up some paid LinkedIn ads to the companies in attendance.  


Then we set up some basic Facebook retarget ads so they are seeing us everywhere for the next month. All of this makes the sales team's job much easier when they are calling the potential customers. Everyone is basically a warm lead at this point knowing we are a legit brand/product. We close multiple deals per day, per rep in the coming weeks after an event.  


**Who do your potential customers currently work with? (Their existing relationships)**  


Now  that we're closing a lot of 'one off deals', we would think... ""how do  we 10x our growth""? What's slowing us down? With our AI chatbot, we install on a website, so during every sales conversation, we would have to get in front of the agency who controls their website. BOOM. ""WE HAVE TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE AGENCIES."" They are the ones who control the websites. How do we incentive them and speed up our growth? This was the start of our channel sales/marketing strategy. Give the agencies a revenue share to sell to their existing clients. We are very generous  with our revenue share, and we have the best product in the market so it's a no brainer for both parties.  


Now instead of closing 10 deals a week, we can close 50-100+ because of our channel partners. Our dev team built the backend and we made the  process as simple as possible for all of our partners. Now we're writing checks for tens of thousands of dollars to our partners every month. Better than spending it on marketing and investing in massive sales teams. Our main focus has become growth through channel partners. We have a small sales team and our margin is higher with them, but we grow  faster through our partners.  


Side note... This mentality can be translated to B2C through influencer marketing. Who are your consumers following? Instagram models are making a living for getting paid to feature certain products. YouTubers also  get paid to more money than their CPMs to feature products on their channel. If you can find the right people, it works like a charm.  


**Where do those existing relationships go?**  


In our situation, LINKEDIN is a goldmine. Not just from a standpoint of adding/messaging, but we pay for LinkedIn ads ever day. Once you add their decision makers on LinkedIn, start doing more paid ads, more organic posts showcasing top clients, the snowball effect begins. We try to schedule as many calls per week with agencies to get them reselling our product. We also meet a lot of people in person at our events so those conversations become pretty easy. Eventually, the agencies started messaging us.  


For larger partners, it's pretty standard to fly out to meet in person and get terms hashed out.  


Again, for B2C, your potential customers might be spending hours on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. Influencer marketing works really well and can  get a massive return.

This is my mindset for marketing. Who are the target companies, who makes the decisions, and how do I get in front of them? The ideology is pretty simple and just all about executing and making things happen!

217,95f6rp,False,,323,3 Years ago I started a company with my last $7k. Now I am making $19k pure profit per month! AMA,Entrepreneur,"Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/dCCWg7u](https://imgur.com/a/dCCWg7u)

A little backstory:

I used to work for a major corporation doing customer service & managing social media accounts. I could usually finish my daily tasks before 3pm. The job was not challenging at all, no chance at a promotion and I was bored out of my mind. I was literally counting the minutes until 5 o'clock. Although I was getting by fine, I figured this way no way to live my life. So with some free time on my hand I started to look for different ways to start my own business. I tried a bunch of different things ( affiliate marketing, dropshipping, etc ) until I found out about selling on Amazon. I figured if other people can make money doing this, I can as well right? So I started doing research. And I was serious about this. For the next couple of weeks I devoured every FBA blog, podcast, forums, case study on the web. All the information was out there for free and I wanted to read it all. So after I felt I was ready to pull the trigger I used part of my $7k I had in savings to place my first purchase order in China. It took about 2 months to produce & ship, but after that the sales kept coming! It took another 12 months before I was making more with Amazon than I was making with my day job. At that point I directly quit my job and went full-time Amazon FBA. Now 3 years later I am still growing every quarter and am currently making $19k a month.

If anybody is interested these were the requirements for my first product:

* **High demand**: At least $3000 revenue per month for competitors in my niche. **I check the demand with** [**Jungle Scout (Review & Discount)**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/jungle-scout-review-discount-coupon-code/) **or with** [**Viral Launch Coupon Code & Review**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/viral-launch-review-coupon-code-discount-2/) **/** [**Helium 10 Discount & Review**](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/helium-10-discount-coupon-code-review-versus-vs-jungle-scout/)**.**
* **$15 + Sales price**
* **Low competition**: The competition should have around 50 reviews or less.
* **Easy to manufacture product**: I don't want to deal with electronics or anything that might break easily
* **Healthy profit margin**: Profit margin should be at least 33% of the sales price. So I want to make at least $1k per month on this product

**Update**: Wow thanks for all the responses! I get a lot of people asking me how it works with [estimating fba product demand](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/how-to-find-your-first-product-to-sell-on-amazon/), [manufacturing in China](https://garlicpressseller.com/manufacturing-shipping/step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-manufacture-private-label-products-on-amazon-fba/) & [ppc](https://garlicpressseller.com/fba-sales/amazon-ppc/amazon-ppc-strategy-guide-tutorial/).

855,4tx3ev,False,,142,Simple harsh truth that changed my perspective on life,Entrepreneur,"Hello /r/entrepreneur.

I know that most posts here are about how to make money and stuff like that, but I would like to share with you a simple advice that I have read from reddit a while ago that changed my life.

Most of us here come from lower/middle class. Majority of millionaires and billionaires come from lower/middle class. A lot of us here went through a lot of shit since we were born. Not everybody had loving and rich parents. But even if you did have, there is a really simple thing that you have to understand in order to become successful. 

**Nobody owes you anything.** Nobody. Not even your parents. If you had happy childhood, good for you. If you didn't, good for you. In life, people only care about themselves. You did something embarrassing today on your way to work and somebody laughed? They will forget about it and they will forget about you in few hours. Nobody cares about your problems, they only care about what you can bring to the table and how you can help them. 

During past few weeks, there has been a lot of posts here about people who were feeling depressed because they failed. They started business, lost a lot of money and time and didn't get anything in return. That is what they all say. Every successful person will tell them exactly the same thing - that they didn't get nothing in return. They have got, probably the two most important things - knowledge and experience. Yes, you failed. Now you know what you shouldn't do. Try again. Majority of successful entrepreneurs failed dozens of times before they finally succeeded. Google ""successful people who started out as failures"" and you will see what I am talking about.

Realize that nobody owes you anything and that life will keep throwing shit at you. It sucks sometimes, but life isn't fair. Lets not cry about it and lets change it. I was feeling bad and I was depressed every time something bad happened to me. When something bad happens to me now, that I definitely don't deserve, I laugh at it. I see what I can learn from it and move on. I suggest that you also do the same. We are here because we know want to change our life. We don't want to be slaves and work 9-5 for the rest of our lives for someone else.

519,9f7ao5,False,,301,"If you are looking to start a business, go into the cosmetics/beauty/health categories",Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone, I know the sub is sensitive to spam/promotions but I don't have anything to promote here except I want to let entrepreneurs or business owners know that the cosmetics/beauty/health industries are 3 excellent categories to start or grow a new business. 

I had decent success in business by starting my own beauty (makeup & hair) brand so I wanted to shed some light on this category for anyone who is interested but doesn't know where to start. 

And no, I don't have anything to flog or market, got no links to share but I just want to share some ideas. Feel free to take these niches and run with them. Before anyone starts, sharing a good idea isn't the same as doing the work it takes to build a successful business in the health and beauty industry. I am happy sharing my insights because there is so much money to make in this market. 

These following segments are ripe for anyone who has even just $5K to invest. I started my beauty line with $1K:

* Colour cosmetics targeting women (Instagram still hot, Kylie & Rihanna are just two of the many business women making bank in this sector, women care about what influencers are doing)
* Hair extensions and hair products targeting women (More women are doing their own hair at home, salons are struggling to keep up with constant new products coming out onto the market)
* Organic soap lines 
* Bridal makeup services
* Children's hair line 
* Hair products dealing with alopaecia 
* Product line targeting men dealing with baldness or thinning hair
* Weight loss (I did alright in this sector as well, worth a go if you can do the fat burning angle)

**Markets that are too saturated at the moment**

* Beard oil targeting men
* Lip kits or lipstick only lines

**Why cosmetics/beauty/health?**

* Recession proof
* Repeat customers
* Loyal customers once you have created a brand

**What I learned from running my brand**

* **Use FB ads religiously** \- Stick with Facebook ads if you want to build a profitable beauty brand online - Almost all of our revenue was thanks to FB ads so I definitely have nothing negative to say about Zuckerberg and co. I found that Instagram ads didn't really work as well as I had hoped so we stuck mainly with Facebook. Our ad spend was about $3K per month and we generated around $20K+ each month. 
* **Instagram** \- Instagram is really important but it is too late now to do it organically because of algorithm changes. I spent money on influencers but I found beauty influencers hard to work with, they charge too much money and some of them have low engagement. Things picked up for our business once I stopped paying influencers ironically, invested more in FB ads and this caused people to search for us on Instagram themselves. Instagram beauty followers are stubborn and first movers - they move at their own pace so I found it was better to use IG as a mood board instead of a sales channel. I know that influencers have worked for many brands but for whatever reason, they didn't bring us clicks. 
* **Do weekly drops** \- Ideally if you have the money, you should release new beauty products every day but every week is a good way to generate recurring revenue and to keep your customers happy. Beauty customers want to see new products all of the time and you need to stay on top of it. 
* **Create a secret VIP group** \- We created a secret group of VIP customers where we invited top spenders of our beauty and hair products, and we told them that they could invite one other 'whale' to the group. This led people to call us organically asking to be in the VIP group and invariably led to people buying our products more because they heard about this secret VIP group. VIP marketing still works when executed properly. 

The bulk of our sales came from the sale of hair products first, then makeup, then skincare. 

The categories I've mentioned are competitive but if you can find a good niche for yourself, you can definitely make it. One rising trend I am noticing in the beauty industry is the launch of reality TV star based beauty lines and influencer based lines. These categories skew towards women more but I am also noticing more men are becoming customers in the grooming categories. 

You are leaving money on the table if you don't even consider these categories or segments. Hope this helps anyone who wants to start a consumer business in beauty/hair/cosmetics/health.

That said, what’s your brand? What’s the story too?  ",2018-09-12 12:28:54

A few days ago I did a little over $3,300 sales in one day (all with private labeling Amazon FBA) without any launches or discounting (so no inflated sales #'s) but a new product had organically ranked extremely well so I was selling quite highly. So I was thinking and realized my eccentric post when I first started was about 3.3k in a month and now I am consistently averaging 1.8-2k a day which I never would of thought possible, even remotely before starting this.

&#x200B;

(Alot of the advice below is specific to Amazon FBA, but can be applied to online entrepreneurship in general)

&#x200B;

I want to make this a comprehensive (as I can) thread of major discoveries / different viewpoints that can be of use to beginners or even other mid level sellers like myself.

1. It's ok to compete against name brands, I've never seen a guru who hasn't said this and I believe it to be very wrong. I rank next to one of the biggest brands in the world; probably one of the top 10 corporations in the world if I had to guess. I say rank next to because I wouldn't say im competing yet because I probably only take 5% of their market share which may be a stretch, their main listing does about 300k a month. All of my listings combined in that niche are currently doing about 50k/month in revenue. Theres alot of uni-dimensional and **incorrect advice commonly touted although each does have** ***some*** **truth such as:**

* Don't sell anything under $15 or especially $10 items. I got started with a $10 item and my average sales order is probably $11/order. Yes I make profit, great profit actually with 35% margin so yes; 3.5 dollars a sale isn't alot individually, but it is when you average 50 units a day for that single item. But under $10 is when you may get deemed addon status from Amazon which means your item has to be ordered with $25 worth of other items and it is a death sentence for your listing unless your item is very small, so I would recommend staying away from items under $10 that aren't very small i.e easily fits in your hand. In my first listing there's times I would drop below $10 to sell more and I would get labeled addon status even though the majority of the other items I never do. Addon status is an arbitrary and undefined label unfortunately.
* Don't sell anything too heavy. Weight *can* *be* a completely useless metric, you can sell something thats 30 lbs if its profitable, ideally yes lighter is easier and cheaper but it is a very restrictive and incorrect statement to say you shouldn't ever or at all sell something above 5 to 10 lbs. However you probably shouldn't sell something that weighs 10 lbs and is bulky dimensionally and only sells for $14 because after your shipping and Amazon fees theres virtually no way for you to profit unless you order in massive quantities.
* Don't compete against name brands. To expand upon my first point should you try and sell something like laundry detergent and compete against Gain, Tide, and arm & hammer? Probably not, unless you have tens of thousands of dollars for marketing and a genuinely great product. But there are niches that aren't *fully* dominated by a name brand that is selling under that keyword. There are plenty of brands who are big brands but have lesser known products that are not the said brands bread and butter, and that scares alotta people away but it shouldn't; it is an opportunity. For reference my first item's niche with the aforementioned big corporation, the top listing for every keyword is that companies and their listing has over 3,000 reviews; i'd say that scares away virtually everyone but me. And the reason I know that is every single other seller right now on the first page are Chinese sellers likely located in their mainland, so no other private labelers like myself. They may have 3,000 reviews but when I was looking I noticed all the listings below them didn't have tons of reviews (under 100) and alot of them were doing 8-12k a month in revenue. Then I examined those listings and thought, I could craft a much better listing than that. So I did, and its worked out pretty well and I don't think its just some 1 off lucky thing, this can be applied to any other niche as long as like I said early half the listings on the first page aren't owned by one brand. If it is just 1 big listing then other private labelers / chinese sellers who are still making decent money & you think you can make a better listing / better product then the fact that there's a name brand making alot of money is irrelevant.

&#x200B;

2. This should of been first but build an email list ***very soon, if not immediately.*** When it comes to your first product and your first order and you're clueless and it may not workout you don't *have to* go through the hassle of setting up an email capture page and doing product inserts to drive traffic to that page, but the second you decide to reorder or that you're going to stick with Amazon FBA and do a second product **you must build an email list.** Even if you solely want to sell on Amazon and you may think why would I need emails, 2 words ***legitimate reviews.*** Yes you can use friends and family for your first product (which would be breaking the ToS and im not advocating it) but that is not sustainable and everytime you use someone theres a big chance you wont be able to again so you will run out of people and be clueless how to get a review or have to rely on review services or launch services which review services are extremely sketchy and illegal and launch services are much better when done yourself and more effective if you know what you're doing. I highly recommend using Facebook ads hooked up with manychat to launch your product and collect email address and future reviewers, its an unprecedented way to get completely within ToS reviews AND email addresses for like $1-1.5 a pop to fairly *cold* traffic. If you're new you'll have no idea what that is but just youtube many chat fb ad launch method if you plan on launching an amazon product soon.

3. This is extremely important not to be misinterpreted but once you've *proven* you atleast have a solid idea of what you're doing which i'll define as 2 successful products that are consistently generating a decent roi. **Loans to expand your business can be huge** ***if and only if your growth is being heldback by capital***\*\*.\*\* And for those wondering why would you be held back if you're making money, for me I was making great money but every single month I was reinvesting thousands and even tens of thousands back into the business for more inventory so getting a chunk or a lump sum can be huge. I'm not saying to go borrow 30k from your family or 20k from a business lender but if capital is bottlenecking you and you know what you're doing you can make a $10-15k loan multiply your business by 2-3x even with a 20-25% interest rate. I spend $1.61 for a product that nets over $4 so the ROI is 248% so even 20-25% interest rates aren't bad if you have a profitable product.

4. Make sure you have products in the pipeline at all times and launch more as soon as you have the money to do so, when your first product is shipping to Amazon **be looking for your second** even if you don't launch it for 2-3 months have multiple potential products because when you do have the money you should not be impulsively choosing a product and quickly trying to get it selling because thats how you make big mistakes. In the same token though you don't need to spend 2-3 months eyeing a product, using junglescout or whatever tools you may use almost all of the product research tools available if you know what you're doing can in about 30 seconds give you the information in a niche needed to known instantly if a niche is worth possibly pursuing or not. I don't believe in tracking a product for 1-2 weeks I make my decision by looking at the exact rank over time directly from Amazon using the JS chrome extension and decide if it is a worth product. I believe this sets me apart from 99% of other people doing product research I'm much more efficient with it, although now I use Virtual Assistants to look for products.

I'm going to stop there, could definitely write some more but I dont want to ramble too much and it takes alot for me because I have an off and on relationship with writing haha. As I said drop any questions below, hope this helps someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/arjhwd/from_33k_in_a_month_to_33k_in_a_day_with_amazon/,797,Downvoted  ,2019-02-17 10:42:47
669,aj33zx,False,,389,Who are the top 1%? And what do they do?,Entrepreneur,"**EDIT: Due to popular demand in the comments, just created a subreddit to help all of us get to the top 1%.** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTop1Percent/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTop1Percent/) **Please subscribe and let's get the discussion going!**

According to the latest IRS data, the top 1% in America make $422,000+ a year.

This group is broken up into two components:

1. Self-employed business owners
2. Highly-paid professionals

Let's unpack both of those in specific detail:

1. &#x200B;

According to the Chicago Booth Review, ""the 1 percent’s income is being driven by owner-managers, mostly of small and medium-sized companies—specifically S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies."" These businesses range from a local restaurant chain to a dentists' office to a B2G enterprise software solution. However, according to Booth's research, ""The businesses earning the most profits in the bulk of the top 1 percent were physicians’ and dentists’ offices, professional and technical services, specialty trade contractors, and legal services."" The typical company in the top 1% category has over $7M in sales. With a 10% profit margin split between two owners, this would create two top 1% incomes. This by far is the most common path to joining the top 1%: small business ownership.

2)

According to research from NPR's Planet Money, the top 1% disproportionately hold jobs as physicians, an array of managers/executives, lawyers, salespeople, and financial specialists/accountants. The common thread? Extremely valuable specialized skill and revenue generation. A doctor and a lawyer have specialized, in-demand skills that people are willing to pay for. Managers, salespeople, and financial specialists all work towards revenue generation.

So how does someone join the top 1% of income-earners? It basically involves becoming a very specialized/revenue generating employee or founding a successful small business.

Hopefully this was interesting! Definitely consider your goals and don't obsess over a specific number or sacrifice things you care about to join an elusive group - it certainly won't make you happy. But earning a lot of money can give you the opportunity to make an impact, not worry about not having enough money, give things to others, and spend money for yourself. Good luck and please let me know what you thought!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aj33zx/who_are_the_top_1_and_what_do_they_do/,495,basically if your evil and ugly as holy fuck with no honor integrity or any redeeming characteristics=welcome to the 1% ,2019-01-23 19:00:39

\[Important: This post is not intended to sell or promote anything homie. It's my small way of paying it forward to entrepreneurs, a community I deeply care about. Can't be more clear than that.\]

# What we do

I’m the founder and CEO of **Smart Alto** the easiest way to set 15-minute phone appointments with homebuyers.

Real estate agents advertise homes on Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com and other places. The problem is when homebuyers want to meet with real estate agents to view properties, real estate agents almost never respond to the inquiries because they’re busy doing other stuff.

We built technology that sends text messages to those homebuyers within 2 minutes, asks them a few simple questions, and then sets 15-minute phone appointments on the real estate agent’s calendar. That way, the homebuyer always gets their questions answered and can then schedule time with the real estate agent to go see the home.

I used to work for a real estate brokerage to set appointments for real estate agents, so I know this problem very well.

# Pulling back the curtain on my startup.

I’m pulling back the curtain on my startup and going to show you exactly what I did to take it from $0 to $500,000/year and beyond.

This (admittedly) long post includes the exact Facebook and Google ads, landing pages, copy, sales playbooks, Facebook posts, integrations, videos, websites, pricing strategies and practically everything I’ve used to grow my business.

I’m going to show you what I screwed up (so you can skip my mistakes) and what I got right (so you can copy my success).

**It doesn't matter how fast you go if you’re running in the wrong direction**. I wish someone would have done this for me when I was a newbie. Instead, I had to piecemeal crap for years, lose money, and fight tooth and nail to climb the entrepreneurial mountain.

Well, you can skip that step because this post is your **Ski Lift** to the top of the mountain, so let’s make it **Snowfall** (inside joke, keep reading and you’ll get it).

These are the most important things I focused on to start growing fast (read: this is what you should focus on too).

\[Important note: Per the [PII guidelines](https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii), I hid the names, email addresses and phone numbers of customers when necessary.\]

# Customers

Most folks screw up because they want to change the world with a fancy idea. They ultimately sell something no one wants to buy and go broke. Start with a hungry, burger-loving customer base and sell them burgers, man. [Click to see how I learn about my customers to sell them what they want.](https://imgur.com/a/zJFXhaT)

# Website

My main goal is to increase website conversions. I want at least 3% of website visitors to schedule a demo with my sales team. My website answers 7 questions. [Click to see the 7 questions my website answers](https://imgur.com/a/bBFxohU).

# Marketing

I pay for eyeballs. I’ve got an outdated blog and my SEO sucks, but who cares? I’m not a publisher so screw all the marketing gurus who demand I write new content everyday. [Click to see my entire marketing funnel, from the Facebook and Google ads I run to the landing pages I use. ](https://imgur.com/a/1Hvie3x)

# Snowfall

This is my secret weapon. The smartest thing I’ve ever done as a marketer is double down on showcasing customer results. This one strategy will have you feeling like [Franklin Saint from Snowfall](https://imgur.com/a/AA6HCTC) when he realized he was finally going to be rich. I created a handful of videos showing my customer’s results and blasted them all over social media, email and everywhere else my potential customers hangout. [Watch my Snowfall.](https://imgur.com/a/vuippBK)

# Community

If I can’t first build a community of people who trust me, then I won’t build a business. I want to be the [Pied Piper ](https://imgur.com/a/l554zQ5)for customers who desperately have a problem and money to solve it. My community has been ROI positive from day one and is the gift that keeps on giving. These fans know I have their best interest at heart, so they follow me. [Click to see me build a community that makes me thousands of dollars every month.](https://imgur.com/a/KLvLgHv)

# Sales

So far I’ve been talking about how to generate demos for my sales team. But demos don’t matter without a way to turn them into money. We created a simple playbook. No fancy scripts. No phony salesmanship. Just a simple process on what happens when we get a new lead. This isn’t as hard as you think. It just takes a little time and a lot of heart. [Click to see our sales playbook. ](https://imgur.com/a/mv7nhK2)

# Raise prices + annual deals

We started with a single $200/month price point. We left so much money on the table that I still cry every time I think about it. The best thing we’ve done is increase our price and start selling annual deals. Now we have customers who pay us as little as $300/month and as much as $70,000/year. Same product. Different prices. More money. [Click to see the evolution of our pricing strategy.](https://imgur.com/a/OrYgvQi)

# Takeaway

Okay folks, here’s the hard truth: I’m a country boy from the backwoods of Alabama. I was born without marketing knowledge, product knowledge, or sales knowledge. I’ve never studied business or design at fancy schools. I run a technology startup, but I’ve never written a single line of code.

I’ve learned everything from free YouTube videos, $5 books/courses, and expensive mistakes.

If I can do this, then you can too. (Read that last sentence again). I’m just a guy. I work hard, I'm smart, and I learn from my mistakes. But at the end of the day...I’m just a guy from the backwoods of Alabama.

Success leaves clues. There is no reason you can’t copy my work and tailor them for your own business. There is nothing new under the sun, you just have to make it fit your business.

**The companies that made this happen**

* Zapier (Automate all my workflows and send leads to hundreds of places)
* Active Campaign (Best email marketing software IMHO)
* Loom (Before I write anything I think “can I create a video”. If so, I use Loom)
* Webflow (Build a beautiful website with zero code. Tons of templates.)
* Group Leads (Add FB Group members to a spreadsheet. #LifeSaver)
* Twilio (Expensive, but reliable text and calls)
* Calendly (Set demos with my sales team)
* Design Pickle (Affordable, awesome design. Priceless)
* Lightshot (Capture screenshots of results I get for clients)
* Chargebee (Subscription management that makes Stripe easier to work with)
* Stripe (Say it with me, “Show me the money”)
* Trello (Manage all my tasks)
* Zoom (Demos all day baby)
* Pipedrive (Good CRM, needs more integrations)
* LuckyOrange (See what are folks doing on my website in real-time)

Congrats homie! You have reached the end, and now it’s time for the next level.

**This is where my case study ends!**

But keep reading if you want to go further into the Matrix and know the intangibles it takes to win. So far we’ve talked strategy and tactics. Sadly, that’s only 20% of the game.

Right now you’re Mario, but you want to be Super Mario flying through the air and throwing fireballs.

No worries, homie. I got you.

# How to win

## Focus

The things I focus on almost always get done. The hard part is figuring out what is important enough to focus on. I made this post because I wanted to share what I focus on to achieve success and give you a ski lift. Success leaves clues so just copy me.

## Personal relationships

It’s hard to do important work by yourself. Your job is to build a solid team and great partnerships. I love working with smart people. Don’t be the guy who sits in your basement working all day only to realize later in life your nerdy neighbor had the missing piece to your puzzle.

## Market > product

The number one thing I need to have a thriving restaurant is a starving crowd. Most folks spend their entire life savings making the perfect burger (product) only to discover customers (market) aren’t hungry. That’s Hustlin’ Backwards man. You can easily figure out what people are searching (Google), watching (YouTube), buying (Amazon), and sharing (BuzzSumo) in 20 minutes while watching Law & Order SVU reruns.

## Build a community

The best way to launch your product is to a group of people who know, like and trust you. This is hard work, but it’s worth it, bro. Give people value. Build influence. Grow your fan base. Everything else takes care of itself.

## Track your results

I measure the 3-5 most important things in my business. Then I ask myself, “how can I improve my metrics?”. The answers to that question results in my to-do list. That helps me focus. Focus is my superpower.

## Data > opinions

I don’t care what any **one** **person thinks**. I focus on what sizable groups of potential **customers do**. *Did you catch that?* I focus on what they *do rather than what they think or say*. People will often tell you one thing and do something entirely different. Screw your opinion. I set up experiments, collect data, measure results, and take action.

## Asymmetric risk/rewards

Ray Dalio, Jack Bogle, Jeff Bezos, and other folks I study all basically say the same thing: take affordable risks and look for outsized returns. With a 5:1 return, you can screw up four times and still break even with one winner. I like those odds.

## Partnerships

Partnerships are great, but they’re only worth pursuing after you’ve had some success. That’s true because people don’t really want to help you, they want to help themselves. And when you’re not successful it’s hard for them to see how working with you is going to help them. The more successful you are, the easier it is to land a partnership that skyrockets your success.

# My final thoughts

## Don’t take it personally

Most people aren’t going to support you. In fact, they’re probably going to hate and try to tear you down. Don’t take this personally. And don’t waste your energy by getting mad or upset. It’s not their job to believe in you, that’s your job, my friend. Become successful and then make a post like this one to help them out.

## You are the enemy

I’m literally giving the playbook and I’ll be around to answer questions in the comments. But most people haven’t read this far, and they won’t ask questions, and they won’t take action. Instead, they’re learning how to design their own logo using Sketch.

## Take massive action

Getting an LLC, designing a pretty logo, hunting for the perfect domain name, doing years of market research, overthinking your next move, listening to haters/trolls, etc are all reasons people never take action and ultimately fail.

## Be humble. Be confident.

Don’t be overconfident and think you have all the answers. In the same breath, believe in yourself and don’t over-optimize for someone else's opinion all the time. Collect your own data with small experiments/tests and take it from there.

## Be positive

I don’t want to get all Tony Robbins on you man, but YOU REALLY CAN DO THIS. It’s hard work. Sometimes it sucks (like, really sucks). The more successful you become, the more haters you get. Hobbies are lost, friendships fade.

But the good outweighs the bad by 1,000,000 to 1. So trust me, you got it. And if you need help then I got you.

If you’re ever in doubt then refer back to this post because this is your **Ski Lift**, so go make it **SnowFall.**

I hoped this post gave you the confidence and energy needed to get to work.

Hi Benny
 
Thank you for your email.
 
As you will know, King.com Ltd develops and produces online, social and mobile games, including the hugely successful “Candy Crush Saga” game.  In addition, King owns the trade mark CANDY (CTM 011538147), which covers for example ""online gaming, interactive poker, online gambling services; casino services; casino services delivered via the Internet"" in class 41. 
Your use of CANDY SLOTS in your app icon uses our CANDY trade mark exactly, for identical goods, which amounts to trade mark infringement and is likely to lead to consumer confusion and damage to our brand. The addition of only the descriptive term ""SLOTS"" does nothing to lessen the likelihood of confusion. You will appreciate that we need to take action where our marks are being used without our consent, with the consequent risk of our marks becoming diluted or damaged in any way or consumers believing that the goods originate from or are otherwise endorsed or approved by us. 
 
We understand that you might not have been aware that this was an infringement.  Now that you are aware of your infringements, please amend the name of your App accordingly.
 
We are aware that there are many games on the app store with CANDY in the name, this is largely due to the popularity of our game Candy Crush Saga. We review each of these apps in turn and take action where necessary. 
 
I hope this helps to answer your questions.
 
We reserve all rights.
 
Kind regards

After realizing i have no choice but to change it, cause getting a lawyer would be a waste of time and money, i sent back this reply. 

-------------------

Dear Sophie and King.com LTD,

After much thinking about my options, I have complied with your request to remove the word CANDY from my little iPad and iPhone app originally called “All Candy Casino Slots”. I am just now waiting for the review team at Apple to approve my new version. I have been approved for an expedited review since this is a legal matter that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. 

In it’s short life, I apologize for any confusion my app may have caused for other people because it had the word “candy”. Maybe they wondered why it looked and played nothing like Candy Crush Saga. The app was only released for less than a week so the damage on your brand was minimal. 

Clearly I meant no harm when I created the game name. Just searching the word “candy” in the App Store is like visiting Willy Wonka’s Chocolate factory. Candy here, candy there, candy everywhere. It’s all the candy you want, but with no calories or fat. 

I certainly wouldn’t want customers to confuse my app with your ginormous popular global game. It’s so popular that the word “candy” could cause some confusion in real life too. I’m sure when little kids say “I want candy”, parents are confused if they are talking about playing Candy Crush or eating actual pieces of candy. 

Just a few years ago, parents would clearly know what they wanted. How times quickly have changed. 

I never thought my app would be confused with Candy Crush in the least bit. It was not my intent. I’ll place blame on my bad sweet tooth for wanting to create a candy themed game. My growing waistline is proof of that.

I did not want to mislead the 1,524 people that have downloaded my app (compared to your half a billion and counting). I can only imagine the confusion from the person in each of these countries: Jordan, Slovenia, Suriname, Lebanon, Egypt, Nepal, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka, Peru, Saint Lucia, and Mongolia. Likely they were eager to play Candy Crush after seeing their grandmother request for more lives on Facebook.

I’m sure after they downloaded my game, they were very confused and wondered where the color bombs, wrapped candy, and the sweet sounding male voice saying  “sweet!”, “tasty!”, and “delicious!” were. I did not mean to confuse them, but hope now they will get to have the pleasure of the words “sugar crush” stuck in their heads after downloading Candy Crush. 

Just like your company, I am a person who creates games for people to enjoy. Sometimes played while on a bad first date, procrastinating from studying, bored at work, or sitting on the toilet. 

I hope we can get back to the main focus, which is making games for these group of people. Therefore, no more confusing candy games from me moving forward. 

Sincerely, 

Benny Hsu

157,b76d01,False,,210,Yelp tried to strong arm us today,Entrepreneur,"I wanted to share a recent interaction I had with a Yelp sales agent, a cautionary tale. I haven’t seen it documented on this sub so I thought I’d share my experience. If this is a repeat, my apologies for the repost.

The dark side of Yelp is pretty well documented; filtering positive reviews and moving negative reviews to the fore if you don’t advertise. I am a co-owner of a small business and shortly after we stopped advertising 2/3rd of our 5 star reviews vanished overnight. We were annoyed initially but figured it wasn’t worth raging against the machine.  Today a pushy, condescending Yelp sales rep called my business partner to sell advertising under the guise of compliance and a threat.  For some background, I handle the business side of things. I have 20+ years of business and negotiating experience working previously for a fortune 500 company. My business partner supplies the craft. She’s an artisan and amazing at what she does.  But she’s not a negotiator. She called me today distraught about the call she received from the Yelp rep. I later called the rep back and he pitched me the same nonsense.

He led with a flowery pitch in an attempt to confuse me. He said Yelp had an “obligation to the public” and that I need to log into my account immediately. He said there were 21,000 people who accessed our profile but didn’t convert because we didn’t enable something on our account. Mind you, there’s no way 21,000 visited our page. He spoke with urgent haste, was pushy, and implied that we were stupid for not enabling this feature. I asked him what he selling. He was taken back, as if surprised I figured out he was trying to sell something (go figure).  He reluctantly said advertising.  I told him I wasn't interested and he hung up. Now he didn’t get to try this bullshit on me, but he told my business partner earlier that if she didn’t oblige that he would have to do something to her account/profile. It was a threat.

771,5sdxji,False,,184,Why + How to ACTUALLY grow your instagram following (without using spammy bots),Entrepreneur,"Social media manager here...


So there was this controversial post this weekend on how to use bots + automation to automatically leave spammy comments on people’s instagram posts in order to get on their radar and have them follow you back.

If you’re interested in just increasing the number of followers and you don’t care about quality or actually using Instagram to grow your business… then that’s what you should be doing. If you DO care about building a tribe of potential customers (leads) and not be perceived as this spammy company that leaves fakes comments here and there, here’s exactly how I’ve been helping small businesses get more customers through Instagram:


**1. Post unique content, every day**

Research content on sites like Buzzsumo, Pinterest etc. to get ideas for the type of posts that work well within your niche. Use Photoshop or other graphic design software to create unique images. Brand is key on Instagram. You don’t want to be perceived as this crappy & spammy company with low quality posts. Play around with short Videos/Gifs once in a while and create unique content. Be consistent and post something *every day!*


**2. Follow relevant accounts**

To get on the radar of leads/future customers, you need to be proactive. Instead of randomly commenting on people’s posts, find influencers in your niche and start manually following their followers. Look at the people that are actively commenting/liking the type of content that's related to your business. Follow these people and a good chunk of them will follow you back. This is how you effectively build an efficient following.


**3. Why should I care about Instagram and posting stuff every day?**

One client of mine already had around 1500 customers when I started managing their Instagram Account. The problem was, they weren’t consistent in publishing content. Twice a month, sometimes 3 or 4 times a month… Why should you post every day? Because the more you post, the more interaction moments you create with potential customers. So when I started creating content for them every day, not only was I growing their follower base but more people started reaching out via comments, asking about the particular service they are offering. So by being on the radar of people, every-single-day (by sharing VALUABLE & UNIQUE content), you create more opportunities for your business to get noticed. This leads to more people wanting to know more about your business.  So while I was creating this consistent stream of output for them, they were getting more people asking specific questions about delivery, pricing, etc. Allowing them to spend their time getting new customers on board.

-

So for small businesses out there who already have a working product/service. Get started with just these steps. Create a consistent flow of output. Stick with it, and you'll start to understand the power of Instagram & social media in general.

703,279mzw,False,Case Study,67,How I developed social skills. Hope this is helpful for socially awkward entrepreneurs.,Entrepreneur,"I've been trying to think of a way to contribute content for this sub, so I wrote a post, hope it's helpful!

It's recently come to my attention that I'm no longer considered ""socially awkward."" When I tell people I've met in the last year that I'm socially awkward, they emphatically disagree. This was a huge accomplishment for me personally and my desire is to provide any insight to those who still consider themselves ""socially awkward."" I made it in list form for easy digestion.

To preface the list, I want to point out a really amazing mental framework for social situations. This framework sees life as a play. This play has actors, scripts, props and sets. Everyone is an actor. Everyone has scripts. Everyone uses props and wherever you are is the set. Much of being socially awkward comes from not knowing which scripts, and/or props to use in any given set. Realize that you can learn the scripts and get the props to play your part however you want. This is something that social engineers have understood for a long time, and it [can get you very far.](http://mitnicksecurity.com/media/CSC-Testimonial.pdf)

Once you understand this, here are the things I do on a daily basis to not be socially awkward and still express myself:

______________________________________________________________________________________________
1. **Care a lot about changing.** Yeah, you have to care about changing and getting better. You CAN change. Social skills can be learned. There is no doubt in my mind. But first you must care.

2. **Study body language.** This one for me was huge. Understand both how your body language affects you and others and you are a step closer to understanding other's body language. [This TED talk by Amy Cuddy really changed my life.](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are) Power posing has helped me so much.

3. **Reflect on your outward appearance.** In other words, [get your props in order.](http://ocw.nd.edu/sociology/introduction-to-social-psychology/eduCommons/sociology/introduction-to-social-psychology/lectures/class-impression-management) When I was younger, I was of the mindset that clothes, hairstyle, etc were irrelevant. They're not. Remember, props! People treat me so much differently since I have started dressing more nicely. (If you think you don't have the money to have style get your butt to a thrift store. I go to the Goodwill almost every other day for 10 minutes to check for vests, shoes or nice sport coats.)

4. **Exercise and meditate.** Both of these things, in conjunction with one another have helped me enormously. Not only in my battle with social normalcy, but they also help me keep my depression at bay. I cannot recommend these two things highly enough. I won't prescribe any single method of either for you, but do some exercise and meditate in whatever way you find works for you. You will be glad you did. [Start here if you need inspiration.](http://tinybuddha.com/blog/8-ways-to-make-meditation-easy-and-fun/)

5. **Observe carefully.** This one comes in handy for many reasons. Not only is it a great way to see how others are reacting to you, but genuinely listening and observing conversation, without being lost in your own thoughts, will do wonders. [Something like this.](http://www.wikihow.com/Observe-People) Watch. Ask questions. Listen carefully. People love to talk about themselves. People love to feel heard. If you are really listening, you will be surprised what you find.

6. **Strive to be the best version of yourself.** This one started as ""be yourself"" but that's not quite true. You don't want to just be yourself, you want to be the best version of yourself. Reflect on what the best version of yourself acts like. What do they dress like? How do they talk with people? What do they do? It's not a lie to practice being your ideal self, heck, you'll probably find you don't even really know what your ideal self is like until you start trying to act like them. In this regard, I highly recommend watching [this interview with Bruce Lee.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRcgk-Avj7c) There is a LOT of insight into how to do this.

7. **Practice, practice, practice.** This might be the most important one. [Push your comfort zone.](http://sethsandler.com/productivity/3-zones/) You will need to push your comfort zone. You have to practice all of this stuff. I started small. I would set small goals for myself and work from there . For instance, while walking down the street, make eye contact with strangers and give them a smile (you might want to practice your smile in front of a mirror.) Make it a goal to strike up small-talk with the cashier at the store, or your hairdresser, everyone. The more the better. When you start doing this often, it will become easier. Your comfort zone will expand. You will learn and grow.

8. **Be confident.** Nobody can give this to you. You have to make it. Confidence comes from within. I saw this video somewhere on Reddit from [Oren Klaff about pitching, it had some of the best insight for confidence I've seen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXavS_IY42A) For me, confidence came from being tested. Waking up every day for weeks, sad, crying, depressed and working out of it through my own efforts has given me confidence. Finishing college also gave me some confidence in myself. Honestly though, this one is a daily battle between the negative self-talk. It gets easier over time, I think. [This TED talk has helped me with confidence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-HYZv6HzAs)

Edit: I'm so happy this was so well received. Ya'll can be a tough crowd so I was nervous. I also forgot one TED talk about stress (this one helps me with pushing my comfort zone) [Kelly McGonigal on making stress your friend.](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend)

You can download all of them in one RAR file by following this [Bandcamp](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/releases) link.

**What's the total size of the library and in which format do they come in?**

Total file size varies in format. You can download the songs in MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, ALAC, WAV and AIFF formats. If you'd like to download the songs in MP3 format, the total file size would be 488MB. If you'd want to go with WAV format, then the total size would be 3.2 GB.

**What about the license? (CC BY 4.0)**

You can use any song in this library in anyway you want, be it as a sound effect in your game or as a background music in one of your Youtube & Twitch videos, even commercially. If you'd like to find more information about the license, please check this [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) link. Providing an appropriate credit (Either Composed by [onemansymphony.bandcamp.com](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com) or patreon.com/onemansymphony) is required.

**Can I remix the songs in the library?**

As long as you provide an appropriate credit to the original album, you can do whatever you want to do with them.

**What is the future of this library? How can I support it?**

I'm planning to expand this library's content as much as possible, and doing so takes a great amount of time, and calls for new virtual instruments and tools to create songs in rich and different sound. My current goal is to keep adding more songs in different genres into this library as well as creating environmental sound effects in high quality. Due to this reason, I created a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/onemansymphony) page if you'd like to support this project. By becoming a Patron, **you'll get access to the loop files, bonus and alternative songs and sound effects** that are not included in the public library hosted on Bandcamp.

**Are these songs loopable?**

Almost every single song in the album (with a few exceptions here and there) is loopable. While producing these songs, I always paid extra attention to make them as loopable as possible since some users would like to break a song into seperate pieces and just want to use that specific section of the song in their projects, and some people might like to extend a specific part of the song for adaptive sound design purposes. I am very well aware of that modern video games call for an application of adaptive sound design. A song which is made of different sections should be easily loopable & cuttable and any section of the song should be easily extandable. And whenever a transition occurs, it should sound as smooth as possible. These were the things that I kept in my mind while composing these pieces. If you'd like to create your own loop files out of these songs, you can use a free software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to do so and refer to its [manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/) to learn more about how looping is done. If you don't want to spend your time with the process of looping, you can subscribe to my $1 tier on Patreon where you can get access to the loop files of the songs in the library.

**Is this album updated regularly?**

Yes! Whenever I add a new song or sound effect to the library, I announce it on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onemansymphony). I would suggest checking the tweets or the album page regularly if you're in need of new music frequently.

378,ducmx4,False,Best Practices,103,A really detailed guide to writing high performing Facebook ads,Entrepreneur,"The ad creative itself is - apart from product and audience - **the biggest single differentiator in determining whether** **your ad will make sales or not**, and is also the difference between making a click or not. 

To help you out with creating your ads, here is a list of important and specific principles that will mean you have a much better chance of performing better with them, based off my own experiences and also the experiences of many other digital ads agencies. 

Fundamentally: what sort of ads would have persuaded you? Those are the types that you should aim for.

I apologise in advance if some of this following guide is a bit abstract in nature. Unfortunately - unlike [interpreting Facebook ad metrics well](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/ds2ovu/the_ultimate_guide_to_facebook_ads_interpretation/) or [having a whole bunch of profitable plugins with objective ROI numbers to talk about](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsri50/my_list_of_most_profitable_plugins_on_my_shopify/), the creation of ad creatives is a very subjective topic and just requires looking at other people's ads to begin with. You can do that with paid tools or you can just find competitors you respect and see their ads at [facebook.com/ads/library](https://facebook.com/ads/library). 

Luckily, testing ad creatives and knowing which ones are actually performing well is a lot easier as there's some harder numbers there - just look for high CTR (&gt;1%), low CPC (&gt;$1), and whether there's actually any purchases above breakeven point. 

# 1. What's something immediately valuable I should know right now? 

**User generated content** (UGC) is far and away performing better universally for almost *everyone* with a reasonably successful store. Although you could spend a tonne on professional video ads, *don't.* **People are regularly disappointed by how much better UGC performs, since they spend so much more on that professional stuff.** The more native to the platform you're using, the more likely it will be a successful ad. 

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, this means trying to get videos from people that have purchased your product before. **You can repurpose all of your reviews (or Instagram influencer videos if you have any) for your ads,** with permission of course. 

Fundamentally, UGC works at all stages of the funnel. 

# 2. Is it the right ad for the right part of the funnel? 

As I talk about in [another post I wrote about funnels](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/comments/dsisc9/how_understanding_funnels_well_allows_you_to_ad/), your audience exists some part of the customer journey, but both your ad copy and image/video need to hit the right audience at the *right time.* Your ads to cold traffic should look quite different to your ads to warm traffic. 

To get more specific on what this looks like and the kinds of ads that work: 

* **Cold traffic ads** (TOFU): 
   * Needs to focus on branding, trust elements, attention-grabbing ads, and social proofing to enhance your credibility
   * If you have products that are selling really well, focus on your winners  
   * Things like single image link posts and video posts work really well 
   * Whilst collections/carousels etc. can work (and I've had them work before), I'd personally save it for MOFU/BOFU parts of the funnel 
* **Engaged audience** (MOFU)**:** 
   * Images/videos will work here too
   * However carousels/collection ads will be the new type of ad creative to include here, now that there's some familiarity, allowing your customer to really dive deep and browse your catalog more 
   * You can also start to really focus on showing **more content that shows people using your product in real life** (i.e. UGC). 
   * **Testimonials also work really well here.** 
* **Warm audience** (BOFU): 
   * Testimonials perform especially well here 
   * Discounts also perform well
   * You can combine both of these together 
   * *Dynamic creatives* that directly call out your product name from your catalog often result in a significant increase in ROAS here too 

# 3. What sort of ad copy should I write? 

The best ad copy (writing) doesn't necessarily do all of the following elements, but will almost always have at least some of them: 

* **The words you use in your ads match the words that your customers are using.** If you're new to the game, here's my pro tip: look at the reviews on Amazon of your competitors, see what specific words people are using to rave about those products, and then take some of those words and use them. 
* **Your ad calls out your customer demographic.** Most likely it's the way they like to be identified, too. So for example, if you do yoga, an ad saying ""Yogis everywhere are raving about this new fitness gear from \_"" will be more appealing than simply saying you have some new clothes in stock. **Relevancy is key.** 
   * Note that you should be careful not to go *too* overboard with this. There's no everlasting consequences from it but Facebook will disapprove ads that ""assume a customer's condition"" e.g. if you start an ad with ""Feeling sore?"" then Facebook might actually not approve that ad. 
* **Does this product solve a problem for the customer?** Call out the problem directly. 

In terms of some more specific nitty gritty details: 

* **Varying lengths all work - no particular magic here.** I've seen two liners work, full paragraphs work, and extremely long 10 paragraph copy all work for separate products. Match it to your customer and the product. 
* Stuff like emojis and links are tricks - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but they're not universal. I've had ads perform with and without them. 

# 4. What sort of images/video/creative should I use? 

* **NOT overly professional ones.** Again, I'd like to super re-emphasize that you want UGC, *not* overdone stuff. Even if it's not actually user generated content, it should look like it. **The basic rule is: if it looks like it was shot on an iPhone and looks like it's appropriate for Instagram, then this is the right quality of image/video.**
* **Make the product at least 1/2 of the image.** It's silly to make a random coffee cup sized proportionally more than your product itself, and it does play out in terms of how well your ads perform. 
* For certain products, a bold splash of color will sometimes make a big difference. 
* For videos: fundamentally good ones are made of: 
   * An attention grabbing opening (split test these) 
   * Real usage of the product from real customers ideally 
   * Doesn't look like you're dropshipping from Aliexpress (...no matter how true that statement may or not be)  
   * They can be square or 4:5 aspect ratio, both of these work well 
* Ideas include: 
   * Testimonials
   * Demonstrations of the product 
   * GIFs showcasing your best performing *single image* creatives, all mashed together into a two frame image (powerfully simple) 
* Anecdotally, *no buttons* on a link post seem to perform better than having e.g. a 'Shop Now' button on a link post. I've only heard this from friends and haven't tested super extensively however. 
* **If using Instagram stories, make sure you're using an ad created specifically for it.** 

# 5. How much should I spend on my ads? 

This is actually a pretty tough question. 

You should generally try to have a 50x average order value worth of ad spend for a month, as a very very general rule - so for example. if your product makes you $20, then have an expectation to spend $1,000 in the month. If you don't have this kind of money, you *can* get away with less (e.g. $500), but the lower you go the lower your chance of finding a successful ad creative in time. 

Another way to think about this is to roughly spend about two times your baseline cost per acquisition per day. For example, if it usually costs you about $10 to acquire a customer through other means, then you might try to spend $20/day on Facebook ads. 

Unfortunately, it's just about rolling the dice enough times till you hit the one that really wins for you, with your money directly being the number of dice you can roll. 

That said, in terms of how you actually *run* the individual campaigns, that's a whole other topic in itself. But to keep it in general terms, you'd run some fairly low budget ad sets (e.g. $5/day) to individual ad sets in Purchase conversion campaigns, and then see what's working and what's not and do some intense optimisation from there. 

When it's working properly, it's not subtle, but actually fairly obvious. 

# Conclusion

If you read through this whole thing, you'll be miles ahead of quite a big proportion of other people doing eCommerce, or at the very least have a little bit more of a systematic approach to how you approach making Facebook ads. 

You may have read some of my previous posts before (as I particularly post a lot to /r/Shopify). 

If you like this sort of thing I'd like to be transparent and plug [this guide I wrote about an A-Z approach to Facebook marketing](https://fbadsblueprint.carrd.co/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=content_marketing&amp;utm_term=%2Fr%2Fentrepreneur). **If you've ever wondered about what types of audiences to target, how much to spend per ad set, what sort of ad creatives work best, and those sorts of questions - then this is pretty much my brain dump to all of the above question after spending thousands on Facebook ads myself.** 

However, once again, *I've tried to make this post as valuable as possible without holding back anything.*

966,787ic2,False,How to Grow,98,How To Grow Any Instagram Account [Complete Guide],Entrepreneur,"So, A week back I made a post about **Growing Instagram account** in any niche. The response was amazing and also got a lot of queries, So I taught I I'll make an extended post with more information. This will surely help any business/social media manager/individual etc who is looking to grow their Instagram account. If Instagram is one of your marketing channel then growing it in the right way is very important, there are tons of services offering so called 'organic growth' solutions which I highly suspect to be the case. So, I will share with you some methodology/tips/tricks using which any Instagram account can be grown.

I have divided the guide into phases corresponding to which I have explained the strategies you can try. This is from my experience of growing accounts for almost 2 years now. I am not saying this is the only way to grow accounts but this has worked for me time and again, so without further ado let's get started!

**INITIAL PHASE (0-10K Followers)**

So the baby is just born and it is time to nurture it, 

Find a neat profile image and an awesome description is very important because that is all you have to show off when you begin. Then also post 4-6 images and you are good to go.


**Growing the Baby**


Make a list of 5-10 huge accounts in your niche(100k+ Ideally)


1.Follow them and keep notifications on so that you get notified when they make a post.


2.Since they are big accounts they tend to get tons of likes in first few minutes.


3.Go to the list of people who have liked their recent picture and follow them!


4.These people get a notification, they tend to come to your profile and check it out(this why having a neat bio is imp) and if they like it they follow you back, Voila!


5.Rinse and repeat the process to get the first big push.

Do this until you reach 10k Followers, Depending on your niche this may take anywhere between 4-10 months. Now, Congratulate yourself because your baby is a teenager now!

**Tips**


1)Many of them asked which app do I use for scheduling posts, I know hootsuite is considered to be the best but my problem with them is they do not post it for us but only remind us. So, I use Gramblr as all I have to do is schedule posts and make sure the PC is on during the posting times. The disadvantages are that we have to login to Instagram and also there is no app version for this.

2) Myth : Use Hastags to grow! Please do not use hashtags when your account is so small. The whole point of using hashtags is that your post will make it to the top of those hashtags which is highly unlikely since your account is so small, in return you end up getting fake likes and followers because most of the bots will be configured to follow users who use 'x' hashtags. This will degrade the Quality of your account.

**TEENAGER PHASE(10-20K)**

Now the baby is a Teenager and you can try more things. 

1.Continue Follow/Unfollow but you can reduce the number of follows you do at once. May be instead of following 6k people reduce it to 3K and do it in two cycles.

2.Start Looking for accounts in your niche with the same following as you and frorm a group. This is called as engagement groups, but I advice you to only like each others pictures just to give it a push. Do not start commenting yet because it will start looking spammy. Do it at a later stage, for now this group must only focus on liking each others pictures. 

3.Start using hashtags now because now atleast you have considerable amount of following and the probability of your post getting into explore page is high (Because of the engagement activity)

**ADULT PHASE (20-30K)**

By now I am sure you would have formed a good network of like minded accounts. Continue the Group engagement activity and also start occasional comments activity (Allot random days for commenting), Please do not do it everyday because it will look spammy.

You can also start contacting pages with 100k+ followings and ask them to like your picture as soon as you post them. This will give you boost and there have been instances where I have got 200-300 followers in hours because of this. But finding accounts who would do it for free is the though task. This concept is called as power likes. 


**CONCLUSION**
This pretty much sums up the complete guide, I know you will have many questions about this which is why this thread can be AMA types. Feel free get all your doubts cleared before building your accounts! I would love to add more content and make it more structured, if I see a good response again I may consider making a very detailed blog post on this! Waiting to hear from all the entrepreneurs! Lets keep crushing ! :)

1. I was in a crap mood yesterday and seeing the positive responses from everybody helped to raise my spirits, so thank you for that. Glad to see that this resonated with so many of you!
2. A handful of people are mentioning the value of MVPs as a counterargument, but I think those people are misinterpreting the sentiment behind this post. Moving slowly and building an MVP are not mutually exclusive concepts. I just mean to say that one's life circumstances and personal balance might result in slow-moving development of an idea. This relatively slow movement could indeed be directed toward an MVP. Indeed, perfection is the enemy of progress.
3. That said, while I agree with the motivation behind MVPs I think the concept is a bit flawed.

174,d936xz,False,Best Practices,245,Dear Entrepreneurs: You need to charge more money,Entrepreneur,"You're over at a friends house for dinner, and they pull out a bottle of red wine.

They discovered it at a local vineyard while on holiday.

It's delicious. Velvety smooth with a balanced flavor.

So delicious that you want to buy a bottle for yourself[.](https://imgur.com/a/972M5fG)

You pull out your phone to order online, thinking that it'll cost about $40-50.

But after a quick search online you see that the price is only $8.99.

Before hitting the 'Add to Cart' button you refill your glass and take another sip.

Hmmmm.

Come to think of it, there's a bitter aftertaste that you missed before... and you decide not to buy.

**This experience of price influencing our perception is** **VERY** **common.**

We're primed to think that a higher price equals better quality.

A [study at Standford University](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2008/january16/wine-011608.html) even confirmed this effect on wine drinkers. Increasing the price on the bottle made it taste better.

It's a powerful effect, with many studies backing it up.

One of the most [interesting studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5533658_Commercial_Features_of_Placebo_and_Therapeutic_Efficacy) comes from Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational)...

82 participants received two small electric shocks. One before taking a pain killer and one after.

**In group 1**, they told them the pain killer cost 10c, and they reported less pain 61% of the time.

**In group 2**, they told them the pain killer cost $2.50, and they reported less pain 85% of the time.

But the twist was that both pain killers were actually *placebos*.

The reduced pain was all in their head.

So a high priced placebo reduces pain way more than the cheap one. This highlights the powerful link between price and perceived quality.

**Since we relate price with quality, it has profound implications on your pricing strategy...**

It's important to remember that true market value has very little to do with how clients judge your price.

It's all about *perceived value*.

If you can solve a big problem for your clients, then the perceived value is very high, and *you need to charge a high price*.

As long as you can show the value in your service (how much time, money, or pain you save) then a high price actually makes you *more* desirable.

**The importance of doing this cannot be overstated...**

Higher prices makes your services more desirable.

You'll attract better quality clients that *appreciate* and *value* your work.

This leads to better testimonials and reviews, more referrals and sales, and a flourishing business.

You'll be happier, less stressed, and able to reinvest your time and energy back into the business.

On the other hand...

Lower prices means you're competing on price, not quality. Your service has now become a commodity.

You'll attract low quality clients that expect you to work for peanuts while delivering the world.

This leads to bad reviews, less referrals and sales, and a shrinking business.

You'll be more stressed trying to make ends meet, deliver sub-par work as a result, and end up hating your business.

It's a downward death spiral that you do NOT want happening.

**Key Takeaway:** Avoid the temptation to drop your prices to attract more clients. More often than not it's a bad decision. If anything you should be *raising* your prices.

486,cnba47,False,,221,$35k/mo cleaning houses (Former Tech Employee),Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I started my business around March 2018, since day 1 my wife and I decided to make a business out of this, this wasn't just us ""cleaning houses"".  My background was in technology (I worked 10 years as a Network/Computer Engineer and 5 years as a Software Developer) and what really helped me was putting systems in place, even before we had our first client we decided to have the software in place to handle thousands of clients if needed. Every decision we took was based on ""Can we scale this system?"". 

In 2018 we ended up making $150k. We are now in our second year and we will be making $400k+ by the end of 2019.  

We learned a lot during this time:

**Systems**: This is the secret sauce, we created systems for every single action in the business, for example: now every time we hire a new employee we have a system in place to train that employee and making sure that employee follows the system.

**Culture**: Having happy employees is not about money, is about creating culture and a great place for them to work, we are a team, we are all employees.

**Clients**: You need to make sure you know what business you are on. We don't sell cleaning, we sell peace of mind.

We are now in commercial cleaning as well, this has opened a new revenue stream that could take us over the top. I found a passion in helping other business owners get to a comfortable level of success.

I have formatted this post the best I possibly could for Reddit, but it is still has a ton of images and reads a lot smoother on my site. I am not selling anything and have nothing to gain by having you read this on my site or here on Reddit. So if you want to read this article on my site you can do so [here](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/website-investment-6-month-update)

&nbsp;

##Intro##

I’m back with the 6 month update on how the $6,000 website investment has gone so far. You will see that things are going very well and it has provided an awesome ROI for both me and my parents. Before I give you all the fresh update, make sure to catch up on the previous two updates below:

&nbsp;

 - [I Just Bought a Website for $6k; Here’s Why](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/i-just-bought-a-website-for-6k-heres-why)
&nbsp;
 - [The 3 Month Update](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/3-month-update-on-my-6000-website-investment/)

&nbsp;

I would suggest reading those two updates if you haven’t already so that you can fully understand everything that I will be talking about in this update. However, for those of you who don't have time to read through the first 2 updates I will quickly recap everything for you below.

&nbsp;

##Quick Recap##

I have been building/buying/growing/selling websites for the past ~2 years and my parents have seen the ROI that websites can provide and were willing to test buying a website as an investment strategy. I found a website making $500/month and I purchased it for $6,000. The site itself makes money from Google Adsense ads, affiliate links and advertisers that buy ad space. The past 6 months I have been growing the site's traffic and earnings and I have been documenting the process I have been making. That's the gist of it, if you want more details behind it you will need to check out the first 2 updates.

&nbsp;

##What I’ve Done Since the Last Update##

It has been 3 months since the last update and to be honest, I have not done a whole lot to the site since then. I have probably put in about 4-5 hours total per month and most of that time has been emailing advertisers and optimizing adsense. The site itself doesn’t take any work as it will continue to earn at a constant rate due to the content being evergreen, meaning that it will always be relevant and will not age. I did do a couple things in the past 3 months and you can read more about them below:

&nbsp;

**Stopped Producing New Content**

The service that I was previously using to produce content ended up going out of business which left me with a decision to make.

&nbsp;

 - I could either find a new content producer via Upwork and keep the fresh content coming 3 times a week like I have been doing since I took over ownership of the site.
 - I could find a new content producer but, slow down the amount of content from 3 new pieces of content per week to 1 new article per week.
 - Stop paying for new content

&nbsp;

I opted to stop paying for new content so that I could take some time to determine if adding new content had a positive ROI for me. I have let this content sit on the site for 3 months and it is now time to determine if I should keep adding new content or if it is best to stop. I will be diving deeper into the results from this and my decision in a second but, I just wanted to let you know that I stopped adding new content these past 3 months.

&nbsp;

**Continued to Optimize Adsense**

The bulk of this sites earnings comes from Adsense so it is smart for me to keep testing and optimizing to find the ads that perform the best. Up until recently, I have been manually testing different ad placements and it has been a real pain in the butt to make changes and to determine what changes led to the most earnings. I was using 3 different plugins to get the ads where I wanted them to be on the site and I was unable to fully optimize the ads for mobile users. This was leaving a lot of money on the table because a good chunk of the sites visitors come via mobile.

&nbsp;

Luckily, I came across a sweet plugin that allows me to test different ad layouts and keeps the stats for each layout so that I am able to determine which one makes the most money. This plugin is called AmpedSense. The owner of the plugin actually helped me setup the plugin on my site and has been super helpful, great guy as well! Take a look at the screenshot below that shows the stats for a couple different ad layouts that I have been testing on the site:

&nbsp;

Stats from Different Adsense Layouts - [http://imgur.com/TFba3mK](http://imgur.com/TFba3mK)

&nbsp;

It gives you all of the stats that are important and in an easy to read fashion. I have only been using this plugin for around 3 weeks and I am excited to see how much I am able to increase the earnings over a longer period of time. One area that this plugin has helped tremendously is for showing ads for mobile users. Take a look at the stats for the ads that are shown to mobile users. The “Baseline” layout was what my site was originally showing before using the plugin:

&nbsp;

Adsense Improvement for Mobile Visitors - [http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX](http://imgur.com/qn5wrSX)

&nbsp;

Ignore the total earnings because the majority of it is from February but, I want you to see the improvements across the board with the new ad layouts. The CTR nearly tripled and the RPM more than doubled. This is HUGE. I’m excited to see how big of an impact this has on the earnings over a month long period. If you are monetizing your site with Adsense and you AREN’T using AmpedSense, you are leaving money on the table. I would highly suggest at least giving it a shot, it’s free!

&nbsp;

##Traffic and Earnings Report##

Let’s see how the site has performed in the last 3 months in terms of traffic and earnings. First, let’s look at the November:

&nbsp;

**November’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of November's Traffic - [http://imgur.com/QQhY945](http://imgur.com/QQhY945)

&nbsp;

A very solid month in terms of the amount of unique users and it was one of the best months since I have owned the site.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The majority of the traffic is still from social media, mainly Pinterest, with direct and organic following it up. Overall, solid month on the traffic side of things and let’s see how this translated into earnings!

&nbsp;

**November’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1](http://imgur.com/xFrD3P1)

&nbsp;

I have to hide all of the data from my Adsense account except I am allowed to show you the amount of earnings it made as well as the date. So in November the site was able to pull in $549.19 from Adsense! Through November, this was my second best month from Adsense.

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/5q26yyX](http://imgur.com/5q26yyX)

&nbsp;

Not a ton of money but, Etsy’s affiliate program made me $64.80 in November!

&nbsp;

Advertisers - Another revenue source is selling banner advertising on the site. I currently have 3 advertisers which add an extra $136 per month to the bottom line.

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in November:

 - Google Adsense: $545.19

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $64.80

&nbsp;

 - Advertising: $136.67

&nbsp;

Total November Earnings: $746.66

&nbsp;

A very good month in terms of earnings and through November, this was my highest earning month yet! Also, since I have stopped paying for content there was no expenses during the month which allowed every cent of the $746.67 earned this month to be all profit. November was my best overall month since I have owned the site. The traffic has increased month over month and it was also my highest earning month. This is awesome to see! However, you will find out that in the next two months the site begins to see even more success.

&nbsp;

**December’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of the Traffic in December - [http://imgur.com/UDISOIY](http://imgur.com/UDISOIY)

&nbsp;

There was close to 40k unique visitors in the month of December, which is slightly down from the previous month. With that being said, still a solid month traffic wise.

&nbsp;

Traffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy](http://imgur.com/JIvtWyy)

&nbsp;

The traffic channels stayed relatively the same since last month but, the organic traffic actually saw some nice growth. Around a 600+ more organic visitors and a 3% increase in the percentage of the total traffic from 16.8% to 19.5% from Organic traffic. This good to see because it means a bigger portion of the website’s traffic is coming from organic searches and is becoming less reliant on social media.

&nbsp;

**December’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings - [http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ](http://imgur.com/FvyjnmZ)

&nbsp;

December saw a decrease in Adsense earnings, although $487.41 is not a bad month by any means!

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W](http://imgur.com/Yln1s0W)

&nbsp;

$55.95 from Etsy! I am super pumped even though it is only 50 bucks because these affiliate links are only on a select few posts where the products make sense to promote.

&nbsp;

Amazon Affiliate - [http://imgur.com/8ouChJs](http://imgur.com/8ouChJs)

&nbsp;

Not much, but an extra $8.65 was earned through the Amazon affiliate program. It all adds up over time.

&nbsp;

Banner Advertisers - Same as last month, an extra $136.67 from the 3 advertisers that pay to have a banner ad on the site. Nothing much else to talk about here.

&nbsp;

Paid Post - I had one person contact me to do a paid post on my site for $50 and I accepted. The content they wrote was good and I made $50, pretty good deal!

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in December:

 - Google Adsense: $487.41

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $55.95

&nbsp;

 - Amazon Affiliate: $8.65

&nbsp;

 - Advertisers: $136.67

&nbsp;

 - Paid Post: $50.00

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in December: $738.68

&nbsp;

Another very good month! Back to back months with over $700 in profits and you will see that the next month was able to continue the trend, more on that below.

&nbsp;

**January’s Traffic Stats**

&nbsp;

Overview of the Traffic in January - [http://imgur.com/3jYn88U](http://imgur.com/3jYn88U)

&nbsp;

January saw a HUGE increase in traffic compared to all of the previous months. With over 54,000 unique visitors in January it made it by far the highest amount of traffic in a month. Let’s look at the traffic channels to see where all of this traffic came from

&nbsp;

Traffic Channels - [http://imgur.com/u58xco2](http://imgur.com/u58xco2)

&nbsp;

You might have been able to guess it. Social media, Pinterest, was what provided the site with a nice increase in traffic this month. It would have been nice to see this increase in traffic from organic search because that would mean the content that I was producing 3 months ago is starting to see some rankings and bring in traffic. Nonetheless, still a nice surge in traffic so let’s check out if this was able to lead to an increase in earnings as well.

&nbsp;

**January’s Earnings**

&nbsp;

Google Adsense - [http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F](http://imgur.com/g9D9K2F)

&nbsp;

That’s what I like to see! $641.85 was made this month via Adsense, which is $100+ higher than any other month.

&nbsp;

Etsy Earnings - [http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI](http://imgur.com/Tp7d8CI)

&nbsp;

A solid $54.50 made from Etsy in January as well, not bad!

&nbsp;

Advertisers - Same thing as the previous months here, $136.67 was made from 3 different advertisers.

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in January:

&nbsp;

 - Google Adsense: $641.85

&nbsp;

 - Etsy Affiliate Program: $54.50

&nbsp;

 - Advertisers: $136.67

&nbsp;

Total Earnings in January: $833.58

&nbsp;

My best month yet! Thanks to the increase in traffic, there was a nice boost in the Adsense earnings which led to the really good month overall. If I am able to keep up this amount of traffic and combine that with my newly optimized Adsense layout thanks to AmpedSense, I should see some higher earning months coming up.

&nbsp;

##The First 3 Months vs. The Last 3 Months##

Now that I have owned the site for 6 months I can now split that time in half and see what kind of growth the site has seen when comparing the first 3 months to the last 3 months. 3 months is a long enough period to get a good idea of whats working and what isn’t. I will also be able to see the areas of most growth and where I could improve. This whole next section of this article will be comparing various stats from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, should be fun :)

&nbsp;

**Overall Traffic**

This is one of the most important metrics to any website and seeing growth month to month is vital to constantly improving the site. Let’s see how the first 3 months of traffic compared to the last 3:

&nbsp;

First 3 Months Traffic vs. Last 3 Months Traffic - [http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz](http://imgur.com/jq6rqHz)

&nbsp;

The image above shows the traffic stats from the first 3 months compared to the last 3 months. You can see that there has been some nice growth. There was a 23.85% increase in unique visitors in the last 3 months, which is a substantial increase! The # of sessions and pageviews also saw a nice boost.

&nbsp;

**Pinterest Traffic**

This is the sites main traffic driver and it accounts for over 50% of the sites traffic since I have gained ownership. I would like to see the site be less dependent on Pinterest for traffic but, nonetheless, it is still driving a ton of traffic each day. Let’s check out the growth it has seen from the first 3 months to the last.

&nbsp;

First 3 months vs last 3 months - [http://imgur.com/kxw076e](http://imgur.com/kxw076e)

&nbsp;

The first 3 months Pinterest drove 67,000 visitors and in the last 3 months it drove over 80,000, which comes out to a 19% increase! One of the major reasons for the increase is due to a handful of the new articles I published that went viral within Pinterest and they continually drive 100+ visitors a day back to the site. Pinterest is different from the rest of the social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook because the content on Pinterest does not get lost in the past. Old posts will continue to drive traffic on Pinterest because people use it as a search engine and popular posts will rank well. This makes Pinterest a very solid traffic source because it isn’t just one-off traffic, it is consistent and will continue to grow if you keep posting on Pinterest.

&nbsp;

**Organic Search Traffic**

Increasing the organic search traffic was a major focus during the first 3 months that I owned the site. I added a total of 42 new articles to the site during that time period and it will be interesting to see how well the organic traffic increased since then.

&nbsp;

First 3 Months vs. Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/hvriZcK](http://imgur.com/hvriZcK)

&nbsp;

There was a solid 33% growth in organic search traffic from the first 3 months to the last 3 months, which is pretty darn good! Organic traffic increased from 18,000 to 24,000, which is about an extra 2,000 visitors per month in the last 3 months. I think the site will continue to see growth over the next 6+ months as well because all of the articles will have enough time to settle into Google and start to rank for longtail keywords. So I would expect the organic traffic to keep rising over the next few months.

&nbsp;

**Keyword Growth**

One of my favorite tools, Semrush, does an awesome job of showing the growth that your site has seen in keyword rankings and how well that translates to traffic. Let’s check out how my site looks in Semrush:

&nbsp;

Traffic Growth via Semrush - [http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP](http://imgur.com/SH2EOWP)

&nbsp;

As you can see, a good surge in traffic growth according to Semrush. Semrush tracks keywords your site ranks for within the top 100 of Google and translates that to search traffic by looking at the monthly search amount. According to Semrush, my traffic grew by 100% but, as we saw earlier it actually grew by only 33%. So Semrush isn’t 100% accurate but I still feel like it does a good job of showing growth.

&nbsp;

**Keyword Rankings**

Like I said, Semrush tracks the amount of keywords that your site ranks for within the top 100 and you can see how many keywords you ranked for 6 months ago vs. now. That is what we will look at now:

&nbsp;

Keyword Rankings 6 Months Ago According to Semrush - [http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P](http://imgur.com/hbyWz5P)

&nbsp;

6 months ago I had just over 4,000 keywords ranking within the top 100 of Google. I feel like the keywords ranking within the top 10 of Google are the most important, so we will mainly look at that number. There were 18 keywords in the top 3 and 192 ranking in the 4-10 positions, which comes out to a total of 210 keywords ranking in the top 10 of Google. Now let’s compare that to my most recent month, which was 6 months later:

&nbsp;

Keyword Rankings in January According to Semrush (6 months later) - [http://imgur.com/W87AfRC](http://imgur.com/W87AfRC)

&nbsp;

6 months later I am ranking for close to 6,000 keywords within Google, which is close to 2,000 MORE than it was 6 months ago. Now let’s look at the top 10 rankings. There are 29 keywords in the top 3 of Google and 212 ranking in the 4-10 position range, which is a total of 241 keywords ranking within the top 10. The site is ranking for 31 more keywords in the top 10 compared to 6 months ago, which is a solid improvement. As you can probably tell, the majority of the keywords are ranking in the ranges of 21-50 position and 51-100 position. These keywords in these ranges don’t bring in a lot of traffic but, they do have the potential to increase in ranking over time. I think the 42 new articles I published on the site have accounted for a lot of the keywords ranking in this range, so I am hoping that after a couple more months they will be able to move up higher.

&nbsp;

**Adsense Earnings**

The Adsense earnings account for the bulk of my site’s earnings and I have also put a huge emphasis on trying to optimize these ads. Let’s take a look at how they have been performing.

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O](http://imgur.com/ZKNlF3O)

&nbsp;

In the first 3 months the site earned $1,333.65 from Adsense, which comes out to $444.55 per month. This isn’t terrible by any means and is still a solid chunk of money each month.

&nbsp;

Adsense Earnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/3U9J12g](http://imgur.com/3U9J12g)

&nbsp;

In the last 3 months the site has earned a total of $1,678.45 from Adsense, this averages out to $559.48 per month! This is a $100+ increase per month which I am really happy about. This growth I think is mainly due to the increase in traffic the site has seen because with Adsense, more traffic = more earnings. However, I am super pumped to see how the earnings grow now that I have been using AmpedSense which has allowed me to fully test different ad layouts. I am thinking that I will be seeing some nice growth over the next few months in terms of Adsense earnings.

&nbsp;

**Total Site Earnings**

One of the most important metrics to track are the earnings and to compare the first 3 months to the last 3 months. This is looking at the earnings from all of the different sources as well.

&nbsp;

Earnings from the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/UGpvEza](http://imgur.com/UGpvEza)

&nbsp;

Feel free to ignore the traffic stats section as it is in the same spreadsheet that I keep my earnings in so it was caught in the screesnhot. However, in the orange box you can see the earnings by each month. There was a total of $1543.61 earned during this period which averages out to $514.54 per month in earnings. Not bad!

&nbsp;

Earnings from the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6](http://imgur.com/xCvaHS6)

&nbsp;

Once again, feel free to ignore the traffic stats and the large black blob. The total earnings for the last 3 months was $2318.92 and that comes out to $772.97 per month! This a large upgrade over the previous 3 months. In the last 3 months, the site was able to generate $775.31 more money and $258.44 more per month! This is some awesome growth and it was from a combination of things, one major reason was that I was able to land some advertisers that added a quick increase in earnings. That combined with the Adsense improvements helped increase the monthly earnings.

&nbsp;

**Total Site Profits**

Profit, by far the most important metric for any business and it’s funny because a lot of people seem to ignore this stat in their business and only look at the revenue. You can have all of the revenue that you want but, if that doesn’t translate to making ACTUAL money what does it matter? So the last thing that we are going to compare is the profit that the site made:

&nbsp;

Profits in the First 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH](http://imgur.com/U7gMrzH)

&nbsp;

There was a good chunk of expenses within the first 3 months since I was paying for content to be written at a pretty rapid pace, which caused there to be a large expense per month for new content. You may or may not noticed but, the profits are a bit higher than I reported in the last update due to my content writer giving me a partial refund for the content that they didn’t write for me. So if you noticed the discrepancy between these numbers and the the 3 month update that is why. The first 3 months accounted for $983.61 in profit, which is $327.87 in profit per month. This would value the site at right around $6,500 based on the 20x multiple if I were to sell it at this point. Let’s see how that value changed over the next 3 months.

&nbsp;

Profits in the Last 3 Months - [http://imgur.com/acCsv2v](http://imgur.com/acCsv2v)

&nbsp;

You can see right away that these months were WAY better, mainly due to their being no expenses combined with a solid increase in earnings. A total of $2318.92 was earned in profit during this time and that comes out to be $772.97 per month. With the new 3 month average being $772.97 per month in profit, the site is now valued at around $15,500 if I were to sell it now! Remember, I bought the site for $6,000. I will touch on the subject of selling the site and the current value in a minute.

&nbsp;

##Current Return on Investment##

Remember that this website is acting as an investment vehicle and it needs to be giving a solid ROI for the investors, which are my parents. So let’s see the type of ROI they have seen so far from this website. Just as a refresher, my parents and I split the monthly profits 50/50.

&nbsp;

Total Profit - [http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG](http://imgur.com/XPnK3aG)

&nbsp;

The site has made a total of $3302.53 in profit since I took over ownership. This means that my parents have made a total of $1,651.26 on their $6,000 investment over a 6 month period.

&nbsp;

**What kind of ROI is this?**

My parents have seen a 27.5% ROI on their initial investment! Over a year long period, this would come out be a 55% yearly ROI, which is 5x better than the average stock market investment, especially during the current market conditions. Not only are my parents getting an awesome ROI on their investment each month but, I am also building up a sellable asset along the way that I can cash out whenever I want. It is hard to find an investment that provides this type of upside. I now want to walk through the idea of possibly selling the site and what kind of ROI we would see if we decided to go this route.

&nbsp;

##Should we Sell?##

Now that I have owned the site for 6 months and have a solid track record of earnings and of the traffic, we could now sell the site if we wanted to. Also, by not paying for new content and increasing the monthly earnings the last couple of months I have been able to maximize the site’s value. So right now would be a good time to sell the site if we wanted to. I’m not sure I have mentioned this before but, my parents buy houses and repair them and then flip them or rent them out. They basically do what I do with websites but with real estate. It runs in the family I guess :)

&nbsp;

However, my point of bringing this up is that they are looking to purchase another house and they would like cash from this website out so they can use the money with the new house they buy. So that means my parents are looking to sell the site pretty soon.

&nbsp;

##ROI If We Sold the Site Now##

If we decided to sell the site right now, based on the earnings through January, the site would be valued at around $15,500. I would probably sell the site through Empire Flippers which they they would take 15% of the sale price as a selling fee so we need to take that into account. This would mean that we would get around $13,200 for the site after the 15% fee is taken out.

&nbsp;

The agreement that I had with my parents for when we sold the site is that they would get their initial investment back of $6,000 and then we would split the rest 50/50. So after they got their $6k back there would be $7,200 to split between us from the $13,200 we made from the sale of the site. This would come out $3,600 for my parents and $3,600 for myself. Now, we add this $3,600 made from the sale of the site with the $1,651.26 of monthly profits from the past 6 months and that comes out to a total of $5,251.16 in PROFIT for my parents and the same amount of profit for myself. In this 6 month period, my parents made $5,251.26 in profit on a $6,000 investment, that comes out a 87.5% ROI through 6 months. That is an insane ROI in a very short period of time.

&nbsp;

I’m going to quickly break these numbers down so it is easier to digest:

&nbsp;

**Breakdown of My Parents ROI:**

&nbsp;

 - Total Monthly Profits: $1,651.26

&nbsp;

 - Profit from Site Sale: $3,600

&nbsp;

 - Total Profits: $5,251.26

&nbsp;

 - Initial Investment: $6,000

&nbsp;

 - Return on Investment (through 6 months): 87.5%

&nbsp;

My parents will be very happy with this kind of return and I am truly excited to be able to help my parents out as well. They were nice enough and believed in me enough to invest $6,000 into my idea and it looks like it is going to work out well. I’m extremely grateful, thanks mom and dad :)

&nbsp;

##Is Money Being Left on the Table?##

If we sell the site within the next month do I think there is some money being left on the table? Yes, I do. I think that the content that I published on the site 3 months ago is just starting to gain some traction within Google and I think continuing to add content will help grow the site. I also think that the Pinterest traffic will continue to grow if I keep adding new content as well. Combine this traffic growth with the fact that I am now truly able to optimize adsense ads with AmpedSense and  I think the site could get to $1,000 per month in profit within 3-6 months from now.

&nbsp;

Are we losing out on a TON of money? No, not really. I just feel like the site hasn’t reached it’s potential yet. However, I am 100% fine with selling the site. Please don’t think that I am complaining about my parents wanting to sell the site, because that is not what I am doing at all. I am just being completely honest with you all and saying that I think the site still has more potential.

&nbsp;

##Wrapping Things Up##

My parents and I have made the decision to let it earn for one more month and then see what kind of valuation it will get from Empire Flippers. Depending on how they value the site we will either list our site for sale or keep it longer. We will be making this decision at the end of February and I will make sure to keep you all up to date on what we do. Thank you all for reading and I hope you enjoyed the 6 month update on the website investment. I hope that I have opened your eyes on the crazy ROI websites can provide you with.

**Understanding the basics of Facebook advertising**

Throughout the years, I’ve heard many explanations of how Facebook works. Most of them are complete BS based on ignorance and in 99% of cases those stories are nothing different than conspiracy theories.

Facebook is a content network and Facebook strives to serve ‘only the best’ content to people which find that content relevant. Facebook measures relevance by checking the ratio between content reach (impressions) and engagement rate (reactions, comments, and shares).

When your post or an ad is highly engaging, Facebook will mark it as relevant and give you a ‘push’ in distribution pipeline – in other words, you’ll get **bigger reach for less money.**

Every successful Facebook advertising campaign is contained from 2 factors – **Content and Distribution**.

[Content is the king... but distribution is the queen and she wears the pants.](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jonathan-perelman-former-vp-of-agency-strategy-buzzfeed.png)

**1. Content or ad relevance**
You need no more than 1000 impressions to see if your ad is working, or not. **CPM (Cost-per-mille, mille=1000 impressions)** is less relevant in this stage, doesn’t matter if it’s **$5** or **$75**. Focus only on metrics that will show you how your content (ad) is performing;

* CTR (Click-through-rate)
* Engagement rate (Reactions, comments, shares)
* Video view rate (Until which point (%) is your video being watched)

Through these 3 metrics you can see if you have an ad that can drive **engagement**, **clicks** and ultimately, **sales**.

*Note: This is not ad relevance score that Facebook displays in Ads Manager.*

**2. Distribution**
When you have an ad that’s relevant (and working), it’s time to start investing in outreach. In this stage, you should focus on metrics that bring you closer to the **desired action**, such as making a** sale** or **acquisition** and **overall CPA**.

* CPM (Cost-per-mille, mille=1000 impressions)
* CPC (Cost-per-click)
* CVR (Conversion rate)
* CPA (Cost-per-action)

Through these metrics you can have a direct influence on your sales record, a number of leads generated or apps installed.

For instance, you have a budget for Facebook Advertising which says **$500/day**. By lowering your CPC (Cost-per-click) by **50%** (and maintaining landing page CVR of **4%**) you can get your CPA down by **100%** and **double your sales/day**.

That’s the way that Facebook and Facebook advertising work.

**Video killed the banner star**

Original Buggles famous refrain from 1979 said ‘Video killed the radio star’, which carried a deep message about emerging trend of music videos. Radio was already dying and the video was about to explode. People could enjoy not only the audio aspect of music but a visual medium as well.

The same thing happened when Facebook introduced video advertising back in 2014. From an advertising perspective, it was just amazing, especially in the terms of distribution. Cost-per-impression in video advertising was drastically lower than banners. And it still is.

But not only that, the medium of communication changed. Two-minute video can explain (and sell) more than a greatly designed banner with a 2000 word copy. For an average reader (200 words per minute), it would take 10 minutes to read and they still wouldn’t get that special feeling of your product.

I’ve heard many times that videos are ‘expensive’ to produce, which is completely false. Solid video a.k.a. the commercial will cost you around $2000 to produce in HD or full HD.

If you’re selling something simple to understand, your videos can be shorter and done in a sequence. If you decide to go with animated explainer videos, it’s going to cost you between $500-1000 for something decent. If you want to get a video produced for less than a dinner for two, visit fiverr.com (not recommended).  In other words, possibilities are merely endless.


Now let’s break the math behind the Facebook advertising with video. Imagine that your total advertising budget is around $5000. Here’s the simple math behind it;

[Banner vs. video](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/banner-vs--video.png)

In this imaginary case, numbers say that video production would pay off (in the terms of distribution) in around 25 days. With a video, you could reach almost 20% more people just in the first month. If you continue running for the second month, the video would get around 1 million impressions vs. a banner which would get around 500K impressions.

**Don’t let your ads look like – ads**

No matter if you’re using banners or videos, your ad copy shouldn’t sound like an ad copy. Rather, make your ads feel natural. When people scroll through their newsfeed, they’re being bombarded with ads. Nobody likes that. People don’t like being manipulated or pushed to do something.

[Gary Halbert Quote](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gary-halbert-autor-of-the-boron-letters.png)

Don’t believe me? Just pick up the phone, type in the random number and start blabbing about the greatness of your product to a random person. In 9 out of 10 cases, they’re going to hang up. Your ads aren’t going to do any better than that, trust me.

**Call-to-action (CTA)** is very important part of every ad. That doesn’t mean that you should include it in the headline. Tell your story first and then ask for the money. The converse will not work.

Also, try to avoid buzzwords like *FREE, new, the best*, etc. in your first interaction with the target audience. Don’t bring the big guns to the game too early. You don’t want to sell them something just once – aim to build a relationship which will result in high customer retention rate. Just liked Rand Fishkin said;

[Tell me Rand.](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/rand-fishkin-founder-of-moz.png)

Take a look at what we did with Breeo – ad did its job perfectly.

['The ad'](https://www.facebook.com/breeollc/videos/810066365799445/)

*All the credit for the video production goes to Jonathan and the team from Breeo.*

**Start with split testing**

Split testing isn’t about getting 100s of ads out and seeing which works the best. That’s not split testing, that’s not a scientific approach for long term results – that’s guesswork.

I’ve heard people talking about scaling in the same manner. Scaling campaigns is not just ramping up a budget from $10/day to $1,000/day, or even worse, $10,000.

In 99.9% of cases, it’s just a recipe for a financial disaster.

[Aaaaand it's gone](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/and-its-gone.jpg)

One simple, yet effective strategy we use for video advertising on Facebook is contained in **3 simple steps** and performs marvelously every single time.

Before you start split testing, do the research to get a feeling of your target audience. Male or female? Both? 18-35 or maybe 36-50? Go with something similar and don’t fear to go to broad. You’ll go more specific once you have an ad that’s working.

**Step 1 – Test video**

We won’t start from the fact that you have a good video. You probably don’t. Your video isn’t finished when the editor says so – it’s finished when you achieve decent view rates.

Average video view rate can easily tell you to which point is your video being watched and when it actually becomes boring and people stop watching it.

For products with mass market potential you should aim for 20-25% average view rate, everything below 10% is unacceptable. For B2B and niche high-end products, everything between 10-15% is ok, below 5% is unacceptable. Why? Because both business and niche high-end products are understood by smaller groups of people – even though you’re targeting well-defined audiences, most of the people are going to find your ad boring.

[Video view metrics](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/video-view-rates.png)

Also, track how much people are actually clicking through the ad and going to your website. Before you decide that your video isn’t working and you need a new one, make sure that you try strong call-to-action at the end of the video.

**Step 2 – Test copy**

Once you have a video that’s being watched and click you’re halfway there. Now it’s time to create a compelling message. In most cases copy on top of the video doesn’t have to be written by professional copywriter – it just has to catch the attention or briefly describe the problem or the solution in the video to the potential watcher. Including a question often does the job. Get the engagement going.

The best thing about Facebook advertising is social proof. Not just on Facebook, but on every social network. People tend to trust other people (even if they don’t know them). Having an ad with high engagement, especially if the engagement is positive, sells.

[Engagement rate](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/engagement-rates-and-social-proof.png)

High engagement results in instant brand awareness and instant sales.

**Step 3 – Targeting**

Here’s one trick that works marvelously on mass market products. It worked on Breeo.

Instead of having 10 different ad sets containing slightly different or same ads, try pointing 10 different ad sets to a single **PPE (Page-post-engagement)** ad.

[PPE campaign structure](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ppe-campaign-structure.png)

That way you don’t have to build up the social proof on 10 different ads, but just on one, which is for the start more cost effective. More engagement brings, of course, more engagement – which leads to the ad going ‘viral’ and you getting filthy rich (or not).

Ramp up the number of different demographics, see which lead to the desired action and which score higher engagement. 
**Then optimize and scale.**

*Note: This strategy works extremely well on cold traffic and product launches, but fails to deliver results on retargeting and retention campaigns.*

**Next steps**

Sticking to strategical points I’ve outlined above helped us to serve almost a half a billion impressions (498 million) to more than 200 million people across the globe for our clients, just in 2016. I’m quite sure that you can apply it to your business too, so get out there and start testing.

103,92onia,False,,289,IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MONEY THEN HERE'S SOME WAYS TO START TODAY GOD DAMNIT,Entrepreneur,"I understand this may come off as harsh, but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect - I KNOW how valuable your time really is and I so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself.

YOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM - TO SEE THE DOLLARS COME IN AND CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN DO IT!

If this post helps one person TAKE ACTION, I will be so happy! There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)

To be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.

You 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. 

I want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.

Not some long ass gameplan..

RIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!

This is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)

Personally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )

I know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. 

My path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!

Here are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..

(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)

'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'

There are millions of items out there that you can make money on..

Everything has a value.

I have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..

First of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..

'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'

Search 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.

Do not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)

'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'

+ Thrift stores

Check your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.

If you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!

Maybe even hundreds of things!

The most random crap sells for a lot online.

Teacups? Look them up! 

Old board games? Look em up!

Action figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!

Usually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.

I always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - 

Over the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!

+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)

Have a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.

Find community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..

Get up early!

My secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!

This way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! 

+ Craigslist 

Besides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

Personally I think this is a gamechanger.

Make a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'

Explain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. 

You wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.

People respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..

+ Ebay

You don't have to leave the house for this one!

Make an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..

This will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!

+ Ebay to Amazon

Most people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.

Because of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!

You can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!

*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.

+ Alibaba.com

Most likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.

Every fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.

This is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! 

Just a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)

It takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!

There are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!

I hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! 

Please please please let me know if you have any questions!

 I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..

Life can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!

Anyway that's about it..

Have a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!

474,gjzshi,False,,202,I am failing as a leader,Entrepreneur,"Backstory: I am a dentist and I purchased my first dental office last fall. It was and still is a great opportunity financially. There have been many circumstantial challenges and set backs early that I would like to think they were unique to my business, but I am sure they were not. I feel as if these setbacks could have been avoided had I not made tactical mistakes as the decision maker. In large part, we were getting over those setbacks around six months into ownership. 

Having a break due to COVID, I am able to reflect on my leadership and see myself as a **FAILURE** despite having nearly doubled year-to-date revenues this past February. **I am a failure because**

&#x200B;

* I overworked and under appreciated my team (disposable) 
   * We were understaffed. I failed to hire team members to replace those that left fast enough 
   * I failed to replace a leaking cavitron (machine used for cleaning teeth) 
* I made my team feel shameful by putting them in tough positions 
   * I failed to set up the proper system for us to answer phone calls with a high answer rate. Leaving my staff to answer to patient complaints such as ""We do not answer the phone"" or ""Never return voicemails"" or ""Said that we would call back but never did"" 
   * Early on I failed to keep petty cash at the front desk, meaning my front desk staff would have to come to me personally to ask for change, that I would sometimes pull from my own pocket 
   * I have interviewed candidates who while touring the office have the look that says ""I do not ever see myself working here"". To me that feeling must make my current team feel shameful. 
* I took motivated people and unmotivated them. Then I would internally criticize them for not meeting expectations. 
   * My team was made up of motivated employees. Yes, each one of them had their faults and things that they could've worked on. We all do. However, I burned their motivation to the ground. 
   * I look back at other leadership positions in which I have done the same and realized that I have a pattern of taking initially motivated employees and taking that away from them. 
* Financially insecure 
   * At times we were close to running out of very basic supplies in a dental office. My intent was to only order supplies in such a way that I did not keep thousands of dollars stocked up in supplies and was ordering them more on an as needed basis as we were closing to running out. In my eyes I was making smart financial decision, while I suspect that in my team's eyes it was saying that we don't have enough money as a business to buy supplies. 
   * I failed to process payroll by the payroll company's deadline for next business day fund transfer. There was no reason for that to happen. There were more than enough funds in the business account. It was simply a failure of leadership. 
* I lack credibility 
   * I do not follow through on what I say I am going to do. I am setting the same precedent for my team when dealing with patients and the same precedent for my team when dealing with me. 
      * I do not hold myself accountable. Nor do I hold my team accountable. 
   * Ex. ""We are going to implement this policy starting tomorrow"" 
      * I do not create a solid policy. If I do, it is half baked. 
      * I try to half a\*\* implement a half-a\*\* policy and fail 
      * I do not follow through and let the tyranny of the urgent get in my way. 
      * The policy becomes an after thought 
* Stingy and scare mentality 
   * It is traditional for dental offices to give staff a bonus at the end of the year. I failed to do so. 
   * I purchased cheaper paper towels, which my employees brought to my attention (since then, I have high quality paper towel) 
* Un-fun poor/work environment 
   * I was so caught up in the day to day that I did not realize that it was around Christmas time and we should put up Christmas decorations. 
   * The previous doctor and his wife used to mop the floor daily. I failed to do that. Nothing is dirty, but it is not naturally to the same standard as with the previous doctor 
* I micromanage 
   * I am over involved in every process. I generally believe I do know better. Even if I do, I need to learn how to make improvements to processes and evaluate in a way that is done without micromanaging. 
* There is no separation between my “business” and my personal life. I am consumed by working in and on my business and am compromising personal relationships.  
* Additionally 
   * My office is unorganized/unsystematized  
   * We have poor employee retention 
   * Weak employee retention 
   * This leads to suboptimal customer service 
   * We missed tremendous financial opportunity as a business 
   * We lose good patients due to my failures 

I am a failure. I am letting down my family, my team members, my patients, everyone that believed in me and helped me get to this point. I am failing myself.   


I am not depressed as I am fighting every day to make things better. The lowest of lows was probably in November and things were starting to come along. Up-to mid February, things cash flow was tight financially. We were producing revenue, but our AR was getting out of hand (we were not collecting) 

Something hit me today that led me to look introspectively at my mistakes.   


Nonetheless, I would still give myself a ""F"" in leadership even if things were looking better financially. This is not a cry for sympathy, but more so an exercise self reflection for clarity. 

&#x200B;

453,61r0l6,False,,67,My experience running Facebook ads and my cheat sheet on how to make them work for you.,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone,

I saw a lot of people posting on this sub asking questions about FB ads so I thought I'd start the week by sharing my experience about them and how to actually get started with them and have a positive ROI. For a long time I ignored Facebook ads because I heard horror stories about people losing money with them, bots, fake clicks etc. I was also simply focused on building my business and selling to customers and had no actual time to get started with them.

That said, Facebook is now actually pretty well developed compared to a few years ago and about 2 years ago I decided to give ads a go and did it for my own company, for a few SaaS businesses and for a few Ecommerce stores and there is clearly money to be made since billions are spent every year on ads.

# **The mistakes I see the most with FB ads:**

----

## 1. Business with no clear value proposition.

A lot of businesses try to start with Facebook ads but forget to actually build a sound business, with a great value proposition. 

Before you put any money on Facebook ads, make sure what you are selling is appealing to your prospective customers. Sales are usually a good indicator that there is actual demand for your product / service.

Facebook ads are just a way to create additional demand for your product and reach a wider audience through creative means but they will not correct the foundations of your business.

----

## 2. Not understanding the context of Facebook.

This is the second big one: When you go to Facebook you go there to relax. I like to take the tube in the morning and look at my Facebook feed to relax before meeting with clients. I certainly do not go there to buy anything. I go on Facebook because I see interesting content from my friends and family and get entertained.

This is a key aspect of Facebook: Facebook generates relevant and engaging content to you so you keep coming back on the platform and see ads. If we compare Facebook to Adwords, FB ads are about creating demand whereas Adwords is about supplying existing demand.

The good thing is that Facebook ads are generally cheaper than Adwords as a result. Adwords already knows that people are looking for your products and capitalize on that.

This thus mean that you have to create various ads to create and capture efficiently that demand. More on that below.

----

## 3. Not getting the targeting right.

Targeting is another big mistake I see with FB ads. A lot of people blindly use interest targeting and hope it will drive conversions. In all honesty, I do not 100% trust interest targeting and consider it like looking for a needle in a haystack. While I do sometimes use it, I mostly use custom audiences (For example: email subscribers, previous customers, people who watched a large part of a video I posted, people who visited my website recently, or even people who messaged my page on Messenger or interacted with my page). I then usually proceed with polishing that audience by excluding people depending on the objective I have in mind and double down with lookalikes. I sometimes also start with interest targeting but that is never my first choice.

Targeting the right customers also means your ads get cheaper and that you get a higher ROI as a result, since Facebook only needs to show the ad to a few people. It is a win win for you and Facebook. You'll get cheaper conversions and Facebook will have to show your ad to less people, which will make your ads cheaper as a result.

----

## 4. No clear strategy about what you are actually trying to achieve.

The magic of Facebook is that you can actually create a ton of different ads with different end goals. You can create video ads, you can create like ads, retargeting ads, messenger ads, and more. Each ad format usually performs best with a clear goal in mind. For example, I like to use video ads to create awareness, create lead ads for contests, and retargeting ads to engage with people who already know the brand or existing customers to upsell them.

This means that you need to have a clear strategy in mind when creating your ads. There is no one size fits all but customers are at different parts of your funnel. 

Usually there are three stages:

* 1) Customers who do not know about you
* 2) Customers who know about you but haven't bought 
* 3) Customers who have already bought from you / are power users of your product. 

Knowing that, you can create different campaigns so that you move those customers down the funnel.

## 5. Going too quickly to stop an ad / not putting enough budget in place.

Facebook ads take time. When you start a campaign, Facebook will take a few days to show your ads to people and will optimize it to serve it to the most relevant audience, so that they get cheaper for you. You also need to set up an appropriate budget so that you reach an audience wide enough for Facebook to properly optimize your ad.


----

## 6. Broken website or no clear landing page.

Make sure your website makes sense to users, that the navigation works well and that you have a clear call to action. You can also use a landing page service to make sure your users' precious attention is directed towards a precise action (for example: Newsletter sign up, clear add to basket form, etc.)

----

# **How to actually get started with Facebook ads**

----

## 1. Learn Facebook ads with Facebook's own Blueprint course.

This is a major resource since it is developed by Facebook itself. Go through the whole course, take notes and Google what parts do not seem clear for you.

----

## 2. Learn about copywriting and ad design.

In my experience, Facebook ads work well with highly visual content and little text. Start with creating a highly visual image (for example people faces, or close-ups of your product). You do not need to be a designer to do that and keep it simple. Your image / visuals matter the most and the text section is usually there to confirm for the user what you are trying to convey with your image. So focus first on your design and then write your copy as step #2. 

A good way to learn copywriting is to write a bit every day, and to read a lot. Write as if you would talk to someone in front of you, even if it is just a random subject.

----

## 3. Learn about psychology and generic advertising.

Mastering the Facebook ads platform is probably only 20% of the job and is only a technical aspect. The other 80% actually comes from you and your ability to create strategies that speak to your audience. My advice here is to look at what other businesses are doing. Learn about psychology / motivation and read a few generic books on advertising. The key here is to develop soft skills and empathy / emotional intelligence so that your ads matters to your audience.

----

## 4. Understand the metrics and KPI's you need to be tracking.

Your first step is to install the Facebook pixel so you can actually track the results of your ads. Secondly, you need to be tracking various KPI's (CTR, Frequency, ...) to make sure your campaigns make sense and are profitable for you.

Some of the most relevant metrics are the following:

* a. Your CTR (i.e:  Number of clicks divided by number of impressions) 
* b. Your Frequency (i.e: How many times your ads are shown to people)
* c. Reach: Number of unique people your ad reached.
* d. Relevance score: Numbers of actual and expected positive and negative feedbacks - it will impact the performance and costs of your ads.
* e. Your primary action metric: Whether it is video views, sales, website registrations, it is the most important metric you need to track in the end to have a positive ROI.

----

## 5. Practice! 

You do not need a ton of money to practice with Facebook ads. If you are running a local business or highly niche business it will even be cheaper. Practice for a few weeks / months until you are confident and never stop learning and trying new things since even the best advertisers have to change their strategies as users get fatigued / the platform is ever evolving.


----

# **My cheat sheet to make Facebook ads work**

----

I am a big believer in processes / systems and being organised as a whole. I therefore try to see patterns to make ads work and here is what I usually do when creating a new campaign:

## 1. I identify at what stage the business is / what are its primary objectives.

Is the business fairly new and needs more people to know about it? Does the business need to upsell existing customer and make them loyal advocates for the brand? My first step would try to understand what the business is trying to do.

----

## 2. I set up a list of medium to long term objectives.

I usually set up campaigns that automatically pause when someone jumps in another part of the purchase lifecycle. My purchase lifecycle is as follow:

* a) Person does not know about my product / company - I will create engaging content that make the person more aware of what the product / service is about.

* b) Prospect: visited the site / interacted with content  - I will set up a campaign that seeks to sell things to that prospect or continue to engage with that prospect depending on how high the intent is. It is also at this stage that I will exclude people that are not interested in my product / service.

* c) Existing customer: knows about the service / product - I will set up a campaign that seeks to make that customer an advocate for my brand and to buy even more products.


My ultimate advice for this one is : Understand vision. It is a big key in advertising and basically people have to envision in their mind what your product / service is about. 

To give you an example: If you can clearly picture the benefits in your mind of what the ad is trying to make you do, your brain will create motivation which will make you go to the next step. If there is no motivation, there is no action and there is no purchase / registrations as a result. 

Your end goal when creating Facebook ads is ultimately to motivate people to take action, by instilling vision. 

So how to motivate people to click on your ad? 

* 1. Grab attention with a promise (for example use a great visual that speaks to your user) 
* 2. Create vision by supplying your image with copy that reasonates / identifies with the user (for example: Imagine staying at this 5 stars resort with your loved one) which supplies a nice picture of a cottage on the beach. 

----

## 3. I fire up the campaigns (usually for 1 or 2 weeks) and tweak them over the time. 


The key here is to test everything. I constantly research the audiences, tweak the copy, and split test ads.


----

## 4. Measure KPI's and increase spend if necessary.

I use a few ad management tools and look closely at KPI's / automatically stop campaigns or double down on campaigns that are performing well. 

----

**Next steps**

----

This was only an introduction but there are more useful tools that Facebook recently opened to the public. For example reach and frequency buying  (you can create campaigns with a reach objective for example). My advice is to follow the announcements on the blog of Facebook and Google on strategies.

47,elckkv,False,Tools,198,I scraped the top 100 e-commerce stores using Shopify. Here are my boring findings.,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

Last month I realized anyone could pretty much find out who the biggest Shopify stores are since they're all hosted under the same IP: 23.227.38.32

Knowing this, I scraped the Top 100 Shopify Stores by Alexa Rank, using myips.ms - so these are the most visited e-commerce stores using Shopify in the whole world:

[Full list of the top 100 Shopify stores \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/GQ60XWl)

(P.S: I transformed the Alexa rank into Estimated Monthly Traffic for easier understanding)

Now, as for my findings:

**1. Clothing is king, and the whole Fashion niche rules over everything.**

[Full break-down of Niches \(Image\)
](https://imgur.com/59PrUEI)

Of the top 100 Shopify Stores, 29 had Clothing as their main niche.

Add Accessories, Footwear, Underwear plus Swimwear stores - which amount to 21 stores in total - and you have exactly **50% of the top 100 stores** belonging somewhere and somewhat in the Fashion niche.

Taking a closer look, the biggest store currently on Shopify is Fashion Nova, which is a fashion company (well, *duh*) with over 21 million visits per month. Their traffic numbers are actually 3 times as large as their 2nd competitor (which is a makeup store).

Now, this really is **The Mountain vs Oberyn** levels of competition.
 
Fashion Nova can essentially A/B test their landing pages and user experience until their conversion rates just blow away every competitor.

And even then, this as a whole will benefit the entire Fashion niche - as they can simply ~~steal~~ *learn* from Fashion Nova UX choices and improve their own conversion rates for free.

No other niche has this much free information to be studied and replicated online.

***Main takeaway:*** If you want to start a new e-commerce store or expand yours, a local needleworker can end up being more helpful than mindlessly browsing Ali-express.


**2. You don't need to have Walmart prices to sell like Walmart.**

[Full breakdown of the Best-sold Product prices \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/vhRiBSx)

Yes, some 29% of the Best-Sold Products on the list are under 25$, but 50% of the top stores have their Best-Sold product at a price point above 50$. 

Were you expecting this? I really wasn't.

This means big stores aren't obliged to do drop-shipping prices, even though some of these stores are (clearly) sourcing products for cheap in Asia.

**Branding up and niching down** seems to be the absolute key here.

And see it for yourself - go to any store from the list, and check if you can't identify their customer persona straight away.

All these stores have made the effort to laser-target their niche because that means they'll be the only ones able to satisfy it.

Finally, having a larger margin per product is also one of the very few ways these stores get to increase their sales - because larger product margins will mean a larger advertising budget, which in the end will mean a larger number of customers reached.

Remember that almost all of these stores survive and grow strictly through Facebook/Instagram ads - 93% of these 100 stores are using Facebook ads (trust me, I checked them one-by-one).

***Main takeaway:*** Always focus on selling the benefit and not only product features, so you can brand yourself and distance your product from the common Youtube drop shipper.

**3. Mobile Site Speed isn't a concern when you get a lot of traffic.**

[Mobile Site Speed breakdown \(Image\)](https://imgur.com/tiqCG9T)

Some of these stores are taking longer to load on mobile than Usain Bolt took to run 100 meters on the Olympics. 

It's this bad.

And because of this, it would seem that Site Speed doesn't affect nearly as much the sales or traffic numbers as one would predict.

However, this a *misleading behavior* that you shouldn't replicate.

Yes, these stores still have their traffic and large sales numbers for sure - but Amazon found in an early e-commerce study that for every 100ms (meaning 1/10 of a second) of site delay, they *lost 1% of sales*. ([Source](https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales/))

Meaning many stores in this list could, in theory, **almost double their sales numbers**, by just working to decrease their site speed to regular values - and all this without ever having to increase their traffic numbers.

This is free money they're leaving on the table every month.

***Main takeaway:*** Focus on having your e-commerce site speed low (especially mobile site speed), because unless you already have traffic in the hundreds of thousands and/or an established brand, your sales will tank (or never even takeoff).

And that's it for today.

752,cx7hw1,False,AMA,137,I made my first ever sale today!,Entrepreneur,"In fact, I made 11! Totalling £450 in revenue totalling in £380 pretax profit! 

It’s been a long and hard journey to get to this point.

The most important thing I’ve done was to build my audience before launching the product. I amassed 220 email subscribers who registered interest in my product. 

This grew from finding my target audience on Instagram and creating valuable resonating content for them. I also ran ads in order to test my proposition and to validate if people would intend to buy the product or not (smoke test).

It’s early days but the fact I’ve sold something for real now makes it REAL! 

The secret is, the product doesn’t exist yet. It’s a pre-order purchase. It will help me learn if the price point is correct, and if people actually buy it (And they are! Whoop!)

943,9wyynx,False,Case Study,107,I have got 81% Open rate and 59% Reply Rate on my cold emails. [Templates included] Here's How. I have explained everything here.,Entrepreneur,"I have sent lots and lots of cold emails. It's a thing that startup entrepreneurs must do to acquire customers.

In the earlier stage, you need to go to your customers rather than waiting for the customers to come to you. And, there's nothing easier which is free and provides a better return over time spent than cold emails and cold calls. This is why you still receive lots of cold calls from insurance companies and banks.

I used to suck at cold email till a few months ago. I am still not best at it, but I am sure that I am better than most of you. Here's the proof.

My latest cold email campaign to 100 people got me 59% replies and 29% clicked on the links that I provided in the email. Out of that 59% reply, 21% converted. There were 1 email + 4 follow up emails. And yes, the open rate was whopping 81%.

**Proof -** [https://imgur.com/a/DzWSqpO](https://imgur.com/a/DzWSqpO)

I had spent a lot of time thinking that what was I doing wrong because I was not getting a good response to my emails. Out of 100 emails that I sent, I receive a reply on only 5-6 of them, and conversion rate was either 0 or 1.

Then I figured out that I was writing the emails from my perspective. I was describing the things that are adding value to my business, not the recipient's.

So, I changed the way of writing emails and started to write it from the recipient's perspective. I started to what would recipient get 95-97% of time. Rest of thetime, I wrote what would I get.

This is what I did.

## You need to automate your cold emails for better performance

Yes, you're right. You and I are human. If you keep on sending the cold emails manually then you'll forget to follow up sometimes. In some cases, if the optimal time for follow up is 2:15 PM, let's say, and you're not free at that time then you'll miss the follow-up. This is why it should be automated.

I used Saleshandy to automate cold emails. It uses my own email account to send emails. I just upload the recipients email and it will start firing the emails based on the template that I provide. The best thing is that it can follow up to the people who do not reply to email. So, if someone does not reply to my first email, Saleshandy will send the follow-up mail. If someone does reply to my first email, Saleshandy will automatically stop the follow-up email.

## Get the recipient first name, company name, and email address ready

Gathering the email IDs of the recipients is a pain. I use Norbert for this. Just write the name and company's website URL, and it will do its best to fetch the email address.

Per my experience, it has given my correct email address around 75% of the time.

## The subject that makes the recipient open the email

Subject line matters. If your recipients get lots of emails, be pretty much sure that he will read or delete the email based on the subject line.

Your eamil won't be opened if the subject is

* too much salesy ""I HAVE THIS FOR YOU. BUY NOW""
* very generic like ""An offer you""
* looks spammy like ""Buy now within 24 hours or the offer will go away"". However, this subject line works with the newsletters because people know the company which sent the newsletter. If I receive two emails with this subject line, one from Amazon and another from an unknown person, I may open the Amazon email and make the purchase but I wouldn't even bother to open the unknown person's email
* The IP from which you send the emails is blacklisted. Your emails would end up in the junk folder. What a waste.

**So, what's the best subject line?**

The best subject line is the one that summarizes the motive of the cold email. 

In my campaign, the recipients were coworking spaces owners and I was offering a month of a free magazine subscription to all of their members.

My subject line was

First Name, are you interested in talking about a free offer for your member?

Adding the name in the subject line makes a lot of difference. I have not seen anyone in my entire life who does not love his name. Your recipients are busy and they have more than 50 unread emails. Just by seeing the one's name in the subject line, attention directly goes to that email. You are already ahead of rest of 49 emails that ended up in your recipients inbox without his first name in the subject line.

Just as a proof, my email open rate was 81% which is very-very good number. The average is somewhere around 20-30%.

Apart from the first word i.e. recipient's name, the rest of my email was describing exactly what I was offering. 

## The body of the first email

The first two paragraphs and the last paragraph matters the most. This is what everyone reads. if the first two paras are not convincing, your recipient will not bother to read any further.

Before I get into the body of the email, I would like to write out what your recipient will think after receiving your email.

**Step 1 -** The first thing he'll notice is the subject name. We have already figured out what to write in the subject.

**Step 2-** He will start to think who are you. This is why you need to answer this question at the very beginning of your email

**Step 3 -** As soon as he knows you, he will start to know more about the offer and what does he need to do get that offer. This is where you need to write what will recipient get and what does he need to do to get that offer.

**Step 4 -** The last thing he will think is how much money does he need to pay for that offer. If your recipient is a part of a company which is making millions that he wouldn't bother about the cost much. If you're providing good value to him i.e. solving one or more of his company's problems, he would buy your product. So, the value is getting priority over cost. If he belongs to a company which does not make enough money, the cost gets priority over the value. If you're providing an offer to someone from a small company, make sure that you write the cost at the end of the email because this is what your recipient wants to see. On the other hand, don't bother to write the cost if the recipient belongs to a big company.

Based on that, here's the first email.

    Hey/Hello [First Name], [1]
    
    I am Vaibhav from I Innovate magazine. It's a digital magazine that provides painkillers to the entrepreneurs' problems, and I am its co-founder. [2]
    
    I would like to offer your members three months free subscription to my magazine. It's a digital magazine and your members can download it on their phones and iPads. [3]
    
    If you and I are willing to go ahead, I would be thanking you by writing your coworking space name, [coworking space name], in the partnership section on my website. [4]

\[1\] Put the salutation based on the culture in recipient's company. ""Hey"" is very casual. Use it for someone who belongs to casual culture i.e. someone from a small company. For big companies, go for ""Hello"" instead. If you want to be super formal, go for ""Dear Mr. Last Name"".

\[2\] I introduced myself

\[3\] I very briefly wrote what I want to offer. No need to be super-duper explanatory

\[4\] I provided one more offer. But the tone is set as I am giving a thank you present

\[5\] Always put a call to action at the end and the answer of the call to action should be as small as ""yes"" or ""no"".

\[6\] My signature was to the point. It had all the things that a recipient would like to see. It had my designation, my website, and my LinkedIn profile.

I received 29 replies on this email and 19 agreed to schedule a call. Rest wanted to me give more info over email. 2 got converted. That's 6% conversion rate. Not bad but not at all satisfactory. Rest 19 people converted after follow-up emails.

## The Timing of the email

This is a very important thing that you must consider. You cannot expect someone to reply to your emails that you sent at 1 AM in the morning. 

Although, I don't have any concrete time but sending business cold emails tend to work best at around 8-11 AM. Because this is the time when business people read their emails. But this is also the time when they are loaded with all the tasks that they need to complete within that day. So, they may skip your email. 

The next best time as per my experience is around 4-5 PM. This is the time when they wrapping up and they may reply to your email right away. I also scheduled my cold email campaign for 4:15 PM.

One thing I would like to mention is that sending cold emails early in the morning (5-6 AM) also worked out for some people I know, but it never worked out for me.

## Day of the email

People say that Tuesday works best for cold emails. but all weekday will work for you. I have tested sending cold emails every day of a week and all the weekdays performed similarly. Yes, the open and reply rate were a lot lesser on weekends which was obvious.

## I got almost all of the conversion in follow-ups

I sent 3 follow up emails + 1 closure email. I'll tell you what's closure email after writing the template of three follow-ups.

The first email was sweet and to the point. But it did not give enough info about the offer. The obvious questions in the recipients head were what do I need to do to avail this, what are the hidden charges, what's the background of I Innovate magazine, what else will I receive apart from this, and what would I Innovate get from this offer.

My next few follow-ups answered every single question.

**Follow up 1**

This follow up was automated with Saleshandy. This means that it would be sent only to those recipients who did not reply to my first email. I saved a lot of time by not manually following up.

Here's the template:

    Hey/Hello [First Name],
    
    Did you get a chance to read my previous email where I wrote that I am willing to offer a free subscription of I Innovate magazine to your members?
    
    One of the best things about my magazine is that all the stories are written by proven entrepreneurs. We don't believe in writers writing the stories for the magazine because they will simply rewrite the content that they find on the internet. They cannot add their own experience. On the other hand, entrepreneurs can add their experience also in the articles. I believe that it can provide a lot of value to your members as they are entrepreneurs and they can learn a lot from those who had been at their place and successfully crossed it. [1]
    
    Add on, we have provided an action item at the end of every article. The action items are checklists, templates, excel calculators, case studies, etc. They can be downloaded without even entering email IDs. Just click on the link and download will begin.[2]
    
    The next best thing about the magazine is that it's optimized for iPad. Unlike traditional magazines, your members don't need to zoom in to read. [3]
    
    Can you and I talk on the phone for 10 mins? I can explain more over the phone.

**Last email**

No offer was made in this email. The only purpose of this email was to give respect to the recipient. If he didn't reply to your email, it did not mean that he's a bad person. It just meant that his priorities were different and did not align with my offering. So, I paid a little respect and moved on.

    Hey/Hello [First Name],
    
    I see that you are not interested. No worries.
    
    I will not send any more email related to this offer.
    
    Enjoy the rest of your day, and yes, [coworking space name] rocks. 
    
    Best Regards,
    Vaibhav

This is all.

**Edit:**

I know that many people hate cold emails and they say that it's a spam. A cold email could be a spam for person A, but could not be a spam for person B. I had 59% reply rate and none of them asked me to stop sending emails because they were spams. It all boils down to the priority. So, my emails aren't adding any value to you, this is why you'd mark them as a spam. But let's say that you're a business owner and I come to you with a tool related to your industry that can greatly reduce your business cost, and all of your competitors are already using that tool. Plus if I offer you 50% discount in that tool, would you still mark that as spam? If your answer is ""yes"", you need to figure out that generalizing every cold email as a spam is not doing good to your business.

&#x200B;

Another point is that cold email is a must for a startup. Some people here are saying that we should not be cold emailing and should be using legitimate ways to acquire new B2B customers. I agree with that. But there's no cheaper way present to acquire customers this fastly. Unicorn startups like Uber, Flipkart did this when they were new. Many of you might have heard of [canva.com](https://canva.com). Even that site uses cold emailing to grow its customers. I received a cold email from someone in Canva. So, if you don't like cold emails then you can simply delete the mail. There's no need to get frustrated over them.

952,8cgihw,False,,68,$92k/month selling products with cartoons on them.,Entrepreneur,"Hey - Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) again.

Today's interview is with Jonas Forth, who runs [Moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com).

**TLDR:**

- His company sells products **based on a popular, existing brand.**
- His business is **content-first** - focused on blogging and SEO to drive traffic
- The business turns over €75,000 per month

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

I’m Jonas Forth, managing director at All Things Commerce Helsinki Ltd. Our aim is to help Nordic brands based in art, literature and design reach a global audience through e-commerce and relevant content.

Our main product is [moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com) - through which we sell licensed products based on the [popular brand Moomin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins) and tell fans about its rich fascinating history.

Our most popular products are perhaps our ceramic Moomin mugs, a phenomenon that started in the early 1990s. But, we also have a wide array of over 700 items, ranging from lamps to toys and t-shirts.

On average, we have a monthly turnover of 75.000€ with annual growth of 20%, shipping to more than 50 countries every month. We are now looking at taking on more brands and expanding our operations with an on-demand model.

All Things Commerce Helsinki Ltd is now owned by the parent company Moomin Characters, to which it was sold to in early 2015.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

My background is in journalism and online content production, but I have also worked extensively with different companies on developing digital products. This has always given me a good understanding of the combination of content and technology.

My previous experience certainly helped when we originally conceptualized the site and online store. But it has certainly been a learning process as the e-commerce field is quickly growing and practices change.

We came up with the idea of ATC after seeing similar brands struggle with their online presence and decided to see if we could develop it into a service, combining content with commerce.

Nowadays, we mainly work with the global brand Moomin, and after four years with the brand, we have been able to test out different sales models and processes.

In practice, we work as Moomin’s official communications channel, ranging from creating high-level content in-house and managing all marketing efforts.

We’re hoping to be able to serve other brands with a similar content structure, perhaps with a stronger focus on the commercial side.

### Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

Starting out, we spent approximately 100.000 € on the site, shop and logistics.

Half of that went into developing the site and shop, one quarter to initial salaries and one quarter into the setup of our logistics.

For a global webstore, 100.000€ is far from enough, but it got us started. We initially went with a custom platform called [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org/) but we have since progressed to [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story).

> When people talk about scaling your business, some forget that flaws in your business scale as well but in a negative way. So make sure that all aspects of the business are working before trying to scale it up.

We also used another 100.000€ to buy inventory, but very little on marketing as we rely on our own content production.

Thinking back, I probably would have chosen a more scalable platform solution early on, as switching systems later requires more work and money.

We now buy items from over 70 different manufacturers, with the one thing in common that they all use the Moomin brand.

### Describe the process of launching the online store/business.

We didn’t do a traditional launch, we sort of put it out there and let people find it on their own.

We did, however, focus on creating a lot of interesting content such as searchable and shareable posts, and we aimed for a high percentage of automatic turnover.

It took us about six months until we started seeing relevant traffic, and we did quite a lot of competitions, sales and hustling during the first months to get that going. Moomin Characters only had a Flash based site up until 2014 without any data analytics connected to it so we started out blind in terms of what people were searching for and what kinds of posts interested people. We only knew that we would have 50% commercial and 50% non-commercial material to strike a balance, and that is something we stick to to this day.

> This is something that I recommend to all brands that I talk to, as so many are putting their emphasis on social media. Your social media accounts can be shut down at any moment leaving you with nothing after years of working on them so make sure that you control your own base.

As the months went by, we analysed our data but also looked at all other existing Moomin sites to see what they had written about. We also did some link and story sharing with the other sites to get the SEO going. It certainly helped that we put out lots and lots of unique content, specifically product information, in three languages at the same time. Google loves structured data and Wordpress with the plugin [Yoast](https://yoast.com/) helps us do it fairly automatically.

Four years later, we receive some 75% of our turnover from organic search, direct traffic and automatic messaging through follow-up emails and social media retargeting, allowing us to focus on keeping up the positive loop. For social media, we use a low cost tool called [AdEspresso](https://adespresso.com/), which allows us to set up hundreds of campaigns at once and then up the budgets or turn off campaigns based on how they are performing.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract new customers?

Our main focus is on creating content that focuses on the brand and that provides value to virtually anyone to whom the brand Moomin is still unknown.

All our content is SEO optimized, from alt texts, to image naming and search term specification. That has allowed us to rely on traffic from organic search and we believe that it will grow significantly once the brand becomes better known.

If you would like to learn more about SEO, I would start with [Moz](https://moz.com/) and [the top posts from the SEO subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/top/), install Google Analytics on your site and just start measuring the results.

It’s very much a long play game and it takes months for you to see results, even with consistent work. Here’s some marketing tips from my experience:

* We’re very much landing page driven and we use our official site ([moomin.com](https://www.moomin.com)) and shop ([shop.moomin.com](https://shop.moomin.com/)) as our spine in all other operations. There are two reasons for this - we can only really convert to sales on our site and we want to build and own our media. This is something that I recommend to all brands that I talk to, as so many are putting their emphasis on social media. Your social media accounts can be shut down at any moment leaving you with nothing after years of working on them so make sure that you control your own base.

* Treat paid advertising as something that’s one-off, so once you pay for the views, clicks or conversions, **it’s over**. This means that you should try to get everything you can out of the paid traffic like Facebook or Google retargeting, email signups or people sharing you content.

* Map out what your traffic sources are and what your funnel looks like - where does your traffic come, where should it go and what should happen once it gets there? When it comes to e-commerce, three things matter - the amount of traffic you can generate, the percentage of that you convert, and the value of the conversion.

We’re heavy on building our own media - both on the site but also through emails list and partners who are willing to trade traffic. We post on social media but since it converts poorly for us, we rarely put emphasis on it. We have automatic ads though running 24/7.

### How is everything going nowadays, and what are your plans for the future?

Things are going well, we’re into our fifth year of growth now and we’re looking at opening up a completely new business doing only on-demand items for other brands similar to Moomin.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

When people talk about scaling your business, some forget that flaws in your business scale as well but in a negative way. So make sure that all aspects of the business are working before trying to scale it up. We messed up when we tried to open up a similar business in another country without the proper foundation in place for it.

Focus on building a team that’s self driving and automate as much redundant tasks as you can. That gives you more time to focus on the important things.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

- Platform: [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story)
- Email Communication: [Conversio](https://conversio.com/)
- Newsletters: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com)
- Publishing: [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- Social Media Marketing - [AdEspresso](https://adespresso.com/)

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

Business Model Generation by Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur is great for planning out your business.

I often listen to [Shopify’s podcasts](https://www.shopify.com/podcasts) as well.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Focus is most often the thing that companies fail to do and it’s even harder while growing the company.

Get a mentor if you can - once crud starts hitting the fan, it’s good to have someone bring you back on track.

774,4j1wft,False,,98,Why Successful People Take 10 Years To ‘Succeed Overnight’,Entrepreneur,"I’ve taken a few of Ramit Sethi’s courses and like them. Here’s an [article](http://www.inc.com/empact/why-successful-people-take-10-years-to-succeed-overnight.html) from him that was published yesterday in Inc. Magazine. I think there’s some invaluable advice in here about just how long it Really takes to build a mulit-million dollar business. Overnight success stories are a joke. Careful systematized execution with sweat and grind separates the men from the mice. 

This is right up the r/entrepreneur community's alley.  I summarized the key points and quotes below along with my own experience executing the ideas.  Enjoy!

***

Success isn’t just about working over a long period of time. As Ramit says there’s a “deeper strategy used by successful people to level up that almost no one talks about…”

# **""The Under Appreciated Power Of Sequence""**

Ramit makes a controversial point that “starting big” is a waste. It leads to doing to trying to do too much at once. Instead the proven strategy that the top entrepreneurs use is the “Domino Strategy”. Start small. Focus on what’s achievable.

**“First, start so small that you can easily knock over the first domino.”**

**“Next, put the dominos in just the right sequence so that each small step makes the next bigger step possible.”**

The key here is to focus on what step will make the next step easier. The first few steps can be simple. I’ve seen this in my own business failures. I was slaving away for months at coffee shops on my computer. But I wasn’t focused on the right sequence of events. Sequence, sequence, sequence!

# **”How The Domino Strategy Helped Elon Musk Become Elon Musk”**

“The domino strategy shows how a tony amount of energy can be converted into something 1,000 times or even a billion times larger.”  Look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y97rBdSYbkg). It’s incredible. The amount of force that’s needed at the beginning is deceptively small. The same thing is true with business. Start small. Get your first customer. Then your second. With time your wins will be larger and larger.

Elon Musk has been working hard for decades, not years. Just one small example is that he read two books a day in his teenage years! He kept leveling up and getting better from a young age. You can see the domino effect everywhere. [Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28computer_programmer%29) (founder of Y Combinator) uses it. [Verne Harnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verne_Harnish) (co-founder of Entrepreneurs’ Organization) uses it. [David Sacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Sacks) (Yammer) uses it.

# **”Why We Miss The Power Of Dominos”**

Ramit talks here about “invisible scripts”. It’s a fancy term for “limiting beliefs” (to use Tony Robbin’s terminology). I think the best example he gives is around money. “I don’t want to have to track every penny of my spending for the rest of my life! (You don’t but that invisible script allows you to not track anything at all.” I see this All The Time with my friends. “All or nothing” Ramit says, is the biggest invisible script. Ever heard of lottery tickets? 

# **”Escaping The Treadmill of Disappointment”**

Because of these “overnight success” stories we expect immediate results. We push hard and we’re ready for the world to change because of our efforts. And then it doesn’t.

[[IMGUR LINK: Why Your Quit And Start Over](http://imgur.com/a4DP7OQ)]

The critical thing to understand is that the dominos grow at an exponential rate. This point really resonates with me personally. In a new business adventure I often forget that the small wins up front count. I recently validated a business idea. Huge win. But man, when I was in the weeds I often felt “can sending this next email really be valuable?” 

The big lesson is understand the sequence that’s needed and stick with it. Do [a lot of work](https://vimeo.com/24715531).

950,f1fv7n,False,,175,I hate being called an entrepreneur,Entrepreneur,"I get it. We have to call ourselves something.

The issue here is that entrepreneurship is no longer being a business owner. It's expanded to anyone who desires to be an entrepreneur. To the point where people call themselves entrepreneur just because they ""think"" they will start a business one day. 

The majority of people I have ever met who called themselves an entrepreneur publicly were those dude bros that watch way too much Grant Cardone. The same guys are the ones constantly crying out about how they don't have any good business ideas. Or even worse. Handing out business cards for eCommerce idea xyz and 3 weeks later they are pursuing business abc because business xyz got way too hard.

Now, I don't know about you guys... I never once referred to myself as an entrepreneur outside of the internet. Instead, I identified myself based upon the specific industry that I work in. Real estate investors call themselves real estate investors. Dentists call themselves dentists. Copywriters call themselves copywriters. Programmers call themselves programmers. And stock traders call themselves stock traders. 

If asked what I do for a living, I never say ""entrepreneur"". Entrepreneur is a very vague term. In social situations people will ask you what that means. If you are unable to describe what your actual skills are then people will see you as a wantrepreneur/dreamer with no actual skills and they will tell you to go get a job. 

It's totally understandable for people for are just starting out to want to come to subreddits like this and forums such as the fastlane forum. You've got to start somewhere and figure out what it is you actually want to be doing. And there is a ton of valuable advice that comes from places like here.

With that being said identifying as an entrepreneur is not enough. Participating on this subreddit or the fastlane forum subreddit is not enough to become successful. 

Here is what I did. And what you really need to being doing:

1. You need to identify your skills/talents. If you don't have any skills/talents, at least figure out what your hobbies are. Is there any way that you can provide value based on your skills/talents/hobbies? Should you first get a job in the niche and develop some skills/expertise before going out on your own? 
2. Join groups, learn from, and network with people in your desired industry. Hang out with coders if you want to code. Hang out with musicians if you want to be a musician. Whether that's offline or online or whatever... You aren't going to make it if you want to fix cell phones and you are taking business advice from truck drivers. You need to be as specific as possible as to where you are getting your information. **If you play tennis it's useless to take advice from someone who plays golf.** Look for a successful tennis player instead. You need to be learning from, doing business with, and building connections with people involved in your specific industry. 
3. Get good at what you do. If you are great at whatever industry that you do for a living, there is a good chance that you will make at least 6 figures. Maybe even make it to the 1%. At the very least you will do a lot better than the majority of ""entrepreneurs"" who are full of ideas and don't ever take action because they don't actually have anything of value. 

**In short, stop identifying as an entrepreneur. There is zero value in calling yourself such. Instead, identify with a skill set or an area of expertise that is profitable and stick with it until you are successful.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/f1fv7n/i_hate_being_called_an_entrepreneur/,397,"I also hate referring to myself as an entrepreneur.

————————

**Lessons in a nutshell**

In an era where the whole world focuses on the extravagant success of entrepreneurs, Hoffman and Casnocha have brought in a fresh insight on how an entrepreneur can be redefined. It turns out that a person doesn’t have to appear on *Forbes’* cover to be an entrepreneur. If one knows how to nurture her/*his career path, she/*he is no doubt an entrepreneur.

In this summary, you will explore

* why everyone has innate entrepreneurial talents
* why being a life-controller is so important
* how to bloom the entrepreneur potential

**Chapters**

1. It’s time to let your entrepreneurial instinct bloom
2. If you want to gain the market, sell something others can’
3. ABZ planning: Always spare an escape
4. Planning doesn’t take a day; it takes a life
5. “Instead of better glasses, your network gives you better eyes”
6. Not all networks are the same
7. Don’t let strangers through the door, except for luck
8. Risk: What you avoid can be your biggest opportunity
9. Intelligence is not for show; it’s for learning

**1. It’s time to let your entrepreneurial instinct bloom**

“*Everyone is an entrepreneur*.” The saying doesn’t mean that everyone can, or should, start a company. However, the core value of entrepreneurship lies in the ability to invent and create, which, coincidentally and fortunately, all people are inherited from their ancestors. 

The definition of “start-up” - a term that is closely related to “entrepreneur” - needs clarifying. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a company or a business of any kind. When our ancestors created caves, the caves were their “start-up,” or the “product” of their creativity. To pursue your dream career is to build a start-up.

Why should everyone establish and develop a career or start-up? Needless to say, one’s profession is what helps a person thrive. As the world changes day by day, it’s increasingly difficult to have an assuring and long-lasting career path that guarantees a happy life. Knowing how to create and maintain a career is more crucial than ever before.

Because a career is no different from a start-up, entrepreneurial strategies can be adopted when you build a career. Entrepreneurial strategies may include many action plans, but the most important strategy is keeping a positive mindset. Tell yourself that you’ll never give up. Failures are frequent, and success never comes overnight. As long as you keep learning, improving, striving and growing, success would finally come.  

**Quote:** *“Whether you’re a lawyer or doctor or teacher or engineer or even a business owner, today you need to also think of yourself as an entrepreneur at the helm of at least one living, growing start-up venture: your career.”*

**2. If you want to own the market, sell something others can’t**

Globalization comes with both opportunities and threats.

The labor market expands rapidly, leading to an increase in high-quality labor. Higher job opportunity for one person means lower chances of success for another. That’s why everyone needs to develop a unique selling point to increase his or her competitive advantage in the job market.

Three elements that make a strong competitive advantage are assets, aspirations and values, and market realities. One’s unique selling point can be sold to the market only when these puzzles perfectly fit each other like one fine picture. Therefore, it’s necessary to evaluate the competence of each piece of the puzzle in order to make a perfect portrait of yourself.

Assets are what a person owns. They can be physical assets, such as cash, credits, housing, etc. They can also be knowledge and soft skills such as communication skills, public speaking skills, critical thinking skills, etc. Assets would be the first thing that other people see when they look at you and get to know you.

Regardless of how many assets a person may have, personal growth cannot be achieved without aspirations and values. Aspirations are the “deepest wishes, ideas, goals, and vision of the future,” regardless of the external world or existing assets. Core values are a part of aspirations: they are what a person considers the most important in his or her life.

Aspirations and values serve as the petrol that keeps a person going. If assets are what a person possesses at present, it is aspirations and values that perfect the assets and shape that person’s future. It’s always more motivational to pursue what you are passionate about rather than what you feel forced to follow. 

The final piece of the puzzle is the market realities. Assets, aspirations, and values only work when put into the right marketplace where you are welcomed. Make sure that the market that you choose is favorable for you to develop to your inner potential. Sometimes, a market that no one but you has thought of, despite being a risky choice, can be the competitive advantage you need.

**Quote**: *“No matter what the demand, you’re not going to be most competitive unless your own passions and strengths are in play.”*

**3. ABZ planning: There’s no easy escape without preparation**

Flickr is considered one of the best web tools for storing, managing and sharing photos in the world. Since its birth in 2004, it’s been consistently developing with more than 5 billion images stored on the websites and 87 million subscribed accounts. However, when it was established, its original plan wasn’t how it seems today.

The website was originally a multiplayer online game called Game Neverending created in 2002. Online games at that time supported only a few people playing at the same time, but the developers of Game Neverending wanted to involve hundreds of players at once. They started to create groups and instant messaging on the website to increase interaction. Eventually, they added a function that helped to share screenshot pictures during the game among players.

The final add-on surprisingly overshadowed the main purpose of the game in popularity. It was at that time that the developers had to consider dropping the original plan or continuing it. In the end, they decided to part from the original plan and continue with a brand new plan. That was how Flickr became one of today’s most effective photo-sharing platforms.

In the career market, situations like Flickr’s frequently arise. Difficult decisions in decisive moments have the power to change a person’s or firm’s destiny. Therefore, these decisions should be prepared firsthand. ABZ planning would support you in carrying out this difficult task.

In ABZ planning, the letter “A” stands for *Plan A: Aim and Fire (and repeat)*. Plan A makes use of your assets: develop what you’ve got at the moment and implement them. It includes a string of aims and actions you can immediately implement once you’re ready. When executing plan A, failures frequently occur, but it’s okay. What matters is that you have to try as hard as you can without giving up.

When plan A doesn’t work anymore, it’s time for a change - plan B. Plan B is ignited when you pivot using knowledge and experience you’ve learned from failures while conducting plan A.

Sometimes plan B is simply an updated version of plan A; sometimes, it is totally different. No matter what, make sure that plan B would help you better to the market compared to the previous plan.

If nothing works, plan Z in ABZ planning is the exit plan. Like a lifeboat, plan Z should be much more certain than all previous plans so that it can save you from drowning and ensure your safety. However, bear in mind that floating on a lifeboat doesn’t mean that your life is over. Plan Z is not the end; on the contrary, it is the opening for a new, better plan A.

**Quote**: *“There is no beginning, middle, or end to a career journey; no matter how old you are or at what stage, you will always be planning and adapting.”*

**4. Planning doesn’t take a day; it takes a life**

ABZ planning is not a kid’s bingo game. It takes a lot of time and consideration to make a practical plan while minimizing potential risks. There are several criteria on which to build this plan.

Firstly, build your plan based on your competitive advantage. It’s essential, therefore, that you find your unique selling point before jumping into creating a plan.

Your assets would help you build hypotheses, for example, “I’m good at Maths, so I’ll be a financer at Wall Streets.” Each hypothesis should lead to a proper action plan, which would later become different ways of implementation in plan A. 

Soft assets - knowledge and soft skills - are much more invaluable than hard assets like spending power. Soft assets help people build and maintain their careers in the long run, and they need frequent improvements. Whatever you decide to do next should utilize your skills and broaden your knowledge.

The best way to learn is through experiences. Sometimes it takes a little risk to test if hypotheses can become facts, and it’s every entrepreneur’s responsibility to take a risk. However, it’s better to make reversible, small bets rather than risk it all. It’s a part of plan Z - always spare yourself an escape.

Use time wisely. Never wait until it’s too late to do something. For instance, you can build plan A and plan B simultaneously rather than consecutively. The first step should be a firm but also a flexible one so that there can be many choices for the next steps.

Finally, try not to tie yourself to a specific employer. It’s not bad to be loyal and completely passionate, but flexibility is what makes ABZ planning so useful and feasible. More importantly, maintaining an identity - or retaining the unique selling point - requires you to be yourself, not your employer. Don’t let the position own you; own it instead.

**Quote**: *“ABZ Planning isn’t something you do once early in your career. It’s a process as important for someone in their forties or fifties as for a newly minted college grad.”*

**5. “Instead of better glasses, your network gives you better eyes”**

“World-class professionals build networks to help them navigate the world.” There is a reason why humans have been forming communities and groups ever since they were born millions of years ago. Aside from providing a sense of belonging, surviving in groups creates better proficiency and protection for everyone in the community.

If teams are important to individuals, individuals are equally important to teams. A team cannot succeed without its excellent individuals, just like how individuals need support from their teammates to shine their light. Therefore, it’s important to know how to deal with relationships, especially during your career development path.

An important principle everyone needs to remember is that giving is receiving. A networker will seek advantages of being friends with another person, while a relationship builder will ask himself what values he can bring to others. All essential and long-lasting relationships are and should be built based on sincerity rather than taking advantage of each other. So, you should be a relationship builder rather than a networker.

A relationship that isn’t frequently taken care of is a fragile relationship, no matter how strong it was at the beginning. No one wants an out-of-the-blue email after a long time without contact, so spend time maintaining contact with others. People often fear that they would disturb the other person, but that’s not the case. Anyone would appreciate a friend that takes the initiative in the relationship.

The power of social media in the modern era cannot be denied. It doesn’t cost much time or money to make frequent contact on social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. However, it should be noted that the virtuality world isn’t enough. Whenever possible, try to invite people over for lunch or dinner.

It’s sad but true that not every relationship lasts forever. In certain situations, there would be no use trying to keep a relationship. The best way to solve the situation is to let the relationship slowly fade away rather than actively delete it. By doing so, trust can remain, and the relationship can still be reactivated at the appropriate time.

**Quote**: *“Relationships are living, breathing things. Feed, nurture, and care about them: they grow. Neglect them: they die.”*

**6. Not all networks are the same**

It’s necessary to understand the networks that you want to build. Between personal relationships and professional relationships, it is professional relationships that increase the opportunities to develop a career and improve ourselves.

Professional allies are the ones who come first to your mind when you need advice. These people can be your seniors, colleagues, or even juniors at work, but they share a similarity: they’ve earned your trust. Allies are the people on whom you can rely for their consultancy.

Allies are so whom you can proactively share and collaborate. They have something in common with you, they share some similarities and interests with you, and you know they’ll work well with you. These traits are vital to figuring out if a person is a right partner for you.

Finally, allies are the ones that mean more than just ordinary colleagues to you. You call them friends, defend them, promote them, help them, and stand up for them. A true ally, or in this case, a true friend, would do the same for you. That’s how you realize whether you have made the right allies or not.

Weaker ties and acquaintances form an entirely different network. They are people with whom you maintain a friendly relationship without being too close, and you don’t necessarily actively know them. Believe it or not, they are the ones who bring you the best opportunities.

Let’s say you and your friends share many interests, which means what he knows is likely to be what you’ve already known. Acquaintances, on the other hand, don’t know you that deeply. Thus, they’ll introduce to you the most unexpected chance, which is both risky and worthwhile.

The important key to bear in mind in building relationships is that the networks need to be both broad and deep. While the breadth of relationships helps people reach as many suitable opportunities as possible, the depth of them is what keeps people survive and make the best use of those opportunities.

**Quote**: *“There are various types of relationships in personal and professional contexts, from intimate friends and family to polite coworker contacts to medium-strength trust connections. Each type of relationship is different.”*

**7. Don’t let strangers through the door, except for luck**

Success begins with opportunities. Networks and all of the necessary skills are built to wait for the right opportunities. So the question to raise here is: what kind of opportunity is everyone looking for?

George Clooney was a B-class actor for twelve years despite his good looks, natural talent, and hard work. It was not until 1994 did he come across his life-changing opportunity: an overly-costed gritty medical drama named *ER*. There had never been such a drama at the time, so it would be a huge risk for Clooney to accept the main role. But he accepted it anyway. The result was an astounding career that hardly any other actor can dream of.

Clooney’s story is an example of having a breakout. “Breakout” is the term implying the unusually rapid growth. There’s no ultimate success without luck. Luck only counts for 1 percent in one’s success, but that doesn’t mean it’s not important.

The most important criterion to find and generate career opportunities is to nurture curiosity. Getting used to the question “why” in whatever situation is an important habit. Learning to be curious enhances critical thinking by helping people examine each hypothesis carefully before making a decision.

Remember the importance of creating and maintaining relationships? It is one’s networks that bring the best breakout opportunities to that person. The number of possibilities is rather synonymous with the number of people you can connect to.

That’s why being in a group or a community plays such an important role in one’s career path. If joining an existing group isn’t what you want, consider creating your own group with specific characteristics that you want to develop and spread within that small community.

Creativity and boldness must always exist in any entrepreneur. Great opportunities seldom fit any body’s schedule. Being bold or you won’t ever have the same moment again.

**Quote**: *“There are always breakout projects, connections, specific experiences, and yes, strokes of luck—that lead to unusually rapid career growth.”*

**8. Risk: What you avoid can be your biggest opportunity**

Sometimes, risks mean opportunities no one would expect. Risks are a permanent part of life - that’s why being friends with risk, instead of being its enemy, is the best way to deal with and take advantage of it.

In a career context, risks are “the downside consequences from a given action or decision and the likelihood that the downside actually occurs.” It is the other side of the coin that always exists; it is the reason why in ABZ planning, there are so many back-up plans supporting each other. In fact, entrepreneurs are bold risk-takers. It takes them years to figure out a list of tips to deal with and take advantage of risks.

Almost everyone tends to overrate risks. Humans were born with three main misconceptions to keep them survive, and one of them is overestimating threats.

Paying attention to potential threats is necessary, but they can often be exaggerated, especially in situations where people encounter them for the first time. That is when you need to calm down and estimate the risks carefully.

There must be a reason that ABZ planning has Plan A and Plan B with numerous implementations before going to Plan Z. When conducting the ABZ plans, remember not to freak out and jump from one plan to the next too quickly. You should first see if how serious the current situation is, then figure out whether it can be reversed or improved by any chance before deciding to change the plan. 

Some circumstances imply risks to others, but not to you. It’s your mission to critically assess all the probabilities and make your own decision. Moreover, questionable situations can also be the best opportunities. In conclusion, being bold and calm will help you win against yourself. 

**Quote**: *“There’s competition for good opportunities. And because of that, if you can intelligently take on risk, you will find opportunities others miss.”*

**9. Intelligence is not for show; it’s for learning**

Entrepreneurs don’t only create, they also learn from their creation process. It is the ability to learn actively and synthesize information that gives that person the most potential to be the best in his or her chosen field. These ultimate skills would determine if a person wins or loses in the end.

Gathering information in the business context is often called “gathering intelligence.” Intelligence in this context is “actionable, timely information on all facets of the business.” In other words, intelligence is what makes up a person’s skills and experience, and is shaped through learning and self-improving.

Learning from others is the best type of learning. The best way to earn intelligence, therefore, is through one’s networks. Again, this is another reason why building relationships is so essential: it plays a role in almost every aspect of building a stable and successful career. The stronger and broader is a person’s networks, the more he is going to learn.

Pulling the right information, or intelligence, from your networks, is another skill that needs enhancing. Before asking questions, regarding the breadth and depth of your relationships. No matter if you ask a mass number of people at the same time or each individual, consider the status of those relationships carefully before thinking of questions.

It is vital to know how to ask good questions. A vague or too broad question would be difficult to answer, and it can even show that you’re not thinking critically before asking. Make sure that your question does not annoy the questionees, and don’t ask things that are too obvious.

The final step would be synthesizing information. It’s important to spend time rearranging all the information you’ve got into one big neat picture. Only by doing this can others’ information become yours. To sum up, “good synthesis is what makes the whole worth more than the sum of the parts.”

**Quote**: *“How you gather, manage, and use information will determine whether you win or lose.”*

**Summary**

In the end, there is no fixed list of tips that guarantee one’s success. Every person is an entrepreneur, which means everyone should have his or her own way to shape his or her life. Consider this book as a guideline for you to explore your entrepreneurial potential. The rest of history is in your hands.

40,56xvo1,False,,391,"How We Made $150,000 Profit Slinging T-Shirts As A Side Business In 2016",Entrepreneur,"I saw the other t shirt thread on here the other day and thought you guys might be interested in a completely different approach. Unlike the other thread, where they picked a single niche and went through getting feedback, testing small versions of their ideas, and asking customers what they wanted, my business partner and I did something completely different. We decided to go after what was already selling and attempt to give customers a better design. On top of that, we decided to sell them on Amazon.com with as little work as possible since this was a side business. Here is [exactly how we did it](http://www.passive.marketing/made-150000-merch-amazon-2016/). We managed to hit $150,000+ in profit within a single year.

**MERCH BY AMAZON (POD SERVICE)**

I am sure you have all heard of other print on demand (POD) services out there. I know a lot of shit is talked about starting t shirt companies, and I completely understand why. Most people fail when they start one. I have given half attempts before at selling shirts on Teespring or other services. The issue is you have to drive your own traffic (which costs money), and tons of testing to get it right. I failed as well, along with the majority of other people.

Well, late last year, Amazon announced they were coming out with their own print on demand service. They were calling it Merch By Amazon. All you would have to do was sign up, upload designs, and they would take care of printing, shipping, and customer service. The best part was there were no minimums. If someone bought 1 design, they would print that single design and ship it. All you had to do was upload.

If you are at all interested, you can sign up here: [https://merch.amazon.com/landing](https://merch.amazon.com/landing). It changed into an invite only program, so you will need to sign up and wait. Everyone gets accepted but it may be some time in the future as they can barely keep up with demand the way it is. You see, they first thought that this program was going to be used just by developers, but other people saw the money signs, and it quickly was changed to invite only.

**TIER SYSTEM**

When you first get an account, you are capped at 25 designs. You must sell 25 shirts before getting tiered up to 100. You must sell 100 shirts to be tiered up to 500. So on and so forth. Currently, the biggest tier I know of personally is 8,000 (where my account currently stands).

We knew when we signed up that we needed to increase the amount of slots we could upload as fast as possible. Both my partner and I had an account and tried out two different strategies. He through up as many designs as he could but out priced the competition. This quickly got him 25 sales, and tiered up. For my account, I went a bit slower but focused my time on Amazon BSR (more on that below).

**Quick Note:** If you are designing your own shirts, there is ZERO costs up front. If you price a shirt at 19.99, you make almost $8 per shirt sold. If you sell your shirt at $15.99, you make 4.28 per shirt.

**MAKING SALES WITH ZERO MARKETING**

As you see above in the note, if you are designing your own shirts, you do not have to put any money up front. This is great because if you have a shirt that is not selling, you are not stuck holding the bag on all that inventory. It also allows you to pivot your strategies if they are not working quickly.

You may look at the numbers posted and think why would you waste your time making $4.28 per t-shirt sold? The answer is, because you are selling on Amazon, one of the most trafficked sites on the internet. They get so much traffic each and every day, that if you set up your listing properly, you will see organic sales.

Not only will you see organic sales, but you do not have to go mad with dealing with reviews (like we had to with PL on Amazon). People feeling lost over the latest review policy on Amazon will be happy to know that with Merch you pay almost no attention to reviews.

So how did we set everything up to make sales without paying a dime to market them? We based all our designs off niches and designs that were already selling!

There is no need to reinvent the wheel here. All we needed to do was find something that was selling well, and improve the design in some way.

To do this, we look at Amazon BSR or best sellers rank. Each and every listing that is selling at all has one of these. You can find it by finding a product on Amazon, scrolling down to the product information, and you should see something that looks like this:

http://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/additional-information.png

Here you can see the Amazon Best Sellers Rank for this item. The BSR is a representation of how well that item is selling. From my time selling on Amazon FBA and selling on Amazon Merch, a good rule of thumb is that if an item has a BSR of 100,000 in clothing, that shirt is probably selling 1 design every day. The lower the number, the more shirts are being sold each day.

If the BSR is around #2,000 you can expect that the shirt is selling 25-50 of that design daily. Around #400,000 and the design is probably selling once or twice a week. The more you sell on Amazon and keep track of the BSR, the better idea you will get on how it correlates to sales. Just remember that the lower the number, the more popular the shirt is with consumers! Keep that in mind when doing research.

**COPYRIGHT**

You also need to have a full understanding that you cannot infringe on copyright with Merch. You may come across some shirts with a very low BSR, but they might have disney characters or sayings on them. You clearly do not own the intellectual property to those sayings or images so this would be infringement. If Merch catches you, they will take that design down and send you an email telling you not to do it again. If you get enough of these, your account will eventually be closed, so you need to be careful.

To ensure no sayings or characters are copyrighted, you should be checking all your ideas through one or both of these websites. I prefer Trademarkia, as they are much more user friendly and I have had zero issues since starting Merch by using them.

* [Trademarkia](http://www.trademarkia.com/)
* [USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database)

**FINDING DESIGNS**

Now that you understand Amazon’s Best Sellers Rank, and know that you need to be checking Copyright, you can now start looking for designs. The goal is to find shirts with a low BSR that cannot be Copyrighted. This means they are SELLING and that customers like products in that niche. You can then go on to create shirt designs that are much better than what is currently being offered and make sales!

You could go on Amazon and start searching for keywords. You could go and click on each individual shirt that pops up for your keyword searches and look at each listing to see what the BSR is. You could also search for each and every name through Trademarkia individually.

These are the exact steps that we took when building our accounts at first.

… But it took a long time! What started out as a side project, ended up taking time away from multiple other projects that we were working on.

> I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. ~ Bill Gates

So, wanting to continue the upward trend in earnings without wasting our time searching hundreds of listings on Amazon, we came up with a better way.

**WE CREATED OUR OWN SOFTWARE**

For the last 5 months, along with growing on Merch by Amazon, we have been developing a way to automate the process of finding low enough BSR t-shirts to improve on: **[Merch Informer](http://merchinformer.com/)**.

Without sitting here and selling you on the idea, we have actually been using it for the past few months to grow the account. Merch Informer lets you search up to 5 keywords at once, take the top 100 best selling t-shirts for each of those keywords and sort them by Amazon’s best seller rank. This allowed me to save a shit load of time when coming up with the designs, and then could easily combine them into a list, and fire them off to my designers.

Here are a couple of screens of the software. Pretty proud of what we have created so far. We have not released it yet, but will within the next week hopefully.

**OUTSOURCING DESIGNS**

I am a big believer in bootstrapping your own business until you can afford to pay other people to do the dirty work. When I first started with Merch, I designed all my shirts. I think I designed around 125-150 before the concept could start paying for itself. I am a god awful designer and can barely use photoshop but a few hours on Youtube tutorials and I was able to create enough designs to start paying some bills.

After I knew I could reinvest the money, I went out to hire some designers. I know Upwork screwed a lot of us over with their change in pricing structure, but that is still the best place I know of to find talent. Here is the exact script I used to hire a couple of full time designers that are still with me to this day:

> Hey, I am in need of 400 t-shirt designs in the time period of 2-3 months.
> 
> Your task will be pretty basic, I will send you ideas of t-shirts I want to make and you make them even better and unique. For example, I might send you a link of a already existing tshirt and I would need it being inspired by it and made even better and unique.
> 
> I will leave you a lot of 5* reviews so that you will be able to get jobs easier in the future and this is a long-term position needed. Once we have done the first batch of 400 – around 4 per day, we could continue if everything looks good.
> 
> I look forward to doing business with you!

I ended up paying $4 per design. I looked at this as a zero sum game as you can get the designs for $4, and if you sell a single design you make $4.28 (if you price at $15.99 per shirt), so I knew that even if I was spending money to outsource, I would eventually make it back since I was selling on the biggest marketplace out there.

**Quick Tip On Getting Rid Of Bad Designers:** 

When I first tried to hire someone to design for me, they stole images and straight up copied designs. This is wrong, and will get your Merch account banned. I was not able to use any of these designs.

When I first hired someone, I let them know that they cannot use any images which are Copyrighted, or infringe on any Copyright someone else owns.

Then, I will send them a T-Shirt idea that is very clearly Copyright infringement. If they copy it or do not change it enough to be considered free use, I will immediately get rid of that designer. The design may have cost me $4, but that is an extremely small price to pay to weed out the copycats!

**SELLING YOUR T-SHIRT BUSINESS**

When it comes down to it, this is a business and should be treated as such (not just a hobby). We are all here to make money.

I have hinted at this in the past, but now it is just time to come out and say it.

Earlier this year, my business partner and I decided to sell a Merch account. Since the platform was so new, we knew it was going to be difficult to find a buyer.

We reached out to a few website brokers, but none of them were willing to accept a Merch account as the vast majority did not have any idea what the platform even was! Then I got in touch with my friends at [Empire Flippers](https://empireflippers.com/). They just did an AMA here by the way!

I had sold a site with them previously and am told it is still doing well to this day. I reached out and asked if they would be interested in taking on this project and selling it for me.  It turns out they were! I described exactly what the platform was, how it works, and what needed to happen to get the process started.

Since it is not a website, I simply paid the listing fee, and then emailed them over all the earnings statements and documents needed to prove that we owned the account and it was making what I said it was making. The account averaged about $3,000 a month at that point.

I ended up doing a seller interview with them, and got the listing posted.

http://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sold.png

We talked to a bunch of interested parties, but finally came to an agreement and sold the account without an issue!

**WHERE WE ARE TODAY**

There we have it. All the steps laid out 1-by-1 that we used to make over $150,000 in 2016 with Merch by Amazon. When you add up the monthly earnings that account was making, the sales price, and what my account is currently doing per month, you can see the vast opportunity that is in front of us. There has never been an easier way to make money online than by selling T-Shirts on Amazon.

http://www.passive.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/amazonmerch2.png

To leave you with a little inspiration, here is my current account sales for the week. You can see how many shirts I currently have live as well as what tier I am at. Good luck out there and keep pushing forward!

816,eawpmx,False,Feedback Please,182,I grew Visa List to $5000 per month after developing it for a year,Entrepreneur,"[Visa List](https://visalist.io) started out as simple list of visa requirements for all countries with detailed visa process and documents for 50 countries so that travellers can go anywhere they want easily. This was a solution to visa issues I faced when I wanted to travel. Since then it's grown to 100+ countries and now features visa exemptions, dual passport requirements and many data points like flight prices, weather, distance, economy status and travel advice. I’m adding new countries every day so that you can use Visa List for all your visa requirements.

Visa List makes money mostly from ads and affiliates. Most of the site is freely usable but to use some filters, community chat and visa advice, you need to pay. Users pay monthly, annual or once for a lifetime membership. Revenue ranges from $5,000/m to $6,000/m. See [https://visalist.io/open](https://visalist.io/open). It became profitable after 2 months of launch.

But it didn't start making $5000 immediately, it started with $500 per month and grew slowly over the span of a year.

Initially I placed ads on visa list and was getting around 100K pageviews around a month. But the ads revenue was not that great at all. I tried to apply for skyscanner partnership because I knew that there would be good need after getting visa, but unfortunately I got rejected. I think the main reason was it was I was not getting a lot of traffic.

With a heavy heart I tried different ad networks like video ads, content ads but none of them improved the revenue. All this while, i never lost sight of my goal to increase the SEO and along the way get more users to Visa List.

Suddenly after a month I got an email from skyscanner from saying that they are interested in partnering with, this was another team. I was so happy and realised that things come around eventually. In a month I integrated skyscanner and it started a good stream of revenue from visa list.

After 5 month around june, people from iVisa contacted me. They provide visa service and visa assistance across the world which was perfect. I was very happy to partner with them as well and thus opened 3rd revenue stream.

Along the way I also learning AdOps so i could monetize the traffic I was getting and finally after 6 months things started working out. So my first channel also started contributing a good chunk to overall revenue.

After around 8 month i started an experiment with Visa List membership which i have been sitting on it for a long time. I was not really sure what was the most valuable information that travelers really need so they won't mind paying. Looking at Nomad list and starter story, i finally put in a set of features that i thought can be useful for Pro members. I'm happy that the experiment paid off adding to the 4th revenue stream.

So looking back, it was not a single thing but a lot of small things done right over an year.

A year back, I launched the first version of Visa List on Product Hunt. It's been a crazy adventure since then. I've travelled to 10 countries during this time and along the way Visa List has helped more than 2 Million people from all over the world with their visa needs. Today I launch the second iteration of Visa List, I've worked on this with passion, some doubts and lots of love from friends, family and indie community. I made everything on this site mostly by myself so I'm super excited.

This is my 3rd successful microstartup and I spent most of my time over the last 2 years making this, thank you for being part of it 🙃

1. People don't book with skyscanner. They book with airlines or google flights.
2. People don't get visas with ivisa. They get directly form the embassy.

748,dfzhwr,False,Startup Help,191,"Want to learn how much does SEO cost? I surveyed 242 agencies, freelancers, and consultants to learn how they price and package their SEO services. Here are some of the top takeaways...",Entrepreneur,"I ran a survey to find out what you should expect to pay for SEO services and 242 people responded.

My goal was to get data-driven answers on five questions:

1. What are the typical hourly rates for SEO services?
2. What are the typical monthly retainer rates for SEO services?
3. What payment models are most common?
4. What SEO services do most offer?
5. What may affect the pricing? (This was more my analysis on the data).

The responses provided some solid insights and valuable data, with a 6% margin of error at a 90% confidence level. 

Additionally, I compared my findings to Credo’s 2015 pricing survey, and Moz’s 2012 pricing survey to help give more context.

I also sourced quotes from SEO experts like Marie Haynes, Dan Shure, John Doherty, Bruce Clay, and Andy Crestodina.

## Some highlights from this survey on how much SEO costs:

1. **62% of respondents price their services between $76 and $150 an hour.** 75.6% charge less than $150 per hour. The majority of contractors may be underpricing themselves. Marie Haynes will share why she believes someone good at SEO should charge at least $150 per hour.
2. **24.6% of respondents indicated that they charge between $1,000-2,000/month.** About a third (30.6%) charge less than $1,000/month. But nearly a quarter (23%) surveyed charge $4,000/month or more.
3. **Pricing is challenging to master.** 81% of respondents change their rates based on the service they offer.
4. **The top three most popular services offered** are on-page SEO (82%), keyword research (81.2%), and content creation (76.8%), yet only 2% identify themselves as part of a content agency.
5. **Only 34.4% of those surveyed offer infographic or visual design services.** Perhaps infographics are a dying trend. Or maybe this is an untapped opportunity.

123,6c3t83,False,,258,"Two months ago I lost my job. Instead of getting another, I started a business. My wife hated the idea, so we came up with 3 goals I have to achieve or I get another job. I completed the first goal on the last possible day.",Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit!

My name is John and in February 2017 I was let go from my cushy, corporate job in Finance where I worked for the past ten years. Admittedly, I had become complacent and needed a serious change. I was given a few months to look for a job while employed, but since I had not kept up my learning I found it difficult to move into a similar position that paid close to what I was making (due to other candidates being more qualified). 

**Why not just get another job?**

Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to start a business. However, the demands of my job had made it difficult (not impossible) to start something on the side. Looking at the situation as glass half-full, it seemed that this all may be happening for a reason. I also had the benefit of not having any kids (yet), and my car was going to be paid off in March.

**The Idea**

I spent the first half of my twenties learning everything I could about the stock market, options, trading, and anything similar. The second half of my twenties my learning fell off, and when I picked it up again, I found it extremely difficult to get good data unless you were:

- A programmer (I was not)
- Rich (nope)
- Worked for a company that had access to it (no, and certainly rules against using that for personal use)

I was very good with Excel (non-vba), and highly-knowledgeable with basic to advanced financial concepts. I knew how to value companies, but I did not know how to get good data. I was very interested in programming and automation concepts, but did not have years of time to learn how to code. 

I worked towards a simple idea: an online repository of data. This dropbox-like navigation would house different datasets from multiple categories, starting with the data I had trouble getting in the first place: stock prices. It would contain CSV files (since Excel and Sheets is what I knew how to use) and would be a familiar interface for uploading and downloading. Users would not have to know how to use APIs, advanced programming languages, or complicated programs. And since I knew how to use Excel, I would also include automation templates that users could download and use on their own.

I now had an idea, seed capital (aka severance) and time. I presented these pieces to my wife who was…not happy. She was, rightfully so, worried. Starting a business is risky, daunting, and ruthless. If I was going to do this, she wanted an exit plan. 

**The Milestones**

We worked together and come up with these milestones. While aggressive, they have provided me with an actionable framework to work towards. 

1. Get one sale within the first two months
2. Get 100 sales by the sixth month
3. Grow at 10% per month for months six through 12

As I left my job on February 13th, this left with the following timeline:

- One sale by April 13th (completed on April 12th)
- 100 sales by August 13th
- 175 paying customers by February 13th, 2018

While extremely excited, I am nervous. 

**The Challenges**

Since being out on my own, I have found a few things to be rather challenging:

1. What is an appropriate way to balance time? 
2. How do you juggle product development vs. marketing?
3. I always hear the term “minimal viable product” but how do you know when it becomes minimum viable? If a website loads in 3 seconds, is that fine? What about 10 seconds?
4.	I come from a background in finance. I can forecast with my eyes closed. But when it comes to marketing, I sometimes feel lost. 
5.	Things break and have unexpected consequences every day
6.	I use the rule of 5: Estimate how long something will take you, then multiply it by five

**Products I currently use (not affiliated with any of the listed products)**

- **Wordpress**. Enough has been said here, but I now know how to build a website that loads faster than 90% of the websites out there. FREE
- **Divi theme**. While a bit pricey, the features and ease of use are AMAZING. Would recommend to anyone. I actually stopped the monthly piece, so you can still get the theme, you just lose support and updates. $89 one-time, FREE on-going
- **Vultr and Digital Ocean**. High performance SSD cloud hosting for the website. I needed a solution that offers good performance, and could be modified for future scaling. Two servers (one for site, one for vault) @ $40 per month
- **Nextcloud**. Open-source, dropbox-like software. This is the interface for the data repository. FREE
- **Canva**. Awesome for coming up with graphics for anything you can think of. $13 per month
- **Namecheap**. Where I purchased the domain name. Negligible cost, not worth noting. If you go with a less used TLD (such as .club instead of .com) it comes out to $0.88 a YEAR
- **Cloudflare**. Great for speeding up websites, however the current website is pretty light load so this may be overkill…but it’s free
- **Blockspring**. Awesome Excel/Google Sheets add-in that makes calling APIs extremely easy. I use this in a good amount of the automation templates I offer on the vault. $15 per month
- **Zapier**. Automation tool. $20 per month. Currently used to fill up my…
- **Buffer**. Scheduling tool for social media profiles. $10 per month
- **Upwork**. I have one developer on staff who I sourced from Upwork. She is amazing, and has been extremely helpful in initial development I was unable to do. Ranges from $200 to $400 per month. I do not have the link at the moment, but someone on this subreddit had a great write-up on sourcing talent from Upwork
- **Data feed**. The most expensive piece, but absolutely required to put the data into the repository. $500 per month. This is exactly the barrier to entry I am trying to knock down for young investors and data-minded individuals. The price is so high due to redistribution (and I foresee this being the most expensive piece going forward)

***Monthly cost:  ~$838 to $1038 per month***

**Products I have stopped using**

- **Intercom**. At this stage in my business this is not needed. Too expensive considering the traffic to the website is very light. I can get around this with a simple contact form, or use a cheaper solution (like Cugiq). However I do think the product is rock-solid
- **Hunter**. While I think the product is really awesome, it is pretty expensive for a newcomer and Blockspring provides some workarounds that give similar functionality
- **SocialQuant**. I made the mistake of thinking I needed a large twitter following to gain credibility. This was a waste of money, and apparently there are ways to boost your followers on Twitter quite easily without any money (but pointless). Makes more sense to grow organically
- **Wix**. My original website was here, but it was missing some needed functionality. I was also worried about the SSL issues they were having (might still be having) so I went with WP
- **Kickoff Labs**. I had an idea for an initial launch with a viral marketing campaign, and so I started a kickoff labs subscription. This was dumb because Wordpress offered ways to build landing pages and viral campaigns, so I stopped using
- **Buzzstream**. Only temporary, as I believe I will use this in the future, but Blockspring has similar functionality that can take up 90% of what Buzzstream can do. The remaining 10% will be when the business grows

I went a little product happy in the beginning, but now I have settled down a bit. I now look for ways to consolidate functionality.

**Skills I have gained since being on my own**

It is quite amazing what you can learn when you are excited, motivated, and ready to tackle the day every day:

- I can now setup a Wordpress website that will load faster than 90% of the websites out there
- Intermediate knowledge of VPS, dedicated servers and baremetal
- Basic scripting in PHP, Python
- Learned how to call, and modify APIs
- Advanced Nextcloud integration
- Blockspring
- Zapier, where I setup an automatic updating of my Buffer queue based on specific pages of the website. I also setup a Twitter marketing tool that will search Twitter for specific terms (less retweets), extract out the users that sent the Tweet, check to see if they are currently following me, then send the list of names and tweets to me by email every day at 9am
- Intermediate knowledge of bash commands
- I have read about 6 books, including: Traction, Growth Hacker Marketing, From Impossible to Inevitable, 7 Day Startup, Ask, and Platform Scale
- I now know what the hell people are talking about when they refer to new technology (for example, two months ago I couldn't tell you what Hadoop is...just thought it was a funny word)

A good portion of these learnings came about from wanting to save money instead of hiring a developer. While I believe I saved a good amount of money by attempting to do these things myself, hiring a developer for the more difficult parts would have definitely made sense.

**Conclusion**

Luckily, if I happen to fail I will have gained a good amount of additional skills to put on my resume. I look at this situation as a win-win. I plan to buckle down and go pretty heavily in marketing for the next couple of months, in pursuit of reaching 100 sales by August.

If anyone is interested, I would be happy to provide updates on how everything is going. I have learned more in these last few months than I did the prior year.

244,6e066a,False,,210,The drunk cold email that changed my life.,Entrepreneur,"Hey folks,

My story: A good few years ago, I was desperate for sales after my word of mouth work dried up.

I got hellishly drunk one night and wrote a completely absurd cold email. I was still tipsy the next morning and decided it was still a good idea to send it to pretty senior Marketing Directors at big brands.

To my astonishment, it worked. I can't attach images to this post but I got the most amazing complimentary responses and requests for calls/meetings.

My favourite one succinctly said ""My colleague forwarded me your spam email and we would like to meet you to discuss opportunities.""

I’ve met with senior decision makers at RedBull, Pepsi, Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, HSBC, Barclays and countless other global brands, exciting start-ups and regular ol’ SMEs.

I’ve used this same style to get senior editors at large publications to respond to me and publish my clients content. I’ve used it to help people get as many job interviews as they want - and to meet people I really look up to. I’ve recently used it to get booked on some podcasts too.

If you’d like to be able to write cold emails, or direct mail that cut-through the noise and get responses like these, have a read… If you find it useful or have any questions, do comment below.

You can see the copy here: https://twitter.com/SallyB_W/status/740110981922197504.

 This is it in letter form. I wanted to increase my open rates so started sending it in the post, and then following up with an email. The subject line said “Sorry for the ferret in the post”. It worked. Open rates > 80%.

I'm not saying my way is the ONLY way - but it works for me :)
OK - here goes nothing...

[MAKING IMPACT]
- Impact/Communication/Persuasion

So many cold approaches such because they go straight to persuasion.

The very first line starts with something like … “We’re the best people in the world at X… We’ve worked with X client and are ground-breaking X technology is a world’s first…”

YUCK! Of course, that gets deleted!

Your job is to sell the idea that a call or meeting with you is not a bad idea. Not to give every little detail – or to sell your entire offering in one go. Those steps come later…

Dave Trott talks about this when talking about effective advertising.

He brings it down to a level anyone can understand.

Imagine for a moment that you wanted your other half to make you a cup of tea or coffee.

You need first make impact.

“CATH!”

That gets her attention.

The communication is next…

“Cath, will you make me a cup of tea?”

However, that’s not very persuasive.

“If you make me a cup of tea, I’ll take the trash out.”

The same rule applies to direct mail or cold email or any form of effective advertising.

You need to make impact first.

Then communicate.

Then persuade.

You need to stand out.

Your prospect likely gets a ton of other letters and emails (and cold calls) – and they all look and read the same.

You need to make IMPACT.

It’s the single most important thing you should focus on.

Without that, it doesn’t matter how good your communication is. It doesn’t matter how persuasive you are. It doesn’t matter how good your product or service is.

Most people think persuasion is the most important.

They focus on using specific words and formulas and forget you're writing to a human.

You're not trying to beat a machine at chess.

You need to get a reaction. A bite. A nod. A smile. A laugh.

You need people to actually see and read and listen before you can communicate and persuade.

Being able to get cut-through - especially if it's done in a unique or clever way - is persuasive in itself.

Think about that.

[The Warren Buffett Technique]

- Unusual honesty. Credibility.

People get so much crap in their email and in the post. You need to make your prospect switch gears.

We can learn something here from Warren Buffett. In his stock presentations, he starts with bad news.

Why would he do such a thing?

a) He gets the bad news out the way.
b) It’s the honest and correct thing to do.
c) Everything else he has to say has more credibility.

How can you do the do this in your cold approaches?

[Five Things People Get Wrong When Cold Approaching]

- DISARMING CANDOUR

What most people get wrong… and what all of my successful approaches have in common.

Here is a list of 5 common things people get wrong with cold approaches...

They are full of ego.

They try to impress with design or persuade with jargon.

The rhythm and cadence are bland and boring.

They make presumptions - This is common with ‘problem-solving’ type emails.

They play it safe! (This is huge!)

You need to write captivating copy. From the subject line to the last line.

All of my successful approaches - from the absurd to the serious - have one thing in common.

They tell a story.

This is going to sound like pretentious fluff... but there is truth in here.

Why is a story important?

Think about it.

When did you last hear someone say “I saw a great PowerPoint presentation the other day""?

When did you last hear someone say “S/he told a great story""?

Do you have a compelling story that your prospect can be part of?

Or are you just going to write them a boring advertisement?

Are you writing as if you are speaking to one person individually?

Or are you rehashing key statistics, industry trends, and speaking in bullshit jargon?

One is compelling and interesting and entertaining.

The other is dull and boring and what everyone else is doing.

One of my key ‘stories’ I call “The Ambitious Underdog”.

What’s your story?
Are you writing something that your prospect can read and understand where you are coming from?

Will they want to be part of that story?

Will this break through the ‘us and them’ dynamic that normal sales emails reinforce?

Or will it raise the ""sales alarm bells""?

A big part of this is making your intentions known.

It’s about pushing your ego aside.

It’s about taking a chance.

Sometimes this means using humour.

Sometimes this means letting your guard down and being more honest than is normal and expected.

[BREAKING NEWS!]

- PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE!

Ok - a little bit on mindset...

I never had an issue with writing to serious and important and busy business people in an informal way.
I have the opposite problem. I can't write with jargon. I can't hard-sell. I can't do the 'serious and professional' thing. At least, I find this more difficult.

It hasn't been to my detriment.

Of course, you can't be completely off the wall bonkers if it doesn't match your personality and yes - there are circumstances where you may have to take a more serious tone.

But when everyone writes in the same cadence, you need to stand out.

Be daring. Try something different. You need to illicit a response. Make your prospect smile, or laugh or go ""That's clever""... or even ""This person is different...""

It doesn't matter whether someone is a CEO of a global brand or an intern at a start-up - they are all HUMAN! Dun dunn dunnn!!!

So don't put them on a pedestal.

Show some personality.

What's the worst that could happen?

They ignore your message?

That's likely to happen anyway!

BUTTT Maybe they will send an angry/mean response?!

You're sending a cold email... you're interrupting their day! That could happen anyway too!

So you may as well take a chance...

By being distinct - you're going to get far more positive responses than blending in and being boring!

Whenever you get this particular fear, remember... ""PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE!""

Ok. I hope that wasn’t too painful. I hope this post has got you thinking...

Please fire any questions, concerns or weirdly personal insults below.

Stay outta trouble,

Jon

796,524nsm,False,,73,The 10 Things I Learned Crossing 55 Million App Downloads,Entrepreneur,"Hi, my name is Trey Smith and I'm the founder at [Buildbox](https://www.buildbox.com).  I also own a mobile game business that recently crossed 55,000,000 downloads.  As a long timer lurker on /r/startups and /r/Entrepreneur , I thought this might help out some new or existing app entrepreneurs.  

The full article on LinkedIn (with pictures of app examples) is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-things-i-learned-crossing-55-million-app-downloads-trey-smith), but I've also pasted it below.  Thanks. 

**The 10 Things I Learned Crossing 55 Million App Downloads**

Today I logged into our AppFigures account for the first time in nearly 6 months. Running Buildbox has taken up most of my time this year, and I was shocked to see we crossed a major milestone without knowing it. As of last week, we have received more than 55 Million downloads of our games on iPhone, iPad and Android devices.

We've released a multitude of games on mobile devices like Jump Pack, Monster Magic, Maze+, The Pit, Phases, The Line Zen, Endless Sky and more. On our journey we've made many smart moves and even more mistakes. In this article, I'm going to detail the most important ones from both sides of the fence. This is for the entrepreneurs, app creators and indie game lovers that are wanting to create businesses. These are the things I wish I knew before I started.

**#1 Launch your first app fast**

I'm starting with this one, because it's the most important for beginners. Your first app or game is most likely going to bomb. You probably won't think it will, but this has happened to every single app entrepreneur I know, including myself. Actually, I was just talking with David Reichelt today who created Color Switch. Before Color Switch, he completed 40 games that bombed. 40 games. Then of course Color Switch went on to be the most downloaded game of 2016.

Very rarely do you nail it right the first time. What you need to crush it is real world experience. You'll need the bitter taste of failure to show you why it didn't do well. Was it too hard? Too simple? Bad user interface? Too complex to use? Your biggest teacher is your last mistake, and you will learn more from that first experience than anything you could possibly consume online. Once you have conditioned yourself to not fear failure, things get a lot easier.

**#2 Simplify everything about your app**

A common mistake with app creators is cluttering the design. This is extremely typical with new developers. They want to fit everything into their product, so they attempt to do so thinking they are improving the experience. You've heard it many times, and it's very true. Less is definitely more.

A great example of simplicity is The Line Zen. This is a game I created that was published by Ketchapp. The Line Zen was the number one game in multiple countries including the United States, and as you can see below, it is very simple.

It was a sequel to an already minimal game, and after many iterations I decided to keep only 4 colors: red, blue, beige and green. Instead of focusing on a complex design, I put forth more effort into the gameplay and music in the game. Those elements became the star of the show. In the beginning, our games were much more complex. As we will discuss, this narrowed the demographics for the game and also complicated much of the process for users.

Any element of your app experience can be simplified, and you will typically see an increased amount of usage if you do it correctly. The User Interface is the worst offender for complicating design. Only display the most essential information on the screen of any app or game when it's needed. If you are creating games, then don't forget to simplify your gameplay. Make it easy to learn and very accesible on mobile. The recently announced Super Mario Brothers Run game coming to iOS is fully focused on one-touch controls. They obviously have a lot going on graphic-wise, but chose to simplify the gameplay.

**#3 Create apps for a mass audience**

This is an important one that took us a while to truly understand, and is a great reason why so many technology companies are simplifying every aspect of their app and game design.

If your game makes it to the top of the app store, then it will be sitting in front of a truly mass audience. Every possible demographic range will see the app, and if your app is not wide enough, it will fall very fast. With our game, The Pit, we engineered it from the beginning to be completely open demographically.

First, we tried to use english words as sparingly as possible inside the game. We knew our international audience would appreciate animations that explain gameplay and icons instead of text. We also tried to create characters, backgrounds and objects that would resonate with all age groups and genders. The plan worked and the game broke the Top 25 of the app store.

**#4 Quickly identify upcoming trends**

This is an important one. In 2011, we released a game called Jump Pack. This game was the second freemium game to be released on the app store that was not a social game. We saw that social games had proven the concept worked, and we acted fast and put a full freemium economy in our game before release. We identified this freemium trend early and took advantage of it. This allowed us to purchase traffic and actually have a positive ROI, unlike all of our competitors, and we used this to push the game into the Top 25.

We took advantage of another trend early on with another game called Maze+. Apple had just released an option to use their Game Center service to create live multiplayer. This allowed two people to play a game at the same time anywhere in the world. This might be common now, but in 2011 when we released Maze+, we were one of the very first ones to do it. The game was featured by Apple and broke the Top 10 of the app store virally because so many people were sharing the game with friends to try multiplayer.

**#5 Know when to fold 'em**

These examples would not work now, but worked flawlessly when we identified the trend early. Timing is extremely important with trends as their shelf life can be limited. What would work right now? Well, exactly what we are doing: We create a game that we think will have mass appeal and be fun for a wide audience, and then we partner with a publisher who can push the game to the top of the charts. There are lots of great publishers out there for the mobile game world, some we recommend are Ketchapp, Nanovation, Appsolute Games and Umbrella Games. We pick a publisher, we analyze their roster, and try to create a game specifically for them that we think they will like.

Unlike the other examples, this is one we believe will be working for years to come, but it will work even better if you can fuse it with new trends that are on the rise.

After making Maze+ and seeing success, we decided to do something very stupid. Instead of making a sequel to any of our popular games - or expanding on what had made those work - we decided to try and make a true platformer style game that was not popular at all on mobile devices. And, to top it off, we decided to do the opposite of keeping it simple. We also screwed up the #1 item on this list, launching new things fast. Instead, we took almost one year and created countless variations of the game. We broke every rule, and even though the game was beautiful, it never felt right.

I let this game drag on for way to long before finally killing it. We spent thousands of dollars on development we won't get back, but that doesn't bother me as much as the time wasted. We could have easily finished two successful projects in the time we worked on this one.

Why did I spend so much time on it? Because it is a beautiful game. I look at it now and still want to finish it, but the truth is, nothing flowed with this game after the first two weeks. I should have folded sooner.

**#6 Create experiences with emotion**

In the Milo example above, why did I focus so much energy on a game that wasn't shaping up well? Because I was emotionally involved. When humans become emotionally attached, rationale quickly goes out of the window. While emotions are a strong force, they are not usually a negative force. Contrary, they are usually very positive. If Milo's development would have been cohesive, it would have been unstoppable. You can use this same unstoppable force in your business.

Creating a positive emotion through an experience in your app or game will most definitely increase retention. This emotion does not have to be visual, it can be because you are sharing experiences like Snapchat, connecting with friends like WhatsApp or simply hearing beautiful music that causes an emotion.

Using music to bring out emotion has worked really well for us. Both my game, The Line Zen, and our CTO's game, Endless Sky, focused on ethereal music to make the game feel more meaningful.

Be warned though, while music can definitely add a specific feeling to your game, it can also detract. People are very peculiar about their music. Just because you might like dubstep, doesn't mean the general population at the top of the app store will. For example, I have noticed a trend where most of the top games in the app store have no music at all. That is a very interesting data point, and like all data points, there must be a reason behind it.

**#7 Do your own research**

I just mentioned a strange trend I have been noticing: most of the top free games in the app store do not have background music. This is not information I am relaying, but information I noticed while doing my own research.

Every successful entrepreneur I know is in a constant research phase within their industry. It's an imperative skill to have and can wildly set you apart from the competition. Why? Because this is how you build a competitive advantage. No, taking out music won't make or break your game, but when you combine multiple tips you've found from research, it can make a huge difference.

Let me give you an example besides music. Do you know which App Category is the most competitive? That's an important question to ask. To get top chart placement, you first have to get sub-chart placement. If you are in an extremely competitive subcategory, it's going to be tougher to rank in that subcategory and get viewership.

Do you know which day of the week has the most releases? What about which day of the week has the least amount of releases? What day do you think gets the most downloads? If you found a pattern there, such as Sunday has the second most downloads of the week, but the least amount of apps released, do you think that could help give you a push? Sure it could, and that is why doing research is so important.

Now a legitimate question might be, ""How do I do research? That is a broad statement to make"". I totally agree, so let's get to specifics. To do the research, you first need to know the variables. What variables are there in play for the app store? There are many, but I can list a few here for you now: App name, company name, app keywords, category, subcategory, launch day, launch month, icon and description. This is off the top of my head, but if you really dig deep you can find many more variations like trending search, social media traffic, etc.

After you have these data points, you need to start asking questions. Don't know what to ask? Start with a simple formula: What is the best + X + why?

You can literally plug any of those data points into this equation and get a great question:

* What is the best description and why?
* What is the best icon and why?
* What is the best app keywords and why?

Now it's time to find answers to these questions. To do this, you spy on the competition. I could write another full article on this, but a good place to start is to find someone you think is answering your question well. Now research them heavily. Learn everything you can find about their business. Take screenshots of their app flow, find out their keywords, find out if they have a publisher, look at their previous apps and do the research.

If you keep this up, you can have a mountain of information to build your business on that others do not. That can be an amazing competitive advantage.

**#8 Always move forward**

These last three tips are not exclusive to an app or game business, they are general business tips that we've always come back to in my company. They have been extremely important to us and are deeply ingrained into our company culture. They are simple, yet crucial rules for any successful long term business.

The first one, is to always move forward. Your job, as a manager, as a business owner and as an entrepreneur, is to make a decision and move things forward. Now listen, because here is the weird part. It doesn't even have to be the right decision. At least not immediately. And yes, I'm specifically saying that making a lot of bad decisions is much better than making no decisions at all.

Why? Because each of those bad decisions moves you forward. You collect new data points. You learn new things about the process. You educate yourself about a new problem. You learn from it.

Let's say you received two designs for an app and you aren't sure which one to go with. Don't put it off, make a plan and move forward. Either make the call yourself, or construct a plan that will get you results. Maybe that plan is running traffic from Facebook to a blind test or asking your mother-in-law. It doesn't matter, but make a plan and put it to work. Regardless of your decision, you will have new data points in your arsenal. After launching you will be able to read reviews from your users, analyze the design and learn from the experience.

Let's say you hired an employee that deep down you know is not working out. Fire them. It's not easy, everyone hates doing it, and he or she will hate being on the receiving end even more... but it has to be done. There is absolutely no way delaying the process will improve it. You will learn from this as well. You'll have new data points for the next time you hire. Move fast. Not reckless, but fast.

**#9 Always evolve**

This won't kill your business short term, but it most definitely will kill it long term. I've seen this happen to many business friends over the years.

Business in the tech realm is changing extremely fast. Faster than I have ever seen. Even the way people interact with each other is changing on a yearly basis. What is working today might not work tomorrow. You have to evolve with your industry or your business could quickly be left in the dust.

A current example is Snapchat. I've seen many people over 30 putting down the service or joking they ""have no idea what those kids are doing"". Listen, if you find yourself not getting why the most popular app in the app store is popular, you are getting left behind. This doesn't mean you have to post on Snapchat every day, but you should understand why it's popular. You need to know why it's so addicting and why a complete generation of kids are leaving Facebook in droves to use it. When a shift that large happens in an industry you are involved in, it is extremely important for your business that you understand why.

One of the biggest shifts in the mobile industry was premium to freemium. If you look at the Top 100 grossing right now, 99% of the apps are now freemium. Love it or hate it, there is no question that this monetization style is the most effective. When this transition took place back in 2012, many companies were completely left in the dust. Another big transition was when social games evolved into real multiplayer experiences. Multiple companies that were making top social games did not evolve and disappeared from the map.

You should already be identifying trends, so now you look for the shift. If you feel an industry changing, then start testing out the shift early, before everyone else. Move early, and while others are scrambling, your company will already be adjusted.

**#10 Stay excited**

Finally, you absolutely have to keep the excitement up with not only your company, but the industry as a whole. It's the only way to truly make great experiences, do the right research, move forward and evolve. If you start getting bored of your own business, then you need to either exit, pivot or hire someone who is excited to run it.

A great way to stay excited is deeply involve yourself with the industry. Download apps every single week. Find out what Apple and Android are featuring, and most importantly, be extremely curious. The curiosity of it all is probably the most fun part. Try to figure out why some things work and others do not. Analyze the top apps and figure out why they are the top apps. Surround yourself with people who have the same interest. Meet people online, go to conferences, have fun and try to create more things. Stay excited.

419,g6mj9h,False,Best Practices,91,Here is my 14 point conversion triggers checklist that I use to create and optimize landing pages for my customers.,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

Most of the articles on the internet about landing pages have 60 point checklists. 60, serious? These lists suppose to help you but they can only create more confusion and anxiety.

So I created my own list. It contains only major conversion points and triggers. And eventually, I ended up with a 14 point checklist. Believe me, you don't need to overcomplicate things to increase your conversions.

So here I go,

(I'll try to make it short and sweet but also share extra articles and resources at the end of the post)

## #1 Clear Value Proposition

A clear value proposition is a short and compelling summary of the primary benefit that you offer to your prospects.

The attention span of a typical visitor is lower than a goldfish. So you should start talking about your visitor’s pain point and your offer in the very first phrase.

Your value proposition needs to answer these 2 questions within 5 seconds.

1. Which product or service does this website offer? 
2. What is unique about this product or service?  


Here are three things to outline before you write your value proposition.

* **Know your ideal customer.**

Her language, struggles and major pain points that make her upset.

* **Specific and concrete benefits of your product**

.Focus on one primary benefit and include qualitative or quantitative, measurable end results of your product.

* **Unique Strength**

What differentiates you from your competitors? Use your unique strength to convince your visitors.

[https://imgur.com/a/1Alw6Ey](https://imgur.com/a/1Alw6Ey) \- This canvas makes it easy.

## #2 Visual Focus

The background image of the first visual your visitors see. It’s a precious element, it would be a shame to waste it with a static image.

You can match your this visual with the value proposition to empower your message and grab your visitor’s attention. 

Here are some ideas:

* If it’s a personal brand -> Show your face.
* If it’s a product -> Show your product with a happy customer, or show the ease of use or show the interface.
* If it’s a service -> Show happy customers, share a moment from the environment.

Think of how you can get through the feeling or end result of your product to your visitors.

## #3 Short forms

Make your forms short and sweet for higher conversion rates. Ask for an email and that’s it, you have everything to start a conversation.

Long forms are scary, and in general, they have lower conversion rates. Try not to ask people their company, city, dog’s name and how many cousins they have, as long as it’s not a must.

## #4 Call to actions

Right after you talk about their pain points and present your offer, call your visitors for action. Their attention span is short, so you should show the next step before they leave the page.

Blend your value proposition and call to action to make it more effective.

Avoid: “Click here” or “Contact us.”

Instead, use: “Start building a landing page”. Or make it more attractive and write “Build a high-converting landing page now”.

Have a single focus call to action. If your product is too complicated, then you can have a secondary CTA, such as “Learn more about x.”

The design of your CTA is also critical. Try to find attractive colors that complement each other and make sure these colors are matching with your brand identity.

## #5 Social Proof

People don’t know you. And the social proof is a shortcut to building an instant trust.

There are tens of social proof strategies, here are some of the most effective ones:

* Show how many people purchased your product – 3043 people bought this course.
* Written testimonials from your customers
* Video Testimonials. A happy customer could sale better than your best salesperson
* Badges. Such as security or trust badges.
* Logos. Show the brands you have worked with.

## #6 1:1 attention ratio

You know attention is the only currency you have. And you need to guide that attention to your offer, only, lonely. So you should get rid of all clickables, navigation elements, search bar and the rest of distractors.

Keep the attention laser-focused to your holy goal: conversion.

## #7 Make it personalized

Browse subreddits, Quora and specific forums to find out how your target audience speaks and writes. Then try to talk their language on your landing page. 

For example: If your potential customers are millennials, you can use “gimme” instead of “give me” to make them feel like they’re talking with a friend.

They’ll easily choose a friend over your competitors.

Note: Never use complicated words when there is a simple alternative. Try to keep your copy at the elementary level, it’s easier for the brain to understand even when it’s educated.

## #8 Help your visitors by showing all the steps

You think your product is too straightforward and doesn’t need further explanation? Don’t leave a space for assumptions. Show how people can use, configure or implement your product.

Even the most straightforward product needs a step by step explanation. Because these steps give your visitors a sense of security.

This step by step approach will give your visitors a gameplan after they purchase your product. You’re placing stepping stones to help them cross the river of doubt. Use five or six steps at max. Otherwise, you may accidentally over complicate your product instead of helping them.

## #9 Use bullet points to present your features or benefits.

I’ll make this one a live example for you.

**Example 1.**

With landing page software X, you can easily design your landing page by using templates and drag-and-drop features, so no coding skill needed. Also, you can A/B test and connect your landing pages to your favorite marketing tools to get the best out of it. If you have any problems, our customer’s support is on the line to help you, 7/24.

Ok, I confess I wrote it with no love to make it look worst.

**Example 2**

With X:

* No coding skills required.
* Design easily with a drag-and-drop feature.
* Use 100+ templates
* A/B test to find out what works best for you.
* Connect X with your favorite marketing tools.
* 7/24 fast online support.

You see, the first one is crowded and boring.

The second one is effortlessly flowing and snackable.

You know what is even better than that? Transforming the features to benefits. 

To do this, you can sort all of your features and try to squeeze emotional benefits from each.

**For example:**

* No coding skills required – You’ll never be dependent on an IT guy who rarely keeps his deadlines.
* Use 100+ templates – With templates, you’ll save hours and instead, you can spend your time doing your favorite things.

Always use bullet points instead of long sentences to make your points concise and attractive.

## #10 Page speed optimization

Is your landing page loads slower than 3 sec? WTF, are you living in a cave or smt?

Yes, people are annoyed if your page loads slower than 3 sec and then they bounce. And you’ll never see each other again.

The speed of your landing page is a passive component but it’s super important for two reasons. 

**One:** as I mentioned, you lost your precious visitors.

**Two:** It also gives you the upper hand to rank higher on Google search.

There are many ways to find out your page speed, Google's speed test is my go-to.

After you took the test, follow the suggestions of Google to make your page faster

## #11 Clear communication (what, why, how)

Make sure that your visitor immediately knows what he can get (WHAT), how he can get it (HOW) and why he needs it (WHY). 

You can map out the structure of your landing page with these three communications pillars. The order can be flexible for each product, but in general, it’s like that:

**Why?** You’re embarrassed because you have a sweating problem.

**What?** Sweatnot can help you to get rid of your sweaty palms.

**How?** You can buy it by clicking the CTA and start using it in three easy steps. 

I know what you’re thinking and no, I don’t have a sweating problem.

## #12 Mobile Friendly – Responsive

If there were a constitution of the landing pages, that would be one of the major laws. Seriously, triple check your landing page and optimize it for your mobile visitors. 

## #13 Create urgency

Scarcity increases the conversion rates but it needs to seem natural and rational. It’s a robust psychological trigger called[ loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) and also known as FOMO.

These days, almost everything is limited edition and available for a limited time, so don't try to make a monkey out of your visitors. Use it carefully.

## #14 Repeating the call-to-action

Hey, do you remember me? It’s me again, call to action and I’m here to transform you to into a customer.

No jokes here, Don’t hesitate to repeat your CTA 2 to 3 times more on your landing page. Your visitors could get distracted and drift away without clicking your call to action.

So add some more action.

## So what does your landing page looks like?

Here is a scheme I use. You don't strictly have to hold on to the order.

**Header**

* Value proposition
* Matching visual
* Tagline
* Form
* Call to action
* **Section 1**
* Description + video if possible
* **Section 2**
* How to use the service or products
* **Section 3**
* Social proof
* **Section 4**
* Call to action -> link to the header.

That's it folks. I hope you learned something out of my post.

739,5dct2m,False,,147,"From idea to cash in less than 7 days, here's what I did.",Entrepreneur,"Six months ago I was living in Bangkok, I'd been let go from a job I'd had for an American company, and had spent 2-3 months trying to figure out my online ""thing."" 
I spent about a week mulling over some dropshipping ideas, a few days thinking about geo arbitrage, Amazon FBA, loads of things, all of which probably would have worked if I'd have put the required effort in.

I'd built websites in the past (just simple Wordpress,) I knew a little about how SEO worked, I'd had a failed travel blog I let expire, and I had no savings. It was getting pretty dire.

I decided to read Dan Norris' book 7 Day Startup and thought, fuck it, if I just give this a go at least I'll only lose a week if it doesn't work. (Always a great attitude to start with right!)

(I had less than $50 to my name at this point so my back was kinda against the wall.)
I wrote a list of biz ideas/niches I have thought about doing/working in. I can't remember all the steps now (you should read the book though) but I wrote a short book on finding cheap flights awhile back, and never did anything with it - it's somewhere on Amazon, I never look at it. (Is that weird? lol) I was a pretty good travel agent back in the day, and learned a few tricks. 

Anyways I thought since I already had that as a kind of asset, I should see if anyone was interested in it and try to turn it into a business. I decided to go for it. (This was a super big deal because in the past I've always semi-chosen something and given up on it later - I have shiny object syndrome when it comes to businesses.)

So on like day 5 or something, the job was to ask people if they wanted it. So I wrote a post in the Digital Nomads around the world Facebook group, that said ""hey, I'm always finding cheap flights, (which is true) would anyone be interested in hearing about them when I find them?"" About 110 likes and 70 or so people said hell yeah. I hadn't really had that many likes for anything before so I was super excited. I made a Mailchimp list and asked each one to opt in (yeah I messaged everyone who had liked or commented on the post.) 

Then I put up a quick (ugly as f^&*) landing page and put a buy button on the bottom.

I kinda strayed from the book a little bit, cause I'm an idiot and always try to do things my own way.
I sent a message out to the list that they could pay $9 a year and I'd send out cheap flights. 
I sold 5 immediately from the one post.

That month (while I tried to figure out tagging on my email provider, learn about opt-in sequences, payment buttons and shit) I made about $400. NOT THAT MUCH I know, but in Bangkok, I could pay my rent and get a couple of pad thais.

There are so many iterations of this, because I kept ""pivoting"" to try to please everyone. In the end, it became pointless to try to find flights, because everyone was in different places, some were working in Africa, some in Colombia etc, as nomads they're always somewhere random and my flights wouldn't match where they were, especially as flights are a limited time deal.

It wasn't going to work.

I decided to change my offering all together, and offer my ebook as well as an email course showing people how to book their OWN cheap flights, anytime, anywhere. That worked pretty well.
I put the price to $25 and people kept buying it. 

I've rehauled the course a few times, added an actual online course, with modules, negotiated discounts with nomadic companies and made a resource collection on ProductHunt (we're launching on there next week.)
I put the price to $49 and people keep buying it. 

It's been live for around 5 months now. Here are the revenues after fees:
June: $408
July: $943
August: $1340
September: $2013
October: $890

The reason October was so crap is because NomadFly started going so well, I got stupidly complacent and figured I'd build something else as well, and completely stopped working on the first project so I could build up the second.

So now I'm working on a relaunch, where I'm getting some software built (a flight search engine with a difference) and putting the price up again. I figure if people are saving hundreds of dollars within a couple months of joining, it's gotta be worth at least $100. My testimonials are the bomb.

Other stuff:
1. I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. (Other than the content for the course I mean.) I've read SO MUCH about all this online busines stuff but I guess there's no way to figure it out until you actually have to do it.

2. I'm really proud of myself, and now I know I can create something out of nothing. That's a big thing to know about yourself, now I know I'm the kind of person who can create a small business. I have a photo somewhere of my bank account at $2 when I got the first sales into my Paypal. 

3. Once I build this up again and automate a few more things, I'll be able to balance it with my other business I started, in the business ""get shit done"" niche.

Hit me up with any questions, I know this isn't one of the epic ""I made 200k in 6 months"" stories, but the small guys/girls are important too!! :)

886,6rgric,False,How to Grow,34,E-commerce Businesses: Here's a crash course on how to use the Google Analytics Ecommerce Tracking feature to Hit 7 Figures in Revenue,Entrepreneur,"*Warning: this is a huge post at over 3000 words. Let me know if you find it helpful!*

It seems these days that everyone is running their own ecommerce shop. You can set up your store, find products to sell and start running ads all within an afternoon. Easy right? Maybe.

However, while starting a store might be easier than ever, growing an ecommerce shop beyond 7 figures in revenue isn't.

That is a frustrating, tiring and never ending fight. To do this, you need to figure out what works AND what you’re able to scale through many, many experiments.

Luckily, there’s a “secret weapon” that you can bring to this fight to give you an edge. The name of this secret weapon? Google Analytics.

You’re likely familiar with how Google Analytics can help you understand your marketing traffic but it can do much more than that.

You can actually track all of your ecommerce metrics like total orders, average order value and ecommerce conversion rate all within Google Analytics. You could even track what users are doing before they purchase something like how many of them view a product but don’t add it to their carts.

This gives you a 360 view of your ecommerce business alongside your marketing data. From here, you can start digging to find the best customer segments that will let you grow to 7 figures and beyond.

In this post, I want to give you a comprehensive overview of “ecommerce tracking” in Google Analytics, show you how you could use all of this data to grow your revenue and help your company get started even if you have no analytics experience.

# Why You Should Use Google Analytics to Track Your Ecommerce Data
This is the question that always comes up when I tell companies to send their ecommerce data to Google Analytics.

Most of these companies are already getting high-level metrics from their ecommerce software (Shopify, Woocommerce, etc) such as total orders and average order value so why should they go through all the trouble to get Google Analytics setup?

The answer: segmentation. 

As the saying goes:

> “Averages Lie But Segments Don’t” - Avinash Kaushik

A metric like average order value is useful but if you want to improve it, you need the ability to dig deeper (i.e. segment) in what is behind that metric. Let me give you an example of what I mean.

Let’s imagine that your average order value is $50. This is the average from all the orders within a specific time period. 

How would you go about increasing this metric to $60?

Perhaps you’re thinking in tactics already. Upselling customers in more locations, offering discounted add-on items, etc but these tactics could be even more powerful if you offered them to the right customer segments.

To find the right customer segments, you need data. 

While the average order value is $50, some orders will be worth $20 while other orders will be worth $100. This second group is the one that becomes interesting to us.

What do people buy in an order of $100? $150? $200?

You can then use this information to craft a tactic that will help you increase the average order value. Instead of your tactics being random, you’ll be able to focus on the customers who are already purchasing more than the average.

This is what good analytics can tell you. It can show you the different segments that you should focus on.

I had a client once that contacted me to help them clean up their Google Analytics data. Their data had serious issues which explain why they weren’t doing anything with it. They were spending serious money on advertising ($500,000+ per month) and yet, they had no visibility into the different customer segments that were buying their products.

They would simply look at high-level numbers like “this is how much we spent” and “this is how much we made” and as long as things look positive, everything was good. A part of me was impressed with this simple but dangerous approach. However, any wrong move or change could cost them a lot of money (as it did on several occasions).

We ended up sending all of their ecommerce data to Google Analytics which instantly let them see exactly what marketing channels were driving sales. 

They were also able to see the performance of their landing pages and figure out how to improve them to get more users to checkout.

They used all of these insights to double their monthly revenue from $1 million to $2 million within 30 days, a 104.27% improvement. 

# Common Questions that Google Analytics Can Help You Answer

Once you got your data inside Google Analytics, we can now combine it with your marketing data to ask effective analytics questions such as:

* What are the marketing channels driving the most orders?
* Which of my users are purchasing my products? e.g. returning vs new, male vs female, etc
* What is the conversion rate of my site? Can I be alerted if it drops?
* Where are users getting stuck before purchasing (funnel analysis)?
* Are users adding my products to the cart? Are they removing any products?

I’ll also walk you through the most useful reports in a section down below. 

# What’s the Difference Between Standard and Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking?

Google Analytics offers two types of ecommerce tracking: standard and enhanced.

Standard will give you basic data like the number of orders, conversion rate, average order value, and most popular products. You’ll be able to combine this data with the rest of the Google Analytics data like marketing channels, location, demographics, etc. 

Standard is great for any ecommerce store that is just getting started with Google Analytics. It will give you most of the reports that matter in the beginning and it will let you segment that data to find useful insights.

Enhanced gives you everything that Standard does but they also let you track your checkout funnel, when users add or remove products from their cart, when users view a product (impressions), etc. Enhanced gives you a more granular look at how your users are interacting with your products BEFORE they complete a purchase.

You can also always upgrade from Standard to Enhanced later on in the future. I would recommend that you start with Standard and get familiar with the data before diving into Enhanced.

One thing to remember is that you can’t use both of them at the same time. That is, you can’t send basic order data using the Standard Javascript library and then send the checkout funnel data using the Enhanced Javascript library.

I have personally made this mistake in the past. We instantly saw issues like orders being dropped, the conversion rate tanked and overall, the data integrity suffered. It’s a mistake that I won’t be making again.

So if you’re using Standard and you want to get some of the reports that Enhanced gives you, you need to convert ALL of your Standard code (transactions, transaction items, etc) into the equivalent Enhanced format.

# How Do I Set Up Ecommerce Tracking? Do I Need a Developer?

Setting up ecommerce tracking will depend on your ecommerce software. If you’re on a popular platform like Shopify, then you likely only need to enable a few settings and your ecommerce software will do the rest.

If you’re running on custom software then you will need a developer to help you implement all this. There are two options here which I will tackle below.

For those on popular ecommerce platforms, here are some links that will help you get this setup:

* [Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/manual/reports-and-analytics/google-analytics/google-analytics-setup)
* [WooCommerce + WordPress](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-google-analytics-pro/)
* [Magento](https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/google-enhanced-ecommerce-tracking-1.html)
* [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_google_analytics)
* [CS Cart](http://kb.cs-cart.com/Setting-up-the-Google-Analytics-addon)

If you don’t see your software listed above, try googling “YOUR SOFTWARE NAME google analytics ecommerce tracking”.

For those on custom software, you have two options. Option 1 is done using the analytics.js Javascript library and option 2 is done through Google Tag Manager.

I’ll provide you with instructions for both but my recommendation is that you use Google Tag Manager to send ecommerce data from your website. The setup might take a little longer but it will be easier to maintain and upgrade later on.

**Instructions for sending ecommerce data through Google Tag Manager:**

1) All of the transaction information needs to be passed on to the dataLayer. This is a Javascript object that Google Tag Manager is able to access.

2) You then need to create a tag (Universal Analytics) using the “Transaction” type. This tag will automatically look for the info from the dataLayer.

3) Finally, you need to figure out how to trigger the “Transaction” tag. The easiest way is to fire it on the thank you page after a user purchases something. You then need to make sure that they dataLayer information from step 1 is loaded during this page.

**Instructions for sending ecommerce data through Javascript (analytics.js):**

This option requires 3 steps which look like this:

1) You start by loading the loading the ecommerce plugin using this command:

    ga('require', 'ecommerce');

Make sure to fire this command after the Google Analytics tracker has loaded so after this line:

    ga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-1', 'auto');

2) Now that we loaded the ecommerce plugin, we create a transaction. A transaction is an order for a specific user. Users can have multiple transactions i.e. multiple orders. The code looks like this:

    ga('ecommerce:addTransaction', {
    'id': '1234', // Transaction ID. Required.
    'affiliation': 'Acme Clothing', // Affiliation or store name.
    'revenue': '11.99', // Grand Total.
    'shipping': '5', // Shipping.
    'tax': '1.29' // Tax.
    });

Note that each transaction needs a unique ID. This usually comes from your shopping cart or your database.

3) Once we have our transaction, we can add all the items that are found in this order. We can do that by using this code:

    ga('ecommerce:addItem', {
    'id': '1234', // Transaction ID. Required.
    'name': 'Fluffy Pink Bunnies', // Product name. Required.
    'sku': 'DD23444', // SKU/code.
    'category': 'Party Toys', // Category or variation.
    'price': '11.99', // Unit price.
    'quantity': '1' // Quantity.
    });

The ID here matches the ID of the transaction we created since this is what Google Analytics uses to keep track of things. You would fire this code for every item inside an order but with different information for each item.

4) Once you are done building your transaction and adding items, we can send it to Google Analytics. We do that by firing this command:

    ga('ecommerce:send');

Ideally, you should fire these commands after a user successfully completes their purchase.

**Enabling ecommerce tracking in your Google Analytics View**

You need to enable ecommerce tracking on specific views. You start by switching the status to ON and then clicking “Next Step”.

You will see a few options like “Related Products” and funnel steps. This is part of the [Enhanced Ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce) within Google Analytics which requires extra setup. If you use a popular shopping cart, this might already be setup for you.

#What Reports Should I Be Looking at as an Ecommerce Store?

This is the fun part. We got some data and now we want to start digging into the right reports. I’ll cover the 5 most useful reports that you need to be using from day 1. I also made note if that report is available through Standard or Enhanced Ecommerce. 


####Basic Ecommerce Overview (Standard and Enhanced)

This is report will give you all the high-level metrics such as the number of transactions, average order value, total revenue and ecommerce conversion rate.

You can then compare two metrics in the trend line chart. I find it useful to compare revenue and ecommerce conversion rate or ecommerce conversion rate and transactions. This lets me know if any increase in revenue is due to a better conversion rate (good) or simply more traffic (more transactions = more revenue).

####Product Performance (Standard and Enhanced)

These reports lets you see how individual products perform and what are your most popular products by revenue, sales, etc.

In this report, you should be looking for items that are popular or starting to become popular. While your top 5 products might always be the same, products 6-10 might be always changing. You could create marketing campaigns around these kinds of products and get more users.

####Sales Performance (Standard and Enhanced)

This report shows you individual sales/transactions and it appears to be a straightforward report. 

The power of this report comes from segmentation through the “Secondary Dimension” feature. You could add other metrics and dimensions like country or device category (mobile, tablet or desktop) to find popular segments for orders.

####Checkout Behavior (Enhanced Only)

This is your classic funnel report which we saw earlier in this post. We can see where users are dropping off in our funnels and what areas we need to fix.

By default, you’re seeing all of your users but you can drill down by using the “Advanced Segments” feature of Google Analytics. You could then isolate a specific customer segment like mobile users, female users or even complex segments like users from Texas who are using Chrome and are between 45-55 years old.

####Marketing Channels & Ecommerce Transactions (Standard and Enhanced)

This report shows your traffic sources against ecommerce transactions. Which traffic source is converting at the highest rate? Which traffic source is making you the most money? You could combine this report to optimize your Facebook Ads for example

#Common Problems with Ecommerce Tracking and How to Fix Them

It’s common to see errors as companies try to track their ecommerce data inside Google Analytics. Let’s look at some of the most common ones and how to fix them.

####Discrepancies in Data Between Google Analytics and Your Ecommerce Software

Minor discrepancies in data between Google Analytics and your ecommerce software is fine. How minor? 5% or less. If you’re seeing more than 5%, then you got some technical issues that need to be addressed. Moving your analytics tracking to Google Tag Manager will help you solve a lot of issues. 

####What About Refund Data?

You can actually send refund data to Google Analytics from your backend. As long as you use the same transaction ID (which is your order ID), Google Analytics will be able to store it. Once again, Tag Manager should make this pretty easy (are you seeing a pattern yet?).

####Watch Out for Timezones

I hate time zones. I have lost track of the number of clients who looked at data inside Google Analytics and then compared it to their ecommerce software and say “Google Analytics is inaccurate. What’s wrong?”.

In a lot of cases, time zones were the issue. You can switch that time zone that Google Analytics uses but your ecommerce software might be stuck in UTC (Universal Timezone). Keep that in mind when you’re comparing two data sources and get them on the same time zone if possible.

Hope that helps!

P.S. I also recorded 8 videos that walk you through how to get this setup and the 5 reports that you should be looking at. You can get those videos [from this blog post](https://practicoanalytics.com/google-analytics-ecommerce/).

230,gdduf5,False,,243,Ideas are Addictive: A Word of Warning for Wantrepreneurs and Distractible Entrepreneurs,Entrepreneur,"*I apologize if this post comes across as ""soft"" in a subreddit that appreciates hard strategies, numbers, and case studies, but I'd ask that you not downvote it if you don't personally relate with the content. My goal is to help a handful of redditors realize that their ""shiny object syndrome"" is not a syndrome at all, but a symptom of a larger problem.*

Hello all, longtime lurker here who recently made an account because I've figured out I have some insights and experiences to add to this community. This post is for people who:

* Have multiple notebooks with filled with viable-yet-unvetted business ideas.
* Have a desktop folder of self-drafted or commissioned logos for nonexistent businesses.
* Have domain name registrar accounts with lots of unused business-related domains.
* Have experienced the social frustration of being labeled an ""idea guy"" who has talked to lots of people about ventures in the past and more recently cringed at the thought of mentioning a new idea you're chasing because someone will ask ""What about X that you were working on?"" 
* Have invested significant time and work into dozens of ideas, but only to early phases, resulting in feeling exhausted with no semblance of measurable progress. 

I am writing this post because for years I have met every one of these criteria, often all of them at the same time. I know many of you also struggle with the burden of too many ideas because I've seen dozens of posts about it in this subreddit, and I am here to tell you that ideas are addictive. 

Every since I was a teen, I have enjoyed the process of coming up with business ideas. In recent years, I have developed some advanced skills around branding, graphic design, and business model development that has only accelerated my ability to shape the beginnings of a new venture. The problem is that I've never actually launched a successful business because the painful truth--one that took a lot of self-analysis and therapy to uncover--is that up to this point, launching a successful business wasn't my actual goal.

My goal has been to distract myself. At some point early on in life, I adopted a coping mechanism of achievement to avoid dealing with difficult experiences. (All addictions are, at their core, coping mechanisms that make existence momentarily bearable while disguising the real issue and causing additional pain in the long term.) Business ideas are a great achievement-related distraction because they can trigger the release of hormones that make you feel excitement, a rush some of you may be familiar with. The problem is that after the new-ness wears off, you have to abandon that progress and chase a new idea or you'll start to feel depression/anxiety/anger creep in. **I've recently wondered how many successful businesses have been abandoned not because the path to launching them was difficult but because the would-be entrepreneur refused to see the cycle they're trapped in.**

The good news is that you can escape the cycle of endless ideation by working through the underlying issues and identifying a path toward authentic achievement. This process can take some time and it will look different for every person, but the options may include mindfulness (journaling, meditation, exercise), trauma-informed therapy (EMDR, internal family systems therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy), medication, or a blend of multiple approaches.

If you're skeptical about taking a step back from your ideas and experiencing a period of what feels like unproductive, unpleasant self-reflection, consider this: If you somehow stick with an idea long enough to make it successful, the stress of managing both your unresolved internal conflict and the external challenges of scaling a business will likely cause you to burn out or implode. Take the time. Your long-term success depends on your ability to break the addiction to ideas.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/gdduf5/ideas_are_addictive_a_word_of_warning_for/,836,"Thanks for this post  r/wearehumanpowered.

431,5h6aba,False,,81,My first entrepreneurial success story. Starting with NOTHING and turning it into $5k.,Entrepreneur,"I've been wanting to be an entrepreneur for a long time and here's my first success story. It's a truly magical example of how you can start with NOTHING and turn it into SOMETHING!

I am an enthusiastic kitesurfer. Since a lot of you probably don't know what that is, I'll just say surfing from here on out. I organised a BIG surf event that saw 450 guests arrive to a fancy downtown cinema and went out for an after party, too. Here's how...

I have a few connections in the surf industry and had heard about a new HD Red Bull movie coming out. I like organising events so figured I'd drop the producers a line to ask them if I could host a screening. I wrote a very catchy email using template ideas from the 4HWW and other sources.

Hey presto, it worked.

Alas, the film was REALLY expensive to host.

I nearly gave up but then I ran some numbers. I'd need 200 guests to pay for the film and the theatre hire, which seemed reachable. So I followed up with a two fold strategy.

Part One - I wrote to loads of surf shops (with catchy emails) and promised to promote them on my website (free with Weebly) as event 'sponsors' if they would just commit to buying 10 tickets. I also promised that the event would have at least 200 guests at it, or I would refund them every penny. I pitched that it was a great opportunity to market directly to 200 keen surfers.

Part Two - I started advertising via my few contacts, Facebook and word of mouth. It was going to be a huge party with 200 surfers at it, I promised, and if not, I'd refund them.

In case you missed it, all I did was insure myself. I either sold 200 tickets and fulfilled my promises to everyone and broke even, or I didn't. In the event that I failed, I'd simply return the money to all guests and stores and that'd be the end of the effort. 

For every ticket that was sold after 200, I was making pure profit. Since 450 guests came, I made almost $6k, everyone had a great time and the community is now stronger than ever before. Plus I know have 290 email addresses which I can market to again.

There's a few other small tricks, but the gist of the story is that I worked out a way to ensure that everyone (cinema, producer, stores, guests and I) benefitted, or no-one would loose anything (including me). 

Hope you get something useful out of this story which you can apply to your ideas. Guarantee EVERYONE success AND NOBODY to get hurt!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5h6aba/my_first_entrepreneurial_success_story_starting/,649,"You started with a (lifetime?) huge passion that entailed numerous hours devoted to learning, networking, and navigating a community, and you found how much that is worth.

31,6i06gw,False,Tools,138,"Shipping ""hacks"" with UPS",Entrepreneur,"Most of the packages I send on a daily basis are large and heavy, so UPS is always been my cheapest option.   Shipping is always my biggest expense, usually running about 40-50% of the total cost of my products (I offer free shipping). I'm constantly looking for ways to reduce my cost and thought I would share what I've learned so far. 

1.  When you're just starting out, sign up for eBay and apply the eBay discount to your UPS account.  When you have no volume to speak of, it's an easy way to score 17-20% off retail prices. 

2.   UPS gives you an unlimited supply of shipping labels.  Easiest way to print labels, especially when you're new, is to use their 8 1/2 x 11 labels. They come two per sheet and fit in a standard printer. 

3.  If you have a UPS driver who drops off regularly at your day job, they will gladly take any and all packages you have to ship out. I always bring my daily shipments to work with me and give them to our driver.  Saves time when the alternative is to drive all the way to a UPS store or pay extra to schedule a pick up. 

4.  UPS leases Thermal Image Printers for $3 a week.  A good new one is $450 or more. This is a very nice and cheap alternative. 

5.  You get free UPS smart pick up for a year when you first sign up.  I don't use this yet, as I have a day job and am not able to have a guy come pick up everyday, but if you are able to it is a huge time saver. 

6.  When you get some volume, call UPS and ask to be assigned an account rep.  I'm not huge, shipping maybe 60-80 packages a month which equals about $1300 in monthly spending with them.  I just got assigned an account rep and, after discussing plans for growth and having a very informative discussion with my rep, got my shipping dropped by 20% AND got my residential surcharge fees cut in half.  That is going to save me about $300 and month or more going forward. 

That's all I have for now. I've been doing this for just over a year now could never find any good guides or hacks for shipping in one place.  Thought I would share what I've come across so far.

550,1xmhig,False,,169,"(Followup) Paypal just froze over $70,000 in my account - Say they won't return it for 180 days.",Entrepreneur,"A few months ago I posted on http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1rkkd7/paypal_just_froze_over_70000_in_my_account_say/ talking about Paypal freezing around $70,000 in pre-orders for my bitcoin mining equipment.

This was done around the end of November when I created the thread, and I wanted to update and let everyone know what happened in detail after the post.

On November 24th, we launched a new pre-order for a preety cool product relating to bitcoin mining called the Red Fury. At the time of the release, the device had a street value of anywhere from $175 to $250 per unit. We had been working with this factory for a while and locked in a fantastic price that would allow us to pre-sell them with a 1 month lead time for only $100 per device to our customers.

Our pre-order was met with fantastic success since we were undercutting the average price by more than $100 per unit. We sold over $40,000 in less than 3 days. This is when paypal not only froze our account, but reversed all the ACH withdraws to our business checking, which put us at the $70,000+ figure, as we had over $20,000 in sales prior to the pre-order launch.

At this point we took to reddit, twitter, and started tagging the president of Paypal on his twitter account. It was pretty successful and within just a day we got a call from one of the department managers at paypal who informed us the president had assigned her to the case.

By this point, we had no money from paypal, and still had to commit to wiring the money for the hardware to the factory. The best strategy we came up with was to quickly sign up with a second party processor (Chase payments) and authorize.net to accept credit card payments once again to hopefully get some capital. It was very, very successful for us to use that route as we resumed nearly $80,000 in sales over the course of a week or two. Unfortunately Chase after a while decided that all pre-orders & bitcoin equipment were suddenly high risk and they froze the account. The difference here was that they froze around $20,000 in the account and gave us the remainder. 

Thankfully, between the chase payments and a few SBA loans we were able to secure in the mean time, we were able to meet our commitment in payments to the factory. We had already secured a relationship that would allow us to pay for the hardware prior to fabrication on their end.

After much arguing with paypal, on December the 14th they released around $14,000 to our bank account. We had nearly $30,000 in hardware sales prior to the pre order that still we were owed on, but were willing to settle on the $14k due to us being desperate for additional capital since we had almost no operating budget for other inventory that wasn't pre-order.

That same day we received a notice from the factory that fabrication would be delayed another 10 days from the 15th to the 25th.  We sent a email blast to all buyers informing them of the move, through this whole time, anyone who wanted to cancel could do so without any loss or fee.

December 25th came and the factory notified us they shipped the hardware out to us. It finally was in our hands January the 4th.

From the 4th through the 8th or so, we managed to ship out all our pre-orders which was something along the lines of 500+ packages. 

After this was completed, we had to manually enter all the tracking information to paypal, since they do not integrate shipping data with 3rd parties (They work with ebay, but no one else). The day after this we called them and they told us they would not release the money till EVERY order was received by customers, even the ones outside of the US who had chosen the slowest shipping methods. We complained greatly about this since even though a minority of orders were international, it would still hold up payments.

A week later they called us letting us know they reversed their decision, and would release $40k of the $50k in the account. They would retain the $10k until the international orders were received.

Well, today is February the 11th and they informed us last night that they would release the remaining $10,000 to the account which then could be sent to our bank.

The rep at paypal informed us that we had received little to no complaints from customers about their orders, one chargeback did occur in the amount of $800, and this was the only one over all payment platforms through the months of Nov-Jan among our customers.

So, what were the lessons learned? Never, ever use paypal for orders, or money that you're willing to have frozen for a few months. Thankfully we were profitable in the end, but we lost a great deal of money due to opportunity loss. 

One of the biggest questions/suggestions we've had was to accept bitcoin as the alternative to paypal, which we have been doing since October, however it accounts for less than 20% of all payments (Including the time where it was the only processing type on our site). We also accept most major types of alternative cryptos (Litecoin, megas, dogecoins, ect) for hardware, which then accounts for about 25%-30% of the volume of bitcoin. We do love using bitcoin over paypal and credit cards, but customer utilization just isn't high enough yet to completely supplant credit cards yet.

729,dhozfl,False,Best Practices,247,Shoplifting teenagers are predicted to be entrepreneurs,Entrepreneur,"Did you ever shoplift as a kid?

Cheat on a test?

Defy your teachers or parents?

Then you might be the next Bill Gates.

A surprising amount of research shows you're more likely to become a successful entrepreneur if you broke the rules as a teenager[.](https://imgur.com/a/WzfY7vf)

We often think of entrepreneurs as innovative, independent, risk takers. They disrupt norms and upend entire industries in the process. These are the things we admire. It's what makes them special.

When you're a 35 year old running a silicon valley startup, you're praised for disrupting norms.

When you're 16, it makes you a delinquent.

Of course not every rule breaking kid is going to grow up and found the next Microsoft.

But many researchers believe moderate rule breaking as a youth is an indication of the entrepreneurial spirit shining through...

A 2008 study by [Zhang and Avery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0883902608000542) found a relationship between breaking rules as a teenager and later entrepreneurship. Their findings were based on the retrospective self-reports of 165 American men.

Then in 2013 [another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879113001346) replicated and extended the results. They proved there was in fact a link between rebellion and entrepreneurship.

They analyzed longitudinal data on 1,000 people in a mid-sized Swedish. The data spanned a period of 40 years, starting from when they were 10 years old.

Teenagers who were truant, ignored their parents' rules, cheated and shoplifted minor items, were more likely to start their own companies.

Interestingly, this link was only apparent with males, not females. There was also no link between *severe crimes* and entrepreneurship. Only moderate rule breaking behavior.

And again, [a third paper](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/132/2/963/2724553) backed this up in 2016.

This time researchers looked at a nationally representative sample of 12,686 Americans. They were followed for over 30 years, since they were teenagers.

They found that successful entrepreneurs were three times more likely to have engaged in illicit activities as a teen. This included things like shoplifting, skipping out of school, and even drug-dealing.

Of course this isn't the whole story. They were also shown to be smart, well-educated, with a high self-esteem. The attraction to risk just compounded their odds of success.

**Key Takeaway:** Don't worry about your delinquent past. It might be the very trait that makes you a success.

Did you have a delinquent past? Got any positive advice or insights to share?

Because I'm giving Gold to the best comment :) As judged by me, not the one with the most up votes. Awarded in the next few days to give everyone a chance to comment.

P.S. This is the type of stuff we talk about into the [Client Science](https://www.facebook.com/groups/clientscience/) Facebook group, you're free to come join us if you like.

EDIT: This has sparked an interesting conversation. If you followed all the rules as a kid please don't take these studies as an indication that you don't have what it takes. I research this stuff a lot and I can say without a doubt it doesn't matter if you followed the rules or not. It's just an interesting link. One data point in a sea of variables. There are tons of studies that find all different types of indicators. You can still be a wild success. People JUST LIKE YOU do it everyday.

I received exactly two letters from the IRS and a few notes from online lawyers about everything I needed to do when starting a new business.  Of course, I needed to do roughly 10 times more things, and nothing but research will let you find everything.  So if you 100% do everything you think you need, you're breaking at least some law I guarantee it.

If you're a delinquent, you will realize this, but simply not care:  You're kind of used to flouting the law.  Most normal people are going to think they'll accidentally go to jail or pay fines out through the nose when they make a mistake.  And this is really a shame. ",2019-10-14 11:02:07

I'm posting this in entrepreneur and not fulfillmentbyamazon for a reason: I think there's no greater opportunity for the home entrepreneur than selling physical products online, but the way amazon businesses are marketed by gurus is downright predatory. Anyone who can think out of the box and google their way to the answer of any question can make this happen, but if you just want to get out of the 9-5 grind this is not for you. My results came from diving in head first with serious commitment.

I don't want to get into the basics of selling on Amazon, that kind of information is all over the place. But these are the basic skills required:

* The actual nuts and bolts of selling Amazon: the rules, product preparation for their warehouse, listing guidelines, etc.

* Importing: incoterms, freight forwarding, duties, how to work with Chinese factories, etc.

* Research: deciding what you want to sell, this is where you need to break out on your own and not listen to anything anyone else says on the subject.

That last bullet is where information hustling gurus screw people up. People want a money formula so that is what they purport to sell. And that's why I'm talking to r/entrepreneur. **Above all else, focus on the PROBLEM your product solves. And use Amazon as your testing ground.** Everyone who learns someones “formula” starts selling the same shit. You have to do better than slap your own sticker on a selfie stick, and if you try to sell garcinia you will be warring with everyone, their grandparents, and their grandparent’s neighbor’s dog.

When I started out last year I had a hypothesis that I would try a lot of stuff with mediocre results until I found something that absolutely popped. That is exactly how it happened. My end goal are brands that people recognize everywhere, not just on Amazon. If I had tried that with my first attempts it would have been a tough road. But ""borrowing"" 10,000 Amazon customers made it a hell of a lot easier.

First of all, I was able to feed phone numbers to Facebook and find a lot of valuable info about my customers. I found out my demographic is about 15 years older than I would have guessed. So I designed my ecom site in a way that I thought would appeal to these people. As soon as it launched it was already getting word of mouth traffic from all the Amazon customers telling their friends. Currently, the site is doing about $1k per day, so it is still massively overshadowed by the revenue from Amazon, but I'm hoping to equalize that over the coming months. We're getting requests for bulk purchases by mom & pop retailers every few days.

So here's my main advice for entrepreneurs who want to sell physical products online:

* Start with Amazon as your testing ground/launch pad

* Focus on product development above all else, unique solutions to problems. All these t-shirt dropshipping businesses make me sad.

* Leverage the data and validation you get from Amazon to build out your full online presence into a brand people talk about and want to be a part of.

Now here’s some of the “nuts and bolts” type stuff that helped along the way. No one will buy your stuff on Amazon if they don’t see it. The fight for visibility can be extreme depending on who you want to find your product. Lots of people use blasting services or review services to give away tons of product and try to game Amazon’s algorithm for visibility. My opinion is that Amazon being a master at big data is out of my league for gaming. Instead I focused entirely on their internal advertising system, and as you can see at the top I’ve paid them $47k this year for visibility (promotion value is mostly from promotions that cross sell). But if you’re selling something people like and want, their algorithm will do all the work for you, and push you to the top of search results for the search terms that you convert for. Don't be afraid to spend money here, I was in the red for my #3 product for a month before it became profitable. My advice on this score is learn their advertising system, the basics of traffic driving (going from wide to narrow), and use your entire promotional budget there.

My last piece of advice is do what others don’t want to. The more difficult your product is to design, manufacture, import, accurately forecast (like extremely seasonal), the greater the opportunity. My star product is mine from the ground up, I drew it up, hired the 3D designer, prototyped and tested it, paid over $10k in tooling, etc.

I know that was kind of a ramble, but I hope people find it useful.

915,2vfjpx,False,,156,Thinking of getting into cell phone repair? Here is my $.02 after 4 years experience. (Part 2),Entrepreneur,"[I made this post about a year ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/22pxzy/thinking_of_getting_into_cell_phone_repair_here/)  And even a year later I still have people contacting me with questions.  So here is a follow up post, to touch on a few more of the more common questions people have had. Its a wall of text, (like my last post) But should help out people interested in starting their own Cell Phone Repair Business. I started small when I was 22. I am 26 now, fixing stuff is all I do, and it pays well. 

Having a smart phone is a pretty big thing nowadays.  Everyone and their 9 year old child has one. If your own personal phone does not have a cracked screen, chances are someone in your family, or close circle of friends DOES have a cracked screen.  There are soooo many broken phones are out there.  And it is actually really easy to fix most of them.  Especially iPhones. 

I noticed a need for cell phone repair about 4 years ago while working for a major cell phone provider. Even if someone has insurance on their phone, it is usually cheaper and easier to get it repaired by a third party, instead of pay a 200 dollar deductible. (iPhone 5 screens are $25 dollars on Amazon right now, and only take about 30 minutes to install. If you charge 50 bucks total, boom, you're making more than you do at your day job.) It's not unrealistic to make 25-50 bucks an hour if you can keep the broken phones rolling in. 

**How the freak do I learn how to take apart cell phones?**
YouTube is a HUGE resource for learning how to to take apart phones. Once you've seen the inside of a any device, it makes it so much easier to take apart on your own.  I personally have close to 200 phone repair videos posted to my YouTube channel [JerryRigEverything](https://www.youtube.com/user/JerryRigEverything). Feel free to subscribe if you are into that sort of thing. Another good channel to subscribe to is Le55ons.  His repair videos are longer, but touch on every aspect of the repair. Mine are more 'to the point'.  Maybe with a lame joke or 2 tossed in somewhere. 

The knowledge you learn from one phone, can be transferred to the next phone, and even laptops, or gaming consoles.  If you've built computers before, you already have a foot in the door.

**How to start out and advertise:**
Cell phone repair is pretty much a local gig. (That's why I have no problem telling you what worked for me and my business. The chances of you taking my clients are pretty small.) So you have to handle your business like a local gig. Nobody wants to send their phone anywhere to get it repaired. They want to drop it off and wait an hour while its done in their own home town. **WORD OF MOUTH IS HUGE!!!** I wish I could make that font bigger. If you don't have friends telling their friends about you... Your business will not do as well as it could. Think about it... the first thing someone says after seeing their friend drop a phone, “Oh hey! Dont worry about your cracked screen, I know a guy...” Boom. Business for you. Hand out business cards. Or better yet: Fridge Magnets. Or better better yet, make sure you are listed as a contact in every single phone you repair or sell. (Have the customer enter it by themselves into their own phone. Don't just enter it in yourself. That's weird. Don't be weird.)

I started off my repair business while in college, repairing my own phones. I would buy a phone with a broken screen or charging port from a friend, or from craigslist, fix it, and sell it for profit. Use whatever other local classified you have in your area. (The prices are pretty high with eBay at the moment, because everyone is doing the same thing; buying, fixing, reselling. But profit is still there.) You can usually get broken phones much cheaper from friends and family.  Especially because most of them will end up selling them back to Sprint, T-Mobile, or their own cell provider, for WAY less than they are actually worth. Offer them a few bucks more for their device and suddenly you're the good guy, even though you are still going to come out ahead. If you have ever sold your old phone to a major provider... you definitely got screwed. 

Once I felt confident with fixing my own phones, I branched out and started fixing friends phones. (Granted, I didn't exactly plan it this way, this is just what happened. There was a need, and I was filling it. Natural entrepreneur style.) My 'clients' would usually be fine waiting a day or 2 for parts to arrive. (Yay Amazon Prime!) I would fix the phone, and give it back to them within an hour or so. It was a good way to start. No overhead for this college kid. 

Once I had enough business going with my repairs, I partnered with a another local guy who bought and sold phones as his day job. Both of us in the same physical brick and mortar location helped both our businesses a ton. (If you are looking to partner with someone, look for a local computer repair company, an mobile accessory store, or even a cell phone vendor that isn't a big chain.) In my city, another repair guy joined up with an electronics store that sells TV's and stuff, and hes doing pretty well for himself.

Other things that helped my business (besides the WORD OF MOUTH that I mentioned so strongly earlier.) were hitting up all of the other cell phone related stores in town. T-Mobile, Sprint, At&t, Verizon... Most of them do not have 'in house' repair centers.  Plus if a customer doesn't have insurance, they cant do much at all for them.  Having my business card to hand to the customer helps them defuse a crappy situation. “We cant help you because you dont have insurance, but this guy can!” Everyone is happy. Plus... I check in on the bigger stores every month or two, and bring doughnuts.  Everyone loves the doughnut guy. Other places to hit up are 3rd party cell phone vendors. Radio Shack, Best Buy, Any place electronics related. Cell phone accessory kiosks in the mall. Networking can make your business take off. Don't be weird though. Seriously. 

**Shiz. What if I permanently break a customers phone?!**
This is a legitimate concern.  Cell phone repair is not all daffodils and daises.  You can legitimately brick a customers 700 dollar device.  Especially if you are still learning the ropes.  You should really *really* practice a lot before jumping into repairs on the more expensive phones that you don't actually own.  Another good idea is to have the customer sign a waiver before hand.  “Hey... Just so you know, I am pretty good at what I do, but with complex fragile electronic devices like this, there is always the chance that something could go wrong. This waiver just lets us both know that I explained the risks before opening up your device.”

Provide a backing up service or contact transfer for an additional $$.  Teach them how to use Drop Box. Or Google Drive. Or hey, learn how iCloud actually works. Nobody ever knows anything about that. 

**WAYS TO BLOW UP YOUR PROFIT MARGINS:**
Screen protectors.  Holy crap.  If you want a business with insane profit margins check these out.  You can get the cheap plastic ones for 20-50 cents each in bulk (Buying 100ish at a time) and turn around and sell them for 5 or 10 bucks each in your store (With the install).  You can get the more expensive tempered glass ones anywhere from 2-5 dollars each, and sell those for 15-25 bucks a piece. Zagg/InvisibleShield sometimes charges 50 freaking dollars a pop for those bad boys. They are making serious bank. 

Buy accessories for dirt cheap from Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba, or AliExpress and sell them for 100-300% profit in your store. 

As you repair phones, you will gradually grow your very own bone-yard of devices. This is a good thing. **NEVER THROW AWAY ANYTHING THAT CAN BE REUSED**.  The more spare parts you have laying round, the more likely you are able to 'JerryRig' a customers phone back into existence. Buy one of those plastic shelf thingys with a million little plastic drawers to help separate all your harvested parts.  People don't really care HOW their phone started working again, as long as it stays working.  Plus, if you didn't have to spend money on a new part, you don't have to charge the customer as much money, and they leave happier, bringing more business to you later on. Its a happy cycle. 

Now keep in mind, for this post I just kept with the business side of things.  If your goal is to make side money by fixing phones for friends... great.  Its a wonderful option for some quick cash. BUT if you decide to work on strangers devices, I would make sure to have an LLC, Business License, maybe even business insurance if it is required. All those things sound daunting, until you actually do them.  They aren't that bad. Just require a little research.

236,91rkn7,False,Case Study,128,"Here's the exact formula I used to grow a blog to 120,000 monthly readers in one year",Entrepreneur,"Building a sustainable revenue channel is the number one reason to invest in a blog for your business. I strongly believe every other revenue stream, be it ads, social media, referrals, outbound marketing or whatever is not going to provide the same long-term, organic growth potential as a blog bringing in thousands of daily engaged users. 

It captures customers searching for problems that you solve. It establishes long-lasting thought leadership and brand awareness. It is a gateway into your marketing automation. Done correctly, it's an exceptionally cost effective way to bring in new customers at scale. But very few people know how to do it correctly, because there's SO much crap out there when it comes to content marketing advice. Chances are, you're spending a lot, publishing a lot of content, and not getting much ROI on it. Or, you're haven't started yet, which is a mistake.

If you're looking for an article that will be saying things like 'you don't want to propose on the first date' as an analogy to content marketing, this isn't one of them. I'm going to show the exact process I use with clients to grow very robust blogs that convert. I haven't shared this anywhere before, but I see a lot of people struggling with this, so am very happy to help you out. My only plug is that I do provide consulting, from designing a strategy that you carry out all the way to full execution. Contact me via Reddit or join [my FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/225247801447380/) to stay in the loop where I also regularly post content like this. 

Now, for the good stuff. 

**Before we start, here are some general rules:**

* Don't outsource to the Far East and publish poorly written content expecting it to do well.
* Quality over quantity.
* You need around 40,000 words to start making a real difference to your business.
* It does take time and money.
* This is a long-term investment, not a short term one, so don't treat it like one.
* If you're just posting an article and expecting it to grow on its own, you're doing it wrong.

***I suggest looking at*** [***this visual***](https://imgur.com/a/ecjblQs) ***on Imgur before we start, which outlines the results I got for the '120k monthly sessions' I refer to in the title of this article. It's an annotated screenshot from Google Analytics and shows a brief overview of the process.***

**Here's the process that I use.** 

Instead of writing loads and loads of articles that don't read well and are keyword saturated, the goal is to write 40,000 words of really targeted, well written articles that are promoted well. 

You should aim to post around 3-4 'pillar content' articles. These articles will be 4000-7000 words long. The title of these mega-article should be something like 'The Ultimate Guide to a huge problem your audience faces', and then split up into a dozen or so sub-sections that are more relevant and related search terms to the main heading. The title is important for the click-through-rate, so spend time making it good. It should also contain the high volume keyword you want it to rank for. 

We're then splitting the article up into 12-20 H2s that are more long tail search terms but related to the title problem. What we're doing is establishing a semantic clustering of keywords around a single high volume search topic, supported by dozens (and eventually hundreds) of smaller keywords it'll rank for. Each pillar article should be targeting a specific high volume search keyword, while the sub-headings are targeting lots of related searches (the article will eventually rank for hundreds if not thousands of long-tail searches around the general topic and other semi-related topics thanks to this idea of semantic clusters). 

Keyword analysis is really individual, so it's hard to write a guide that everyone can follow. But quite simply, you can start by typing in something that your customers will be searching for that relate to you, and then start listing all the related searches that appears on Google. You can also use tools from Moz, Ahrefs, Google Trends and so on to do this. There are also some really useful Chrome extensions that list all related searches, including '[Keywords Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keywords-everywhere-keywo/hbapdpeemoojbophdfndmlgdhppljgmp?hl=en)' tool (which I highly recommend). A really nice thing about the Keywords everywhere tool is that it shows the cost-per-click if you were to put an ad on that search term. It's an indicator of the competition and value of traffic. Look for keywords with a high search volume, low competition score and record those. They're low hanging fruits. Generally, I use a combination of Ahrefs, Moz, SEMrush, Keywords Everywhere, Google Adwords Keyword finder and Quora for this part, but if I was to go over that that'll need to be a whole seperate post. 

Back to writing. Now that you would have allocated around 25k words or so to these pillar content articles. Another 10k will be split up into 10-15 800-1200 word articles. These articles will focus on long-tail keywords such as reviews of certain products, lists (top 10 ways to..), and searches with lower search volume but a good chance to rank for.

The final 5000 words will be split into 800 word guest posts that we'll send around to establish some contextual backlinks.  

While the content is being published, it's really important to start promoting the articles and driving traffic to it. That way, Google will start recording engagement, bounce rate, pages-per-session and all the goodies that help determine how valuable your article is to the reader, thus determining how well you should rank in Google. 

For my clients, I have a go-to graphic designer where I create a bunch of infographics on certain articles or topics that I promote around to help with backlinks. I usually run a few searches on Quora relating to the major keywords then scrape all the answers and organise them by the number of answers. I start with the lower ones and go through answering questions and uploading plenty of photos to each answer, including the infographic if I can. Quora is about getting as much real estate in the answer and this helps drives traffic. I also find relevant forums and aim to provide value in them and link back. I use Google search operators to put together a list of blogs and influencers in the industry, find their email and auto-email them on a cold email sequence offering to write a guest post for them. I also find complimentary businesses (for instance, if you're selling skateboards, i look for skateparks) and if they have a blog, I reach out to them offering a guest post. This is really powerful and I usually get rid of the 10 guest posts pretty fast. Remember, the goal here is to establish a strong, diverse backlink profile. Other things I do is publish a few of the articles on Medium, LinkedIn Pulse, Reddit, Buzzfeed, Lifehacker etc. to establish some other links. If you know people who run blogs, ask them if you can write a guest post or if they can slip in a link. It helps. With the infographics, I submit them to infographic portals, Visually, Pinterest, Behance, Dribbble etc. to establish that search presence. Overall, this process here is how I managed to get that viral push in the example I link to with the 120k monthly sessions. For this particular one, I was pushing a lot of content out to Journalists and on my own LinkedIn which got picked up. 

Regardless, within about three months the articles should be gaining some traction on search, even if it's on the 30th page. That's fine, because now it's time to go back and optimise the articles.

This is where it gets exciting and has the biggest impact (you can see on the image I linked to earlier, in Google Analytics, the major growth happens after this stage). 

Here, you need to go into Google Webmaster and organise the 'search analysis' dashboard so that you're going through each individual page looking at the 'position' and search queries it ranks for. This is a bit of a manual process, but you should be identifying keywords that have a high search volume and cross checking that with the competition score. The goal here is to identify the keywords Google has started ranking you for and optimising the article to push it further up. In other words, the fact that your article is already ranking for these keywords so soon is good, but now it's time to bulk it up and push it further up. It's important not to remove any existing content, though, as we still want it to rank for other keywords. We're just helping it along. You then record that all down and go back to your writers, and give them instructions to add around 20% content to each article by focusing on adding more content around these keywords. The result is that your articles will get pushed up much faster, as Google has basically hinted at what it sees the value of this article to be around, and you're now satisfying Google's algorithms more, so they reward you by pushing you up. 

This, as well as a continued backlink strategy, will push you forward very fast and help you start generating A LOT of traffic from Google. 

I am well aware at how long this post is, and the original post was MUCH longer, but I figured no one would have read it, so I figured an overview would be the best place to start as many people are 30-40% aware of what to do, but just need that final strategy overview.

I've probably forgotten a few steps, but let me know what you think about this all, as I said, I really enjoy helping people out and am also holding a free online workshop in a few weeks time where I go over this, just let me know if you want an invite.

642,78vc2y,False,AMA,132,"Thank you r/entrepreneur, from $25K to raising $5.5M in two years. AMA",Entrepreneur,"Hello fellow entrepreneurs!

First off, I wanted to thank this community. I’ve been seeing some recent negativity such as posts about a lack of participation and wantrapreneurism on this subreddit, but I believe you get out what you put in to any community. While I always do my own research, I still read all the advice and feedback from others as a way to open my mind to different ways of approaching universal business problems over the years.

I’m the CTO and co-founder of Fattmerchant. In less than two years we went from winning $25K check (literally the big kind like you see on TV) in a pitch competition to closing on $5.5M Series B (announced a couple days ago) in the same month that we became profitable. During that time we’ve had all sorts of crazy experiences both positive and negative. We’ve been featured on TechCrunch, Forbes, FastCo, HuffPo, which has been phenomenal but with short-term exposure, and we’ve also invested large amounts in campaigns which never returned anything, conferences which never generated leads, and product roadmaps and customer requests which stretch out into infinity with limited resources and a small development team competing against massive and well funded incumbents.

We now process $1B in payments annually for thousands of small businesses like yours throughout the country.

I want you to know that I’ve had successful and failed businesses in the past, and that as long as you keep learning and hustling, you will succeed. I know that we are only one data point, but through my past experiences as a serial entrepreneur and the network of entrepreneurs that I collaborate with, I have enough of a sample size to tell you the key differentiator is an internal drive to continue pushing despite not seeing results (delayed gratification) while being able to continuously parse and react to constructive feedback from everywhere, customers, yourself, competitors, to your own staff to incrementally improve (kaizen; continuous improvement).

I jumped ship and left a well paying executive job at an established company to join this team and start our SaaS product from scratch. I’m so grateful to have an incredible group of people that I enjoy working with everyday. Everyone told me I was crazy, but I knew I made the right decision the day we graduated from our local tech accelerator Starter Studio and I continue to look forward to the future.

I’m not one for hollow inspirational / get motivated cat posters, I just want to share our story, and thank you all for what you do supporting and encouraging other entrepreneurs and if there’s anyway I can help anyone of you, please let me know.

197,cb3ego,False,,180,The three wealthiest people I know and what I've learned from their stories,Entrepreneur,"The first one started out by **opening a single pizza restaurant with two friends in a small town in Ohio**. 4 years later he sold 30 pizza restaurants. Then he built and sold the next business and the next one after that. Now he is a wealth manager and makes a living investing for and advising mega wealthy families and buying and selling real estate and businesses.

Another started making **caricature t shirts of NBA players** and selling them out of the trunk of his car. Ended up getting the contract to provide the NBA champions with custom T Shirts (and selling them to all the fans) when they won the title. Sold the clothing brand a few years later and was one of the first investors in the planet fitness franchise and made boat loads of money at their IPO and now buys shopping centers in major metro cities.

Another started by **remodeling his friends house for him in a super small southern indiana country town**. Then he built a house for himself. Then his neighbor. Then another neighbor. Then a restaurant. Then a local doctors office. Now he builds, owns and leases hospitals and nursing homes to nationwide operators for $150k a month and has a portfolio of 30 of them.

**What I learned from them...**

**Start really really small.** Don't try to change the world on day 1. Business is like a snowball effect and it grows with time. The first step should be doing something simple and risk free with the goal of quitting your job and getting your time back.

**Then you move on to the next thing and the money grows and the opportunities grow.** We read biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and watch shark tank and everyone thinks they need a new revolutionary world changing idea to be an entrepreneur. 

**All of these people started out super super small and LOCAL doing things that other people were already doing.**

It's all about not being afraid to work hard on something others would think is boring and ""unscalable"". Get your feet wet. Learn entrepreneurship. Make some money. Learn to sell and interact with people and manage expectations and deal with money.

Then keep your eyes and ears to the ground and make really good logical (not emotional) decisions on what opportunities you should say NO to and what opportunities you should say YES to.

200,dvy2pu,False,,409,"My Coffee Shop's actual numbers - Sales, expenses, profits",Entrepreneur,"Hello!  

I own a small coffee shop in Ohio and thought I'd share my shops numbers for anyone interested in the industry. Coffee shops seem to be a business that everyone thinks they want to own some day. I purchased this existing coffee shop 3 years ago when it had sales of $115,000 for the year. 

I'll go through some of the major expenses and if anyone has questions, I'll be happy to break them down further. 

&#x200B;

Trailing twelve months revenue - $296,000

COGS / food, drink, apparel / - $93,000  (31.4%)

Materials and Supplies / cups, napkins, towels, toilet paper, etc. / - $15,000 (5%)

Labor - $63,000  (does not include salary to myself) (21.2%)

Advertising - $5,000 (1.7%)

Rent - $7,200 (2.5%)

Utilities - $8,300 (2.8%)

Repairs and Maintenance - $5,300 (1.8%)

Insurance, Taxes, Licenses, Office Supplies - $4,200 (1.4%)

Credit Card Fees and Loyalty Program - $5,300 (1.8%)

Loan payback - $9,500 (3.1%)

Everything else - $5,900 (3.8%)

Profit before paying myself - $74,500 (25.2%)

Actual profit would be debatable. If I never worked any actual shifts and gave my manager a raise to do more of the things that I currently do, it would probably cost me around $30,000 - maybe more. 

That would put my profit somewhere around $45,000 (15.2%)

&#x200B;

We sell all the usual coffee drinks you would find in most coffee shops as well as salads, wraps, sandwiches, pastry items, smoothies etc. I would call ourselves somewhere between a ""2nd wave"" and ""3rd wave"" coffee shop. We have a pour over option but it's not a huge seller, our espresso and lattes are very good but most of them are flavored. 

Revenues are very close to half Coffee drinks and half everything else. 

Our staff is currently 7 people which includes myself and 1 manager. We run two different shifts, one in the morning and one in the evening.

Just getting ready to close on our second location and hopefully starting our build out soon!

727,9plltv,False,,199,I didn't win a pitch competition because my pitch was too good.,Entrepreneur,"I am a college student who has been working on a startup for the past 2 years. During this time I have pitched my company at various pitch events and have become very comfortable with my presentation. I even won my schools business pitch competition last year. 

The makerspace where I do most of the work for my company holds an annual pitch competition. The which the winner receives $5000 of credit at a professional prototyping facility. This would be extremely helpful to me because I am planning on launching a kickstarter campaign and would love if I could get some ""pretty"" prototypes made for the video. I have prototypes that are perfectly functional but they don't look like a final product because I made them by hand. 

Anyways another startup got selected as the winner, no big deal they gave a good pitch and were able to answer all of the judges questions well. After the event was over I approached the judges to thank them and two of them pulled me into another room to talk to me. They told me that my pitch and idea was actually better than the team they selected, And that they didn't choose me because they felt like ""I was going to succeed regardless of if I won the money or not, and it would help the other team more than me"". 

I obviously think this is complete bullshit because the whole idea of the event was that whoever had the best idea/pitch would receive funding. 

Am I wrong to be upset about this?

832,b9wh6d,False,,112,A $7.6 Trillion-Dollar Industry,Entrepreneur,"I think the majority of us are here for ideas and inspiration, right? We like to read about successful people and figure out how we can apply that to our lives. Sometimes we find gems, usually we find trash, often we're just blinded or uninterested.

Well, I'm here to wake some people up.

A few days ago I listened to this amazing podcast from Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn, Paypal, .etc) and he was interviewing Brian Chesky the founder of AirBnB on his early days and how he scaled the company. Not only was it fascinating to hear how they started, and how they almost failed and came up with an ingenious political cereal idea to help fund the company (Obama O's, Cap'n McCain's) ...one number really stuck out.

**$7,000,000,000,000.00**

That's right. In between talking about their business model, funding and growing a billion-dollar company, Brian shot out a number as to why he chose the travel industry, it generates over $7 trillion dollars per year. Actually, $7.6t.

So my question to you is, why fight over a $10b industry when you can take a small piece of a nearly $8 trillion dollar industry?

Scared of the competition? Don't be a pussy. Competition means there's money, my people. You have a better chance of getting rich in a big industry vs. a smaller niche industry, it's simple math. More money to go around.

Even cooler? You probably have a great shot at acquisition by some of the big public players that are looking to grow. The Pricelines, the Expedias.

Excited yet? Let's get more hyped, shall we?

There are four **segments** of the hospitality **industry**:

* Food and beverages
* Travel and Tourism
* Lodging
* Recreation

Within these segments you have unlimited options, and I truly mean unlimited. Let's break just some of these down.

**1.) Food & Beverages**: Many of you might be saying, what? But F&B is actually the largest hospitality segment there is and, well, why wouldn't it be considering literally everyone needs to eat! If you think about how it ties into the travel industry you have everything from airport food, carts at events, F&B for hotels, hotel bars, distribution.

Yes, it's rather generic, but think about how it applies to the travel industry. What could you do? Become a vendor near a tourist destination? Open up an American bar in France? A French bar in America? Supply healthy snacks to hotels?

Doesn't sound like fun? What about starting an event for the F&B industry? Or a website dedicated to connecting people in the F&B industry. A blog that helps people get ideas for the F&B industry.

Use your imagination.

**2.) Travel & Tourism:** This is massive, and what everyone thinks of when they think of travel, right? You may not be able to build the next airlines, or have a billion dollars laying around to start a cruise ship or space tourism business - but there's nothing stopping you from catering to these companies, or inventing a tour of your own.

Let's take a look at some of the verticals within *travel and tourism*.

**Travel**

* Airfare
* Cruises
* Transportation

**Tourism**

\- Agencies

\- Tours

If you had a pen and paper and sat down for an hour you could probably come up with 100 business ideas for each one of these verticals.

* Flight tracking
* Cruise packages
* Uber/Lyft
* Travel Agency For Pet Owners
* Pet Destinations
* Sex tours
* Cannabis tours
* Adventure tours
* Cruise tours
* Tours For Young People
* Tours For Old People
* Vegas tours
* Grand Canyon Tours
* NYC tours
* Maps to the stars
* Party bus
* Airport shuttle

...Dude, it's limitless.

Oh, and each one of these ideas still needs an F&B source attached to it!

* Coffee supplier for travel agencies (B2B MRR!)
* Natural snacks for adventure tours

and on and on.

**3.) Lodging**

This is where AirBnB staked their claim. They wanted to own the whole damn vertical, but you don't have to be so greedy. You can take just a little bit if you want. Here are some ideas.

* AirBnB photographer
* AirBnB host
* AirBnB house cleaner
* Bed & Breakfast
* Vacation lodge
* Vacant hotel room booking system
* Website that helps people find all types of lodging discounts
* sell bedding to hotels
* sell F&B to hotels

Yet another rabbit hole, huh? There's easily 500 businesses you can pull out of this, local or worldwide.

This brings us to the last segment...

**4.) Recreation**

There's definitely some overlap between tourism and recreation, but that's fine. The whole industry kind of overlaps and runs in a sequence. You can't really have one without the other.

So, recreation. There's got to be 1,000's of opportunities here because you can break this down into tours, sporting events, film, music, festivals and pretty much any activity you can dream of.

Think about what you do, or want to do when you travel.

* Sightseeing: This overlaps with transportation, tours and sometimes lodging. All kinds of offshoot niches here. From creating the tour, to booking the tour, to guiding the tour, to hosting the tour.
* Sporting Events: If it's played with a ball, there's a cottage industry behind it. Think about all of the side businesses for stadiums, tickets (buying/selling/scalping), finding discounts, merchandise, F&B, security, cleaning, .etc.
* Nature: Maybe you want to enjoy the beach, you could take a taxi, or an Uber, or walk. You'll probably need clothing, too, huh? Maybe sunscreen? Are you going to eat today? Those shoes look pretty tired. Did you forget sandals? I'm sure you'd like this umbrella, or these delicious natural snacks for your hike. Oh, shit. Look, they're parasailing off the boat! Damn, that zipline looks fun, too. Let's get a t-shirt to remember this and drop $100 on a seafood themed dinner.

Alright, I'm going to cut this short because I have to get back to a business that makes me actual money! I just wanted to drop some inspiration here, and honestly writing all of this out helps motivate me too.

The hospitality/Travel industry is massive. I'm lazy, you're probably lazy - most of us are lazy, but we could all make 6 or 7 figures in this industry if we just grabbed an idea and ran with it.

But read with purpose and intent to solve something specific, not the bullshit case studies that rely heavily on non-replicable facets and rarely on action (not to mention most of them are so puny that we almost hit sampling bias with it... aka the guy who made $30k off selling shirts or whatever garbage a few days ago... and did so by extrapolating from 15 days of sales ever).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7y7hgk/something_no_real_entrepreneurs_do/,670,"Wow.

277,b265h5,False,,132,An extra 15k a year growing cacti with my kids.,Entrepreneur,"First off, I just want to make it clear that I didn't do this. A good friend of mine did and he doesn't use reddit so he agreed to let me post it here as I helped him a lot along the way. This is one of those neat ""I'd never think of that"" side hustles that ended up becoming a low effort extra income for him and two of kids. He made 15k after expenses growing cacti in his basement.

Total grow time on our second attempt was about 8 months. However on their first attempt very little germinated for 2-3 months so be prepared to mess up your first time. Once we had the solution figured out we managed to get about 40%-50% of the cactus seeds to germinate in about 3-4 weeks. With 60%+ reaching a sellable size in about 8 months. We had another 20% germinate later and should reach a sellable size this year with our third batch. Now that we're on the third batch of seeds we have hundreds of cactus' in various stages of growth and repotting and selling will be done yearly.

&#x200B;

Note: I'll be using us and we a lot , however I didn't actually take any of the profits, I set up grow tanks and lights as a favour and because I love seeing people start business' with their kids and the father is a long time friend of mine. BECAUSE OF THIS I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS. THESE ARE ROUGHLY THE PROFITS AND EXPENSES.

So if you're going to comment yOuR mAtH dOeSnT aDd Up, thats why. The exact numbers are not important, but I feel that this is an excellent example of how things can scale.

What we used:

We started with 1000 assorted seeds which ran us $100 CND + Shipping. Totalling $135

Four used 20 gallon fish tanks, two had cracks and were free and two we bought at a yard sale for $20

Soil, we used a mix of sand, siffed potting dirt and small gravel for drainage. This cost us about $50. \\

We started off with some really basic grow lights that we're basically household CFLs and LEDS. After the first 1000 we switched to grow lights we bought on Amazon that we're roughly $100 each, and we needed 4. So $400 so if you want to try this factor this in because I feel that this made the biggest difference in grow time.

&#x200B;

After our first trial run we did the same thing but upped our seed count to 10,000 and scaled the number of tanks and lights we had accordingly. We learned that we could plant 500 seeds per setup, with a total of 20 setups.

This was a big leap obviously, we still managed to source the fish tanks for very little but lighting and other costs soared to over $2500 dollars.. Currently we have 20 tanks set up with roughly 500 seeds per.

Another factor, for us, it cost around $150 a month to run all these lights based on our local electricity rates. This may be higher or lower than your rates or you may live in an area where the sun can do most of this work for you. HOWEVER, I would not recommend relying on the sun to germinate the seeds. You're shooting for 50% germination rates and this can be tricky when you're relying on the sun. WE DID NOT FACTOR THIS IN ON OUR FIRST 1000 SEEDS, THIS WAS OUR MISTAKE. Technically, we lost money on our first 1000

&#x200B;

Lets look at the numbers:

The total cost for the first setup was roughly $605 including the better grow lights. Technically we didn't have that $400 cost right out the gate but I added it in because it made such a big difference.

We had around 45% of the seeds germinate and the vast majority of them reached a sellable size within the first year. That spring, we sold 400 cactus' to two local gardening centers for $2.50 a cactus, they then resold them for $5-$10 based on size and what style of pot they were in. (The center chose to replant some of them in fancy pots.) We made $1000, minus the $605 in expenses, but, once we factored in the almost 10 months of grow time we actually lost $45 a month running the lights with this smaller batch (the $150 above was when we had 20 tanks). So Really, we lost $55 in our first year. ($605 + $450 = $1055 total cost.

To offset this the kids took the 50ish remaining cactus' that didn't go through our wholesale deals and potted them in attractive pots and their mother helped this customize the pots with peoples names or other saying which they then sold for $10 - $20 each via Facebook and other online means. I don't have exact numbers here because my friend allowed them to use the money they made this way (it was a few hundred dollars) as spending money on their family vacation.

Side note, but another thing I found incredible here was my friend managed to talk his oldest son into ""investing"" in his younger siblings business' with his lawn mowing money. He sunk $1000 into their business' and they actually wrote up a basic contract to sign. I thought that was pretty cool.

Year 2:

While they were away I helped by sourcing another 16 tanks and fitted them with air tight lids, we used a similar potting mix but added some cactus specific fertilizer we bought locally (note, we're in Canada so Cacti are not natural here, but it's become a very popular house plant). We fitted all the tanks with grow lights (bulk ordering knocked the price down to $80 a light) and I managed to scoop up very basic temp/humidity monitoring devices for $5 each. We then ordered 10,000 seeds and switched to used fish tank water to water our grow tanks (from a fish tank with live plants, we had someone check with water quality beforehand to make sure it was good). We planted 500 seeds per tank and we effectively cut our grow time in half. In 8 months we had more cactus' that we're bigger than the previous 10 month run.

&#x200B;

Originally we had 45% success in ten months, this time we had more 60% in a little less than 8 months.

Total cost for this scaled up version was;

10,000 seeds $1000

20 grow lights $1600

$150 a month in utilities for 8 months $1200

$1000 for the needed fertilizer, soil and other odds and ends for the grow room

Temp monitoring and dehumidifier for grow room $200

Total: roughly $5000

Because we had bigger cactus' we managed an average price of $3 per plant and sold to several different gardening centers, stores and even sold a order to the local zoo.

Total sales came in a just a few hundred dollars short of $20,000, making for roughly a $15,000 profit, we manged to pay our investor back (he doubled his money, not bad for a first timer) and the kids paid for this years family vacation. The rest of the money will be used to keep running this business (although they have an interested buyer and are thinking about selling). This year they're running the same number of seeds, they had to replace one grow light but overall this year should show record profits.

&#x200B;

Why Cactus'? In theory, you could do this with any house plant. But,cacti are compact, you can grow a lot of them in a very small space. Once they're our of the seedling stage they're very hardy and can grow basically anywhere with enough lighting meaning that any plants we have outside of the seedling stage need very little attention. They're popular with interior designers right now and the cacti fad is in full swing making them an easy sell.

This year we ordered another 10,000 seeds, this combined with our ""left overs"" from the last two runs we're expecting to have 7000-8000 cacti for this years selling season which should net us $22,000+ and with our reduced operating costs the majority of this should be profit.

Long term we plan to use this years profits to build a greenhouse in an unused garage and branch out into other house plants.

663,45350g,False,,118,How to Win on Facebook: 8 Lessons Learned From Analyzing 1 Billion Posts,Entrepreneur,"Everything Neil Patel writes is long and packed with info -- so much so it's often difficult to absorb everything in one reading.

This week he broke down the analysis of over 1 billion Facebook posts. Here's a synopsis of Neil's article:

**1. No other social media site drives more traffic than Facebook**

According to Shareaholic's (admittedly 13-month-old data) data, Facebook refers more traffic than Pinterest, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Google+, and LinkedIn combined.

**2. It's counter-intuitive, but the best time to post is when your readers *aren't* on Facebook**

The reason? There is too much competition during peak hours. If you post during the day, your readers have *lots* of other stuff to read.

So when is the best time?

For those in the US, it's between 9 and 11 PM in the timezone most of your readers live in. A similar test for another country, France, showed similar findings (though in France between 11 PM and midnight proved to be the best time for engagement).

**3. Posts with images or posts that ask questions receive the most interactions**

So, if you really want to boost interactions with your Facebook posts, consider combining these. Post questions *combined* with images.

**4. Weekends are the best day to post if you want interactions**

The data shows that weekdays perform the same -- there is virtually no difference in engagement between Monday and Friday, for example.

But weekends, particularly Sundays, get an engagement boost.

The takeaway? Save your important posts for the weekend.

**5. There's a strong correlation between the performance of a Facebook post and the length of the article it links to**

In other words, Facebook posts that link to short articles don't perform as well.

**6. The shorter the description for your Facebook post, the better it will perform**

Facebook posts with 0 to 50 characters (around 10 words or less) get the most interactions on Facebook -- *by far*.

The takeaway? If you are long-winded in your Facebook posts, people are less likely to interact.

**7. Facebook videos far exceed YouTube videos**

Per Neil:

> ""Embedding a YouTube video only gets an average of 140.75 interactions, a fraction of the 951.48 interactions that (Facebook) direct embed videos get.""

In other words, take the time to upload your source videos onto Facebook rather than embed the YouTube version. It's well worth the effort.

**8. Pictures posted on Facebook via Instagram perform better**

How much better? 23% better.

Why? Even Neil is stumped on this one. Does anyone have a theory?

**9. People don't like hashtags**

According to the data, Facebook posts without hashtags receive 34% more interactions than posts that do have them.

Did any of the data surprise you? I must admit publishing when my readers are offline surprised *me*. So did the ""save your best post for weekends"" finding.

How about you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/45350g/how_to_win_on_facebook_8_lessons_learned_from/,512,"The most important thing to remember is that all of these lessons are completely dependent on whatever niche you are going after. 

For example, if you are running a sports FB, the proper time to post is NOT between 9 and 11pm. The proper time to post is when teams are playing. 

If you are running a social justice type of account, a LONGER description is better than a shorter description. You want to engage your followers with your passion, and those readers are more apt to read and interact with the person. 

If your niche sports again, you don't need long articles. Maybe you only need to link to a video or a GIF with a few short sentences and thats all your followers want. 

Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff here. What I am saying is that don't just apply this as a one size fits all. Look at your niche and ask who your followers are and what they want.  ",2016-02-10 15:12:36

Tomorrow I start a $1700 job that will have less than $100 of expense associated.,Entrepreneur,"Things are going well. I am not lighting the world on fire but have got my foot in the door with a few bigger ones and landed the $1700 one mentioned.  My son is my partner and we are currently owner/operators (why there is less than $100 of expense on job).

Big thank you to this sub for the support and encouragement.  I am still willing to get a night job if necessary while building my buisiness but I have already established that I will be able to build something substantial in the short time that i have been working on it.

A couple of redditors gave a couple of BIG  things to me.  One gave me a free year of House Call Pro.  I used the free version for a couple of days before he got me hooked up.  I you are in the service industry you MUST check out this app.  The free version is very powerful.  Another redditor is almost done with my website.  I have not seen it yet but I still cannot express my gratitude to these two individuals.

Edit:  spelling

Update:  Day one of the job and we got the entire inside of the house complete.  I THINK that we will be able to finish tomorrow but we have Saturday set aside just incase.  Looks like I did a good job quoting this one.  Fingers crossed for tomorrow.  
Bottom line - this is not rocket science.  I just need to stay disciplined in getting new business and make sure that my quotes are on point.  The work is easy.


SECOND EDIT:

The job is complete.  We made a couple of rookie mistakes that caused us about 6 hours of labor and $20 in job expense.  At the end of the day we brought in $1670 for the job - Lunches for crew (me and my son) and one breakfast, gatorade for the days (it's hot in florida), 2 packs of microfibre cloths (the $20 because of one rookie mistake) total right at $120.  I did use about six cap's full of my cleaning solution which probably equates to about $.25.  Took us 36 total man hours but should have been 30 (rookie mistake #2) and obviously we are not fast window cleaners seeing that this is my first home to have been cleaned.  I think that this job could be completed in 24 man hours with experienced employees.  Total job margin = $1550 92%.  Job margin paying two employees would be roughly $1,010  60% even with the poor time management of 36 hours.

I""m going to call this one a BIG win for us.

Feeling confident that I will make this work but it's still a scary road ahead of me.  I hope my luck matches my effort!


Rookie mistakes were:
1. Poor quality on a few outdoor second story windows causing us to go back.  The customer did not see the poor quality but we did and fixed it.
2. We completed a hard water stain removal job two days before starting this one.  The rags that we used on the HWS removal job had a chemical on them even after washing and got mixed into our 'good' rags.  When detailing the windows after cleaning it left a residue the two didn't notice until we had done almost the entire inside of the home.

My partner and I launched www.DankStop.com on April 17th 2014. After a spontaneous (literally decided the night before) trip to a Vegas glass art convention, we ordered $4000 worth of products (22 products, 1 unit each), photographed them, and launched a website. We had a functional ecommerce site up and running 30 days after deciding we wanted to start the business. We started an Instagram account (@dankstop) promoting the glass art industry. Through networking, the account grew fast and we used it to drive traffic to our new website. I had worked in the photo/film industry and dabbled in web work, while my partner had experience in marketing with several large social media accounts under his belt, so we combined our skill sets to make it work. 


As of today, our IG account has grown to 80,000 followers and our product selection contains over 2000 SKUs. We ship thousands of packages each month to countries all over the world and continue to grow every single month. 


For about 8 months, my partner and I did EVERYTHING. Fulfillment, packaging, customer service, web dev, etc. We quickly realized we needed to expand, and over the course of the past 7 months our company has grown out of my basement and into a 4000 sqft facility with 8 employees. We've expanded our marketing beyond Instagram to PPC ads, featured articles, SEO, other social media platforms, and more.

447,fbj89l,False,Lessons Learned,182,How I lost $873k and what I have learned from it,Entrepreneur,"EDIT: before you start reading, keep in mind that by “lost” I mean profits that didn’t materialize due to a series of poor decisions or simply by bad luck.

Today I was reflecting on the past 5 years of my life.

I will preface that I'm not a millionaire.  And, knowing the tendency of some posts,  I'm not going to try to sell you some motivational courses - if anything, I will buy some :)

I simply want to share my story with someone.

I'm told that I'm good at what I do - I manage startups and invest in Wall Street.  But I'm not a particularly successful person, I would say pretty average compared to people with my same education and professional experience.

However, I had my chances to ""get ahead"" several times in the past 5 years.  But I missed most of them and lost $873k of profits along the way.  But I learned some key lessons:

1. Back in 2015, I started a little tech agency with $10k in the bank.  I was lucky enough to have some great freelancers around me who helped me land great contracts.  The turning point was a $1.4M semi-Governmental tender that I won. Two months later being awarded the contract, not only nothing got started, but my purchaser and his team got fired.  After spending months (unpaid) on POCs, my contract was canceled and I had lost $500k in pure profit. The new head brought in his own agency.

**Loss: $500k (in potential profit)**   
**Lesson learned:** it is so important not to be tunnel-visioned and try to work exclusively with large corps or Government on high ticket types of projects. Especially if you run a small agency.  SMEs can provide the cash you need to keep going.

2. Back in 2017, I land a leading role in one of the fastest-growing startups in my region.  I felt so privileged, excited and humbled by the opportunity that I didn't formalize my bonus / equity agreement the way it should have been.  I was rushing to get started and I thought ""money will follow"".  1.5 years down the line, targets were crushed, the startup went through multiple rounds of Series B funding and my bonus was never paid. No specific reason, except ""we don't have cash now"".  And that seems strange when you have just raised $10M.  I left and didn't sue.

**Loss: $110k + equity (in potential profit)**   
**Lesson learned:** don't let your emotions forget the importance of formalizing business arrangements.  Don't trust hand-shake deals: they work only on TV shows like The Profit.

3. Early 2018, I entered the stock market and managed to get a great entry price on my favorite portfolio (mainly tech, slightly diversified).  I was semi-experienced, but far from being a PRO.  My portfolio grew 25% in a year.  However, December 18's correction scared the hell out of me and I decided to book profits by liquidating the whole portfolio.  Although I was planning to hold for 25 years, I got scared.  I decided to sit on the sidelines and wait for a recession before re-entering the market.  If I had kept that portfolio going, this would have returned 180% in 2019 alone.

**Loss: $180k (in potential profit)**   
**Lesson learned:** if you plan to hold your portfolio for 25 years, then hold it for 25 years.  Don't let your emotions control your investment decisions. Follow Buffet's advice.  Don't try to time the market.

4. End of 2017, I was holding 5 BTC, purchased for a total of $10k a few months earlier.  They shoot to $16k each, for a total of $83.5k in a matter of a couple of months.  I don't sell.  Afterall everyone is saying that they will reach $100k.  Well, they didn't.  I sold them a few years later when they were worth $2.5k each and got my money back.

**Loss: $68k (in potential profit)**   
**Lesson learned:** pay yourself first and re-invest the profits from high-risk investments into safer nests (e.g. real estates) when possible.  This is my personal philosophy, I know some might disagree.

5. Early 2019, I started taking online stock trading quite seriously.  I had done all the study, practice paper-trading for a while, read a few books and found my mentors.  Things were shaping up well until I started getting greedy while feeling invincible.  My early wins made me forget I was a novice, after all.  And, in fact, after an incredible start, I ended up the year with a loss. Stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.

**Loss: $15k (my own cash)**   
**Lesson learned:** again if you want to be in the stock market, train on getting your emotions out of the way.  Be humble, the stock market is a b\*tch, especially when you're a speculator trader.  Be content by small, predictable and consistent wins rather than hoping to catch the new Tesla every week. And, finally, never underestimate the importance of risk management - that's the first thing you should learn.

Said that I'm keeping going.  I have never felt depressed or sad about how much money I have left on the table.  I learned a ton (although at a high price) and I became a much stronger man.

I have another couple of projects on the table and I hope at least one of them will go through.

To all of you that, like me, had more losses than wins in life - **KEEP GOING** and, most importantly, **NEVER EVER STOP HUSTLING.**

After all, all we need in life is one big win.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/fbj89l/how_i_lost_873k_and_what_i_have_learned_from_it/,632,"In my view, don't buy stocks now. The prices have risen too high the past 10 years, a correction has started and might continue. I could be wrong though.

I personally lost about $800k in potential profits the past 2.5 years. I bought 40k BNBs (a cryptocurrency coin) at $0.56 a coin spending about $23k in August 2017. A month later I sold. Had I kept all my BNBs, I would be worth about $760k now as one BNB rose from $0.56 to $19 now (34x return).

My goal now is to get out of debt by trading some alt coin together with a tokens named Ethbull and Ethbear. I'm also planning to do international arbitrage trading, and hopefully I'll scale and make more money than my current job. ",2020-02-29 21:16:23

856,cr8s0g,False,,90,$400k/mo selling raver glasses.,Entrepreneur,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Dan Watkins of [GloFX](https://www.glofx.com), a brand that sells party eyewear and flow props.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Party eyewear and flow props.
* Revenue/mo: $400,000
* Started: February 2012
* Location: Tallahassee, Fl
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 25

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

Hello! My name is Dan Watkins, and I am the founder and CEO of GloFX. Our brand develops innovative eyewear and LED flow props, ranging from glasses with kaleidoscope lenses to fiber optic flow toys. If it augments your vision or you can dance with it at a music festival, odds are we make it or are looking into making it.

We are the #1 global leader in dimensional eyewear, and have sold millions of pairs since inception.

We started marketing primarily within the ever-growing EDM music festival demographic, and years later, our top sales still come from this category. We love being part of the EDM and festival culture and are fortunate to be able to grow with this community.

Although we focus a lot of our time and marketing toward these festival-goers, it’s exciting to say that we’ve expanded our brand into other markets as well, such as arts and science museums, educational institutions, and EDM subculture fashion. We have also been working to spread the word about our own line of batteries, a product that has done extremely well since its release.

On top of selling the standard products we provide on our website, our [wholesale](https://glofx.com/bulk-and-wholesale/) team has done a tremendous job handling bulk custom orders. We’ve seen substantial success in utilizing this area for experiential marketing campaigns. One of our most popular orders is Custom Paper Diffraction Glasses where businesses can choose what their glasses will look like as well as have their logo on the frames.

In 2018, GloFX was named #1,650 on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing companies in America, and pictured below is a portion of our Executive Team from when we won 1st in class at the Sterling Manufacturing Business Excellence Award in 2017.

To learn more about GloFX, here is a link to our About page.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Although I never set out to start my own business, I think I’ve always been an entrepreneur by nature. At one point when I was working 40 hours a week with a different employer, I realized that all my hard work was paying off for someone else’s idea of success.

GloFX was originally a side project I started in my garage when I wasn’t at work, and I was just selling basic glow products to local clubs. I was putting the money I earned back into the business, and before I knew it, I was making 80% of my income by only putting 20% of my time into its creation. And that’s saying a lot when you also have a 40-hour week job!

After the garage, we moved into a small office building. I first rented two small offices, each about 10x15 square feet. We were packed in! Within about a year, we expanded into over a dozen of these small offices. We had a small operation inside each of them. All-in, we were still under 2,000 square feet. Pics below!

*Office 3 was package holding. This was a cool order we did of 50,000 pairs of glasses for iCitizen.^*

*This was the “Main office” where I worked, sharing a desk with our graphics guy.*

The business really took off as soon as I discovered diffraction grating film. This eventually turned into GloFX Diffraction Glasses, a key factor in developing our line of dimensional eyewear. I started GloFX with $400 in capital, and within 30 months, I watched that $400 snowball into $1,000,000.

A few years later, we moved into our second facility, which was half office and half warehouse. It was right around 4,000sq ft, which was HUGE for us at the time.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/339/original/open-uri20190804-4-11sopnu?1564888524)

In 2017, we moved into our current location, which is roughly 15,000 square feet. The new production warehouse is more than twice the size of our previous location. We anticipate outgrowing this facility again soon.

### Take us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product.

Creating a product is not a walk in the park. One of our most substantial and earliest launches was the Lux Series, and for around two years we were pinching pennies to get enough money to start the production process. The Lux Series was specifically a Glove and Orbit launch. An Orbit is a spinning disk on a string with LED lights. When spun, the LEDs create mesmerizing patterns and trails. Gloving is a popular hobby in which people use the lights on the end of their gloves to create glowing patterns as they move their fingertips. Both very different, but the flowing aspect remains the same between the two forms.

And then when we thought we had enough money (over six-figures worth of investments) we still went $20k over budget and spent over a year editing and tweaking the prototypes to create the perfect products.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/342/original/open-uri20190804-4-ytt2xk?1564888525)

We start with product development. This includes figuring out concepts and ideas, researching marketing strategies, prototyping, sourcing, and manufacturing.

Then, we moved to funneling. That’s when we started analyzing marketing data, researching SEO, creating prices, making website pages for all the products to be accessible, and finally starting to think about styling, themes, colors, and logos.

Below are images of the Lux Orbit during the prototyping phase.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/343/original/open-uri20190804-4-scf1lf?1564888525)

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/344/original/open-uri20190804-4-1vldx3y?1564888525)

Once we got all the logistics in place, marketing came in full swing to push our products as much as they could.

This meant social media, promotion at events, paid advertising, wholesale outreach, ad campaigns, and guerilla marketing.  At the time, our team was pretty small, so it was all hands on deck for marketing. Even our product engineer helped with marketing at times. Some of our biggest marketing successes came from Google Adwords back then when it was at its prime. These days we focus more on social media and display ads. Below is a shot of one of our marketing meetings just before launch of the series. We were in our second location at that time.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/345/original/open-uri20190804-4-o9xrj7?1564888526)

When the product launch finally came along, we already had enough excitement surrounding the Lux Series that we didn’t see a lull in sales when the series dropped.

During this process, we quickly learned a lot about the required safety precautions attached to lithium batteries and even hired a law firm to do patent research on our glove lights. Of course, the process wasn’t as simple as a few paragraphs, and what could have gone wrong did. But we never lost sight of the goal, and on the other end, we came out with one of the largest scale product developments GloFX ever tackled.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

One of the biggest factors keeping customers coming back is constantly focusing on “what’s next”. It’s easy to say, “This is working. Let’s keep doing exactly that,” but that’s not how you grow. You always have to take chances because who knows? One of your craziest ideas might also be one of the best.

For example, for one of our earliest versions of the Space Whip, one of our most popular flowing toys, we released Sparkle Fibers as an option to compliment our regular Nano End Glo Fibers. They didn’t do as well as we thought they were going to do, so years later, when our team decided to bring Sparkle Fibers back, it was a big leap.

However, we knew the flowing and whipping community had grown substantially since this first Sparkle Fiber release. When the Space Whip Remix officially came out, everyone went crazy for the “new” Sparkle Fibers. It was what we were looking for in our first release and more! You just have to flow with market, follow your gut, and not be afraid of failure. If we hadn’t made that jump again, our sales this quarter would look much different.

We also focus on multi-tiered marketing. For us, this looks like heavily using buyer-intent keywords for search engine optimization, remarketing to high-value customers, and utilizing our reseller network. Over the years, we’ve shipped wholesale orders to thousands of resellers, and right now, we have over 300 approved resellers worldwide.

When we were starting out, we wanted to get ourselves face-to-face with our demographic. To do this, we did (and still do) have onsite event activations all across the USA. Most recently, we were the official Dimensional Eyewear and LED Flow Arts Sponsor of Electric Forest 2019.

It was exciting to be able to send an awesome team into the field to interact with the Flow Arts community as well as possible consumers.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

Right now, we’re doing great. We just released our Space Whip Remix Series to the public, and this is our biggest product launch to date! Before the Remix came out, we were all focused on getting this product into the hands of our customers. Now that that’s released, we have time to spend on updating the website, refining our shipping processes, and more.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/349/original/open-uri20190804-4-1sdmai3?1564888528)

Amazon Prime Day was an amazing turnout for us and so was Electric Forest. We just got Afterpay officially installed into glofx.com to allow buyers to pay in smaller installments, and we’ve already seen positive feedback with both sales and happy customers.

Moving forward, we’ve got some big projects sitting with the product development team, and our marketing team is helping out the creative and wholesale departments with media and outreach.

Overall, we have slow months and fast months depending on festival season and holidays, but there is always something to be done. And we’re always looking up and up to see how we can improve the company together.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

The first thing I would say is to hire slow, and fire fast.

When in the hiring process, you need to really make sure the employee you’re choosing is a right fit for the company. Are they going to excel at what they do and take tasks upon themselves to complete? Also, are they going to fit into the culture of your company?

Make sure you’ve covered all your bases because the last thing you want to do is lay someone off. Employee turnover can be one of the most expensive and detrimental issues that a business faces. So if the time comes and you realize this person you hired wasn’t what you thought they would be, lay them off now rather than later. The sooner you realize this and pull the bandage off, the sooner you can get someone new in who will work much better.

Some more common things that I’ve heard over the years but I still had to learn myself are trial and error. You can’t assume you’re going to get everything right on the first try. That’s an almost delusional idea. Accept that you *are* going to fail at some things when you are an entrepreneur. Once you can be comfortable with that idea, the quicker and more confidently you will bounce back, and the bounce back is always the most important step.

Also, watch out for tariffs and taxes! Nexus will almost always occur faster than you think, including globally. Don’t let your company suffer from an oversight like this.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

With a growing company, we are always searching for what programs and platforms work best for us. For our website, we have found that Wordpress has done wonders. We have WooCommerce installed and numerous plug-ins to make things easier. WooCommerce helps us out with website organization such as order tracking, managing coupons, product page editing, creating sales and discounts, and more.

We use a variety of other tools, technology, and integrations to maintain efficiency with day-to-day operations. GloFX is a “systems and automations” focused company, and we’re always looking for the most cutting edge technology.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I’m actually not big into books or podcasts, but I will say that I have an intense appreciation for Google. If you have a question or want to learn more on a particular topic, Google is just a few clicks away. I’ve read some great articles over the years like this.

I would have to say that some of my best resources have been from peer influencers, observing my most prominent competitors and companies in different industries, and attending conferences and seminars. If you are presented with an opportunity to go to an informational conference or seminar, definitely take the offer. They are chalk full of information that is meant to help you in ways they feel should be expressed face-to-face. Some of my biggest leaps of knowledge came from these resources.

My last, biggest influence would be my dad. He was a salesman for 20 years and engineer by trade, which happened to line up with my two top interests.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

The advice I always give are these four things:

- Stay laser-focused. When you’re not seeing immediate turnaround, it’s easy to give up or think that maybe you should focus your time and efforts on something else. But if you’re hoping around from idea to idea, strategy to strategy, you’re never going to see the results of your hard work. Don’t feel defeated when something doesn’t work. Use that as fuel for the next attempt. 

- Make sure you’re producing quality products. I know it’s hard to find quality without having to fork out a lot of money, but investing in quality over quantity is the most important. Customer feedback could, in the long run, make or break your sales. Steer away from products that have a tendency to fall apart as soon as the reach the customer, even if it’s better on your wallet.

- Create strong business systems. As mentioned before, GloFX has many platforms and systems we rely on daily to organize our workload and maintain a steady balance of future goals and daily tasks. Never underestimate the power of a well-oiled machine and what it can accomplish.

- And lastly, you must find and train great employees to operate those systems. Having happy, capable workers will make the previous 3 steps a piece of cake. When everyone is clear with what they have to do and what is expected of them, that is when you have a functional company. 

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

As a company with under 30 employees and big ambitions, we are always on the hunt for talented new teammates! You can find open positions on our GloFX Careers Page.

For all practical purposes we (my son and I) started our business the first week of Feb 2017.  See my first post (link below) for the story.  We have surpassed the 100k mark currently setting at $110,252 in revenue.  Our worst month was June with about $3000 in revenue and our best month is this month where we are currently setting at $22,436.  

We started out only window cleaning but added pressure washing a few months later.  Now almost 75% of our revenue comes from pressure washing (with fluctuation each month).  We are currently doing residential work about 98% of the time.  I do plan on hitting commercial work very hard in the future but not until I have the residential side automated which will allow me to focus on a new area.

Early on almost all of our revenue was generated by door knocking and flyers (mostly flyers).  Over the last two months we have not been able to get many flyers out (zero this mont) but our numbers are steadily growing as we are getting a lot of business from people finding us online.  We have made it a priority to earn 5 star google reviews and now have far more than any of our competitors which is allowing us to capture a lot of revenue online.  

From day one I have wanted to get out of the field as soon as possible but I dont think it is going to happen quite as soon as I would like.  I will likely work in the field for a good part of 2018 as we try to lay a solid foundation for the business for future growth.  Originally I thought that $20,000 was the most revenue that my son and I would be able to do in one month but after speaking with some others that do what we do I think that number is closer to $40,000.  Currently our biggest limiting factor is equipment so we are in the process of planning/saving for the necessary equipment to allow us to get more work done in less time.

Although I still deal with some doubt and fear from time to time I have gotten past the ""Can I actually do this"" phase.  We have a great deal of confidence and are expecting great things in the future.  We have the goal to become THE exterior cleaning company in our metro area and have every expectation of achieving this goal.  I honestly feel that we already are THE exterior cleaning company but not everyone knows that yet.  I've adopted a new motto in life:  ""The world belongs to those that do, not to those that know.""  I know that our actions accompanied with continued education will result in a great future to us.

I'm open to any questions or suggestions.

93,6onf14,False,,282,Content Marketing is Broken: Why it's so damn hard to learn anything these days.,Entrepreneur,"There was a [post in this sub earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6olf5o/i_am_sick_of_seeing_entrepreneurial_youtube/) that was basically saying that if you don't have the ability to Google answers to simple questions, that you probably don't have what it takes to make it as an entrepreneur.

And for the most part, I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment.

However, the short reply I started to write about that quickly turned into a rant about another topic I've been pondering lately, and so I decided to give it its own post.

# Content Marketing is Ruining Our Ability To Learn Online

Malcolm Gladwell is well-known for his reference of the 10,000 Hour Rule - the principle that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill - but a few years ago I realised that there were a whole bunch of these 10,000 hour masters out there who'd written pretty detailed, yet distilled, advice on how to achieve mastery in their given art, and published it online. Sometimes even in the form of a ""top 5"" list, this knowledge was never more than a 20 second google search away, and literally gave you master-level insight.

But then something happened. Other now-well-known authors started popping up telling people that they don't need to become a master in order to teach others, that with just a little bit of study and some self-confidence, you too can act as an authority on a topic. Thus, the ""10 Hour Guru"" was born, and Google quickly became flooded with top 5 tips from people who maybe weren't the most qualified to determine what those top 5 tips were.

And I feel that this has been exacerbated in the last 18 months or so with the rise of content marketing, where everybody is writing quick little sharable pieces in the hope of catching attention, to the point where it's actually become really difficult to find quality learning material online.

For example, if you were to go on Google right now and type in ""how to launch a youtube channel"" or similar topics (""Youtube tips"", ""Youtube strategy"", etc.), you'll find pages like this:

* [How to Start a Youtube Channel](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229284) (Entrepreneur.com), which is literally a guide on how to follow the fucking setup steps for registering a Google account and creating a channel on Youtube. Super not helpful
* [7 Ways to make your Youtube Channel Really Successful](http://www.vlognation.com/tips-for-starting-new-youtube-channel/) - which contains ever-helpful advice like ""be positive"" and ""be unique and original""
* [How to Launch And Grow a Youtube Channel in 14 days](https://blog.hootsuite.com/launch-youtube-channel-14-days/) (Hootsuite). This one is actually slightly more helpful, and contains some links to topics you can read more on, but ultimately comes down to giving superficial advice like ""post good videos"" followed by ""use Hootsuite"" at the end

As well as a whole host of other people trying to sell you ebooks and online courses, or to sign you up to their e-mail drip marketing campaign (that will later try and sell you an ebook or online course)

Can you imagine if recipes were shared online like that?

***

**A Content Marketer's Guide to Making an Apple Pie**

* **Step 1: Have confidence in yourself** - confidence is key to really nailing that apple pie!

* **Step 2: Your pie must contain apples** - An apple pie isn't an apple pie without apples (the Entrepreneur.com step)

* **Step 3: Choose a crust that aligns with your ethos.** Some people like butter, other people like to use shortening. There's no right answer, but we can't give you pros/cons or even an opinion!

* **Step 4: Make sure the oven is the ""right"" temperature** - too hot and you could burn your pie. Nobody likes burnt pie!

* **Step 5: If you mess it up, you can always buy a pie!** Walmart has a great range of pies that can ship to you in under an hour!

***

Even the purportedly good content creators are creating very SEO-driven content, which means creating individually packaged pieces of content that answer frequently searched-for questions, but that don't actually give you a broader learning structure to put it all under. The example I would give here is [Video Creators](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcB3bcWy0_QK7uPQvTD0LwQ) on YouTube, who actually seem to know their stuff, but damned if I can find a structure or starting place to any of it.

What's more, this approach surely results in a ton of duplicated content (albeit repackaged slightly). Eg:

* [How to Rank YouTube Videos for a Broader Topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHfsiCUzNrk)
* [The Best Way to Rank Videos #1 in Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stYW9c6P8P4)
* [The #1 Best Thing You Can Do for your Video SEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-wB9Ua1j0)
* [This playlist of 20 videos about SEO on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxDZJe1lbaatO_3n2Zleorp0Acof8aO8)

And as frustrating as I find it that they don't just have a single, comprehensive video about SEO on YouTube, I completely understand why they're doing it: **Because that's how the game is won in 2017**. The reason content marketing is what it is, is because people are rewarded for behaving this way... and essentially punished if they don't.

Google rewards them by ranking their endless streams of content across their multitude of keywords. The numpties that upvote posts reward them. The people who fork over their e-mail addresses reward them (or worse yet, the people who pay for ebooks and courses reward them).

This problem is systemic.

# So what's the solution?

Honestly, I don't know that there is one - at least not one that I can see.

I mean, these stand out to me:

**1. Encourage masters to create more content.** The issue is that when they're at the peak of their game, they're out there doing, not teaching. This is why the 'teachers' in Entrepreneur Land are often criticized as making their money from teaching people how to make money. Not to mention that there's a bit of fear involved in ""sharing the secret recipe"", even though history will show us that having a perfect recipe and being able to bake a perfect pie are two completely different things).

**2. Discourage useless posts.** Unfortunately, there are a shit ton of people who get super duper inspired when they read things like ""be authentic"" as a critical step in apple pie making. Heck, we see it in this sub all the time - people upvoting and [writing how inspired they were](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6o8bnv/how_i_generate_5475000_impressions_a_year_for/dkfoq65/) when someone gives bad advice in [useless posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6o8bnv/how_i_generate_5475000_impressions_a_year_for/) in the sub - if we're lucky some people chip in with why that advice is bad and the author deletes their post. Even /u/garyvaynerchuk, who was previously well-known for freely giving in-depth strategic knowledge, has recently discussed that he's using motivational content as a gateway to access a larger fanbase.

**3. Better curation.** I think this is one of the reasons that Product Hunt became so popular initially. It wasn't just a great way to see the latest apps/products being introduced to the market, it was also a **curated** list in the beginning, with a select number of people able to even submit projects in the first place. It's also why sites like Startup Stash have become so immensely popular. (*Note that Startup Stash isn't just a list of the ""top 5 apps"" in multiple categories, it is an actual definitive list, according to /u/BRVM, of every app that will be useful to you in those categories.*). Don't just subscribe to services that automatically populate your twitter/social feeds.

**4. Ask people who've done it before for advice.** Welcome to the callback! Granted, I think the main reason that people post asking for advice on simple topics is that they are too lazy to take the time to research it themselves, but I also think it's sometimes hard to find a starting place. That's why I [posted the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/6mqdbp/question_where_can_i_find_a_comprehensive_guide/) in /r/newtubers looking for a good guide that breaks down youtube strategy.

# A Call To Action: Let's Create Better Content

It's always good to end a post with a nice call to action, and I think at the end of the day what it really comes down to is that it is our responsibility as entrepreneurs to create better content, to help each other grow our businesses rather than trying to profit from each other all the time.

If you're sitting out there, and you have knowledge of how to grow a pinterest account, how to grow a youtube account, a facebook account, how to copywrite, run a Kickstarter, etc., then create teachable content that goes beyond a sharable/rankable fluff piece, or even a single pillar article. Take a look at sites like how [the landing page course used to be](http://imgur.com/JSVk357) (before they threw an e-mail capture in front of it), and look at how you yourself can contribute to creating perennial, definitive content that others can learn from, that becomes the #1 piece of content anyone anywhere will recommend when people ask , ""Does anyone know how to grow a youtube channel?"".

And I'm not excusing myself from this. I've already started to assemble the piece meal posts and comments I've made here for my experiments with [@yahtzeedog](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3zfg0w/how_to_hire_a_social_media_manager/cym9vgr/) and [@fuddlemuckers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/362s1t/600_instagram_followers_in_1_week_for_new_brand/) and others into a single definitive guide to Instagram, and you can be sure I'll do it with YouTube once I figure that one out. If anyone wants to help build any of these, feel free to drop a comment/DM and let's get started.

And the thing is... I think if we actually assemble this information, that it could potentially serve as the greatest content marketing of all.

Thanks for listening to my rant :D

Within the first year, I was bring home $5,000-6,000/month in cash, while working 15 hours/week. AMA",Entrepreneur,"As the title said, I'm 24, and this is my first business. Lots of people have been asking me for an AMA, and I regularly get questions on how to get into this industry. So here goes!

I knew I didn't want to start a company that required investment up front, so I decided to look at what I was good at, and what I enjoyed. I settled on tutoring, because I love teaching, but wouldn't want to work in a classroom.

I moved to NYC and started working for some other companies. Tutoring is a huge industry here: most companies charge upwards of $180/hr for test prep. Within a few months of going independent (and charging slightly lower than commercial rates) I was able to fully support myself. 

I still tutor students individually on the side, and my bills are paid from that alone. But I wanted to expand into developing test prep resources, so I used my extra time to do that. I made a [website](http://www.altiora.nyc) with wordpress, bought a copy of Illustrator, and started developing questions for a common NYC admissions exam (the NNAT2 and OLSAT, aka the Gifted and Talented entrance exam). 

It's a popular test, and people were paying $180+/hr to have tutors come to their house and go over questions like ""If Billy had 5 apples and ate 2, how many were left?"" There weren't many resources available for people to study at home, and those that were available were very expensive. The largest set of free questions you could find are the 14 questions on the nyc.gov website, and a full proctored practice test can cost upwards of $200.

I noticed a market niche for low-cost resources for this exam that hadn't been filled yet, so I made a free test and guide book that I put on my website, to give people a reason to visit the website in the first place. I developed three practice books, with varying levels of question difficulty. Instead of paying to publish and print hard copies of my practice books, I have them priced at 1/3 my competitor prices as downloadable PDFs. 

Examples here: www.altiora.nyc/publications

I also have a page where I recommend amazon products (affiliate links) for people to prep their kids at home, with advice on how to use said products effectively. 

Right now, the bulk of my income comes from my in-person tutoring, but that has it's limits (I can only teach so many kids in a day!) So hopefully I can reach more people via my online resources. 

So, that's the background.

700,4u1vap,False,,88,"For the better part of a year I forced myself to come up with 10 ideas a day. Here they are, over 1,000 ideas in one place.",Entrepreneur,"I posted this as a comment on another thread and it got a lot of love so thought I should make it its own post.

For the better part of 2015 and the beginning of 2016, I tried to forced myself to sit down every day and come up with 10 ideas. 

I'd chose a subject. For instance: ""ideas for food-related businesses"". And wouldn't get up till I had thought of ten different ideas.

I failed a lot, but did still manage to do 118 days and put together over 1,000 ideas. Not all business related. But plenty that are. Here they are: [My Daily Ideas](http://sampriestley.com/daily-ideas/)

Most of the ideas are crap. A few are OK. And a couple are golden and have been followed through in my life.

The idea for it was taken from James Altucher.

Here's an example:
**Ideas for food-related online-businesses**

* A podcast where you interview the founders and chefs of the cool restaurants and coffee shops around London. Places like Shoreditch grind and the food carts etc. Should be fairly easy to get them on. It’s free publicity and there’s not many foodie podcasts about.

* A YouTube channel of budget cooking in London. How to cook in a small flatshare kitchen. Aimed at foodies in their 20s or 30s living in London. How to do flash, cool food cheaply for dinner parties etc.
* A compilation style site that brings all the information on the ‘cool’ places to one place. Collate data, links and picture from all over the web. For instance: what timeout says, what the bloggers say, Instagram pics, Foursquare reviews. Get all the reviews and tips in one place. Could have some sort of auto-webscraper that gets the information automatically, which could then be checked and uploaded by a human.
* A recipe site for stuff you've had in restaurants or food carts. Want to create a Lucky Chip burger at home? Here’s how to do it. Look up the stuff you love the look or taste of on the site and get the recipe. If the chefs want to keep their recipes secret could be the best closest guess by an expert chef.
* A website to find companions who want to go to restaurants. Like online dating, but you’re looking for people with a shared food passion. The you go to cool restaurants or pop-ups together. Like the couch surfing communities. A great way to meet people that isn’t weird or awkward. Plus if you’re a massive foodie and your current friends aren’t or don’t want to spend the money, it’s a way not to look like a loner.
* Amateur chef lessons.Like an airbnb website but instead of a place to stay you find a chef who will give you a lesson. Full range of teachers from professionals who can put on lessons at their restaurants, to local mums who want to make a bit of extra money from their home. Also can play on the global nature of London. So you can find teachers from every country in the world.
* An instagram/Pinterest account solely aimed at taking cool photos of food. ‘A professional food photography’. Try and monetise by selling the most popular pictures to the restaurants and cafes to use. License it – for £100 you can use this picture which 10,000 people liked. Basically crowd-sourcing the best pictures of your venue.
* Similar to the one before, but become a broker. Find the most popular images of food. Contact the photographer and ask if they’d be interested in licensing it. Then get in touch with the restaurants and take a middle-man cut.
* A recruitment style site but for cool food related stuff with a focus on volunteer work. Give places the opportunity to hire volunteers to work in their kitchen or food cart. And a place people who want to get into seriously good food can go to do some volunteering at the best places. Pretty much all top chefs went to France to work as dishwashers in the best kitchens in the world. This could be the food cart/creative food version. Could review the volunteers and restaurants as well.
* A crowd funding place for food carts and pop-ups. Like a local version of Kickstarter. Awards can be invitations openings events, menu items named after the funder, free food for life, the opportunity to have the food cart come to your event/birthday party etc.

434,93pnq6,False,AMA,433,We made 250k USD last month with our dropshipping side hustle. Oberlo / Shopify reached out to us to do a success story. AMA!,Entrepreneur,"Hey Reddit!

My name is [Jacky Chou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacky-chou/). With my partner, [Albert Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertqliu/) ([albeliu](https://www.reddit.com/user/albeliu) on Reddit), we launched a home decor dropshipping site on Shopify that went from negative 3k to 250k a month in 8 months at 30-40% margins. We’re both first generation Asian-Canadians who moved from Vancouver to Berlin to work in marketing.

We started our dropshipping store as a ‘practice what you preach’ case study, as we’re both working as digital marketing consultants (Albert as a freelance Facebook consultant and I’m a founder of an SEO agency, [Indexsy](https://indexsy.com/)).

Oberlo / Shopify reached out to us to do [a success story](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/thriving-home-decor-business). For those interested, we’ve summed up our learnings below:

1. Dropshipping is extremely saturated and competitive.
2. You’re paying for ads to buy data so Facebook/Google can optimise better.
3. Perceived value determines how much you can charge for a product. Invest in web design and ad creatives.
4. Do not try to imitate the big players in dropshipping. If they are selling a specific product, it’s highly likely it’s already too late.
5. Invest in product research and building a brand/niche store. Having multiple products that appeal to the same customer will increase your AOV.
6. Screen suppliers for product quality / packaging. Better packaging will increase perceived value and help to build trust. Also, make sure suppliers are not putting their own promotions in their products (Oberlo Suppliers will never put promotional material in their packages).
7. Pay attention to customer satisfaction. This is even more important in dropshipping than traditional e-com given lower perceived value.
8. Set up processes ASAP and outsource when possible. Bring on external help for time consuming tasks and areas you are not familiar with so you can focus your time on growing the topline of the business.

# We’re here to answer any questions you may have about dropshipping, ecommerce, or even life in Berlin!

EDIT: Taking a breather for the night, will come back a bit later and tomorrow to answer any remaining questions. This was fun, if you want to connect, find me on Linkedin!

## 10. The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facde98f2dc1c62ce9ff1_JNBLt0IjmQzUbVpgUE484LiYfRl50gK9jUDiuSzkNxou9HC1A4pitU0zneFyvLnBP2UzLawyZbzxf0uuGhL6LFL27O4haFC_IhZ0_fnV26wKYekCFY_iIv6I7qN48lEMPiekqNhr.jpeg)

**Why Buy: **Business is difficult. Especially as the CEO of your startup. 

Ben Horowitz has been there and back as the CEO of Opsware, product manager of Netscape, and venture capital co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz.

**Pros:** In [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205/), Horowitz gets into the nitty-gritty details of managing a company. He covers topics like firing employees, the dangers of promoting the wrong people (and the right people at the wrong time) and managing the company and yourself.


**Cons:** Until you’re managing employees, this book may not be valuable until you plan on doing so. Further, some of the high-stress moments were self-inflicting from taking venture capital.

The profanity in this book may be off-putting to you too (one use of the “n” word, several uses of the “f” word, and several other cuss words sprinkled in it).


## 9. Built to Sell by John Warrillow

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdef466ee938190f88d_UXk3DnFhLO_bm4dUq_1222DSyFkAFaDWrv-ZhA-3FCs2zs5ruB59MKaZes1JaCf2kjc308_Tx2txw2wUTcujEV9f5wLJXlULJ2rz7IPYHyajOgMVB_NhEp2kqSIqMp8toAGrU0r8.jpeg)

**Why Buy:** Even if you have no intention of selling your business, it’s valuable to know what you should do to remove yourself from being a bottleneck in your business.

**Pros:** [Built to Sell](https://www.amazon.com/Built-Sell-Creating-Business-Without/dp/1591845823/) gives you the mindset and strategy to make sure you spend more time working _on_ your business rather than _in_ your business.

**Cons:** Unless you’ve got a lot of capital to invest in employees, you need to be the bottleneck to do the work. That said, even as a one-person business, standardizing your business will help streamline your productivity.


## 8. Monetizing Innovation by Madhavan Ramanujam and Georg Tacke

**Why Buy:** Pricing your product right is often an overlooked growth lever. 

A $10/month product would pull in $1,420 a month in revenue if you reinvest all revenue into acquiring more customers (yay compounding interest!). But bumping up your product to $29/month would pull in over $1.1 million a month! That’s 819x more monthly revenue.

**Pros:** [Monetizing Innovation](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119240867/) is the best book I’ve read on pricing strategy. Some books only talk about the psychology of pricing or tell you to optimize for “value-based pricing.” This book goes over several elements of pricing strategy and why you should pick one strategy over another.

Some of the principles I talk about [on pricing strategies](https://www.growthramp.io/articles/pricing-strategy) I’ve borrowed from this book.

**Cons:** Some of the principles aren’t easy to apply without several potential customers to do a price-test. This is why I recommend you use the Van Westendorp pricing method to find the acceptable price range of your potential customers.


## 7. The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdfc7ec61886c9c74a9_6ql1kDJ065xIdBWXFSO4uSxWaUSjdVtno0rVL5hBNwjP2JDq1dl7NyY2vH_Pctuw5XnlW17zaznaYD4DvLXndVcXLYILqVJC9qpeAI3SpMIqcuRGcbH5sFQ5rV8iG6mp652yAAly.jpeg)

**Why Buy:** Business operations are an often overlooked part of building a healthy company.

**Pros:** Yes, the cover of [The Goal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0884271951/) looks like a boring business book from the ‘80s. But you’ll find the story inside to be very compelling and insightful on how to operate a company. There were a few counter-intuitive principles Goldratt teaches, such as why having employees doing nothing is a necessary part of business efficiency.

**Cons:** You may find the story used in the book a little unrealistic at times. But there are moments when the story does help paint a clear picture of the importance of the core concept.


## 6. What’s Best Next by Matt Perman

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdf096ef4300890b9e1_geh1_Oyt24Y5y0InBC6rcktwnPFz-Ob2AGD4GFm_FhHh9fgcSHKkQxNIsEp1ojjX_7nku2uq3OFfFK19D1jyDNIUvapkVYLulftbJvdVzyDCwVSOwrwylhf20WuO99yC7GUWgYVm.jpeg)

**Why Buy:** Entrepreneurs often lack a clear sense of purpose in what they are doing and why. 

[What’s Best Next](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310533988/) will give necessary clarity on productivity, understanding your life goal, and your life mission without all the fluff I’ve read from other books on this topic.

If you have an open mind, this book comes at productivity and purpose from a Christian perspective.

**Pros:** Having a clear mission and life goal has been my greatest source of motivation. This book inspired Growth Ramp’s mission to help 1,000 entrepreneurs from idea to scale, along with several other life goals I am pursuing.

I’ve gifted and recommended this book to fellow entrepreneurs the most.

**Cons:** The last 1/3 of the book on Perman’s productivity system wasn’t super insightful. 

Further while having a life mission and goal is a great motivation, in itself it won’t pay your bills. Like a few other books on this list, that’s not the fault of the author, but the necessary limited scope of this book.


## 5. Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdff466ee68c190f893_0airG9f8GrHGBEYPCCFw2T6es-v6SHBYn9KWOhDvJxXY06QrObeLl9ZlDej8ldyCIVSL5yqDB6zsuqAQs5qZ__2M3s9TfXIwSg4Y2XIPy10Fiild04NAspoTzfED-wV_muperaLp.jpeg)

**Why Buy:** Whether you’re selling yourself to a co-founder, selling your idea to an investor, or selling your product to a customer, you need to know how to sell. Negotiation is a critical and often overlooked part of successful sales.

**Pros:** [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/B01COR1GM2/) provides a gripping story in one chapter, followed by a valuable negotiation lesson in the next chapter.

I used one suggestion in this book to retain ~$3,000 MRR in one negotiation.

**Cons:** I put this in position #5 because of its importance to starting a successful startup, not because the topic isn’t covered well. As important as negotiating is, you still only need it in the area of formal and informal sales.


## 4. Positioning by Jack Trout and Al Ries

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdf946b12e4c0a2efef_nRrixN8StKsl7YoD3YfTAkDUkBNSGPE6-wrbjbx-sB64y6blec8pIFi2PMAluRr-TrYDKCrVcAu0V9lxqosLIizpuu2jCfGE9GNfrLhA5-KJuAGn-z4QdJN3uEQVyj6JY9Xt_SXl.jpeg)

**Why Buy:** If you struggle to separate your startup from the competition, [Positioning](https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586/) is an excellent primer to point you in the right direction. 

**Pros:** Much of the fundamental principles of positioning come from this book. You’ll learn about principles like why you should be #1 in your market, what to do when you’re #2, and why market leaders attempt to own a single word.

**Cons:** Trout and Ries don’t share many specific how-to details in this book. Much of the data also seems to suffer from survivorship bias as they only mention what works after-the-fact.

**Honorable Mention**: [Marketing Warfare, 20th Anniversary Edition by Jack Trout and Al Ries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/125902900X/). This book dives deeper into positioning and gives some how-to guidance. Like Positioning, this book also suffers from survivorship bias.


## 3. Traction by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdfc7ec6126329c74cb_EXS9_iqV-eiUpnJMP34UFMJMpSbY4gjihQsDE8whdXTGXuBWiwY6vff65Sk-WHe0BYmSfCzovbifxx36xOJ95otX0d8TrkkcOaTHhSOOiH-M6gsVBU9ALRZBuXchIDel8f94c708.jpeg)

**Why Buy: **Having a great product is one thing. Having traction is quite another.

**Pros:** Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares pull their experience of creating and growing successful startups. The duo then interviewed over 40 founders and pooled their knowledge to help entrepreneurs learn what it takes to get customers in their book, [Traction](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369/).

Weinberg and Mare’s work inspired my article of [the 12 core marketing channels](https://www.growthramp.io/articles/marketing-channels).

You’ll find a lot of solid ideas to test and frameworks to apply in this book to help you get your first 1,000 customers and scale from there.

**Cons: **What’s missing from this book is understanding the messaging you need to get traction. There’s a chance you may stumble upon the right words you should use to sell more product. But I don’t like leaving anything to chance.


## 2. Reality in Advertising by Rosser Reeves

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdf946b120c9fa2eff0_PZrEYAvxZNrtAk2rQF-yBuEWo7uIJWWmOFySxS2KEL5P0HB_5RIk8_dJBKiGICNISqJmR9m0gw_9Ekc28tnA32fM4bI--9PLDcwaxo2LdOCCnXchWlq4oucfn8t3uau9TUg_2-qY.jpeg)

**Why Buy: **Do you want to improve your messaging? Yet do you hate all the over-the-top copywriting which screams “BUY NOW!!!” in bold red letters and yellow highlighter? 

If so, you’ll likely connect with Rosser Reeves’s copywriting philosophy as I have from reading [Reality in Advertising](https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Advertising-Rosser-Reeves/dp/098269413X/).

Reeves was one of the greatest American advertising executives very few people know about today, which is a shame. In addition to popularizing [the power of a strong USP](https://www.growthramp.io/articles/unique-selling-proposition), Reeve’s career highlights include creating:



1. Anacin’s “a headache medicine for fast relief.” (Yup, the same USP Advil borrowed 30 years later). In 18 months, Reeve’s Anacin ad campaign increased its sales from $18 million to $54 million _([source](https://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/reeves-rosser-1910-1984/98848))_.
2. M&M's ""melts in your mouth, not in your hand.""
3. Colgate toothpaste’s ""cleans your breath while it cleans your teeth.""
4. Dwight Eisenhower's presidential ads for the 1952 election. Reeve’s TV ads helped Eisenhower beat Adlai Stevenson 442 to 89 in the electoral vote _([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_United_States_presidential_election))_.

Marketing legend David Ogilvy spoke highly of his mentor Reeves, saying, “Reeves taught me more about advertising than anybody I’ve ever known.” _([Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=C_ZxurmAk4MC&pg=PA260&dq=david+ogilvy+on+rosser+reeves&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiKhOzbj97mAhXKtp4KHeVgD244ChDoATABegQIBhAC#v=onepage&q=rosser%20reeves&f=false))_

**Pros:** Reality in Advertising has a lot of solid information on USPs and general information on marketing. Reeves takes a similar philosophy on marketing as I do: emotional marketing is valuable (e.g. brand image, video, “originality,” and “creativity.”). But a clear message which sells is more valuable to increasing sales. 

**Cons:** Some of Reeves’s case studies to back up his claims has very little verifiable evidence. Still, some of what he teaches aligns with my experience, so I won’t throw out all claims he makes.


## 1. The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen

[Book Image](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c92c77f1f695251c1b7a498/5e0facdff466ee409790f894_KwvRI1UbrurSI1bCDYfg07z9po5oKsVz3K6AT59A9JcXjA2GYpJoYQrtBifcx0JEjkD2j68LSs-gHZUe77DDqutglmWHG7fKFlSgrqPwgT8cVwfPQ_9SiILF4wBua4u2LblhiJ5f.jpeg)

**Why Buy: **Nearly everything I wish The Lean Startup covered, Dan Olsen covers in his phenomenal book, [The Lean Product Playbook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118960874/).

Olsen was a product leader at Intuit, one of the first tech companies to create a culture of the importance of creating customer-first products. He’s also consulted for Facebook, Box, and Medallia as a product manager. Much of his experience shines through in this book.

**Pros:** Throughout the book, Olsen provides a lot of frameworks and step-by-step advice on how to create a successful product. Olsen covers a lot of ground in his book, including:



1. How to conduct customer interviews.
2. How to define your value proposition.
3. How to prioritize features.
4. How to create an MVP.
5. How to apply user experience principles to your product.

**Cons:** I felt Olsen lacked on the marketing-side as a product manager (i.e. product marketing). His discussion on creating customer personas wasn’t thorough and the information on marketing MVP tests was rather thin. His focus is very SaaS-centric, but I’ve used Olsen’s principles for non-SaaS products and they still work.

413,7dcslb,False,,151,How to learn to code,Entrepreneur,"I'm a self-taught developer and I constantly get asked how to learn to code, including recently here on Reddit. Figured it would be useful if I shared my curriculum here. Also happy to answer any questions.

**My background / why you can trust me**
I started to learn to code my senior year of college, graduated, and had the following series of positions:

* Junior Web Developer at a startup
* Full-stack Web Developer at the same company
* Lead Growth Engineer at the same company
* CTO/founder of a startup (~2 years / $500k in volume before shutting it down)
* CTO/founder of [Sail](https://letssail.co) (current)

**The curriculum**


1. **Web Basics**: HTML/CSS, and JS courses on Codecademy or similar intro-level course.

2. **Ruby basics**: I did [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) (free), but you could probably replace with the Codecademy Ruby intro course, or similar.

3. **Put it all together**: [Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) (free). This book is excellent — it walks you through making a Twitter clone, from top-to-bottom.

4. **Continued learning**: Pick a project that interests you, and try to build it. You'll spend a ton of time on Google, StackOverflow, and banging your head against the keyboard, but you have a strong enough foundation now to build something from scratch. It won't be the prettiest or most functional at first, but you will be getting better really fast.

**Key to Success**

Make sure you can commit at least 1 hour / day to learning. Programming has a STEEP learning curve, that requires you hold a million new concepts in your head. You need to hammer away at these new concepts, and taking days off will just cause stuff to slip away from you.

**EDIT:**

I did not expect this to get this much attention. Figure I should come back and clarify some stuff:

**Web Development vs Coding:** As folks like /u/theCoinMedia pointed out, this curriculum is is focused on web development. A better title for this post would probably be ""How I learned Web Development"", acknowledging not just that web development is a subset of coding, but also that there are other curriculums one could follow even within web dev. 

**Coding vs CS/SE:** As many commenters point out, this curriculum is light on traditional Computer Science. In my opinion, you should start with learning to build stuff (coding) before diving into CS. Being able to build real stuff — even if it's rough, and not scalable — is much more motivational that learning abstract algorithms, which you only implement in trivial contexts as a learning exercises. Plus, being able to build the projects of your choice gives you an important learn-by-doing vehicle to continue your growth.

I can also say that learning to code can make learning CS easier, in some ways. For example, I have been studying ML recently, and though there are plenty of concepts that learning web dev has not helped with (eg, linear algebra), the actual code writing is trivial for me, even though it's in a new language for me (Python).

**There is lots of learning beyond these 4 steps:** I would think this would go without saying, but the comments on this post make it clear that it doesn't. These four steps will get you to the point where you can continue learning by building your own projects, practicing, studying, and generally striking your own course based on your own interests. These four steps won't make you Mark Zuckerberg, but rather will build a strong foundation for continued growth.

**Pick a discipline, not a language:** There are lots of comments here about whether you should Ruby vs Python vs ???. Fighting over languages is the wrong approach. Instead, pick a discipline: web development, data science, systems programming, w/e. Then go learn a popular tech stack/toolset in that discipline. This will allow you to build stuff you are actually interested in, leading to more passion, and faster learning.

**Pick a tech stack and stick with it:** Don't get caught up in which language you should learn. Once you've picked a discipline, pick one of the popular tech stacks in that discipline. Don't fuss too much about which one to pick — it really doesn't matter, as long as it's popular enough to find jobs in, and it has good learning resources. Then stick with this tech stack for at least a year, and probably longer. Focusing on a single tech stack will allow you to grow faster as a Software Engineer, rather than just a coder, as you will gain mastery in your stack, giving you the mental space to focus on stuff like software and systems design, without getting bogged down in syntax.

**The key is putting in the time:** I know it's trite to say that ""hard work is important"", but that doesn't make it any less true. Most folks who try to learn to code fail. From what I've seen, the most common reason is not being able to make time for it. You really need to spend at least an hour a day, and more when you can. You need to be willing to spend 5 hours on Sat/Sun to have deep dive sessions. Get up early and put in an hour or two before work. Coding has a lot of new concepts and skills that you have to learn, and having to constantly relearn stuff because it drifts away due to extended breaks is going to kill motivation, and greatly slow progress.

586,9zevqv,False,Lessons Learned,186,How I started a Copywriting Business After Getting Fired From My IT Job,Entrepreneur,"DISCLAIMER: I was very fortunate because my parents let me live with them rent-free. I attribute a lot of my success to them

&nbsp;



Stage 1: Get Started

So June last year I got laid off from my job. From there I decided I'll make a copywriting business from scratch. I hated the politics and the grind (I'm sure a lot of you can relate).

Problem is.........I didn't know how to write copy. Or even get started.  So I learned the only way I could, by going on Google. 

I must have read through 50 + blog posts on getting started and finally found a copywriter I liked. Read all his content and bought his course.

Took it religiously and read every single book that he recommended front and back. I still have the books littered with notes.

But I had NO CLUE how to get clients. Zero. 

One of the blog posts I saw online mentioned to look for Facebook groups. They said there were clients there looking for work.

So I decided to join one, messaged someone and got a response. I had a phone interview with my very first 'prospect.'

Holy shit I had a prospect. But that enthusiasm was short-lived. After talking to me and seeing that I didn't have anything close to a portfolio he wasn't convinced.

He liked me, but he wasn't sure if I could do the job. I don't blame him.

But I was one step closer; I knew what I needed was a portfolio. I got his attention, but the product (me) wasn't good enough.

I actually have to thank Reddit. I saw at the time there were a lot of posts going around offering 'free work.' I was interested and tried it.

It changed everything.

&nbsp;



Stage 2: First few clients

I set up a Reddit post offering free copywriting. Waited for an hour or two with my fingers crossed.

Nothing.

Went to sleep and woke up the next morning...........25 messages.

Holy. Okay, now we can get started.

Long story short, I got a few portfolio pieces. I also got my first client!

If you're reading this, you know who you are :)

I just made my first dollar...well it was a whole lot of dollars. But for the first time in forever, I felt like this had a chance.

Mind you this was six months in after I got fired. I was eating through my savings cause of small bills.

So it was very welcome. 

Also through a referral from that client, I got my second job!

Now I was ready.

&nbsp;



Stage 3: Leveraging my first few projects to get more!

Ok. Now I have a portfolio, what next?

I was reading about getting clients online like a madman. And I had mixed feelings about my next step.

I've read A LOT of good and A LOT of bad about Upwork. But I wanted to try it out to see if I could get clients on there.

What did I have to lose?

But I couldn't be like any other freelancer and start sending out proposals. 

That wouldn't get me anywhere. The thing was at this point I knew a lot about copy.

I know how the process worked and I could explain to anyone why I wrote anything.

I could break down sentences, user personas, headlines, bullets.....you name it!

This came in handy. I created a WordPress site next. 

I then wrote full-length, in-depth case studies on every single project I did to date. I mean testimonials from my clients, linked sources, screenshots......the works.

I legit spend 2-3 weeks writing 1000+ word case studies. I applied every copywriting trick I knew to the case studies.

&nbsp;


Stage 4: Bite the bullet and try out UpWork

Before I got on upwork, I researched every single part of a profile. What my tagline meant, what my user profile should be like and how do I frame my portfolio pieces.

Every single thing was geared towards getting clients.

No 'Hey I'm so and so a professional for x years yadda yada.'

It was straight, 'Hey you want great copy and clients? Well, this is what you have to do'. 

Well not in those words but you get the drill. I made sure it was personal and tried my best not to be generic. 

I send out my first 35 proposals in 2 days and waited. I won't lie I was nervous AF.

If this didn't work, that was almost a month down the drain.

Out of the 35 proposals sent, I got 11 responses and three jobs.

............this is working what in the hell. 

The best feeling was out of the 11 clients, at least 7 mentioned my case studies. They said they loved and learned a lot.

They mentioned no freelancer came close concerning presentations, even those with experience on UpWork.

I beat out several experienced freelancers (the job had 70+ proposals) for a really great project. 

I still have that client to this day, they pay well and give me projects that look stellar on my portfolio.

&nbsp;


Stage 5: Trying to grow

Life was good. I was legitimately making money per month. I'd get clients and do great work.

I leveraged work I did to get even better work. I was building up my reviews.

Now you're probably wondering, 'Hey I hear Upwork had a shit ton of crappy clients, where's the story about that?'

Yeah, I had those for sure.

I had people hit me with a '?' for not responding in 3 minutes (god can't I take a #2 in peace?)

The simple story? Cut them lose. I don't care how much money you bring to the table.

If you bring my morale down for dumb reasons, you're out.

I only worked with clients that I loved working with. If that meant less income, I'd take the hit. 

As I mentioned, I was living with my parents, so the money I made was more than enough for my bills to be paid.

And now I was starting to get referrals. The clients that I got off Upwork liked me.

Why? Because I had MORE than enough time to spend on them. And I made sure to deliver service above and beyond what was expected.

Need this done in 5 days? I'll get it to you in 4.

Wanted 3 headlines to split test. No problem man, here's 5.

If I liked the client, I would give them extra stuff. Is it the best way to do business? Maybe not.

But it's how I wanted to do business, and that's I think all that matters at the end of the day.

Those referrals turned into more referrals with great work. I started getting legitimate results.

There was a B2B campaign for a well known Australian Marketing brand I worked on. I was able to get a 10% conversion rate on the first split test.

I charged $400 for that landing page, every lead to the client was worth 1k+.

Within the first month, they had 17 leads from that one landing page and closed 5.

Safe to say they were happy as hell and had me do a bunch more.

I now had an idea of what I was doing.......about time.

But I didn't want to stay stagnant; I wanted to see how far I could take my hourly rate.

So every time I'd get two clients at a dollar amount I'd increase it by 50%.

I went from 40 to 60 to 90 to now 100.

I'm close to closing my first 100/hr client now, and it feels great.

I'm still nowhere close to where I want to be, but I'm MUCH closer than I was a year ago.

I've heard so many great stories on this subreddit from the FBA stuff to the brick and mortar stuff.

It all motivated me to want to start and do my own thing. Thought I'd share my story.

I'm pretty caffeinated and tired at the moment, but I really wanted to type this out.

I still think about the days where I used to work 9-5. I know it works for a lot of people, but it just isn't for me.

Don't get me wrong some days are bad. But the lows aren't that low.

And the highs (to me at least) are out of this world. 

I'm so happy I decided to get on this journey.

I can't wait to see where I am in 5 years, now that I started there's no way I'm stopping.

I have a dream of starting my own agency one day and I sure as hell am going to try to make it.

Also, this is just me pouring on the page so watch out for typos! (Yes writers make mistakes.....we're human too you know)

&nbsp;


Cheers r/Entrepreneur!

P.S. I still think UpWork is a bit cancer and I'm trying my best to create other forms of lead gen. I think I might try Google Ads, Facebook Ads and go to networking events around my area.

&nbsp;


P.P.S I have no idea how to edit on Reddit.....sorry if this looks bad.

905,bs5esj,False,Feedback Please,142,"I took 1.5 years to hand curate 50K visa-free travel, startup, residence and immigrant visas worldwide",Entrepreneur,"Hola guys. I am a Digital Nomad who travels and work from different countries. Visa and other high risk information is the first thing I need to figure out. For that I go to Govt. websites which suck so I decided to bring the design to trip planning / moving abroad. First thought was to design visa search or discovery in 2 clicks.

So I took on the challenge to compile travel visas (incl. visa-free), startup visas, immigration visas plus laws & culture, yellow fever requirements and other high risk information at one place. I thought it will be an easy task to write script on python and scrap 200 Govt websites. But I found out that data is not structured and differently modeled on each govt. website. The only way was to manually curate first time to make a database and then monitor for changes to keep it updated.

**1.2 years of manual curation :**

I sat down with 2 people for over a year to manually curate the visas and its requirements. After countless hours and no-weekend weeks now we have the first human curated Internet visa database  indexing 300K visa routes for the citizens of 200 countries going anywhere for any purpose. Its like IMDb for visas. You can check out here at [https://visadb.io](https://visadb.io)

**Another 4 months  of curation:**

Half way down the line  we realized that visa is not the only high risk information. There are laws and culture info, No. of Expats, Women safety data, info for LGBTQ2 travelers, Marijuana laws are important to know in advance.   e.g. its prohibited in some countries to take Govt. building pics. Its illegal to cover face in France and etc. So we decided to start compiling such information as well with the help of UN data, recent security alerts and using official Govt. sources.

**Visas indexed**

Visa-free travel, Tourist, work , study, startup, residency, immigration, investment, talent, high-skilled, freelancer, digital nomad visas, working-holiday visas.

**High-risk info**

Safety & security data, Laws & Culture, Yellow fever entry requirements, cigarette & alcohol quantities allowed, pets requirements and electric plugs,

**Monitoring & Updates:**

Now we are closely monitoring Ministry of Tourism, Foreign affairs and immigration websites of 200 countries to keep our database upto date :)

**Why we are doing this?**

* I am a traveler and passionate about making it easy.
* 71% millennials like to live'n'work outside their home countries, there should be an easy way to figure out where.
* Political situations around the world creates a need for such a database

**Grants:**

Thanks to EU & Government of Chile and Republic of Poland for the financial grants to make this happen.

514,ccp30x,False,,85,Case Study: How I Find & Select a Manufacturer on Alibaba,Entrepreneur,"In [part 1 of the case study](https://garlicpressseller.com/amazon-product-research/fba-product-research-guide-how-to-do-tools/) we found a great product for us to sell. To quickly summarize, here are the stats for the product:

* Estimated purchase cost: $5
* Estimate shipping cost: $1
* Estimated landed cost: $6
* Sales price: $30
* Amazon fee’s: $11
* **Estimated profit: $30 – $6 – $11 = $13**

So the profit looks great on this product. It hit all the other requirements ( enough demand, not seasonal etc ). The only problem with this product is that it will be a bit difficult to manufacture. Since the product is made out of 2 types of material. And I got a feeling I can easily get scammed if my supplier replaces 1 type of material with a cheaper material.

Because of this I have to make sure to be extra careful with these following steps.

&#x200B;

I already have a very [detailed guide on manufacturing](https://garlicpressseller.com/manufacturing-shipping/guide-produce-manufacture-private-label-products-china-on-amazon-fba/) so I am going to skip the basics and jump right into how I negotiate. If you don't understand anything or don't know what any of the abbreviations mean, I advice you to check out the beginners guide.

&#x200B;

I searched for as many manufacturers of my product on Alibaba and all send them the same message:

>Hi,  
>  
>I am looking to manufacture product X ( see attachment for picture ).  
>  
>**Product description**  
>  
>\-Size: X  
>  
>\-Weight: X  
>  
>\-Material: X  
>  
>\-Packaging: x  
>  
>\-Color: X  
>  
>Are you able to manufacture this product?  
>  
>For my first order I am looking to purchase 1000 units FOB. Can you send me a quote for this?  
>  
>Is it possible to add my logo on the product? How much are the extra cost for this?  
>  
>What is the current lead time?  
>  
>Thank you very much

&#x200B;

Just a simple email to start the conversation.

I usually make an Excel spreadsheet where I would save all the supplier info. This will give me a quick overview of all the suppliers.

# Negotiating Round 1

&#x200B;

|Supplier|Port|FOB Price|Quantity|Branding|Packaging|Lead time|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mr. A|Ningbo|$4,87|1000|Yes, $0,10 per unit|Yes, $0,30 per unit|30 days|
|Mr. B|Shenzhen|$5.10|1000|Not possible|Yes, $0,35 per unit|25 days|
|Mr. C|Ningbo|$4,95|1000|Yes, + $0,20 per unit|Yes, $0,35 per unit|30 days|
|Mr. D|Ningbo|$4,90|1000|Yes, no extra charge|Yes, $0,50 per unit|40 days|
|Mr. E|Ningbo|$4,85|1000|Yes, + $0,20 per unit|Yes, $0,40 per unit|30 days|

&#x200B;

In the spreadsheet above I have already narrowed down the 20 suppliers I messaged to 6 suppliers. Some suppliers did not respond. Others required a Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) that was too high for me. And others just had terrible communication.

Now I will start to negotiate with these 6 suppliers I have shortlisted. I like to keep it straightforward and just have them outbid each other. My goal is to get the lowest price. Right now Mr. E offers me the lowest price, so I have send all other suppliers the following message:

>Hi,  
>  
>Thank you very much for your quote! I really like the product you manufacture and appreciate that you respond very quickly. However, my boss wants me to pick the lowest price for this product and we received a quote for: $4,70 FOB for the same product.I would much rather order from you but this is only possible if we get a more competitive price.  
>  
>Please let me know if we can do something about the price.  
>  
>Thank you!

Very basic. I straight up tell them that I like their offer but they need to drop their price if they want to get my order.

# Negotiating Round 2

3 out of 4 suppliers dropped their prices after this message. Mr. B wouldn’t drop his prices, it’s also not allowed to put my branding on the product if I order from him so I am going to eliminate him.

Mr. C dropped his prices but only to $ 4,90. So I am going to eliminate him as well.

&#x200B;

|Supplier|Port|FOB Price|Quantity|Branding|Packaging|Lead time|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mr. A|Ningbo|$4,70|1000|Yes, $0,10 per unit|Yes, $0,30 per unit|30 days|
|Mr. D|Ningbo|$4,70|1000|Yes, no extra charge|Yes, $0,50 per unit|40 days|
|Mr. E|Ningbo|$4,85|1000|Yes, + $0,20 per unit|Yes, $0,40 per unit|30 days|

&#x200B;

I am now left with 3 suppliers. I am pretty happy already with the prices but I think I can still get it a bit lower.

# Samples

But first I will order samples from all 3 suppliers. I have also asked them to include their business card & example of the packaging they use. When I have received the sample I can test the actual product quality and continue negotiating.

To save a bit on shipping I have them ship the sample to an address in China first. Because shipping in China is very cheap (none of them charged me any shipping cost). I will then have the 3 samples put together in 1 box so I only have to pay shipping to my office once, instead of 3 times. The company I use to do this is: [TipTrans.com](https://TipTrans.com)

# Testing the samples!

I have received the 3 samples from the suppliers and I’d say that all over them are high quality. So it is time to test the samples!

**Stress testing**

I decided to do a lot of stress testing with them. I have used the samples as rough as possible. Throw them around, put them in water, let my dog have a go at them. Just to find the breaking point of each sample.

**Get other peoples opinion**

I spend about a week evaluating the samples. I had everybody who came over to my house test out the samples as well. I think this is very important as I am already pretty biased to go for the supplier with the cheapest price.

# Picking a supplier

So now that we have done our testing it is time to pick our final supplier. I have added the sample info in my Excel sheet to get a clear overview of all the pros & cons of each supplier.

&#x200B;

|Supplier|Port|FOB Price|Quantity|Branding|Packaging|Lead time|Sample Quality|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mr. A|Ningbo|$4,70|1000|Yes, $0,10 per unit|Yes, $0,30 per unit|30 days|Great|
|Mr. D|Ningbo|$4,70|1000|Yes, no extra charge|Yes, $0,50 per unit|40 days|Great|
|Mr. E|Ningbo|$4,85|1000|Yes, + $0,20 per unit|Yes, $0,40 per unit|30 days|Average|

&#x200B;

All suppliers will ship from Ningbo. Unfortunately, I don’t have any other shipments leaving from this port this month. Else I could combine the shipment to fill a container, as this will greatly reduce my shipping cost. If one of the suppliers would be based in Shenzhen for example and I had another shipment leaving from Shenzhen, that would seriously impact my decision.

Here is my thought process when picking a supplier:

**Mr. A**

Total unit cost will be: $5,10. Normal lead time & great sample quality.

**Mr. D**

Total unit cost will be: $5,10. High lead time & great sample quality.

**Mr. E**

Total unit cost will be: $5,45. Normal lead time & average sample quality.

Mr. E total unit cost is simply too high & his samples wasn’t that great. So I have to choose between Mr. A & D. Both offer a great product for a low price. The only advantage Mr. A has that his lead time ( production time ) is 10 days less. I don’t really care about this too much so it’s time to negotiate again. I send both of them another message:

>Hi,Thank you for the sample. I think your sample is very high quality and I appreciate that you always have great communication. However, there is another supplier who also send me very high quality sample and he lowered his quote to $4,60 FOB.  
>  
>Is there anything you can do about the price?  
>  
>Thank you!

&#x200B;

Mr. A was willing to work with me and dropped his price to $4,60. While Mr. kept his price at $4.70.

&#x200B;

**For that reason, I will go with supplier Mr. A.**

# First payment

To start the production, the supplier will need some kind of down payment. Normally this is 30% of the total order. If you are having doubts about trusting your supplier you can ask him if it’s possible to pay with Alibaba Trade Assurance. However, I have only used this option once in the past 4 years and never had any problems.

&#x200B;

I have wired the 30% to the supplier. My bank takes a couple of days to process international wire transfers. So I always take a screenshot from the transaction and send that the supplier while my bank is still processing it. After a while, I will hopefully have build up a relationship with my supplier and there is mutual trust. They will then start the production as soon as I send them the wire transfer screenshot. This will reduce the production time by a couple of days.

# Next part

In the next part I will show you how I do my quality control & everything you need to know when shipping your products with ocean freight.

There was recently a post that had a decent enough response to it that was basically saying to watch out for ""get rich quick"" ebooks, courses, etc... Which is a very valid point. But the user (thou shalt not be named) went on to say ""DoNT StaRT a BuSiNEss"" and basically not to buy a single course or anything.

LO AND BEHOLD, said user literally had a post on his/her  account about how to create your own course... So that's that. 

My point is this, this isn't the only instance of this sort of mentality in this sub or even amongst the entrepreneur community. I'm not saying this sub is filled to the rim with this sort of thing, it's just something I've noticed in more then one post/thread.

A lot of people seem to be sending messages out that basically claim that if you weren't an entrepreneur in the past you'll never be one. 

Which, I'm sorry to break it you, but that **ISNT TRUE**. 

Listen, people come from so many different types of backgrounds that it is literally impossible to make a generalization like that. 

Some people come from backgrounds where they didn't have the time to even consider building a business or anything because life happens and they were probably too focused on surviving the crazy shit that life throws at people. They didn't have the time to devote hours to research and learning new skills or even to find out what the hell they wanted to do in life or what their interests are to begin with. Honestly, anyone who is a successful entrepreneur **consider yourself lucky to be one**. It's a blessing. 

Is entrepreneurship for everyone? No. But you don't have to have been an entrepreneur in the past to start being one now. However, there is no ""fast track"" to building a successful business. It often take countless hours and even years to cultivate the idea in your head and to build it out in real life. And even then it might fail! But then you pick yourself up and go back at it. There are so many successful entrepreneurs who have failed more times than they have succeeded but they kept pursuing their goals. At times, it can take relentless pursuit to build something you might have thought was ""simple"" but that's just the name of the game. 

If there's anyone reading this who has felt discouraged in the past because of a message sent to you similar to the one I've outlined, please do not buy into it. Keep pursuing, be consistent, and persevere.

102,6gaifh,False,,141,Guide to Buying from Alibaba and importing from China,Entrepreneur,"I gathered my and experience and thoughts of other Reddit and Quora users and summed up in one into one blog post. An article is adapted for selling on Amazon but the principle is the same for any other business. I am hoping that I am able to create a free resource for people looking to start buying on Alibaba and importing from China.

In this post, I’m gonna share spreadsheets, message templates and a strategy for calculating which supplier is best.

**Things to know when buying from Alibaba and importing from China**

*Everything is negotiable with sellers from Alibaba. Do not exaggerate when negotiating with a seller, your goal should be to get a fair deal, not a good deal. You have to be careful though because if you keep pushing on price and they believe you won’t reorder without a lower price the factories WILL sacrifice quality to meet your price.

*If they are forced to lower a quote then they might use inferior materials and with the Chinese unless you’re strict and clear on what you want then quality could be a real issue. The best thing to do is to compare prices and to tell the supplier that there are other manufacturers offering this product at competitive prices. Quality and profit margin is more important than getting a good deal in my opinion.

*I learned not to push too much in price since I have had already quality problems. The key to avoid this is to specify the quality you expect for the product, this is very important, size, color, materials, tolerances… with this information on the table, you can negotiate better prices. You don’t want to get a better price at the expense of lower quality.

*For small initial orders, I usually offer 60% of the first quoted price. In general, I get the best price after the 2nd reorder because by that time they feel that I will be a long term customer and I normally get 30% off of the initial quote.

*Try to find the original manufacturer instead of the many middleman companies there are out there. Unfortunately, in my experience, this was pretty tough since there is not much info out there for most of the companies so one doesn’t know whom to trust. Once I got lucky ordering from Aliexpress and one of the products I purchased had the manufacturers information (Website, phone) inside of the packaging. I was able to negotiate a very significant reduction in price with the manufacturer (something like a 60% price reduction compared to Aliexpress, for an expensive $70 product.

*Do you use Aliexpress to test the Amazon market first? It is definitely possible, not the best course of action though. In order to find a niche that is good on Aliexpress, you need to dig extremely deep and weird, and even then it's a long shot. That’s way I always enter the market set up to succeed. If I’m ordering 15-20 units then that isn’t possible. That doesn’t give me enough units to do giveaways, get reviews, run ppc, get custom packaging made, and definitely doesn’t allow me to get to page 1. My entire plan is based on the fact I’m going to get page 1. And if I do make it to page, I need to have enough stock. With 20 units, my hands are tied and I can’t be successful. If you still want to use Aliexpress, here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQwoQCJRjPJf_FP-GicKy10WUEc8QFEID62mruCZQqA/edit) you can use.

*Tip on finding original manufacturer. Use [https://www.1688.com/](https://www.1688.com/) rather than www.alibaba.com, you will find mostly factories, and very few trading companies (because who the hell needs trading companies if its all domestic?). If you look at the pictures, they will have faded white words on there. Google it, then find the factory page, then find the phone number. Usually, it will be the factory.

*Knowing the real value – you should have quotes from multiple manufacturers before doing this. Otherwise, what are you basing your asking price off of? Also, factor in that they are also doing business. You can’t expect them to offer you a price at their cost. They also have to make a margin. Consider that the margin you allow for them can result in non-monetary perks/benefits down the road. A good manufacturer looks to create a relationship, not just a transaction.

**How to avoid frauds scams when buying on Alibaba and importing from China?**

Finding suppliers is easy, the hard part is finding Mr.Right. Keep in mind that there are suppliers on Alibaba who will try to scam your money so always be vigilant and trust your gut feeling when sourcing for suppliers on Alibaba.

If you get scammed, it might completely discourage you from further dealings with foreign trade companies. Actually, fraud is something that everyone has heard about, even you just do business with local companies. It can never be completely eliminated, but it can be minimized. All you need to avoid fraud is a little precaution, observation, and knowledge. I have been using Alibaba for a while. There are 10 golden rules that I always follow when buying on Alibaba, although these methods don’t guarantee a 100% safe transaction.

*Google the company which you are interested in and check their website. Does it look legit?. You can add the word “scam” to the search keywords. It is possible that past cases of fraud by that certain company have already been described on the Internet and listed in someone’s blacklist. If they are real companies, you can find their export records from many export data’s websites, such as: importgenius, tradesns, tradesparq, panjiva, etc.

*Only buy from gold suppliers and look for suppliers with Trade Assurance
Shop around. Is one supplier way cheaper than everyone else? If so they should probably be avoided.

*Pay attention to e-mail adresses. What is their email? Is it “@gmail” or “@companyname”? An e-mail sent from economicdevelopment@mail.com should make you think twice, as special economic zones don’t use free e-mail accounts…

*See if they are professional. If they are real manufacturer, their quote is usually detailed and professional. Try to ask more professional questions. Think twice If their reply is not professional.

*Onsite Check and Assessed Supplier are important, but not 100% necessary.
Always request a sample. Every sample I have received they have provided for free if I paid for shipping.

*Before you have anything sent to you, ask for pictures. If what you get does not match up with the pictures, ask for a refund through PayPal using the pictures as evidence.

*Ask for customer references. It is impolite to ask for customer references at the beginning, but after they quote, you can do it before you pay. To be on the safe side, you can contact the references to learn more about how they work.

*Make a factory tour. If you have Chinese friends, you can ask them for help. You can pay them to visit their factory and take some videos for you. Of course, if money allows, and the project is big, you can go to visit the factory in person.

**Avoid buying and selling counterfeit products**

Alibaba is not a legitimate source for branded products. Alibaba is meant for generic goods where you research to ensure that the item wasn’t patented by a brand already. It’s not a legitimate source to purchase branded inventory from because if you see something braned available on Alibaba that belongs to national brand, these are counterfeit goods which could land you in jail if you decided to sell them.

An example for people that may be confused out there and sourcing branded goods from Alibaba. [This](https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Disney-White-Vinyl-Figure/dp/B0056ZT0ZA/) is an item on Amazon that sells for a lot of money. [This](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/OEM-Funko-Pop-Snow-white-figurine_60476740832.html?spm=a2700.7724838.0.0.8LF3TX) is a counterfeit example of that item on Alibaba WHICH YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE TO SELL ON AMAZON!

I feel like there are likely people out there that have gotten extremely confused from going through the “guru courses” teaching them to source from Alibaba and create their own private label product to sell on Amazon FBA. I am starting to see more and more people selling truly counterfeit goods and I hope you aren’t doing it because you’re confused.

As an example, [this](https://www.amazon.com/Figures-Minifigures-Building-Educational-building/dp/B00XPYYWWU) is not a legitimate product to private label. That’s truly a knockoff of a LEGO product from a couple of years back. Even though you saw it available on Alibaba and you’re trying to sell it as your own brand, you are selling counterfeit items and infringing upon the Intellectual Property of LEGO. Although you’re getting sales now, you’ll likely find yourself in a huge lawsuit down the road.

The same goes for items like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Oliasports-Marvel-Heroes-Vehicle-16/dp/B019UP3P98). Just because you’re putting your own brand name on the product doesn’t put you in the clear. You are purchasing counterfeited items where large worldwide brands hold the patents, trademarks and licensing to and trying to sell them under your own brand.

You can’t just take an exact copy of an item from one of the major brands and try to private label it as your own, even if the original brand has discontinued the item. That’s illegal in the United States or anywhere else.

**How should I pay for samples on Alibaba?**

Use PayPal but send as goods and services…they'll charge for the service fee but that’s ok. Use PayPal for payments up to around $2000, then start wiring from bank accounts. After multiple transactions ask if you can go back to PayPal and send money as friends to save money on fees on both sides. The sample should be the cost of your wholesale product + 25USD for the first kg and about 6.00 per kilo after. You should most likely be paying around 50.00 for this sample if it weighs under 5-6lbs.

**Which Alibaba item is becoming saturated on Amazon?**

An item that every second new seller recently tried to source on Alibaba.  A Newer version of the garlic press. A good place to look would be on a Facebook review groups. There you could see all the new stuff coming out and look for patterns.

**How do you negotiate with a seller on Alibaba?**

Contact minimum 10 suppliers with short, clear, specific, concise questions (Write short, clear, emails. The language barrier is very real). You can use this introduction email template:

Hi,
My name is Peter Koch and I am the production manager for Seller At Heart, I need your help with the following. We would like to sell garlic press but we need the best possible price and MOQ information. I am happy to send you a picture as an example. We need a target price of $5 in order to make this order work. Please advise if you can make this happen.
Please let me know prices for 200, 500, 750 and 1000 runs.
Where in China are you located? Are you an agent, factory, or trading company?
I need you to advise best possible price and also give me at least three other options of similar items that you have so that I can review them with my boss. Any qualities you can send us to pick from would also be helpful. Please send us quality standards.
Also its company policy that we don’t pay for samples so I need to make sure you are able to provide me with samples. We need to check the quality of the product and make sure we are happy with the sample before we place an order. We are really looking to build stronger partnerships with new factories / and or agents.

After they respond you’ll send them 2nd email template….

Hey Lee,
Thanks for your response.
Just wanted to give you an insight to how we work.
When working with a new supplier we need to build a relationship. Therefore; we do a test orders before scaling up. You have to understand if we buy 500 units and there are problems it affects the relationship with our clients.
This is how we work:
We purchase 15-20 samples as a way to see the consistency of the production and pass onto our clients for initial orders from them.
We place a test order of 200-300 units to ensure everything is perfect.
We scale up and repeat order and grow our relationship.
I understand it becomes more difficult if we were making bespoke changes to the product or require special packaging.
Please can you let me know the following:
Your best price for 15 – 20 samples to land at our address in the US by air?
Does your prices for the 500 include our logo and labeling?
What is the weight of the individual item with a poly bag?
I look forward to your thoughts and feedback.
Regards,
Peter Koch
3rd email template for Alibaba suppliers…

Thanks for coming back to.
I have attached our [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AyLRkbYbVty-Gflx-2dVGv5ajyKvo4XOIfG9I_qbCaM/edit) for remaining quote details. I have completed most of it, would you mind just filling the blanks, please?
Once I have all the information I can arrange meetings with my bosses to discuss further.
I would like to thank you in advance for your time in dealing with my inquiry.
I look forward to your thoughts and feedback.
Regards,
Peter Koch
 

When your suppliers all complete the spreadsheet you can then copy and paste into one and start the process of negotiating a better deal.

80-90% of suppliers will fill these out despite they get so many inquiries a day, and you think they wouldn’t bother going through all of that… The rest either resend their quote and add to the body of the email or they just add to the body of email. You need to judge the rapport thing as going in cold won’t help. If you are doing 15-20 suppliers it saves a whole heap of time.

I can’t stress enough the cultural importance and shooting the breeze before going in on what you want. 

**Be very polite and very professional at all times.**

It is an industry built on negotiating the penny of the pound. The bigger the order often lower the price. Like in all walks of life you have good honest people and emotionally bankrupt ones. Some will work off the basis of building longtime relationships and others just think of tomorrow. See it as a way to weed these out. The good thing about email is you can get feedback here or other places before you respond. My advice to you is to do what I did. I picked a product I had no interest in and spend time dealing with a load of suppliers right up to the point of agreeing on first wave of terms. This was a great opportunity to see problems and get a grip on how it works. I learned lots from this and built out spreadsheet templates to speed everything up. I went through all the shipping process for quoting and snagged a load of issues there also. All very insightful. I still learning now at first I danced around it with what if’s as it was daunting. I can’t recommend enough the process of just jumping in and doing it.

Here one more product profitability [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y1kQDgQuXbdUi4xXdzzdj6Ok5mXloh_-E-4GUe9j-eI/edit) you could use.

**When negotiating with a supplier on Alibaba to purchase a new product and import from China, what are some common additional questions you ask?**

*what percentage of your exports go to the US (or wherever you’re importing into). Important to understand if they have experience selling to your market

*do you understand FBA packaging requirements

*does the product meet the country’s certifications (if applicable)

*do you offer DDP parity

*what product is your factory best at producing?

*what is your turnaround time?

*what are your payment terms for new customers

*do you use SINOSURE service

In summary, there are a lot of sleazy suppliers on Alibaba, but there are also a lot of legit suppliers that would love to work with you. Do everything you can to protect yourself in a case of a scam, but don’t let it paralyze you to the point that you are not willing to pull the trigger on anything.

690,adwg33,False,Case Study,140,$15K/month selling CBD cigarettes.,Entrepreneur,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Evan Marshall of [Plain Jane](https://www.tryplainjane.com), a brand that sells CBD cigarettes.

**Some stats:**

* Product: CBD Cigarette
* Revenue/mo: $15,000
* Margins: 63%
* Started: April 2018
* Location: Berkeley, CA
* Founders: 3
* Employees: 3

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

I’m Evan and I started [Plain Jane](https://tryplainjane.com) with my college roommate, Duane Dennis.

Plain Jane is dramatically changing the CBD market. We’re the first ultra smooth and low odor Hemp CBD flower and cigarette.

Not a ton of people know what CBD is. It’s a cannabinoid in the Cannabis plant like THC except it doesn’t get you high. It also has anti-anxiety and anti-pain effects. Generally when people refer to the medicinal properties of cannabis, they’re talking about CBD. Most people aren’t aware that you can get these benefits without intoxication.   

I believe we’re the best CBD company because we offer the best prices and we have unique products. Unlike the vast majority of companies, we do not have middlemen. We’ve partnered directly with farms to bring customers the best prices.

We’re also continuing to innovate and create new products. Our flagship product is a low smell and ultra smooth CBD cigarette. It has the same potency of other CBD flower products but without that identifying weed smell.   

Within 5 months of starting to sell, we’re now generating more than $20K a month in sales. We have customers in 47 states and we’re in more than 12 retail locations.



### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

At MIT, Duane and I grew weed in our dorm room and were really interested in learning more about the plant. After college, I went to work for a tech startup in San Francisco as a software engineer.

391,dpqty1,False,Case Study,120,"How I started and grew a software design service with $0, by letting my customers lead the way and have been hired by Elon Musk's team, Fortune 500 companies and B2B Software Startups from around the globe.",Entrepreneur,"I usually skip the long stories in this sub so I'll try to share my story through bullet points (based on what I can recall from memory).

* I started my design company a little over 10 years ago, doing all sorts of projects for a variety of companies. 

* At some point, I read that if you want to scale your business, it's best to start with a narrow focus and expand gradually (instead of offering everything to everyone), so I took a bunch of steps back and started a Logo Design service for software companies. Why? I enjoyed doing logo designs, and most of my friends are software engineers.

* I then read it's best to productize your service, so you can build a scalable 'engine'. I decided to productize my logo design service.

* Wasn't sure what to do with pricing, so I went with ""Name a fair price, get pixels back"" (hence the name..)

* Posted the one-page website on a few forums and started getting logo design requests for $25, then $50, then people started naming their price of $300 and above. Every time I would break a record, I would gradually up the minimum price.

* At some point I had the idea, in order to stimulate higher prices, I would organise the orders based on bid-size. If you name a high price, I would work on your logo first, so you'd get your design faster. Your bid was connected to your place in the queue.

* Press took notice and started writing about the service.

* This business kept growing until one customer asked if I could help him with more designs for his business. I said, ""sure... how about I'd give you unlimited designs for  $500/mo?"" (This was years ago, way before the avalanche of subscription design services that exist today)

* I Kept getting clients through word of mouth but quickly realised I fell in the same trap again. I was providing a service that was too broad. Designing flyers, social media posts, websites, t-shirts, etc. By not being able to do one thing over and over again, it was hard to scale. I was mentally jumping from totally different projects, for a relatively low monthly rate.

* I took a step back and analysed my customers: who did I enjoy working with the most? On what type of projects?.. the answer... UI/UX Design for software companies. So I took an other step back and narrowed my service down.

* I doubled my prices, customers kept signing on. Doubled again, and kept growing. I had to start hiring and build a team to keep up with the growth of the company.

* More companies started contacting me. Now, not just startups, but Fortune 500 companies. Well known tech brands. YC companies and more recently Elon Musk's team hired us to help design some of their internal software. Our team is kept deliberately tiny, and we only take on a handful of projects at a time. This way, we get to do the best work of our lives, apply lessons learned from Fortune 500 companies to small scrappy startups. My goal now is not to scale to a billion dollar business. I want to build a company where a small people can do the best work of their lives, enjoy every day of it and have enough time left to be with their friends and families. Because we take on a small amount of clients, they benefit because they always get the A-team on their project. The same team that worked for Elon Musk, gets to work on their startup.

* A few months ago, I took an other step back to analyze the business and see what other ways we could grow, without touching the newly found vision for the business. What would be that next step? What could we start offering? For who? The answer was what many customers had been bugging me about for over a year. Add frontend design on top of the UX/UI service. Don't just give them .Sketch files. But HTML, CSS, JS files that could cut their implementation time in half and gives us better quality control over the final product.

* Let's see what the future brings.

People seemed to like the idea, so I went ahead and compiled some details on the user acquisition strategies used by a few of the better known companies. I wrote more in-depth articles, but I'll share the most interesting aspects here.

* **Dropbox going from 5000 to 75,000 wait-list signups in one night**

Back in 2008, Dropbox was struggling to get new users. They were running an Adsense campaign, unsuccessfully. For every $300 they spent, they'd acquire a user who paid for the $99 product. After going at this for a while, Drew Houtson and his team decided to try something different.

Drew made a simple, four minute video showing off how Dropbox worked. Because the service doesn't sound as impressive in text, having a video to show off how it actually functioned worked wonders. [Here's a link to the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QmCUDHpNzE) Another aspect of the video that is important to note is that it was tailored to the community it was being shown to. Drew was a member of the Digg community, and knew what kinds of things they'd appreciate. If you pay close attention, the video is full of references to things like TPS reports and Tom Cruise. It was full of inside jokes, and quickly got voted to the top of Digg. By the next day, they had 70,000 new signups. 

Another thing that Dropbox did that we might be able to emulate while marketing our own products is offering extra services for social shares. Dropbox ran an extensive campaign during which you could share the service on Facebook and Twitter for an additional 128MB of space. It was something the users wanted (as opposed to just giving away a peice of technology in a raffle), and lead to 2.8 million invitations being sent during the first 30 days.

* **How reddit and Quora got past the chicken and egg problem of having no content / users**

Quora and reddit solved the ""empty site = no users / no users = empty site"" problem in similar ways. The founders of both services spent the first months filling them with content themselves.

On Quora, the founders simply answered and asked lots of questions under their own profiles. But the reddit approach was a bit more interesting. Instead of just using their own accounts, the founders would create fake users to make it look like there were multiple people submitting links. Their 'submit link' form featured a third slot: ""Username"". According to Steve Huffman, reddit cofounder, it took several months until they didn’t have to submit content themselves to fill up the front page.

They also focused on keeping everybody in the same place in the beginning. reddit had no subreddits, and Quora was mostly focused on technology. Instead of having users spread out, everyone was in the same place- making the community feel bigger than it was.

[Quora and reddit write-up](http://kirjonen.me/how-quora-and-reddit-solved-the-chicken-and-egg-problem/)


* **Foursquare**

Foursquare took the old concept of local apps and added several interesting features that really attracted attention, like the badges. Becoming the ""mayor"", or the person who checks in the most at a certain place, quickly became an addiction for people. 

They also gave merchants the opportunity to interact with their customers a lot better than most apps. After the business claimed their Foursquare page, they could interact with the people who were checking in at their establishment- whether they just wanted to chat with their most active customers, or actually wanted to reward people who check in. 

And lastly, a huge part of Foursquare's growth was due to their city by city strategy. Every time they expanded to a new city, they had a huge amount of new users signing up due to the word of mouth effect (""have you heard that Foursquare just came to our city?"") and local media covering the app.

[Foursquare write-up](http://kirjonen.me/three-reasons-foursquare-became-so-successful/)



* **Groupon started with a local MVP**

I really like the story behind Groupon because it is a great example of the things we repeat on this subreddit so much. Start local, and make a minimal viable product.

Groupon started as local as they could get. They went around the office building that they were renting a space in, asking people to sign up. Their first campaign? Half-priced pizzas at the restaurant on the first floor. The first 500 signups came from here.

After that, they stuck to focusing on local products and services. Because big companies such as Amazon or Wal-Mart were able to negotiate such low prices, not even a big group-buying website could compete with them when it came to items such as televisions and phones. So instead, Groupon focused on unique products from local businesses. A lot of these smaller establishments had never even tried marketing, so Groupon's offer was enticing. They were able to negotiate much better prices.

As far as the MVP goes, Andrew Mason didn't want to waste time developing a full platform around the Groupon idea. Instead of trying to build a big team like he had with his first business venture, he got a few people together and set up a WordPress blog that the team would post offers on. Coupons were individually emailed, and no one had a clear idea of what their role or title in the company really was. They spent their first months focusing on seeing how many users they could get as quickly as possible in order to validate the idea, and then started looking into the business side of the company once it was clear that they were onto something big.

And lastly, Groupon focused on offers that were inherently social early on. They had deals for things like cafes, restaurants or movies. These are all things that you invite other people to, so it naturally lead to people sharing the website.

[Groupon write-up](http://kirjonen.me/what-made-groupon-work/)


* **Tinder**

Tinder had two things going for it. It started local, and it was dead simple.

The app did a great job at taking the tired concept of dating online and re-doing it completely. Instead of directories of people and search, you simply have a person's image appear, and you swipe left or right. It’s basically the same feature that made HotOrNot and Facemash fun, brought to mobile. The double opt-in feature helped with the problem that lots of users have on traditional dating websites: if you are an attractive female, you're swamped with messages. If you're a guy who isn't having a lot of luck on the website, most of your messages go unanswered. Because you aren't able to message somebody on Tinder without them also liking you, both these problems were solved to a large extent.

And more interestingly, Tinder also started locally. Having 50 users in a small space is a lot better for this kind of app than having 5000 spread out users. Here's my favorite part: they threw exclusive parties at USC. To enter, you had to install Tinder on your phone. You can just imagine the amount of word-of-mouth they got out of that.

[Tinder write-up](http://kirjonen.me/why-tinder-works/)


* **Airbnb used another platform [Craigslist] to get early users**

I also found Airbnb's strategy interesting. Unlike with reddit and Quora, putting up fake offers wasn't going to work. So instead, they did something a bit different. They used a marketplace that already had a lot of vacation homes to grow: Craigslist. A lot of the people who posted their homes on Craigslist's vacation homes section received an odd email from a ""big fan of Airbnb."" 

*I am emailing you because you have one of the nicest listings in Craigslist in the Tahoe area, and I want to recommend you feature it to one of the largest vacation rental marketplaces on the web, Airbnb. The site already has 3,000,000 page views a month! Check it out here: http://www.airbnb.com*

Each one came accompanied by a semi-anonymous Gmail account, such as Jill D. The thing is, these messages worked. Lots of people started posting their homes on Airbnb as well as Craigslist, which solved the big problem of having users check for places only to find an empty website. The supply side is a lot harder to fill up on a website like Airbnb.

And as a side note, one thing that also helped early on was going around to user's homes and helping them with their photos. This is a great example of doing things that don't scale early on. They went from $200 a week to $400 after updating their website with the new photos for each offering. It might not seem that big considering the money Airbnb makes today, but I know that a lot of /r/Entrepreneur users would love that kind of increase in profit.

[Airbnb write-up](http://kirjonen.me/the-story-behind-airbnbs-success/)

Those are the ones I have done so far. I enjoyed digging around to see exactly how they were able to get such large numbers of users in such little amounts of time. In the original thread, I mentioned that I was thinking about posting these on some website related to startup stories. I might do that someday, if I get enough content written and people like these. But for now, I just posted them on a personal site so that people can read them. Good enough for me.


**Takeaway**

The whole point of this is to look at what successful startups did, and see if we can apply it to our own marketing. Some key points to consider: 

* Try making a video to explain your service, if text isn't doing it justice. And if you do, make sure to target the community you'll be sharing to. 

* The best way to make your new community not look like a ghost town is to fill it up yourself. Whether you take the reddit approach of fake users or go with Quora's team of active members depends on what kind of community it is. Having fake users on Quora, an important aspect of which is credentials for every user, wouldn't have worked.

* Is there already an existing user base on another service that you can tap into? Try taking Airbnb's approach and seeing if you can get some of them onto your website. When doing this, it's important to note that what you're offering should be better in some way.

* Local is key in a lot of these stories. It's much easier and cheaper to focus on one subset of people than trying to get them all.

285,2jx7t2,False,,102,"Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash flow is reality.",Entrepreneur,"When people do AMA's here, there's a lot of talk about **revenue** (which is equivalent to **gross sales**, since most businesses here aren't investing their cash in the market).  Revenue is largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things.  It doesn't speak to the entrepreneur's business acumen or the financial health of the company.  If I'm selling a $10000 widget, but I pay $9990 for it from the wholesaler, my **gross margin** is only 0.1%.  If you include the cost of shipping materials, the labor of my warehouse guys to pack it, my phone system used to take orders, etc.  my **net margin** is likely negative, meaning I'm losing money every time someone buys my widget.  The more I sell, the more I lose.

Despite this, revenue is frequently used to measure businesses because it's easy.  You simply count the numbers of incoming dollars.  It's really only meaningful in the context of industry peers or past performance.  For example, if my Q/Q (quarter-over-quarter) revenue growth has been 30% over the past two years, then I'm likely doing something right.  People in the world are flocking to me because I'm providing something of value to the marketplace.  Now, if I'm losing money because my margins aren't good enough, or because my internal operations are very inefficient, my business could still fail.  But I've proven that there is market demand for my product/service.

Similarly, if I'm telling you that my subscription box service is making $500k/yr. in revenue, I'd need to frame it by also telling you what my nearest competitors are doing, as well as their growth rate, for it to mean anything.

Oddly enough **profit** also isn't a good measure.  My business isn't likely to see a **net profit** this year†.  Does this make me a bad businessman?  Well, it depends.  The reason that my business will likely be unprofitable is because I've reinvesting so heavily back into growth.  If we get a large project from a customer, I'll use that money to hire another sales guy or perhaps fund some marketing efforts.

My business is a very high-growth services business though.  I have to reinvest my money back into (very expensive) people to continue to grow.  However, if I instead owned a Taco Bell, laundry service, apartment complex, or a carwash, I'd be making different choices.  These types of businesses are operated with the expectation that they'll be profitable on a consistent and predictable basis.  That's why these low-growth businesses are normally valued on **EBITDA** (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is an easy way to gauge profitability of a business before the complexity of taxes muddy the numbers.

So what's a better way to measure the day-to-day health of a business? **Cash flow**. A business with great cash flow has the money that it needs, when it needs it.  I could make 90% margins selling a $100 widget for $10.  Awesome profit! But if my customer takes six months to pay, my business could fail.  My landlord--and certainly my employees--won't wait six months to be paid. Cash flow is king.

Cash flow can be further categorized into **operating cash flow (OCF)** and **free cash flow (FCF)**.  Operating cash flow is the stream of money I need to keep the lights on and people paid.  A company with a strong OCF will generally be able to get a line of credit from the bank, sometimes with minimal collateral, because the bank feels that the company isn't likely to go bankrupt.  This is why so many people believe that banks will only lend a small business when they don't need the money.  Banks want to lend to companies that can service the loan (make payments) out of OCF without a problem.  The bank is providing a booster shot to simply smooth over cash flow or help fund a growth initiative.

Free cash flow is the holy grail.  FCF is what I have at the end of each month (or quarter, etc) that can be used to reinvest back into the business, save for a rainy day, or put into my pocket.  *Free cash flow is the single most relevant indicator that a company is healthy and growing.*

Since finance people love formulas, this can be further quantified into a **FCF/OCF ratio**, which is simply FCF divided by OCF.  If my business is costing me $100k/mo to operate and I'm generating $180k/mo in revenue, my FCF/OCF ratio is 80% (180 - 100 / 100), which is outstanding.

*† As of Jan 1 this year, I took the s-corp election for my LLC and put myself on the payroll.  I receive a paycheck twice a month just like everyone else, get the same 401k contribution and health care deductions.  I do not count my salary to be part of my business's profitability because if I wasn't running the business, I'd have to pay someone to do it for me.* **Be wary of anyone who tells you that their business is profitable if they're not paying themselves first.**

*Edit:  Since this has gotten more attention than I anticipated, I want to hedge my advice.  I do not have a formal background in accounting; I don't even have a four year degree.  I'm writing from the perspective of a scrappy, bootstrapped entrepreneur who's had to figure this stuff out along the way.  The further you get away from my situation and start talking about established businesses with large capital expenditures, the less relevant my advice is going to be.   But for an entrepreneur who's sweating payroll twice a month, cash flow is definitely where your focus needs to be.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2jx7t2/revenue_is_vanity_profit_is_sanity_cash_flow_is/,768,"gross, people talking about exploiting others like it's some kind of game.

121,bqcg1l,False,,135,I left my corporate job to start a pressure cleaning business - 3 Yr Update.,Entrepreneur,"Some time ago I decided I wanted to scratch the itch and try something for myself.

&#x200B;

Here's my original post from some time ago, looking back I really had no clue :) 

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/481cf8/critique\_my\_plan\_to\_ditch\_the\_95/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/481cf8/critique_my_plan_to_ditch_the_95/) 

&#x200B;

**Short story** \- I was in a pretty good corporate job making good money but worried I was backing myself into a corner, the golden handcuffs so to speak. The company I was at was undergoing a lot of change and I didn't fancy being on the scrapheap with a bunch of others should someone above make a call or worse still stuck in a position I hated.

&#x200B;

I decided to build a business in a completely different industry, with no experience, a big mortgage and new baby and not a huge deal of business experience.

&#x200B;

My real reason to do this was to build a foundation and asset for my family - all along my intention has been to build a saleable asset that can generate my income or be sold if I ever desired.

&#x200B;

I'm also a worker, I like the excitement of the hustle - I like to put my head down and go 100 miles and hour. Working in a corporate job I was frustrated that most of the time was spent justifying your job or doing useless busy work - I just want to get my shit done and move on.

  
Fishing and boating is my big passion, I used to fish up to twice a week and had a small boat that was my pride and joy. When deciding to go into business I put it up for sale to get some funds to kick start, I figured if it sells that's my sign to go for it. 2 days later there was an empty spot in my driveway and heart but a few dollars in my account and off we went.

  
I used some of the money to fix a few pressing issues on my house and the rest to fund some basic business setup and equipment - once again looking back I had no idea what I was doing but great intentions.

&#x200B;

To save a few dollars I built my own trailer, taught myself to weld and made a horrible but functional box trailer to cart everything around in. No sign writing and looked shady to say the least but it got me going!

&#x200B;

The first year of business was part time - weekends basically. Trying to land jobs, learn the work and do the work. Over the course of that year I worked weekends and the odd day were I took leave from my day job and really operated in secret - sneaking into a meeting room to call a customer to hustle a window cleaning job or arrange a booking.

&#x200B;

I had no real idea how to get jobs initially but eventually caught onto a lead generation service, a bit similar to home advisor called hipages in Australia. Basically you pay for leads for jobs then the customer gets quotes from 3 providers, generally it's a price war but I found I could pick up a job for say Window cleaning but offer a package with all my other services and generally win the job. Once I did a good job I got some referrals etc which got me off the line.

&#x200B;

In the first year part time I did about 60k of revenue. At times I used friends for help and paid them through the books -  I didn't take a single dollar myself and reinvested everything back into the business which allowed me to have a professional grade trailer built up with some great equipment which gave me some confidence to bid bigger jobs and know everything was going to work.

&#x200B;

Second year I told my work about the business and made a plan to exit my day job that year. My employer was pretty understanding and allowed me to take a bunch of accrued leave to work in my business a couple of days a week and in the third quarter of the year I finished my 12 year stint with the company to go it alone. That year we also had our first kid - just to do it all at once.

&#x200B;

The first few months were daunting as I really had to hustle for leads and sell jobs to survive, I had a bit of a cash buffer but that quickly depleted and ended up being a lot lower than I wanted and the reality hit of trying to make ends meet.

&#x200B;

Initially I was stupidly paying myself similar to what my old job was paying but I soon found out this wouldn't last and basically took a pay cut to as low as I could possibly go so I could reinvest as much into the business and staff as I could afford.

&#x200B;

I realized that I really needed some help to get through the work and hired a full time guy as well as a part timer - things were far from perfect but we got through some work! The first full time guy didn't work out and he left and the part timer became full time and is our main guy today.

&#x200B;

The end of the second year saw us hit 184k in revenue and we purchased a second had truck (ute) to start building our second rig.

&#x200B;

Year 3 has seen us take on another full time guy and I'm starting to get the odd days were I can get off the truck and do sales which is an absolute must. We have 2 trucks in operation and a 3rd ready for build - this will be a replacement of the original equipment I started with as it's starting to get a bit long in the tooth, the end of year will see us operating with 2 trucks but hopefully much more capable and reliable.

&#x200B;

We have also leased a small warehouse where we stored the trucks and equipment - I thought it was also important to have a home base for the guys to arrive at each day rather than my house which is one more step toward removing myself from the day to day. It's a big cost but the benefits far outweigh it.

&#x200B;

Our marketing has changed quite dramatically, we no longer use any lead gen services and collect all our own leads in house using Google adwords, organic (SEO + Maps), referral and we had just started with some direct mail.

&#x200B;

To keep growth going in the right direction I've learned you really need marketing levers that you can pull to make the phone ring so I'm paying more and more attention to that while learning how we can best retain the existing customers.

&#x200B;

In Australia our financial year ends June 30 - all going well this should see us hit 300k revenue.

&#x200B;

Profits are quite low but at this stage we are still young and trying hard to grow, it has certainly been one of the hardest things I've done and at this stage is harder than ever as we face cash flow issues and the usual growth pains. 

  
This year coming I'd like to hit 600k revenue but to be honest it's a little scary as to reach that level is going to require some serious action on my behalf. I plan to get off the truck completely to focus on sales and marketing help in achieving this.

&#x200B;

We also have our second baby on the way just to add to the mix !

  
I'm certainly not rich - in fact each month is a struggle to pay the bills and I pay myself about 500 bucks a week. I've chosen to invest in my business and staff and hopefully reap the rewards later. Survival mode sucks big time but hopefully it's short term.

  
Overall it's been a damn tough time but very rewarding to look back at what we have created from nothing. I've never learned so much in my life 2 years of full time business has provided more learning than 15 years of employment and high school years by far. There's no better way to learn and develop than when your back is to the wall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bqcg1l/i_left_my_corporate_job_to_start_a_pressure/,1089,"You guys do not seem to be getting the point.

> I'm certainly not rich - in fact each month is a struggle to pay the bills and I pay myself about 500 bucks a week.  

This is a story of what you should NOT do.

 

A successful business will have all these points.

1. A   monopoly. It should be a unique product or service. Difficult to copy   or compete with.
2. Horizontal  growth in the future. Adding more products or services.
3. Vertical Growth. Adding more stores or retail outlets.
4. High   return on investment.  Product or service cost should less than 20%.
5. Low debt, low start up costs. Don't want to waste a lot of money to see if an idea works.

118,4wkaop,False,,330,How I turned $600 into my first $4k in revenue in 4.5 weeks importing products from China (Alibaba).,Entrepreneur,"[Numbers & Data](http://imgur.com/a/LMVqT) [More](http://imgur.com/a/wvEKH)

$4,006.90 in total revenue since I listed my first product for sale on June 22nd, about $1,500 profit.

My products are consumer electronics and jewelry, not going to name them specifically.

How I did it:

I've always like the idea of being your own boss. I used to flip vintage sports hats off eBay and made like $5k in a summer doing it, but unfortunately that market completely died and decided it was time for my next venture.


I'm 21 and hate the thought of working a minimum wage job so I decided to take a shot at importing from Alibaba. I've been really interested in it for over a year now but never really pursued it as I didn't have a lot of money and it is hard to start with a small amount of capital due to sample fees, suppliers MOQ, etc. Eventually I just couldn't get the idea off my mind and knew I could make money at it, so I started to get more serious about it.


I had $200 in the bank and decided to sell my PS4 and other things I had sitting in my room, my family thought I was insane. I ended up with somewhere around $600 to use and knew I had to put it to good use.


With only $600 I knew I had to play the high volume low margin game (buy low, sell low, sell a lot). It was the only choice I had and I simply couldn't afford to look for any products that cost >$10 because that was already thousands of dollars over my budget.

**How I found my product(s):**

It's no secret that importing in general has blown up over the past 5 years and a lot of people are taking their shot at it. It's hard to find profitable products that aren't already being imported by massive power sellers with incredibly low margins, so it takes time and patience. The amount of times I've thought I found a slam dunk product and have had my hopes crushed is too many. You need to settle down into a niche category, something ideally with 5,000 or less listings in it, so you have a chance to compete with the other sellers.

I found my first product through a website that I love, Terapeak. Terapeak is an eBay analytic tool that analyzes the hottest categories, keywords, and products selling right now. It's a must have if you're serious about importing as it gives you data that you just won't be able to find without it. I was going through the website and found a niche category in consumer electronics and the product fit all my guidelines (light, cheap to ship, profitable, low chance of defectiveness), so I decided to import 50 units, that's all I could afford. I felt like such an amateur ordering 50 of my item and I'm sure my supplier thought the same thing, but I was happy I finally made my first order.

My first product wasn't a slam dunk by any means, but it was profitable and it got me started. I turned my $600 into something like $900 and the turnaround wasn't great but I turned a profit and it allowed me to place a bigger order with a lower price and better margins. A lot of people interested in importing never take the next step because they haven't found the miracle product that nets them $15 a sale and allows them to get rich overnight. Just get started, find a profitable product and go from there. 

My second product and my most profitable to date was also found through terapeak as well as doing a bit of snooping through other successful importers eBay stores. It's a very niche product, only with about 1,000 listings and it's pretty much me vs. another seller jockeying for best match and the better search results. This product again hit all my criteria (very cheap, very light, sells well and has pretty much no room for defectiveness).

Terapeak isn't the only place to find a product to sell, obviously. Other options that have worked for me are Amazon best sellers/ movers and shakers, searching through importers eBay stores, trying to solve a problem, and asking suppliers what their best selling and hottest products are.

**Okay, I found a product. How do I get it to sell well?**

After you've found a product and imported it, you need to sell it. If you're familiar with eBay you know that if you have top search positions you will get a ton of sales. How do you do this?

1. List your products really cheap to begin with. I sell my product at $7.99/pc and when I first listed it I had it at $5.99. After my first 10 sales I bumped it to $6.99, next 10 sales I bumped it to $7.49, next 10 bumped it to $7.79 and finally $7.99. The reason for this is that if you list it immediately at your desired price you will struggle to get people to see your listing as you won't be high up on the search listings. Starting your listing out at a very low price (breaking even or taking a loss) allows a ton of traffic to get your listing and traffic = views = sales = high up on eBays best match search algorithm. The small loss you take in the beginning will be worth it 100x over when you get good search positioning.

2. Promote your listings and run promotions on Ebay. Open up a seller store and create promoted listings for your items. Promoted listings create ads for your items in which you pay a very small fee on if someone clicks on it and purchases your item. Take a look at my numbers from my promoted listings [here](http://imgur.com/a/ye4q3). It's a great new feature that eBay is using that will spike up sales.

So that's where I'm at now. I just got a new shipment in yesterday and have been packing orders for the past hour which got me to typing this. I actually dropped my first product and am focusing exclusively my second product (4 different styles) and am anticipating sales to increase to about 40-50 a day @ ~$1.78 profit per unit which in the long run is a good chunk of change, and that's just one product. I'm actively searching for more products to add so I can hopefully scale this and make some good money for myself.

I hope this helped someone get the motivation to start their importing journey. It's not crazy success by any means or a ton of money but I think I can start to ramp this up with the capital I have now, so expect an update in the next few months.

I'm not the best writer and this post was all over the place so if you have any questions about the importing process feel free to ask and I will answer your questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4wkaop/how_i_turned_600_into_my_first_4k_in_revenue_in/,1093,Is this an advert for Alibaba? ,2016-08-07 10:01:08

27,ayzlqu,False,Lessons Learned,384,I lost nearly $8000 selling on Amazon FBA,Entrepreneur,"With all the success stories, I wonder if people would appreciate hearing about a sheer unadulterated failure of a business.

In 2017, I started my first business, selling with Amazon FBA. I followed every guru gimmic in the book. I sourced a niche product from China. but the niche became so saturated I ended up selling my product for next to nothing and giving away much of my inventory in the hopes of reviews/better ranking.

Here is a breakdown of the money I lost:
$4000 on inventory (500 unit order)
$1000 for Freight Forwarder (Ocean freight)
$1400 on pay per click ads (got out of hand really fast)
Another $1000 between professional photography and artwork/branding design
$500 misc. (FBA subscription, barcode registration, product samples, etc.)

I learned a lot for sure. My main takeaway was not to follow a cookie-cutter scheme that promises a guarenteed revenue stream after following 5 easy steps. Amazon FBA is not passive income, it's a full time job, one I had nowhere near the time for. If everyone is doing something, it may not be the best idea. Don't run off the cliff with the lemmings.

As much of a gut punch this experience has been, I have tried to learn from it, and have a better idea of what not to do in future ventures.

150,5vdyp8,False,,237,"I quit my job 4 years ago and started selling WordPress themes with a friend. We have since made more than $500,000.",Entrepreneur,"Hey, guys!
I've been wanting to write a story about our journey for a very long time, but I've never got around to doing it until today. Also I'm not english, so sorry in advance for poor writting.

**A quick look at my backstory:**

I have been working for about 3 years for 2 different digital studios as a web designer. Just a few months shy before the end of 2012, I decided that I've had enough of waking up at 7 in the morning (not really an early morning kinda person)
and going to work till 5:30 all the time with 20 days off for the whole year.  I was tired of my routine, and as a result I felt disgruntled at my job. I was always researching and finding ideas online on businesses. I wanted to run my own business
that would help me earn a living. I've always loved playing games ever since I was a kid and that interest helped lead me to where I am now.

One day, while I was creating a website for a Counter Strike clan, I discovered that there weren't a whole lot of gaming themes for WordPress. I saw this as idea
that could be profitable as there were alot of people coming up with clan and gaming sites at the time despite a lack of themes, and I believed that I could fulfill this demand.

I started by selling a PSD (Photoshop) file of a theme and which made around $500 the first month in themeforest [https://themeforest.net/user/skywarrior](https://themeforest.net/user/skywarrior). I asked a friend to see if he is interested in converting the PSD files to Wordpress themes, which he accepted and took us around 1-2 months to complete.
In the first month or so, we made around $2000 and he became my partner in the business. After releasing a couple of new themes, we started to earn around $10000 a month, which is roughly what we still earn today from Themeforest. 

Unfortunately, Themeforest changed its policies a lot in the past year or so. Instead of taking 2 weeks for a theme to be reviewed, it would now take up to 3 months, which made me feel like it isn't really worth it anymore to publish our themes there. 
In early 2016, my partner and I opened a office in Belgrade (Serbia), where we run our studio. We have expanded our business to accommodate more clients and more work and we started to pickup on sales of our themes in our website.

Now we are focusing into a more client oriented work, while still supporting and developing new themes.

**Problems we faced:**

One of the major issues we have faced throught the years, and we still today is be able to find the right employees (web developers and designers) at the right price. We generally look in Upwork, so online wise is not too difficult,
however now that we have moved to a fixed location.. well is more of a challenge to find somebody to come to the office daily. 
Another big problem we face is that our product is not too easy to market. Is very niche, you need to find people that like gaming, know what wordpress is AND want to make a site. We invested quite a lot of money and even now the results are 
somewhat poor.

560,aup5go,False,,86,Lesson learned: Never let 1 client be more than 15% of revenue,Entrepreneur,"Hi all, 


So this was something pretty basic lesson that I had read and heard from others before - but sometimes things don't really ""stick"" until you experience it first hand. We are a services start-up (coming up on our 1 yr anniversary next month!) that is bootstrapped with no debt. We are currently at 4 full time employees. Last year, we signed a big client that was paying us about $100k/yr (we were at $450k ARR) which meant this client was a SUBSTANTIAL portion of our revenues. The client was great to work with, but the margins were TERRIBLE on the work due to a variety of reasons. After meeting with the team, we decided to cut the client which had a DRAMATIC negative impact on our cash flow. Our gross profit went from 40% to -25% in a matter of a month. Ultimately, cutting them was the right choice because now we can take on clients that have much better margins, but losing that amount of money so quickly was a big shock to the system. So if it is any advice I could give fellow business owners ... say NO to a client that would be giving you more than 15% of your total company revenue. You never want to be in a position where someone could 'have you by the balls' and make you bend over backwards in order to keep them. And also: Sometimes cutting a client that is paying you a lot but has relatively low margins is WORTH IT because it will free up your capacity for those higher margin clients :). ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aup5go/lesson_learned_never_let_1_client_be_more_than_15/,551,"> The client was great to work with, but the margins were TERRIBLE on the work due to a variety of reasons. 

So you spent a huge amount of time on a client with bad margins (likely solved by charging more), and let your company rely on its cashflow...

And the lesson you took away from this was to just generally always turn down your biggest clients/jobs?

There's lessons in here, but they're about quoting, margins, cash flow management, reliance/commitments and managing expectations.  

Telling everyone they should just plain turn down their biggest clients based on a magical number of 15% is ridiculous advice. ",2019-02-25 19:25:07
17,fsihym,False,AMA,282,"Inspired by deep depression, I taught myself to code, built a manual mood tracker used by 285k people which earned ~$100k then raised $1m in angel/VC funding to launch a fully automatic mood tracker. Ask me anything!",Entrepreneur,"10 years ago I was given  a serious mental health diagnosis, my world was flipped upside down. I was in my second year of college and I was hospitalized for a month. Upon coming out my mom (a psychiatrist), my therapists, and doctor all recommended I track my mood. I didn’t agree with it, but it came at a cost.

I struggled  with my mental health for 2 years and slowly learned the wisdom of mood tracking and seeing how what I do impacts my mental health.

Not wanting to use the flimsy paper given by my psychiatrist and unhappy with the mood tracking apps at the time, taught myself to code and built myself a mood tracker that was used by 1/4 million people, featured by Apple on the front page of the App Store, and generated around $100k from a freemium subscription.

I’ve now built an automatic mood tracker called Misü because the top reason folks stop tracking is that manually tracking anything makes it a hard habit to keep up.

What is Misü?

Misü ([www.misu.app](http://www.misu.app/)) automatically tracks your mood through facial micro-expressions while you use your computer. Misü helps you learn about your mood trends, as well as how various apps and sites impact your mental health. Would love your feedback on the app.

Turns out that 10% of the U.S. has tracked their mood in the past, and using Misü, people track their mood for 10x longer than they would for manual tracking.

964,cego1o,False,,171,Why I switched from online businesses to local businesses,Entrepreneur,"I've followed the entrepreneur subreddit from when it was a lot of valuable information to where it is now and I figured I'd try and help it get back to it's glory days. 

&#x200B;

I wanted to try and help out some of the newer entrepreneurs with something that seems so easy and obvious to me now that wasn't a few years ago when I was just started out in the business world. I see that /u/sweatystartup has been trying to tell you guys as well so I figured I'd help drive the point home. 

&#x200B;

**My background**: I started out working with one of my family businesses (a hair salon) trying to turn it into a more self sufficient business as the only time it was making money was when the lights were on and there was people in chairs and staff performing services. 

&#x200B;

I discovered e-commerce and spent the next couple years slugging it out online selling hair products. I loved the idea that we could make money while we slept and there was no better feeling to waking up to a Shopify notification saying I made a sale. 

&#x200B;

However my CPA was high about $70-$100 and my AOV was about $250 so profit margins were low so I decided to experiment one month with local ads pushing traffic to our salon to see what would happen. 

&#x200B;

In that month my CPA dropped down to about $50 and my AOV went up to about $450. That's when I knew I had something. 

&#x200B;

So the point I'm trying to make is this: When you're running an online business you're competing against the best marketers and businesses that exist in your niche. When you're running a local business you're competing against the guy down the street that might be using a fax machine and hasn't updated his website in 5 years. 

&#x200B;

For those of you that haven't had much success in the online business space, take a look at local businesses. There's ways to build businesses where you don't have to do much of the actual service but can run the business smoothly and efficiently. You likely have skills that will allow you to decimate the competition around you. 

&#x200B;

If there's interest I'm happy to write more posts about how I run my businesses very similar to an online business while keeping my target market local. 

&#x200B;

Happy to answer any questions below as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cego1o/why_i_switched_from_online_businesses_to_local/,392,This is exactly as the other stupidstartup spam post. ,2019-07-17 18:22:24
377,4q3b49,False,,116,6 things I did to generate over $150k in under 16 weeks.,Entrepreneur,"EDIT: Updating with ChallengeBox description. 

Four months ago I started a company called ChallengeBox. It's a fitness subscription box that uses your wearable to deliver personalized fitness challenges, fitness gear, equipment, and healthy snacks each month. At the time, my other startup after doing a few million dollars in revenue a couple of years straight was struggling through a pivot.

In our new direction we were having a hard time selling the software to large companies. Around thanksgiving of last year we had to lay off our team and put it on hold. The timing couldn’t have been worse. It was one of the hardest things I had to do, and right around the holidays was crushing.

I still had confidence in what we built but I couldn’t figure out how to scale an enterprise software business quickly. I had spent years on this company and I wanted to prove that what I learned from Decisive would work.


**1. ANALYTICS AND RETARGETING PIXELS ARE CRITICAL**

Data is the lifeblood of ChallengeBox. It helps me make decisions faster, and get the most out of all of your work. So before I launch I ensure that my business is instrumented.

Here’s are the analytics that I set up before launching:

**Add Google Analytics tags.**
Set up Goals in Google Analytics. Goals tell me what channels are driving customers. Here’s a great explainer for how to set up goals.

**Ensure that I have heatmap tracking.**
It’s extremely important for me to understand how people are interacting with the site. Heatmaps allow me to do this. I usually use Mouseflow because they have a free plan to get started.

**Set up Google and Facebook remarketing pixels**
Every visitor from the day I launch likely has some level of interest in what I’m offering. I want to be sure I can reach those people after they’ve left. Remarketing can be an extremely cost effective way to do this. Here’s an explanation for how to set up Google Remarketing tags. Here’s an explanation for Facebook remarketing tags.

**Set up link tracking.** 
As I post across social media make sure that I’m tracking links. Bitly is awesome for this.


**2. DISTRIBUTION IS KING**
 
Once the site is set up I wanted to put ChallengeBox in front of as many people as fast as possible.  Before launch I always ask where will I distribute this product? I think of myself as Starbucks or McDonalds. Where are the busiest street corners with the right people to place my store.

I tested the following free channels:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Pinterest
* Product Hunt

I also emailed a number of blogs and I was able to get ChallengeBox written up a blog post for Style Magazine.

For paid tests I ran advertising campaigns across:
* Facebook
* Google
* Twitter. 
More on that later in the post.

The goals of testing distribution are three-fold

* Understanding whether people will actually pay for your product.
* Getting feedback (both likes and dislikes) about your product.
* Listening to the actual words people use as they describe your product. You can use these in testing landing page copy and ad copy in the future.



**3. DISTRIBUTION DETERMINES CONTENT**
 

After running all of these tests I determined that Facebook was the best place to spend my time. Our audience was there, and I knew that it could scale.

I spent a few days in Facebook groups just listening to what people were saying, what jokes they made so that I could understand what types of content to create.

I created three anchor pieces of content:

* A blog post that was 100 awesome resources that will make you happier with your Fitbit.
* A eBook that was meant to be a comprehensive manual for how to use your new Fitbit. 
* A fun personality quiz with memes called ""What is your Fitbit personality"". 

These allowed us to get started with promotion of the site, and make it feel like our customers were getting value even if they didn't buy anything from us.  


With ChallengeBox I wasn't immediately sure if it actually would work. I wanted to prove it to myself. So I set my goals in various milestones to prove that I should continue with building the business out. 


**1-10 Customers** – The first ten customers I got were based on some manual work. I interacted with people on Twitter who were interested in Fitbit and fitness and posted to forums. This was great to prove that someone would actually pay for ChallengeBox. It was also key to learning about what I needed to say as I thought about how to reach even more customers.

**10-100 Customers** –  I determined that Facebook would be the best channel to focus on here. I achieved this through testing out of variations of Facebook ads.

**100-1000 Customers** – After a couple of weeks of testing I was able to determine out which content and which targeting worked best to acquire our first 100 customers I began to increase our daily spend to about $300-600 per day

**1000-10,000 Customers** – We’re putting in place the infrastructure to scale to our next 5x. Facebook alone won’t get us there so we’ll start to expand to investing in, and optimizing other social platforms.


**5. ASSUME NOTHING. TEST EVERYTHING**

With content and ads I test everything. I look at ChallengeBox as one huge experiment. I tested different content formats. Images versus video. I test different images,  headlines, descriptions. I tested multiple variations of landing pages.

We found that videos definitely work better than images, for driving conversions. If you can test basic videos for Facebook I highly recommend it.

Adespresso is also an invaluable too to helping you quickly test and iterate through Facebook ads.


**6. FOCUS LIKE CRAZY ON WHAT WORKS AND IS SCALABLE**

Through testing I’m always looking for two things.

* Does a channel work?
* Is it scalable?

It seems that finding scalable channels is where companies hit a wall. Influencers are an awesome way to jumpstart a community but they may not scale cost effectively.

Most people are afraid of spending on advertising. However if you get it right it is one of the best ways I know to truly accelerate your growth. I was able to generate over $150k by spending $40k. Worth it? I think so.

The key is finding what works. For ChallengeBox so far, after our initial tests we ONLY focused on Facebook on Females in the US on iPhones. These users have converted the best.

**WHAT’S NEXT?**
There is still TONS of scale here, and once we are ready we will expand beyond this target audience to Android, and then males and then International.

Building and scaling successful subscription business is not easy. There are so many mistakes I’ve made over the last 6 months, but it's a fun challenge to be learning the ins and outs of a physical product business.  

[Here's the original post with pics](https://growthstory.co/6-things-i-did-right/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4q3b49/6_things_i_did_to_generate_over_150k_in_under_16/,688,"The profit margins aren't much on most of these gimmicky subscription boxes.

Along with my business partner, Joe Magnotti, we started building and selling our own websites back in 2009-2010, but eventually pivoted to a brokerage & marketplace where we bring together sellers, buyers, and investors to close deals.

The company has grown quite a bit in the last few years - from $200K in sales in 2012 to $4.7M in 2015 - enough to get us listed at #161 on the INC 5000 list this year. To date, we’ve helped broker more than $12M in website sales and should do around $8M - $9M in 2016.

We are a US based company, but run our business from SE Asia and we’ve grown our team by hiring “apprentices” and bringing them halfway around the world to join us. As they grow they become part of our management team.

Our management team is technically “location independent”, but we all get together every 3-4 months to spend 1 month working together. At our last get together in Phuket, Thailand we held a retreat where our customers and other entrepreneurs got together for a mastermind and had an absolute blast.

It was a great experience so we are holding another retreat Oct 28 - Nov 1st in Phuket. [More info on our Phuket Retreat here](https://www.picatic.com/EmpireRetreatPhuket)

You can always reach out to me with any questions or for advice and I will do my best to help you.

Ready?

Let’s jump in.

&#x200B;

**Day 1: Reflection**

Ok! Day 1.

I want to take the time to make sure that this is what I want to do, and to set my commitment for it\*

I know this will not be an easy journey the next few months, however, I am doing this to give myself true financial freedom and power over my future.

So, I will take two hours to write down my thoughts and hopes for this business into a journal. I will also write down what my long-term goals really are, and then work backwards to see if they are aligned with this business.

But most of all I will take time to kick back, relax, and get motivated. Because now that I’ve committed it is time to get down to business.

\*This is an important day, even if you feel like you won’t be doing a lot. What you are really doing is gaining clarity on what you want to do. You do not want to commit to a business and then find out months or a year later that it is trapping you and not letting you do what you really want.

**Day 2: Getting Down to Business**

Today is where we start looking at all the amazing opportunities and different types of local businesses in our area to see what lights a spark in us.

Go for a walk for an hour or two in your town or city and really look around at all the businesses that you see. Look at the cars passing you by and you'll see plumbers, electricians, bathroom remodellers, or appliance installation services.

You probably never thought about this before, but all the businesses that just passed you by or you walked pass? The vast majority of those are 6 & 7 figure businesses. Run by people who have absolutely no business experience but are just good at what they do.

They are small operations, but they can bring in serious money. So, start taking notes on businesses that you pass by, just a giant list of every single one. Now when you get home, go through that list and pick the top 5 appealing ones, or the ones you've never thought about before that seem interesting.

And just start playing around, go on YouTube and learn about those five different niches. How they work, how much they charge, and so on. Lastly, take a moment to think of the possibilities. Because most of these businesses are being run the same way they were in 1980 and 1990, and you have access to some of the most amazing marketing and sales knowledge FOR FREE. Strategies that work in 2019. You need to realize the power at your fingertips.

Because tomorrow you're going to decide on your niche and get going for real.

\*Really do this because it far more insightful than just visiting Yelp and looking at the different niches.

**Day 3: Decide on Your Niche**

Today is arguably the most important of the entire 30-day plan, because you are going to decide the niche that you will be working in for the next few years. Yesterday when you looked through your 5 chosen local niches, chances are one or two of them appealed to you more than the others. So now it's time to decide between your top 2.

A couple important qualities to help you narrow the choice down:

\-Should have good profit margins (above 20%)

\-No licensing required in your state (some industries, like painting in certain states require thousands in licensing fees and are a very real bottleneck)

\-Do not require you to personally be in the field

\-Already have companies in your area doing well in that niche (means there is plenty of business on the table)

Here's a very important tip: If you're really struggling between the top 2 and you just can't choose... Choose the one that will leave your options open for growth later.

For example, I run a cleaning company, which has allowed me to expand to window cleaning and carpet cleaning services as I have grown. Over the next couple of years, I can even start offering home organisation if I want to.

And if you are still unsure, shoot me or the community and message. I'll be happy to help you choose. Regardless, you really need to choose TODAY because this is one of those decisions that if you let it, will stall you forever.

Tomorrow is going to be interesting because we're going to look at your local competition and use their weaknesses as our strengths.

**Day 4: Scout Out the Competition**

Welcome back!

Today, we will be doing competitive research on your chosen local business niche. This will be a quick, but powerful lesson for you because it will set the foundation of your branding and marketing. For this lesson I will use the example of a cleaning company in Spokane, Washington. Just replace this term with your chosen niche and city.

You may have heard of a SWOT analysis in a marketing or business class, but I assure we will *not* be filling out any boring charts or tables. Rather, we will be doing a rudimentary and real-world analysis. A quick and dirty SWOT analysis, if you will.

Ready? Let’s Go.

Head on over to Yelp.com or Google.com and search “cleaning company Spokane wa” and “cleaner Spokane wa”. Now, open the top 10 companies that appear and grab a notebook. Go to their reviews section but ignore the 5\* reviews for now. Instead, focus on their 1\*, 2\*, and 3\* reviews.

Start taking notes on *why* the cleaning company got that bad review. You may find that some of the most common reasons are:

1.People don’t answer their phones

2.People show up late and don’t tell you

3.Their team rushed the job

4.There was poor communication before, during and after the cleaning job

5.They are unwilling to fix an issue the customer found

Notice something?

None of these reasons are related to the actual cleaning part of the job. They are all to do with the customer service side of the business.

Here’s the beauty in this – if you can do a better job than the competition on customer service your customers will always prefer to work with you. So many local businesses are run by amazing technicians who are great at what they do. The reality is they can’t be good at everything and often their weak spot is customer service.

What you can do is take the top 5 patterns of bad reviews you wrote down and turn them into your strengths. You can start branding yourself as having great customer care, easy to reach, and always willing to make an issue right. The fact is, you don’t need 20 years of cleaning experience to own a great cleaning company! You just need to hire the right people and provide a great experience to your customer.

Treat your customer onboarding like a 5\* hotel check-in and make the entire experience flawless. All we are doing is finding out what annoys our future customers and just *not doing that*.

That’s it!

**Day 5: Residential vs Commercial**

Now that we've chosen our niche, for many of us the next step is to choose if you're going to be doing residential or commercial work from the get-go. This is a really important decision to make because if you try do to both at the same time, you'll find that the marketing and sales process for them is very different from one another.

I want you to concentrate on one at least the first year, so you can allow yourself to build a level of competency within your niche and your focus. Take painting – residential exterior and interior painting are a whole different ball game then commercial painting, or new construction painting. They have different marketing, different profit margins, different expected turnaround times, and different scales. To the point that you can have a painting company for 20 years and never explored other types of painting.

It's the same with cleaning. My cleaning company does primarily residential and vacation rental cleanings. We have never done a single commercial or office job in years because we need to hire a different type of cleaner, on a different schedule, with different pricing. Far better to double down on what is already working until you need to add services to grow.

Take some time to think about which one you want to start with, but here's what I will say. If you are a new business owner, I would recommend residential at first. Commercial can scale larger more quickly than residential but residential is a much better starting option because the marketing and sales process tends to be a lot easier. And there is less risk of having all your eggs in one basket with a big commercial client (who pays you two months late and causes payroll issues…).

This is a really short-day guys so I don't want you to spend all day consumed by worrying about making the wrong decision but do give it some serious thought today and commit to one or the other.

**Day 6 & 7: Create Your Website & Online Presence**

Welcome Back!

The next two days are very important ones, because you will be making the first *real* step in starting your local business. We will be setting up our online presence to make our business easy to discover and convenient to book.

So, first off what online presence is essential for us to have?

Here is what you *need to have:*

Website – there are three parts to your website that you will need to include, at a minimum.

The first is to buy your domain name and hosting once you have chosen a name for your local business. I recommend Namecheap (I personally have dozens of domain names through them). Their support is phenomenal whenever you have a problem, which is almost unheard of in that industry.

The second is to buy a good-looking website theme. Chances are, somebody has already made a beautiful theme for your niche that you can buy for less than $50. There are dozens of great cleaning themes for $27-$47 and I am sure there will be for yours too. Do not pay a professional at first, instead use that money for marketing later.

The third and final part you will need on your website is a convenient booking form so that customers can book without any hassle. Nowadays, so many potential customers expect to be able to book online and don’t want to be forced to call…so you best make sure you make it as easy as possible for them! See if there is a specific booking form for your business first – if not then use a more general one.

Please don’t spend a week on your website trying to make it look perfect, it should just be professional and convenient!

As well as a website, you will need to claim all your social profiles immediately. That includes Facebook, Next Door, Alignable, and any well-known local social sites in your area. If relevant to your industry Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube may all be worth including.

I won’t lecture you on why you need to claim your social media profiles…at this point I think we all know just how powerful social media can be for *any* business.

Finally, once you have claimed your social profiles and built your website, the last step to take is to build your profiles on relevant marketing channels.

Across industries the most impactful ones currently are:

Google My Business (**very important**)

Yelp

Thumbtack

HomeAdvisor

AngiesList

And if you are in the UK Bark has been making a big splash lately.

It is worth spending considerable time on your profiles and templates for these websites because for the first year most of your customers are likely to come from them. One way you can make sure you do it right is by finding the top pros in your area and in major cities. Study their profiles on these sites and see what they are doing to promote themselves.

“Absorb what is **useful**, **Discard what is not**, Add what is uniquely your own.” – Bruce Lee

I bet you didn’t expect to find a Bruce Lee quote in a plan about building a business, did you?

One last points – make sure you build your profile on smaller region-specific marketing platforms too. Most people don’t bother, and you can turn this to your advantage. Often just having a couple good reviews on smaller platforms is enough to propel you to the top and claim all the jobs that come through. You can dominate these small marketing channels with little effort and a worthwhile reward.

At this point, do **not** start spending money on advertising platforms yet, we will get to that soon.

That’s it for today!

Good work.

**Day 8: Choose A Booking Software, Payment Processor & Phone System**

Day 8 is very close related day's 6 and 7 and is an integral part of how you will do business every single day.

I touched on the booking software briefly yesterday, but I wanted to give you a little more insight into that. There are great general booking softwares/CRMS out there like MindBody or Jobber, but if you can see if you can find one specific to your niche. There are booking softwares that only do cleaning companies for example, and their forms and structure are optimized with cleaning companies in mind. If you have chosen pressure washing, painting, appliance repair or whatever...see if there's a booking form specifically for those if you can.

The second thing is your payment processor. I'm just going to go out and say it 99% of the time you should use stripe. I haven't used Square myself but I do know about people who have you swearing than happy with it so I think that's a fine option as well, particularly if you take card payments on location.

A good virtual phone system is also crucial. Now, my VA business runs over 50 local businesses for the owners, so we have great insight into pretty much every virtual phone system out there. The two that...while not perfect and they have their own flaws, I would recommend are Grasshopper and RingCentral.

This is very important. **Do not** use you personal cell phone number. I cannot tell you the number of times I have talked to business owners who used their personal phone number in the beginning and have had to change their personal phone number or get a new one.

Get a separate number for your business. This is not negotiable.

If you've read this far, we're now on week 2. I know there's been some fluff at the start but a lot of this is very important to set the groundwork correctly for your business. But from here on out, we're starting to get into the nitty gritty and launch this baby by figuring out pricing, hiring our first team, starting marketing and getting our first few customers.

See you tomorrow!

**Day 9: Figure Out Your Pricing**

Pricing is something you can spend a lot of time optimizing, but I recommend you use a simple pricing method your first year so you can get on with building the business.

Look at your top five competitors (have the best reviews and a good customer base), and either copy their pricing or add 20% on top of their pricing at first.

What you are going to do when you start with 0 reviews is tell people your price, then discount their first booking. This gives them an incentive to book with you. I know, I know, everyone says to avoid price shoppers, but guess what? When you have no reputation or reviews that is who you are stuck with, so get on with it and make them happy. This is how as a new company I was able to get hired hundreds of times off of thumbtack over the course of a few months, outranking companies who have been around for years with impeccable reviews (we also followed up like crazy).

The strategy goes a little something like this, regardless of the platform: The first 10 people receive a 35% discount and you really push them for a review, when you have 10 reviews you drop it down to 30% discount, when you have 20 drop down to 25%, when you have 30 down to 20, and so until your typical charging your normal price or giving them a small discount as a first-time customer.

**Day 10: Take A Break**

Seriously, take one. You’re doing a LOT in a short amount of time, even if it feels manageable right now. We want to build good momentum, not bad momentum that heads us towards a crash because we never take a break.

**Day 11: Put Together A Budget ($500, If I can)**

Ahhh budgeting, how fun! This is another one of the most important days, especially if you are a student or you don't have a lot in savings. Putting together your budget is a necessary part of starting a business. You can start a service business incredibly cheaply and do the labour yourself the first few weeks to build up some cash reserves, but in my experience if you can it is better to start with teams from the beginning. I know many owners who get trapped being the tech in their own business and it can take years to transition out of that mindset and role.

You could buy a window cleaning kit for $50 and start knocking door to door…this still works brilliantly in 2019, by the way. But if you want to build a real service *business* then we need a bit of money for your website and marketing.

If you can swing it, I recommend $1000 for everything to start. you can't I strongly advise $500 minimum, because that would be very tight as it is. The truth is you are not going to know where your money is best spent at first, so you need some time and money to figure out what marketing is working best for you.

So, put together your budget with as much as you can set aside (there are always small unexpected costs).

**Day 12: Create Your First Job Post**

Let’s jump straight into it today and create our first job post!

Go on craigslist and indeed.com, see what job posts are doing well in your niche start to craft your own in a similar style. Here’s one I use for cleaning that I tweaked from one I found (funny enough, on reddit!) years ago that has always worked well:

Subject Line: Looking for Two Person Cleaning Teams (Washington)

Looking for Two Person Cleaning Teams ({Washington DC} & Surrounding Areas)

We're a cleaning company that expects a rush of clients as the summer winds down and we need a few teams to help us out.

This is for residential cleaning. We pay per cleaning.

\*\*Residential Cleanings\*\*

\*Studio Apartment - $75

\*1 Bed 1 Bath - $85

\*2 Bed 1 Bath - $95

\*3 Bed 2 Bath - $125

\*4 Bed 2 Bath - $135

\*\*With Extra Services Tacked On (Example: Inside Fridge, Cabinets, and Interior Windows)\*\*

Thank you very much. We'll respond quickly.

Try not to spend more than 3 hours searching and creating your job posts. To start, create two totally different ones and post them on both craigslist and Indeed.

**Day 13: Interview Potential Teams**

Most of the stuff you're going to read about hiring doesn't really apply to you. A lot of it is about corporate recruiting, tech recruiting, and review processes that are too in-depth and cost a boatload of money.

Unfortunately, there are not that many good resources recruiting for local businesses, but here is an excellent one to get you started: [https://academy.getjobber.com/tags/hiring/](https://academy.getjobber.com/tags/hiring/)

They have job posts and descriptions for all kinds of niches, along with hiring tips and questions. I wish I knew about them when I was getting started. Go through their hiring vault and start drawing up a list of questions to ask your potential candidates. If feasible, have them do a trial service at your place so you can get an idea of if they can do what they say they can.

Straight up make sure they are polite, have reliable transportation, are citizens, can submit to a background check, and already have years of experience. Remind them the day before the interview, AND the morning of the interview.

At first, aim to bring on two good contractors even if you don’t have any work at first. As contractors, they already have other work to keep them busy, so they are not solely relying on you for income. The other reason you want two teams is if one of them decides to no-show the first couple of jobs, you could reschedule with the backup team.

**Day 14: Hire My First Team**

We have our first job ads up, candidates are applying, and you think you’ve found a couple winners!

There is a few important things you have to do to formally bring them on as an employee or contractor. I'm going to assume you're going to use independent contractors for now.

Non-negotiables:

\-Have them fill out a W9 BEFORE doing their first job. You will need this at the end of the year to issue them a 1099.

\-Draw up a subcontractor agreement for working together.

\-Background check them using a service like Onfido.

\-Make sure they have insurance

With those done, you are going pay close attention to the first three jobs. The first few jobs you want an outstanding experience, because this is the Foundation of your business' reputation that you are building in the early days.

If you have all of those pieces sorted, start to walk through expectations of working together. How much they will get paid, how you will send them jobs, and so on.

With those done, you are going pay close attention to the first three jobs. The first few jobs you want an outstanding experience, because this is the foundation of your business' reputation that you are building in the early days.

**Day 15: Start Organic Marketing**

While everyone is talking about optimizing Google Adwords campaigns, Facebook Ads/Clickfunnels, and the latest paid service, you can get a ton of business completely free.

Here are four quick ways we get several bookings per week consistently for years, without spending a dime:

Local Facebook groups:

Go join local mum groups, discount groups, flea market groups, student groups and local networking groups on Facebook.

People love to interact, get helpful advice from each other, and recommend each other.

If you have a slow booking day where your schedule is just not filling up, you can offer a crazy discount to flea market/garage sale groups and often get some bookings. The goal is not to make a profit on the discounted clean, but to have them become a regular at your normal price.

Do this 2-3x a week in various groups and you will start building authority and bookings from that group. When you post make sure you include a screenshot of some 5\* reviews of your business so they know you are legit and let them know you are the owner.

Next Door:

Next door is such a wonderfully underrated platform, and it's the way Facebook groups *should be*. You have your neighbours in a discussion board just for them, and recommendations feature that you can get other members to recommend your business. Our cleaning company has gotten a lot of business from Next Door, simple by asking our customers already on there to recommend us. We also provide a neighbour discount exclusively for them.

Hell, we even hire cleaners from Next Door sometimes by asking others if they have a good cleaner they know looking for more work.

This is a great avenue, if you authentically engage and be helpful, instead of just being salesy. Spend 5-10 minutes a day on there commenting and giving your own recommendations. I often see handymen recommended on there and know they get a ton of referral business from it.

Alignable:

Alignable is useful because it allows you to connect with other local business owners without having to pay BNI or your chamber of commerce a bunch of money every year. This is a fantastic platform to refer each other business and create interesting service partnerships. As an example, what we do is every spring season get together with window cleaners and home organisers to specials where people can get 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 services done at the same day, with us taking a chunk of the profits.

Door-To-Door:

I'm not going to say too much about door to door, but it is still very powerful method in 2019 for getting a lot of business, particularly for high-ticket seasonal services like painting and pressure washing.

There are a dozen wonderful organic marketing methods I could talk about, but here are just a few to get you started and thinking. Set a goal to be doing some sort of organic marketing every single day consistently. Because once you start getting more bookings from organic marketing it starts to speed up and referrals start coming in naturally. This is a key advantage over paid marketing.

**Day 16: Choose Your Top 2 Paid Marketing Channels To Test**

*You do not want to try out 10 different paid marketing channels your first few months, you will go broke and waste your money getting no bookings*. *Instead, focus on two great ones in your area and become an expert at them.*

Here is my recommended list for new service businesses to explore. Keep in mind EVERY CITY is different and certain ones will perform better than others:

Google Local Ads – this is Google’s new service, and it is performing far better than Adwords across most of the country. Get in while it is hot since most competitors aren’t using it yet.

Yelp – sorry, I know their management sucks, but they can get you a lot of business. If you do go with yelp, make sure you build up 10-15 positive reviews before paying for ads.

Google Adwords – don’t do this at the start unless you already have experience or a big enough budget to pay an expert to do it for you. I recommend not paying someone for Adwords help until you hit around $10,000/mo in revenue.

Thumbtack – Still a fantastic platform to get hired through, but follow-up is key (it always is, but even more so for thumbtack). Send a quote, then follow-up when they see it, follow-up end of day, the next day, two days later, and three days later with a final message. Revisit them 6 months later and ask them if they need service.

Facebook Ads/Funnels – don’t play around with these yet. Facebook marketers will tell you these work for every niche, but they don’t.

Craigslist – placing ads is still cheap and can get you a lot of inquiries, so this is very worth it at the start.

Amazon Seller Central – they take a cut of each job, but they WILL get you jobs. This is great the first few months when you are doing discounts, because even if you don’t make money on the front-end you can push to have them become regulars.

HomeAdvisor – it CAN work, but your leads are not exclusively sent to you and they charge a really high cost per call. If you have a big budget try it out, if not try others on this list at first.

**Day 17: Rapid Fire Testing**

Rapid Fire Testing is a crucial and painfully overlooked part of every business owners marketing strategies. Often, we just throw more money at a marketing campaign we THINK is working, without going through to calculate our ROI or optimize them.

Here is a quick way to rapid fire test the marking platforms you are already using.

Let us pretend we are trying to decide between 2 different marketing channels.

For example, if you use Thumbtack with a $150 monthly budget. Assume this gets you 10 quotes, and of those 10 quotes (assuming you have a tight follow-up system in place), you close 4. Your other marketing channel is HomeAdvisor, also with a $150 monthly budget. But HomeAdvisor only brings in 8 quotes, of which you closed two.

Essentially, we are comparing our customer acquisition costs.

For Thumbtack, we get one quote for $15 on average, and 1 sale per $37.50 on average. Whereas for HomeAdvisor we get one quote for $18.75 on average and get a sale for $75 on average.

From this very simplistic comparison we can see that Thumbtack would do far better for you, and it would be worth taking the $150 that you're currently spending on HomeAdvisor and doubling your Thumbtack budget instead.

This is what we want to do regularly from the get-go. Later on, you also want to compare the average ticket sizes that we get for each platform, because as you dial things in more it becomes more important. For example, exterior painting the ticket sizes are often larger than interior painting, and if you're using porch and thumbtack, you may find that the average exterior painting jobs that you close are higher on porch than on thumbtack.

This is a rapid-fire test that should be done at least quarterly.

Having said that, do not over complicate, it's just a quick marketing health check and asset reallocation. So do your rapid-fire test and stick with just the top 1-2 performing marketing channels.

**Day 18: Soft Launch**

Your soft launch is just an announcement that you are open for business and is a commitment to yourself to really do this.

This can be a good way to get your first few customers, and I see people recommend that often, but to be perfectly honest it can also be really annoying to push your friends and family to buy your business services.

The important thing here is the mental aspect that this is now a real business that you own. It is more for yourself than anyone else and is a safe way to start without being fully ready to go yet (otherwise you may fall prey to perfectionism). Just let people know you are trying this new side hustle out and are excited to see where it leads.

**Day 19: Learn How To Pitch & Close**

The first in golden rule that I tell people is to treat your potential customers like a hotel reception does when checking-in new customers. Treat them like they're going through the checking process already booked and you are just gathering their information. Assume the sale and walk them through your booking form step by step, answering their questions along the way but making sure that you return to the next step.

There are so many books about sales and so many sales tactics, but to be completely honest with you, if someone is calling you because need their lawn trimmed, or their fridge installed, they just want it over with and are already committed to just getting on with it. Some people price shop, but it is a surprisingly small number of people who do.

Now, as a new business with no reputation, I do recommend offering a discount at first if they resist. I see a lot of business owners say that you should not discount service or devalue yourself, but I think the mindset is so wrong.

What you're doing is offering them peace of mind that you're willing to work with them this first job. Sure, a few people may try and take advantage of you but the vast majority of people do respect you and only ask for a discount the first time.

This is smart to do, because when you discount you increase your sales conversion rate, which allows you to do a stellar job and then makes it 10 times easier to sell them on a recurring service afterwards. So, I typically treat the first booking like a loss leader similar to how a supermarket gets you in the store with cheap milk and bread, because they know you're going to want other stuff or services (which is where the profit is).

If you think about it this is exactly how paid marketing works too. You have a conversion cost when you run an Adwords campaign, and you typically only make a little bit of money or even no money on that first booking (if you have a lower priced service), but your hope is to convert them to a recurring customer and keep them week after week, month after month, where the profit really kicks in. You are doing the exact same thing at the start before you have reviews by offering them a discount. Just sweetening the deal a little bit for them.

One cool thing that has been effective for me, is offer them $25 off their first 3 bookings because it gives them an incentive to come back and still profitable for me at each booking. Find a reasonable amount you can discount that you are slightly uncomfortable with, but you can still make work and try that.

Lastly, *do not do not do* **not** get them on the phone…. then tell them to book online. When you do this, you are doing it because it is more convenient *for you*. It is more inconvenient for them, and you're giving them a chance to slip away and check out a competitor’s website and maybe book there. Walk them through and book them while you have them on the phone because your chance of closing that sale once you're off the phone with them drops dramatically.

Obviously, this is just a super brief tip of the sales iceberg overview, but this is a good first framework to use for the first 50-100 bookings.

**Day 20: Take A Break**

Yes, really.

That’s all today folks, check back in tomorrow after taking a nice walk and chilling.

**Day 21: Create A Follow-Up Sheet**

If this is your first business, then you probably suck at follow up, and if this is not your first business you may have an overly complicated system that you don’t use consistently. Totally normal, but it’s time to use a simple system that does work.

Below you can see my two-follow-up sheet that I use for my cleaning company, as well as my virtual assistant agency. It is very simple, but very powerful when followed with consistency. I will be releasing a download of the sheets as well for you soon.

📷

📷

Hopefully, it is mostly self-explanatory. But here is in brief explanation of how to use it just in case:

For follow-up calls, start using this google sheet and fill out the two follow-up sheets with a) Customers after their service and b) Leads who contact you but don’t book immediately.

Page 1 is for new leads, and Page 2 are for people who just had their first service that you want to convert into a regular.

Here is a process to follow-up with each person (we basically stop when we get a NO):

Day 1 - Call the lead at 3 different times of the day (only leave a voicemail on the third call). Shoot them a text after the first call to let them know who you are and why you are calling.

Example: ""Hey this is Sara from ABC Clean. I was just calling regarding your request for the discounted deep cleaning you want this week. Is this a good time to call?""

So, Day 1:

Call

Text (asking for permission and a time to call)

Call

Call

Voicemail Left On Last Call

Day 2:

Call

Call

Final Text Asking Them To Confirm Interest

Day 3 and beyond:

Shoot them a call or text once a day for the next week, beyond that you can let the lead rest a week then try again. It’s always worth trying old leads again in the future.

As a rule, ONLY CALL AND TEXT. No emailing unless you are responding to them. I recommend setting a specific block of time in the evening or lunch to get these done, whenever you think your customers will be available.

Basically, you want a written and categorized track record of every leads that comes to your business from every source. This will not only dramatically increase the number of bookings you get over time, but it will also be helpful when we go back and do our next rapid-fire test. You can visually see over time what sources you get the most new business from.

**Day 22: Create A List of Sales KPIs**

Ok this is the last big day on sales, then we're going to move on to the last few important things.

Last thing you need to do is get a sales structure in place by creating a list of key performance indicators (KPIs) that you will regularly update and follow. I think most of us at this point know what KPIs are, but most of us are probably *not actually* *using them* because we just think of them as this boring idea from a business class or a YouTube video.

They are Lifesavers. Here are the KPIs I recommend you start out using. Put them into Google sheet and track them once a week. If a KPI is way off target see how you can get it back on target. If one is performing particularly well see if you can do even more of that:

\-Number of leads (eg phone calls in a week)

\-% of leads that turn into a sale

\-% of one-time customers that convert into a recurring customer

\-Total adspend

\-Average booking price

\-Hottest upsell services

If you do this, you will be way ahead of people who've been in business for years and you will find yourself growing far more quickly than someone in the same business who isn’t tracking KPIs.

**Day 23: Form A Legal Entity**

This is not legal advice, but just a friendly opinion of mine. Please talk to your accountant or business advisor about incorporating and have them tell you their professional opinion.

If it were me starting over from scratch again, I would personally form an LLC right away, and get a separate business bank account from day 1. I know people who have been in business for 15 years and do not still have an LLC. I cannot tell you how nervous that makes me for them because it only takes one big accident for them to be completely screwed.

Forming an LLC only costs a couple $100 maximum and is worth the extra protection it gives you. For me personally, I would file this as soon as I possibly can. Again, this is not legal advice, this is just what I would do if I decide to start another local service business. Remember, this is what I would do if I had to start over from scratch.

**Day 24: Figure Out Your Profit Margins**

Knowing your profit margins is essential because this is going to be the key that will help you decide how much to pay your teams, how to price your services, how much you can afford to put into marketing and operations, and finally how much to pay yourself out of every $100 that you bring in.

Typically, local service businesses have a much lower profit margin than software or digital marketing businesses. Sorry, just what it is. What we have more consistent revenue and long-term customers than they do (often 10-20 year long customers!)

Brick and mortar is almost always at the bottom here because you have to pay for the physical storefront, products, equipment, rent and other necessities. Your profit margins are usually in the range of 5 at the lower end to 20% at the very high end.

A good business friend of mine used to run a very tight ship at his day spa, where they did almost a million dollars per year in revenue. Let me just say the guy is really good at business he knew how to run his day spa far better than most did, and he was still only able to get about 10 to 12% profit when he (honestly) factored in all expenses.

Most local service businesses are going to be in the 15 to 35% profit margin rate. Think of house cleaning, roofing, window washing and so on. Labour is almost always your biggest expense for this type of business.

At the higher end, certain services like exterior house painting you can get up to 50 or 55% profit margins, and I know dozens of painters who do between 45 and 55% profit margins regularly, but this is not common across niches.

You should do some serious research to find out average profit margins for your industry. I want you to join a couple Facebook groups and communities for business owners in your niche and talk to them about it, because you really need this information to know if you're doing it right to make this business worth your while.

###Create a Startup Profile

This should help to build a foundation of backlinks which you can develop over time. Search engines like websites which have lots of backlinks as this suggests they're important.

These websites allow you to either register a profile or engage with the community. It will probably not serve to increase traffic immediately, but backlinks will help the traffic flow in the future.

###Search Engine Optimisation
SEO is the process of improving the ranking of your website in search engines such as Google.

**Sitemaps** - By creating a sitemap for your website, you help search engines understand the layout of your site, location of product pages etc. You can create your own sitemap at [xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/). Once you’ve created it, add it to your root domain so it will be visible at www.yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml

**Robots.txt** - A robot.txt file helps search engines understand which pages not to index (add to the search results) such as login, backend or technical pages. Create yours here: http://tools.seobook.com/robots-txt/generator/ make sure to add it to your root domain so it will be visible at www.yourwebsite.com/robots.txt

**Analytics** - By watching how people arrive and interact with your website, you’re able to make changes and improvements. We’d recommend you install [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), it’s easy to install and comprehensive. The only issue is that it can be a little complex, so [here’s a guide](http://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/microsites/google-analytics-guide/).

**Webmaster Tools** - Whilst Google Analytics allows you to understand how people interact with your website, Google Webmaster Tools will tell you how Google interacts with your website. It can identify  and list any problems (and some awesome stats). [Check it out here](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en).

###Growth Hacks

Growth hacks are techniques that can help you to grow your business. Some companies do this very well, for example [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) who brought their initial users using Craigslist. [Check out their story here](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/airbnb). 

**Leverage dead competitors** - Your competitor exiting the market is good news in more than one way.  
1. Create a page full of content (and why you’re better) on your website about them. This way, you may start ranking for their company when people are no longer able to find them when searching.
2. Search their name and find websites that list them, then ask those websites to list you as a replacement.

**Competitions** - Run competitions via email and social media to raise awareness of your company. For example a giveaway for people who use a particular hashtag on Twitter, or perhaps give something to everyone who refers a friend. [These guys make it easy](https://gleam.io/app/competitions).

**Newsletter** - A company newsletter that is sent out to your customers serves two purposes: First, it creates a ‘top of the mind’ awareness of your brand and it can also incentivise them to purchase from you in the future. Not sure where to start? Consider using tools like Mailchimp.  Keep in mind, your customers get plenty of emails on a daily basis.  They can hit that “Unsubscribe” button or worse, have a negative association with your brand. Make it worth their while to read your newsletter.

**Blogging** - Blogging is an activity that many startups are now employing. Having a regular, high-quality blog can help bring more customers to your company and raise awareness of your brand. Additionally, it can help your brand rank well in search engines.

**Call to Action** - A CTA (*Call-to-Action*) is an instruction that requests the reader to do something. Although this isn’t a marketing activity in itself, it is something that many companies overlook. When publishing a blog article, or piece of content, always try to encourage the reader to do something. This could be to sign up to your brand, or share an article.

**Guest Posting** - Guest posting is the act of publishing articles on other blogs. This synergy helps drive potential customers to your brand and raise awareness. By offering a piece of high-quality content to other blogs, you can stand on the shoulders of giants  as their blog may have many more visitors than your own, and also gain a solid backlink to your website. [Check out our article here](http://blog.shoprocket.co/learn-how-to-boost-website-sales-part-4-guest-blogging/).

**Content Reproduction** - The Skyscraper Technique is a method of raising awareness of your brand and reputation by replicating existing content, improving it  and then republishing it.
Here’s how you do it: 
1. Go to a forum (or Google) and search for relevant terms
2. See what comes up
3. Locate a good article
4. Rewrite it, improve it or add more value
5. Publish it and promote on the same sites that link back to the original article

**Drip Email Campaign** - When potential customers visit a website such as an ecommerce store, they don’t always sign up immediately. Sometimes they  may want to think about it before they decide to sign-up or buy.

One good way of ensuring a customer doesn’t forget about you during this time, is by creating a *drip email campaign*. This is when a customer enters their email address in order to receive some sort of information. For example, you may sign up to a health website which offers a drip email campaign on ‘10 Things You Can Do to Lose Weight'. For basic drip automation, you can use a tool such as [Drip](https://www.getdrip.com/) or some email platforms offer more advanced tools.

**A/B Testing** - A/B testing (sometimes called split testing) is comparing two versions of something to see which performs better. For example, at Shoprocket, we test the copy, colours, buttons, pictures and website structure to see (and measure) what effect that has on engagement (clicks) and sign-ups. The aim of A/B testing is to send the same type of people to each page, otherwise, your results will be skewed. To do this we use, [Optimizely](http://www.optimizely.com). 

**Landing Pages** - A landing page is a single webpage which generally contains some sort of information capture form. You can [see an example here](https://www.shoprocket.co/start-selling.html). The advantage of these kinds of pages is that they often have high conversion rates (a lot of the people who sign up, end up adding their details). Here’s a guide on creating a [great landing page](http://thelandingpagecourse.com/landing-page-101-intro/
).

**Webinars** - Webinars are online video presentations. Some people such as Hubspot used them to demo their platform, others use them to offer customer service. Whatever you use it for, if you do it correctly, it can help build a relationship with your viewers. I’d recommend [Google+ Hangouts](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/2553119?hl=en-GB).

**Attending Industry Competitions** - Competitions provide an excellent method of building credibility and raising awareness of your brand. Simply keep an eye out on relevant trade publications and search on Google occasionally.

**Commenting on Blogs** - Leave relevant comments on blogs, although this is becoming an increasingly outdated method of link building, it can help you generate links to your website and if your comment is insightful, it will encourage people to click on it.

**Public Speaking** - Speaking at events can also help to raise awareness of your brand, build up credibility and potentially encourage sales. Start small by contacting low profile events via [Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/) and as your skills and content increases take on larger events.

**Run events** - Alternatively, you can also achieve the above by running events yourself. For example, Shoprocket will be running a monthly eCommerce developers Meetup in London shortly.

**Answer Questions on Quora** - [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) is a fantastic question and answer service that I use all the time. You ask a question - any question and someone answers. There’s been some really high profile answers which are part of the reason that they receive millions of hits. A great way to build credibility and traffic is to offer high-quality answers.

**Trade social media posts** - Speak to relevant organisations and ask to trade Tweets and Facebook posts.

**Watch for mentions** - Keep an eye on brand mentions around the web with [Google Alerts](https://www.google.co.uk/alerts) and [Mention](https://mention.com/en/). Get a notification whenever it finds particular keyword (such as your company’s name). Or stalk your competitors. 

**Engage with PR** -  Engage with PR more effectively by using services such as Help A Reporter Out or Twitter’s hashtags: #journorequest and #prrequest.

**Personal Emails** - Try sending out handmade personalised emails to your customers, asking them to refer you to anyone who may benefit from your product or service. Simple but effective.

**Competitor Comparison** - Create a competitor comparison page to show how your product is better than your competitors. Be careful with this one, because  if done wrong this could result in you sounding arrogant. Also, if your customer has no knowledge of your competitor, you could lose your customer to a rival!

**Post on Slideshare** - Create presentations (try using existing content as inspiration) and upload to [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/). This can help to increase brand awareness and get some backlinks.

**Email Signatures** - How many emails do you send per day? I bet it’s a lot. Don’t forget to add your website to the signature of your emails, [try this site](https://htmlsig.com/).

**Whitepapers** - Create big, comprehensive and high-quality documents and share for free. If they offer good content and have links to your site, you can generate some very effective backlinks.

**Use Influencers** - Power YouTubers and Bloggers can have millions of followers.  Leverage their influence by asking for a product review. 

###Social Media
* **Facebook** - Don’t forget to create a Facebook Page for your brand (fill out all the details and add links to your other social media profiles). Also, you can cross post good quality content to relevant Facebook groups. 

* **Twitter** - Along with your Facebook page, Twitter can broaden your outreach.  You’re not limited to 140 characters; Twitter conversation cards allows you to attach photos and videos to get your message across!
 
* **Google+** - Create a Google+ Page (supposedly Google places higher value on websites that do this).

* **LinkedIn** - Create a LinkedIn page. This is sort of a business version of Facebook

129,75iqmk,False,Lessons Learned,119,So You Want to Start Your Own Business? — 10 Invaluable Things People Never Tell You,Entrepreneur,"They say that the only way to self-mastery is by assuming absolute control over your life processes. Entrepreneurship is one of the activities that can have a massive impact in that respect. It is an activity that will not only allow you to take matters into your own hands but also reveal the essence of the words responsibility, discipline, and productivity in all its glory.

In this post, I will reveal some things that you seldom find on the headlines of famous media outlets. These are things that you learn only when you have hands-on experience in the area and you have spent days and nights trying to polish your strategies. My hope is that by revealing these things I will save you time, money, energy, regrets and unwanted conflict.

Whether you are an entrepreneur already, or you are thinking to start your own business, this article will prove invaluable along the way.

**1.ENTREPRENEURSHIP BOILS DOWN TO COMMON SENSE**

…but common sense isn’t always common practice. That’s something a former colleague of mine told me while I was working as a business consultant. This simple yet powerful remark has stayed with me, and I keep referring to it, till this very day.

The real question, however, is this: what does common sense look like and how do I know I have it?

Common sense is nothing more than good sense and sound judgment in practical matters. Some examples include:

* You can’t hire someone just because you know them. It is common sense that you need to evaluate their background and identify whether or not it fits the type of product you sell.
* You can’t look and act unprofessionally. It is common sense that if you look and act that way nobody will trust you.
* You can’t expect your sales people to improvise on how to promote your product. It is common sense that you need to train them and provide them with the necessary material.
* You need to create an accurate image of your ideal customer. It is common sense that you need to know your customers in order to find them, understand their needs and target them accordingly.

I will elaborate on most of these and some more below.

Additionally, you identify common sense by detaching yourself from your ego and by stepping into your customer’s shoes.

When you start your own business, you are blinded by your ego. It is the same feeling you get when you have your first child. Your business is your baby. You have an idea of how to raise it, but because it is your “possession” you can’t see things objectively, oftentimes reverting to unorthodox practices and behaviors. Even if you do things wrong, you are convinced that you do things right.
 
Most of business owners fall into this trap and therefore suffer dramatically.

I understand that when you do things wrong and you eventually have to face potential change, more often than not, you develop resistance towards change. That’s because of laziness and because of fear of change. You aren’t sure what to expect and you don’t know if the required change (which will certainly require time and money investment) will yield the expected returns.

Well, I can assure you that if things aren’t going as planned, change is the surest way to go. To quote Albert Einstein:

> “Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”

**2.YOUR IDEA IS WORTH NOTHING AND TRACTION IS EVERYTHING**

Two years ago, I attended an amazing entrepreneurship conference called Pioneers Festival. One of the speakers was Philipp Moehring from Angelist who gave a prodigious speech on what investors look for when they evaluate your company. In one of his slides, he mentioned that your idea is worth close to nothing.

That is something incredibly important to grasp. Your idea, no matter how innovative you think it is, no matter how interesting it sounds in your head, no matter how much research you have put into it, is worth nothing.

If your team is not great, if your execution is not close to perfect, if you haven’t properly identified your niche, if you don’t understand your customer’s needs, the idea is worth nothing.

Which brings us to the most important part when it comes to product and business evaluations: **Traction**.

If your product is converting, if it is generating revenue and if it is attracting interest, it is a great product.

Do me a favor and watch Shark Tank. You will notice how the eyes of the sharks shine whenever the entrepreneur mentions good numbers in the users acquired or sales accumulated over the past year. Regardless of the industry or type of product.

Great investors know that once your product generates traction and reaches product-market fit, it has the potential to become a gold mine.

The reason I stress the importance of this is because some wannapreneurs have two bad habits:

* Are secretive about their ideas.
* Give insane evaluations to their companies when they are actually worth nothing.

So, the main principle here is that, in the beginning, you have to assume that you know nothing and that your idea is worth nothing.
Now you are more humble and you can make sure that you will focus on the fundamentals of your business.

**3.IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU THAT BRANDING ISN’T IMPORTANT, RUN AWAY**

I have heard people on the Internet suggest that as far as your product is great, your branding doesn’t matter.
This is wrong and dangerous. When someone tells you that, they are either ignorant or they are leaving a lot of money on the table.

The reason is twofold:

* Humans are visual creatures. We are attracted to aesthetically pleasing views and we will always favor something beautiful to something ugly.
* Every successful salesman and marketing person will tell you that most buyers are impulsive. They don’t always buy something because they need it, but more because they are convinced that they need it. Part of that convincing is how the product looks.

That said, I am not suggesting that it is ok for your product to be average and that you should spend most of your time on marketing and branding.

What I suggest, is that you should spend an equal amount of time on creating a great product and on promoting it successfully.

Great branding makes your product look professional and people can trust you easier.

Every product out there has to face competition. Successful branding is one of the surest ways to make your product stand out.

**4.NETWORKING IS PROBABLY 50% OF SUCCESS**

You will hear a lot of people stress out the importance of networking in business success, but you can’t really understand that importance if you don’t experience it first hand.

I am going to demonstrate this importance with a simple analogy. Imagine you are Super Mario. You fight turtles, you spit fire, you eat mushrooms and want to save the princess. At some point, you find a magic star that makes you invulnerable for a small time frame. That magic star is networking.

Without the magic star, you struggle a lot. You face a lot of obstacles and difficulties. You need to try different approaches and tactics in order to reach the end of the game. With the magic star, nobody can touch you. You actually kind of bulldoze your way to success.

Networking allows you to meet the right people and these people feel obliged to help you if you were introduced to them by someone they trust and respect.

Now, this is good in theory but practically it is quite arduous because it requires a lot of effort and great social skills. There are some great books that explain how it is done, like the seminal “Never eat alone” by Keith Ferrazzi, but most of them repeat the same advice:

* Put yourself out there
* “Ping” constantly
* Be generous (buy people drinks, dinners etc.)
* Make it more about them and less about you
* Leverage social media for exposure

In that respect, I want to add one more thing: **Do not consider networking unless you have made a lot of progress with your product development.**

If you are just starting and you have just an idea, going to networking events is a waste of time. You might listen to some successful people promote their story and you might get some interesting feedback, but, most probably, you will end up disappointed because no one will be interested in you.

Make sure that you focus on creating a great product and once you see the first signs of traction, you will be in a position to promote it.

**5.WORK ONLY WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFESSIONAL**

Professionalism and delivery will help you stand out. It is absurd how many businesses are leaving money on the table because of their inability to exude professionalism.

In the trade business I run, our operations are in Greece at the moment. Some of the companies I decided to contact, in order to buy raw material and other services for my product, dumbfounded me with their lack of professionalism. I wanted to make really big orders, way bigger than what they usually get, and instead of treating me with utmost respect they lacked enthusiasm and oftentimes they didn’t even respond to emails. There is nothing worse than that when it comes to business.

Jordan Belford mentions a similar incident in “Straight Line Persuasion System” about a time he visited a Porsche Dealership. He was very excited about buying a new car and when he starting discussing with the dealer he got turned off because he was unable to make him feel sure about what he was buying.

So, if you really want to stand out, make sure to:

* Respond promptly
* Be polite
* Over-deliver
* Offer competitive prices

**6.WHEN HIRING PEOPLE, DO THE BEER TEST**

A couple of weeks ago, I attended a startup event. Among the presenters was a company that developed a platform that helps consumers find the cheapest price of a product online.

They are a very successful company and they stand out because of their incredible work environment. That, however, didn’t happen to them accidentally. Hiring the right people is a very challenging endeavor and many companies face extreme problems because of that.

What the representative of this company suggests is that, when hiring, you should do the beer test. What this means in simple words is this:

Ask yourself. If you go out for a beer with this person, will you have a good time?

Does this person show empathy? Can they listen? Can they contribute? Are they open minded? How do they handle criticism? Are they eager to learn? Can they stay cool under pressure?

All these are extremely critical and when coupled with a solid work ethic, you found the perfect match for your hire.

**7.THE BEGINNING IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART AND PREPARATION WILL SAVE YOU TIME**

Your beginning will be borderline suffering. You will be really enthusiastic and everything, but once you realize how overwhelming the processes of entrepreneurship can be, you will start having second thoughts.

That’s why what I suggest to people who have no previous experience in the area is to invest some time upfront in studying the subject. There are a ton of online courses on entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, management, coding etc. out there. With so much free knowledge, the world is your oyster.

Also, read some great entrepreneurship books to see what others faced before you. My two favorite ones are:

* Zero to one
* The hard thing about hard things

They both focus on technology startups, but the lessons suggested are universal.

Before I quit my day job as a business consultant, I spent almost a year reading and studying entrepreneurship. I still didn’t have a good idea of what this new world really is. I understood it when I actually started being “in business.”

However, when you start working on your project, make sure to focus primarily on getting things done. Don’t inundate your schedule with podcasts and blogs and social media. You will lose your ability to focus and your performance will suffer dramatically.

If you have a concrete work ethic in place that is characterized by discipline, flow immersion and time management, everything will work out fine.

Until your launch everything will be vague and uncertain, but after your launch you will get a good idea of what works and what doesn’t in order to make the necessary adjustments and corrections.

You will soon realize that after you spend some time “living” your product, you will feel that you “own” its processes and some things will work automatically. This is the best time because it is then when you can actually focus on profitability and sustainability.

**8.SHARE YOUR JOURNEY BECAUSE THAT INCREASES ENGAGEMENT**

This is a pro tip and something that has helped companies enjoy tremendous growth.

Sharing your journey allows your clients or customers to get an insider’s view of your business. It demonstrates that you are transparent and confident about your product and culture and it makes you look interesting and approachable.

There are many people who have attempted this successfully, but I will mention here the most interesting ones:

**Space X**

Elon Musk is a master at this. In space X for instance, he sells the journey impeccably.

Space X emphasizes on the journey. A journey almost everybody wants to take part in.

Additionally, their events are astonishing and the enthusiasm of their followers is palpable.

**Gary Vaynerchuk**

Gary Vaynerchuk is a social media influencer and motivator with a huge following. He does a great job sharing his journey and simultaneously educating his following on marketing, branding and business matters.

Even the Kardashians do that effectively. You might think that their personalities and attitude are unorthodox and silly, but there are millions of people out there who approve it and enjoy the fact that they can have a sneak peek into their lives.

**9.DON’T WASTE TIME IN IRRELEVANT STUFF — ALWAYS STRIVE FOR PRODUCT-MARKET FIT**

There is usually a huge confusion when people start.

As I mentioned before, there are many things to be done and you oftentimes lose track of what really matters.

There are usually two methods that can determine a great start to your business.

**The Japanese method**

Japanese people are notorious for their proactivity and preparation. The Japanese method is inspired by the Japanese mentality and suggests that before your launch you should spend significant time making the first version of your product great and your branding professional.

Bear in mind that you should choose that method when you are very confident that your product can stand out. You can evaluate that when you have identified a certain gap in a big market.

Maybe you live in a developing country and you can bring a technology or product that is a big hit elsewhere around the world.
Or maybe you think that the products in a specific market aren’t that competitive and you can build something better.

**The beta method**

If your idea is something quite innovative, test it in a small segment of the market first.

Find a group of people who might be interested in the idea and pitch it to them.

For instance, go to a subreddit or a forum and ask people what they think about your idea. If you get an overwhelmingly positive response, design a prototype or beta version and give it away for free so people can test it.

If people like it, you have established the potentiality for a great product or service. Now it’s up to your mentality and execution if it will become successful.

**10.IT WILL BE THE MOST DIFFICULT THING YOU WILL EVER DO IN YOUR LIFE**

It includes risk. It includes losing money. It includes losing friends. It includes losing your mind.

A lot of people will question you, a lot of people will envy you and a lot of people will admire you.

At the end of the day, none of that matters.

The reason you decided to start your own business should be unaffected by external influence. Maybe you do it because it is challenging and because it gives your life more meaning. Maybe you do it because you want to make money and you think that money can buy you some freedom. Maybe you do it because you don’t like having a boss and you want to be your own boss.

Be clear about your reasoning. Clear reasoning leads to clarity of intent and this makes your progress smoother.

And make sure to read the following quote by the great Charles Bukowski every day:

> “If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.”

These are, in my opinion, the most critical elements to consider when starting a company.

If you want to correct me or add more value to my ideas feel free to comment.

442,858abx,False,Best Practices,253,Gary Vee - Mentor or Distraction?,Entrepreneur,"I've noticed a lot of Gary Vee (GV) fan boys in this sub. 

GV sells motivational entertainment. He plays the trendy music, spits out some power words and talks down to his viewers/customers as if he's very authoritative on whatever hype he just delivered - he is his own proof after-all.

At this point in his life, he's a showman. He builds powerfully passionate, and hyper rants and then tries reversing it with very soft and paternal injection later in order to build your levels of trust. It's all based on psychological triggers.

This is different from saying, hey, i offer these services and this is how its done, breaking everything down at a technical level. He doesn't, won't and can't.

Instead he puffs his listeners up and turns around saying, ""ok, now go an build the thing and crush it!"" 

But guess what? You can't and don't, as the information delivered was with such a broad stroke that it's unable to be applied by his listeners. 

Those listeners are wasting time listening to other peoples' so called pain points and remedies, though are rarely beneficial to your needs. 

The advice he offers to those directly, lacks the details to be helpful either; but don't look too closely, it will ruin his glow.

Metaphorically, his videos are as helpful as a toddler helping in the kitchen.

But he makes the listeners so happy. The psychological trigger is strong.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqWC58PgypE

There is a great deal of emphasis on his superficial behavior (success and lifestyle appearance), designed to keep peoples minds distracted and attracted to the idea of building their own momentum and building themselves to also being like him. This is a common technique to give people a false sense of purpose and meaning, and works well with those who are struggling with low self esteem and is often accompanied by low motivation. 

Of course there is also the issue of not wanting to admit that they are being taken advantage of, so many folks will fiercely insist that these types of videos have somehow helped them and will do anything to defend their idols.

His target audience consists largely of people who fall into the following loop:

1. Anon doesn't want to work for anyone else, but what is the alternative? he'll start a business!
2. Anon doesn't know what it will be yet, its early; ""it's his plan'n phase"".
3. A week goes by and still nothing - it's ok though, he's consuming ""content"" and ""learning"". Apparently he needs to solve a problem - that's interesting, right, who knew? Thankfully he's still planning.
4. Another week goes by: jeepers! he can't believe there are no problems he's able to solve, how's he supposed to start a business without any problems, the world seems to have perfected itself. To make matters worse, he is running out of money! He probably shouldn't have quit his job.
5. A month goes by and now he's dedicated; he's watching only entrepreneur videos on youtube, he's taking action! But motivation is getting lower.
6. He's stopped keeping track of time now. He needs a break, it's getting exhausting.
7. Motivation has reached an all time low. Anon can't eat, he needs a job.
8. Anon gets a job.
9. Anon doesn't want to work for anyone else... and so the cycle repeats.

If this hits too close to home for any of you, then you really should figure out whether or not you are perhaps chasing a fantasy and not taking real and measurable steps to starting a non-romanticised business.

Influencers like GV fuel the fantasy of desire and make the process of building a business attractive - that's their business and it's how they make money. Don't get caught up in this. 

If you need the inspiration then there are better and less distracting sources that allow you to get in, get out and go back to the execution of YOUR business plan; without giving you a false sense of achievement.

As an aspiring business operator, you shouldn't be attempting to study entrepreneurship 
as a whole, instead you should be studying the concise skills relevant to your business as you require them. 

Anything else is wasting time.

No one cares about how to do internet marketing, when they don't actually understand how a business works.

**Edit 3:  Goodness everyone, the reception has been tremendous.  Tons of ordinary everyday business owners have reached out and I'm already close to filling up spots for the first 6 episodes.  I'm going to try to ride the momentum pretty hard here and get this done ASAP.  Expected launch date before Dec 1st, 2016, but I will keep everyone signed up for the launch announcement notified.  Along with a teaser of the businesses, which you can join at the link above.  Thank you all soooo much!!!!  So cool!**

Businesses like:

-- day care centers

-- spas

-- towing companies

-- music equipment stores

-- piano making companies 

-- drug rehab centers

-- cleaning companies 

-- power washing companies

Companies that people don't think are sexy but that make a ton of money!  These are real businesses that real people really use on a daily basis that do amazingly well.  Essential products and services that people on /r/entrepreneur seem to never think about. 

I'm so sick of this inspirational ""follow your passion"" crap.  I want to expose how businesses actually work.

My goal is to show everyone how similar businesses can be to each other, and how different.  I want to show that there are certain skills, techniques, and practices that almost all businesses use to work successfully -- so expect to learn them as a business owner.  And I want to show specifically how each of these types of businesses operates.  Detailed, technical, specific content about how these businesses succeed.  And detailed content about what they need help with (and maybe, how you could help).

**Fellow Reddit Entrepreneurs: would interviews with real profitable small-business owners, exposing their start, and their operations, be interesting to you?**

I'm thinking of starting with 6 episodes.  I will talk about my two businesses, a friend who runs a successful real estate rental business, and the rest are unknown.  

**ABOUT ME / DO I WALK THE WALK**

I've started two extremely profitable businesses that I managed from my computer with my business partner.  Yes, they use internet technology.  Yes they are ""online"" but NO they are not just ""internet marketing"" and NO, they are not bullshit information products ""teaching"" you how to make money online.  I hate that shit, deeply.  I hate the lifestyle marketing, ""here in my garage"" bullshit deeply.  

The first one is an SEO-based lead gen website for drug rehab centers.  It's earned up to 93k/month and brings in a steady 10k/month with 0 work now.  Literally, the only thing I do each month is send an invoice email.  We took over a failing venture backed company when I was 22 and turned it around in 14 months.  I'm 29 and 7 years later it's still doing great.

Our second business is an insurance billing service.  We also earn 10k/month.  That was bootstrapped less than 30 months ago, and it takes about 10-20 hours per week, now, mostly of management.  We expect to get to 5 hours per week of pure management by year 5.

Don't get it twisted.  Your first year you will be working too much.  Uncomfortably too much.  I'm showing you where you can get to, and I want to detail how hard it can be, emotionally mostly, to get there too.  (Teaser: it's a lonely thing to do unless you cover that base outside of 'work').

Lifestyle points:  I manage them both from wherever I want.  Today I'm in Tallinn Estonia.  Tomorrow I'll be headed to Krakow, Poland.  I've recently spent 6 months in Medellin, Colombia, two in Bogota, and weeks in NYC, Las Vegas, Lake Atitlan Guatemala, among a few great places.  

I want to emphasize that the lifestyle I live isn't necessary to do what I have done -- I'm not into lifestyle marketing, rather I'm into the *freedom* that being a business owner gives you.  You could be doing great and also stay in your city or move to the country with a bunch of land.  I just choose to use the freedom I've earned to travel, read, write, and compulsively shit on noobs in /r/entrepreneur for fun.  

Again, please let me know if these interviews sound interesting -- I'm asking because I love talking ""business"" in this way, so it's interesting to me.  No plan to monetize it, just a for fun, giving back project -- I have to do something with my time.  

I'm not interested in interviewing people who say ""be obsessed"" or ""quit school and follow your passion"" or other bullshit advice that's out there.  I want to talk *real businesses with real business owners who have earned freedom through creating a profitable, not-super-sexy company*.  

Please let me know your impressions!  

Thanks!!!

Edit:  Folks, I'm floored by the positive reception of this idea!  I'm gonna do it!!  

If any of you would fit the bill (200k+ in profit / year that you take home, small biz) please feel free to reach out.  If you know someone who would be a great guest, please do so as well.  

I'm stoked! :)

What's up reddit?  

Have been really busy with a ton of projects but I've decided to document how I start a new business venture from scratch.  This will not be a Tai Lopez knowledge episode, I once watched a full hour worth of video of his and didn't understand what he was teaching or talking about, I think he likes to go in circles over and over again.  That's what bothers me, repeating how to be successful without actual tips and walk through's is just not my cup of tea.

If you're coachable and have the desire to learn, you can do what I show you.  It'll be in easy steps on what I did, how much I spent, who I called, what ever was necessary to launch my business and to getting that very first customer.  This will be retail based which I'll push for online at a later time.  I'll be sharing sensitive data including costs, profits, total revenue, etc... this will be the guide of the century because I have not seen anything like it at all.  I want to be as transparent and clear as possible in every step I take in getting my business launched.  

The business will be about starting a phone/computer repair store.  Something I had always wanted to do but never got involved in.  From negotiating the lease, to store build out, establishing a brand, equipment, training, hiring, marketing, losses and gains, lawyers, etc.. etc...  all will be in plain sight for you to see.  Once done, we can then repeat the process over and over again and franchise out.  

I will keep in mind that many people are on a tight budget, I'll make sure we find the best ways to be cost effective as well.  Look forward to my post tomorrow and I look forward to helping you be successful.  We'll also do internet projects as well down the line.  Almost time to break fast, see you all tomorrow!

Basically, I want to create a series of free daily 60-90 second video tutorials that essentially distill SEO topics into short actionable videos.

These would probably be for a set period of time (e.g. 3 months) and I'd probably create one video per day, 5 days a week. Some videos would be quick actionable tips, while for the more in-depth tactics, the content could simply be spread out over the period of a week-or-so.

I know there's a wealth of SEO knowledge of there, but it usually comes in the form of lengthy in-depth blog posts that are often difficult to put into practice, at least without a significant time investment.

P.S. I think it might be cool to focus solely on link building strategies and tactics, as I'm sure this is the primary area that most site owners struggle with. I think on-site SEO is pretty straightforward to learn from other resources.

249,7rxpn1,False,Startup Help,80,How I funded my restaurant cleaning business and started earning $1000 per night.,Entrepreneur,"Everyone wants to know how I got the money to buy all of my tools and vehicle's for my business.  One time my step mom asked if she could get a government grant to help her start her own similar business, and wondered if thats what I did.  On another occasion my uncle said that I have had more money than he did, and thats why I was successful and he was unemployed, and if he had my money he would start a cleaning business too.

But the truth is, I started my business with no money at all.  I'm not special, lots of people do this. You probably already know that you can start a business with no money, because if you're reading this you already have a business, or you know a lot about financing from this Subreddit or other resources.  But [I made a video](https://youtu.be/o80-Y1832gc) that talks about how I was able to start my business when I was broke as shit. The video is ten minutes, which could be annoying but I kinda like the longer format as it allows me to explain things in more detail.

If you cant watch the video right now, its essentially me on a job-site, talking about how I wrote contracts that allowed me to use customer equipment, or how I would get the customers to buy my equipment before I did the jobs. When I did eventually buy my own gear, I would buy used from craigslist and that allowed me to have a low break even point and start pulling in a small profit right from day one.

Anyway, if money is stopping you from becoming self employed, I know its frustrating but it might be possible to get started for less than you think.

Edit: I'm off to bed, I was up all night working and making that video. If you comment, I'll reply when I wake up later today.  Again, I'm going to ask even though I probably shouldn't, if you got any value out of my video would you mind subscribing to my YouTube channel?

109,8brjty,False,,179,"I replaced my Phone Number with a ""Call Me Back"" button on my Ecommerce Store. This was the result:",Entrepreneur,"Update: I made a followup to this post here about the lessons learned from the first few stores who installed and what we learned from them: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8n0zex/reddit_helped_get_the_first_few_installs_of_my/
----------------

OK so about 2 months ago I removed the phone number field on my Shopify store with a ""call me back"" button. When a visitor to the website clicked that button, they would be able to enter their phone number and choose which method they'd like to be contacted back (either SMS, WhatsApp or Phone call). From here, I would get an email alerting me about the call back request (later I added a Facebook Messenger bot, so then I got an auto messenger alert with the phone number too).

----------------
EDIT: Since the post has gotten positive feedback I thought I'd share the link to the button app I created (you can see it was shared originally in the final Result point below: https://apps.shopify.com/raven) end edit...
----------------

**Here are the main reasons why I made the switch:**

1. I didn't want my customers waiting on the phone. Many times I'm not available to take the call, so I didn't want a customer to call and then go to voicemail, during which time they might go to a competing website. So with this, once they submit their info, I assumed they would wait for the call back and not need to continue searching elsewhere.

2. I could save the phone numbers. Before the button, a customer would have to pick up their own phone and dial me, and I didn't have a system in place to save those phone numbers to follow up with later, for example. But when a customer submits their number then I can store it, and I like that. It gives me the option to create an SMS mailing list, for example, if I wanted to do that in the future. In addition to this, I also wanted to store on which URL's of my page the phone calls were coming in from. When someone pressed ""call me back"" and submitted their phone for me I could also store which page they were on so I know what they were interested in.

3. Email is dying. Kind of related to point #2 above. My email open rates were dropping like a rock, so I wanted to collect some other form of contact information. I had read that SMS open rates are 95%, where as with Email it's considered good to have 30%. Additionally, when someone wants an answer to a question they want to talk to someone, not sign up for a never ending wave of spam email. The 'contact us' form also didn't do the trick, because it takes ages for someone to reach out to me, so I can understand why others wouldn't want to use that on my website. Usually someone just wants a quick response. Also, the live chat widget on the website. If I'm not online (as a small business this is often since I have so many others things to do) then my visitor is sitting there waiting forever. I had a huge problem with this with Facebook Messenger. I had the Messenger chat button on my website before, but FB would never alert me when someone answered, so I had no idea anyone messaged unless I logged into my business page and looked for it - which again I don't have time to do as frequently as required to make it worthwhile.

**This was the result:**

1. Within the first week, I had made an extra $420 in sales. I know this to be true because since I saved the phone numbers, and I made phone numbers required on my checkout process, I could cross-check which phone calls resulted in a sale.

2. My revenue per call back request was just over $50. So anytime I got a call me back request alert, that was basically worth like $50 in sales to me, so of course I was going to call that person back right away. I basically started calculating the total number of converted sales made (where the customer left their phone number and had requested a call back to that phone number) divided by the number of phone calls requested.

3. Even though I offered SMS and WhatsApp requests, most people still used the Call feature. I thought that was interested, I thought more people would request an SMS back or WhatsApp back given our chat-based culture these days, but that wasn't true. I guess people want to speak with someone before opening their wallet to also ""size them up"" and evaluate if they want to do business with you? Not sure yet on this one...

4. The number of phone calls went up, compared to when a customer had to manually call themselves. I noticed that the increase in calls were actually sales related. Whereas before my phone number was really only being used by existing customers to do post-sale support. With the ""call me back"" button I was getting a much higher percentage of just generally interested customers wanting more information before making their purchase. The increase in calls was very very welcome, because I believe the phone call is the best way to develop a relationship and establish brand awareness (it's an uninterrupted 5-10 minutes with an interested customer).

5. I got a message back from one of my visitors saying the ""call me back"" feature was the best customer support experience he's ever had. He ended up buying almost $180 in products from me. Because of the auto-alerts I had set up for myself, I was able to call him back within 2 minutes.

6. I started getting less spam phone calls from telemarketers. Honestly before that, I don't know why, I would get like 3-4 phone calls from robot voice telemarketers pitching small business services. When I made the switch to the call back button, that scaled down dramatically, I only get about 1 per day now.

7. I learned that people have more variety of questions than I thought. Before I had a mental assumption that my customer base has maybe 4 FAQs (warranty, assembly, shipping time, and return policy) - but on teh phone I realized it's so much more. People were asking about whether it was Child Friendly, or Senior Citizen friendly. People asked about the materials used in manufacturing, where it was made. Also questions about bulk pricing if they wanted to buy 10 of them! So yeah, it was just really cool that I was able to learn more about my business and my market when I was on the phone with people.

8. I decided to publish the feature as an app for other merchants to also use, since I had so much success with it on my store. It's called ""Raven Call Back Request"" and it's listed on the Shopify App store. There is a free plan, which I think most small businesses would fall under, so most likely it'll be free for most.

Here are the 6 tips:

**1. Nix big meetings**

""Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get \[out\] of all large meetings, unless you're certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.""

**2.Ditch frequent meetings too**

""Also get rid of frequent meetings, unless you are dealing with an extremely urgent matter. Meeting frequency should drop rapidly once the urgent matter is resolved.""

**3.Leave a meeting if you're not contributing**

""Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren't adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.""

**4.Drop jargon**

""Don't use acronyms or nonsense words for objects, software or processes at Tesla. In general, anything that requires an explanation inhibits communication. We don't want people to have to memorize a glossary just to function at Tesla.""

**5.Communicate directly, irrespective of hierarchy**

""Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the 'chain of command'. Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere.

""A major source of issues is poor communication between depts. The way to solve this is allow free flow of information between all levels. If, in order to get something done between depts, an individual contributor has to talk to their manager, who talks to a director, who talks to a VP, who talks to another VP, who talks to a director, who talks to a manager, who talks to someone doing the actual work, then super dumb things will happen. It must be ok for people to talk directly and just make the right thing happen.""

**6.Follow logic, not rules**

""In general, always pick common sense as your guide. If following a 'company rule' is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation, such that it would make for a great Dilbert cartoon, then the rule should change.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8dyl44/elon_musks_6_productivity_rules_from_a_letter_he/,969,I love this! ,2018-04-21 21:01:16

let me just begin by saying that this is not a brag post. This will be a running blog to hopefully inspire others who may be in the same position as we were and also give a bit of insight into our operation. Hopefully we can learn something from some of the other entrepreneurs on here.

Lets get the formalities out of the way:

1) What is your product or service ? We run a carpet and upholstery cleaning company called Carpet Tech (www.carpet-tech.com.au) in Sydney, Australia. We are mostly in the domestic market but lately have been expanding into the commercial market more and more.

2) What motivated you to start a business ?  Change of perspective on life.

3) How long have you been working on your start-up ? A little over a year.

4) What is your one year plan ? Five year plan ? We currently have a 3 year plan in place with three main goals. Keep our growth rate,   grow in the commercial market and start making inroads to the flood restoration market.

5) Most memorable experience and negative experience. Memorable has nothing to do with business, but having the financial freedom and time to enjoy the first year of my sons life. Negative would be going through the process of repairing one of our mistakes at a customers house. It was a fantastic learning curve but at the time it was very stressful.

6) If you could travel back in time, what advice would you give yourself. Don't undervalue yourself or your time.



Backstory:

Around two years ago, I was finishing up my Criminology degree at a very average university in Sydney. I always held a job since the age of 18, including working at Hungry Jacks, as a personal trainer, fruit shop attendant, pamphlet delivery, pizza delivery driver. During my university life I worked as a security guard(read bouncer) at various nightclubs and events. A lot of people would be embarrassed at such work experience and so was I for a while. Only now can I look back and reflect on all the fantastic things I learned in those workplaces. Working in security really shaped my perception of life and work in general, it gave me a window into the world that I did not want to be a part of. Most importantly, it gave me ample time to think and devise business ideas.

Owning a business always intrigued me however I was always the - I'll do it later in my life. A career should come first - That's what my parents drilled into me anyway. I am Ukrainian by birth, however my parents emigrated here in 1995. Dad was an engineer and mum was a childcare worker, however being fresh migrants with no understanding of English, they became a fruit shop attendant and sandwich hand, respectively. Since coming here they have both, without fail, worked 10-12 hour days, 6-7 days a week. Only through the quantity of hours, rather the quality of their pay did they provide me with a decent life with every opportunity - a lot of which I sometimes took for granted. This is something that I regret to this day and hope to make up to them.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago. I was finishing up my degree, wanting to get into a criminal justice institution. NSW Police had a backlog of applicants with no recruitment date set. After applying for various agencies, I struck gold by getting through the first round by the Australian Federal Police. I was stoked, it was honestly one of the best days of my life - probably because I was so used to getting so many rejection e-mails. I proceeded with the application, which was really time consuming (4000 application going into roughly 50-70 places). Start-acceptance usually takes a year or even longer. I reached the  last stage of recruitment, in which you had to travel to the ACT for a formal interview and some testing. Something about that day did not feel right from the beginning, just didn't feel in the zone. When I got there, mastering all the confidence I could reach, I was really nervous (a by product of such a long time culminating into one important day). Everything went fine until I got into the interview. It was a panel interview and I buckled. I'm usually very cool in interviews and build good rapport with the interviewers. However, they got me hard at the start, which made me lose a bit of confidence and I never really recovered. I guess that is a technique that they use. I drove home that day replaying the interview over and over in my head, still hoping that the other testing will somehow gloss over it. Deep down though, I knew I failed. Next week consisted of a lot of soul searching.

Oh, one thing I should probably mention - my wife was 3 months pregnant at the time.

The rejection hit me hard and I did start to get a bit nervous. We are not big spenders and never had any problem with money however we did purchase a decent property in Sydney 2 years prior. My wife was making decent money as a teacher and I was making ok money from working security. Australia has generous maternity leave laws, especially for teachers so I suppose we did get lucky in a way that our income was covered for the next 9 months.


Idea created.
I was slowly exploring career options with end goal of starting my own business - butcher, importing etc. I applied to a couple of them to no avail. One day by chance, we decided to clean our carpets to get them ready for the baby's arrival. I called someone from Gumtree (Australian equivalent of Craigslist) and found someone willing to do it for 115 (2 bedroom unit). The gentleman on the phone didn't sound very professional and sent me a confirmation text using poor  grammar. Just a carpet cleaner, don't care, as long as he cleans well.

On the day, a scruffy looking guy turns up in an unmarked van, with no uniform and after a pleasant chat about sport, began his process. I watched for a few minutes, seemed legit, then went out on the balcony to stay out of his way. To my surprise, 25 minutes later, he was finished. Seemed to do all the areas, looked ok (I had no idea what a good clean looks like). I helped him with his stuff downstairs and then went to pay him. To my surprise I received a generic Tax invoice for 135$, when quizzed about the change in price he stated it was for the fact that he had to go up 2 sets of stairs. All good, it's only $20. Not worth the argument. I went back upstairs and while waiting for the carpets to dry, I was trying to figure out what exactly I paid for. How, did this man, with seemingly no professionalism, get $135 for less than an hour of actual work ? So I did a bit of research into the industry.
Unregulated industry ? Check. Low start-ups cost ? Check. 

Next day, I applied to a few carpet cleaning jobs. I never told my parents or my wife. I mean it was still a bit embarrassing to me. To my surprise, I got a call from a local Chem-dry franchise offering me an interview. A week later, I had a carpet cleaning job. Crap, how am I going to explain to everyone that I'm pursuing a career in carpet cleaning ? So again, I lied to my wife and parents and said I was helping out a mate from my footy club with his business. I worked carpet cleaning during the week and security at night, trying to save some cash. I'm not going to speak too much about the Chem-Dry operation, only that I learned exactly what NOT to do when it came to the actual carpet cleaning. Luckily for me, the owner was a very switched on individual and I learned a lot from him, in terms of business.

After 6 months and a month after the birth of my son (Jackson, just like the song by Mr.Cash), I announced to my wife and parents that I am going to be starting my own carpet cleaning business. To my surprise they were very supportive, if they were sceptical they never showed it (only a month ago, I found out how sceptical they were). I handed in my resignation to my boss at Chem-Dry, I didn’t tell him that I was going out and running my own gig. I’m pretty sure he knew but didn’t say it. I’m not a confrontational person so I never initiated contact about it. The whole time I worked for him, I was never unethical and I never so much as approached any of his clients with the intention of stealing them. I always gave 100% and tried to provide the best results despite a very limited process.

The Start.
I had roughly 10k in capital and I slowly started to undertake the first steps of creating the business, during my last few months at Chem-Dry. Registration, website development, buying equipment. I could only afford an old beat up van with 330000km on the clock. I bought it for 3000, the body was straight. I sent it to the shop to get wrapped which cost a further 1800. So more than half of my budget was essentially gone. I had no equipment. I went out and bought an extractor and a rotary buffer, both used for 3500. For some reason I bought a brand new vacuum (LOL in hindsight) for 600.
All the rest of the money went to buy all the little small bits like chemicals, small tools, etc.
By the way, at this point I never performed a hot water extraction prior to this, as Chem-Dry was exclusively doing dry-cleaning using a buffer.
Continued in next post
My idea was to create an illusion of a big successful company with numerous techs and vans. I needed validation. I wanted to look professional prior to entering a clients house. I think this was more of my lack of confidence rather than anything else. My wife was on maternity leave, so I put her in charge of the phones (she had zero idea about carpet cleaning, just a rough guide which I written out). To her credit in the coming months she took it upon herself to learn and became a superstar on the phone.
My first job couldn’t go anymore wrong. I cleaned some upholstery and failed to identify a water damaged ottoman which proceeded to rip. The owner was working in another room and I paced around the room trying to figure out what I was going to do or say. I honestly thought about throwing it away, just paying her the money for the damage and looking for jobs when I get home. I finally stopped and convinced myself that this may be the greatest lesson in customer service that I can learn. I went and got the client, admitted guilt and went through all the options with her including free cleaning of other furniture, paying for the damage etc. To my surprise, she accepted the offer to clean another sofa. That taught me a very important lesson – honesty and integrity will always hold you in a strong position in the eyes of a customer.
The following month was spent doing the odd job here and there, getting lucky with adwords and other ways of advertising but making just enough to get by. I was still working security to make ends meet. I was in a tough position because the money I got from the business, I needed to spend on advertising to get more job, so essentially even though I was making money, it was all going. I made a lot of marketing mistakes, namely with google adwords. Some, pretty costly at the time.
The breakthrough happened a few months later. I was awakened at 11pm by a phone call from a distressed lady begging that I come fix a big paint spill because they have an inspection the next day. With my eyes half closed I accepted and made my way over there. I was still inexperienced and I got pretty lucky with the stain. It was huge but I laboured for over two hours on that thing. While I’m working, I noticed this lady was taking photos but didn’t think too much of it. She and her husband were lovely. 
Next morning my wife woke me up, saying that we had close to 8 phone calls asking for quotes (prior to that we were lucky to receive 2 phone calls a week). It turns out, that lady was taking pictures to post on facebook all while giving us enormous praises. We converted all 8 phone calls and made over $1200 that week. Unprecedented. That taught me my next lesson, every individual job’s value is not the ticket price but all the tickets that could result, if you do a great job.
Slowly, the phone calls and emails increased and we were trying to go above and beyond on every job. I mean we were coming back to redo jobs which we knew wouldn’t get better because we had the time and we wanted the customer to be happy. Although in some cases I couldn’t produce the results that more experienced carpet cleaners could, I made sure I worked my ass off on the customer service. A smile, politeness and honesty carry you a long way. If something was out of my expertise I referred the work out and they appreciated that honesty. I made no money from that, I just wanted a result for them. I think they could see that, as many came back to us later.
I would work a few jobs a day, come home and chill with my family and read carpet cleaning content online till I fell asleep. This became the norm. I loved it. There is so much information on the internet, I honestly learned all of my craft for free, which is why I have no qualms about helping others, even if they are in the same market. We can co-exist together. I still worked a bit of security as we were re-investing most of the money. We upgraded all out equipment to a point where we were looking more professional by the day. Uniforms, website, chemicals, we were upgrading everything. I got better and more confident. I finally felt like a professional and it helped my demeanour and anxiety tremendously. I networked with all the local guys, referred jobs when needed. They really helped me with some great advice.
Our weekly income was averaging on 2000, which seemed decent at the start, but when you try to grow, it’s not really that much at all. Work, physically was starting to get hard. I didn’t mind though. I used to work 12hours in security for the same amount that I earned in 2 hours. I trialled a few helpers with the intention of turning them into full time employees but my hiring practices were horrible and even though they worked hard and I paid fair, they never eventuated in the long run.
We bought a new van, a VW Crafter, which is huge and is a pleasure to drive. All the space is unreal and it makes the job easier (keeping in mind that I am 6’6”).
We recently entered our busy period and got absolutely blasted, I was lucky that a good friend of mine who is currently unemployed was able to lend a hand. It was hard work but I was bringing in no less than 750 a day. I had a few moments where I felt I was going to burn out. For some reason I was still doing security work. I owed it to my boss who always took care of me and supported me all these years and essentially helped us purchase our first property (by providing well paying work which was easy on the family). I would finish at 3-4am and then go to work at 630am. Nightmare.

I’m happy enough that we kept the momentum even after the busy period. In fact last week was a record week which culminated in 4.2k. From one van. 
I’ve quit security, although still visiting the boys when I can. There are some awesome people in that industry. Recently hired a mature gentleman who can hopefully allow us to get a second van on the road. My wife recently went back to work, not because she had to, but because she wants to. She is working one day a week which allows me to spend even more time with my son, which is awesome.
We got some big plans which I’ll details in my next post as well as tips that I believe brought us success in our own little world. It’s not really limited to this industry. It’s a mindset of success in your own mind. It looked so daunting yet now it is getting clearer and clearer. Again, please ask any questions and I’ll provide a detailed response. If there are any questions to my wife, I can get her to answer them as well. This post is more than about business, it’s about life. 

Oh by the way, did I mention I try to not ever work Mondays. ;)

166,hhznn6,False,,122,I've been creating content on LinkedIn for 1.5 years now. This is how I create a year's worth of content plan in a day. (Full guide inside and you can use the strategies for other platforms),Entrepreneur,"Hello guys,

Social selling on LinkedIn is not easy.

You should frequently post to get results.  
To post frequently, you should have lots of ideas.  
To write those ideas, you need decent writing skills.And so on.

This guide will teach you how to keep up with all these things. And make it doable by teaching you:  


* How to build the right profile type.
* How to create topic clusters.
* How to mine platforms for ideas.
* How to make 30 out of 1 content.

But you should be consistent. And once you get the rhythm, it'll become natural.

Onwards to the guide.

PS: I'm not using LinkedIn articles. This guide is about regular feed posts on LinkedIn.

# Part one -  Understanding the difference between publisher and library profiles.

**Publisher**

* Posts irregularly.
* Posts business-related things, memes or funny videos or any content.
* When you scroll down on the profile, it's a mixed bag.

**Library**

* Post frequently
* Posts consistently.
* Speak the language of his or her audience.
* Narrows down the topics he or she'll talk about. (Picks a niche)
* Almost always talks about business-related topics.
* When you scroll down in this profile, it feels like you can find answers to your problems in a specific topic.

If you want to be a thought leader, you should be a library profile.

# Part two -  Creating topic clusters.

A topic cluster is a group of smaller that are built around one broader topic. See the pic:

[https://imgur.com/a/8i3Pxk9](https://imgur.com/a/8i3Pxk9)

By creating a topic cluster, you'll get rid of this question

""Okay, what should I post next?""

Here is an example:

**LinkedIn marketing**

* LinkedIn profile optimization
* Linkedin content creation
* LinkedIn Sales Navigator
* LinkedIn ads
* LinkedIn growth marketing tools
* LinkedIn trends in 2020
* LinkedIn updates

And so on. But it doesn’t stop here because every sub-topic has its own sub-topics. Such as:

**Linkedin Sales Navigator**

* How to use Boolean search
* How to use the feed of sales navigator
* How to use filters
* and on and on.

You can create a map by using any mind mapping app to get a more clear picture.

# Part three - Finding content ideas

I use Reddit <3, LinkedIn, Quora, LinkedIn and FB to find my audience and pick their brains.

On LinkedIn, you don't have to care about SEO keywords.

If you can find popular questions, discussion or topics in one of these platforms, you'll more likely get attention.

Popular = Proven.

Now I'll show you how I move around in these platforms. But before that

**A tip to help you write faster on LinkedIn:** Researching without taking notes is just consuming content. I use Evernote to capture the answers, sentences or language people use on these platforms.

Then when I create content, I rephrase their sentences or ideas. In time, it'll make you a better copywriter.

**REDDIT**

You already know how to use it. Here are quick 5 steps.

* Find your subreddits.
* Play with filters to find hot topics.
* Use the search function within subreddit by typing your keywords.
* Find the best topics to analyze.
* Always go deep in the comments to find the best ideas. The comment section is a gold mine.

**QUORA**

You don't have upvotes on Quora. If a topic is popular you can understand it by checking three things:

* Followers. The more followers a question has, the more views it gets.
* Stats. By viewing stats and log you can see the stats of question. (Hit the three-dot to find it out)
* Answers.  The more answers a question has, the more popular it is.

Here instead of Subreddits, you have Spaces. They're the same thing.

Again you'll pick keywords from your topic cluster and search popular answers, check comments and so on.

**Little known trick:**

1. Go to ads manager
2. Create an ad
3. Fill the first screen and proceed (don't worry you'll not spend any money)
4. From targeting section pick this [https://imgur.com/a/9E87oZ2](https://imgur.com/a/9E87oZ2)
5. Click bulk add and enter your keywords
6. Quora will share the most popular topics with you [https://imgur.com/a/F9tPmLe](https://imgur.com/a/F9tPmLe)

**LINKEDIN**

Go to search, click the content section in the search and enter your keyword.

Play with the filters and see what content works best on LinkedIn.

**FB**

Find and join the related FB communities and monitor the topics in the group. You can use filters and group search to see popular posts.

# Part four - No content is limited to single-use.

This is important and I'll say it again.

**No content is limited to single-use.**

Let's say you have a comprehensive blog post or long format content.

You can squeeze it and extract tons of content out of it. How?

* Make a carousel (slider) content that sums up your blog post
* Divide it into five parts and write a long-form post on LinkedIn 
* Part 1
* Part 2
* Part 3
* Part 4
* Part 5
* Shoot the video of the blog post
* Write a bit more about it and transform it into a lead magnet
* Create an infographic out of it. It doesn’t have to be limited to pie charts. You can sum up key takeaways, as we do in this eBook

You have raw footage of video from an interview or seminar or workshop.

* Extract fun, informative and interesting moments then create 1-3 minute LinkedIn posts
* Repurpose them into 15-30-45-60 sec videos
* Write a long-form LinkedIn content about your experience
* Create slides out of it
* Write five key takeaways posts
* Make gifs out of the raw footage
* Go even smaller and capture some photographs from the footage and write about it
* And many many more

You see what I am doing here? I tear down huge content pieces until I have nothing in my hands.

Here is how my content pyramid looks like  (I interpreted Gary Vee's content deck for my needs)

[https://imgur.com/a/FMwJhMO](https://imgur.com/a/FMwJhMO)

By creating this system, you could make 30 out of 1 content.

641,hl2f7o,False,Lessons Learned,61,How I grew my Shopify micro-SaaS to $25k MRR and 20k users in 14 months,Entrepreneur,"14 months ago, my co-founder Sankalp and I set out to build a business that can sustain our livelihood while allowing us the freedom to live life on our terms.

When we started, we each had roughly 12 months of savings to survive on, assuming we made $0. Hence our minimum goal was to make $1,500/mo and the case where we would be celebrating with champagne was set to $3,000/mo.

We launched our app on April 24, 2019. The first paid plan was launched on June 4, 2019. Around the same time, we got featured by Shopify.

14 months later, we grew past $25,000 in MRR while remaining a 2 person team.

I’m so proud of what we have built here.

If life is a video game, and there’s 100 levels to it, I feel like we have finally crossed level 1.

Here's what we've been up to in the 14 months since launch:

* 20,000 active merchants (users) on the app
* 1,500+ paying merchants (customers)
* 450,000 automated WhatsApp messages sent in June
* 2.2 million WhatsApp chat messages initiated in June
* Highest rated 5.0 🌟 app for all things WhatsApp with 500+ reviews
* Users from 50+ countries around the world

We did a lot of things right, but we also messed up here and there. I've tried to capture an honest and accurate account of our journey so far.

**11 key learnings and mistakes from our journey**

**1- Learning: Always keep moving the needle**

Running your own business and having 100% freedom and flexibility is a gift or a curse, depending on how you use it. It’s easy to get lost in building, polishing, bringing your ideas to life. But remember, the only things that matter are what move the needle.

For every decision related to your business, you should always run it through a set of questions that help you filter out whether your idea is aligned to your business goals.

* Does it help our app get more users
* Does it help convert more users to paying customers
* Does it help users derive more value and ROI from the app
* Does it meaningfully improve user experience
* Does it reduce our support ticket load
* Does it have any unintended 2nd order consequences that can bite us later

Ultimately, you want to keep making decisions that move the needle for your business - by bringing you more customers and revenue, or making it easier and less time consuming to run the business (if that’s one of your goals, it is for us).

**2- Learning: Help users realise value as soon as possible**

From our research, we learnt that Shopify merchants are mostly solopreneurs or teams of 2-10. They are always time and resource crunched.

We wanted to enable our users to start using the app with the least amount of setup time or steps. This reflects in in the user experience of the app.

For example, when a first time user enters their phone number and hits the “Save” button, at this time the user is looking to test our app and see if it fits their needs. We speed that up by automatically enabling the chat button on first save, along with the best default configuration for all chat button related settings.

Another example, when a user wants to start sending automated messages, all they have to do is click on the “Enable” button. All the app’s default configuration is automatically applied and the user can start seeing value immediately.

**3- Learning: Care about your users, they can feel it**

Users are on a mission to achieve their goals. They typically need your help when there’s something that stops them from getting there.

From day 1, we were clear on providing the best possible support. Our users would be thrilled to see bug fixes deployed in 15 minutes, WhatsApp & email replies in 5 minutes, and so on. We were fast, we were responsive.

This worked in our favour - users showered us with positive reviews which is how we managed 500+ reviews while staying 5.0 star rated.

But customer support isn’t only about getting reviews. We’ve had users who prefer using our app instead of competitors because

A- We reply quickly

B- We proactively provide information beyond the immediate premise of the query

Your users can feel when you genuinely care about them

**4- Learning: Be smart about managing and reducing support ticket volume**

The downside of trying to be a customer support hero is, you only have finite hours in the day, and you don’t want to spend most of it replying to customers.

We took 3 specific initiatives to reduce support tickets.

1- Embed FAQs within the product

We found that users would have FAQs around specific features, and they wouldn’t really go to the help center and reference it. To them, it’s simpler to ask for help.

To solve this problem, we embedded FAQs inside the product itself.

Here are a few examples where we included the most commonly asked question beside the feature configuration.

The results were always immediately noticeable. Where we would get 10 questions a week about X, would drop to 1-2, thereby freeing us up from answering repetitive support questions.

2- Fix repetitive bugs

If a bug appears more than thrice in a span of days, the third time is when we go ahead and permanently fix it. Why thrice? That way we don’t overwhelm ourselves with trying to fix every single bug, but only the ones that appear repeatedly and take up support time.

3- Remove WhatsApp chat support and go with Email only

During initial days, we found it useful to let our users contact us on WhatsApp. It lead to tons of conversations which shaped our understanding of the user’s needs and how we can better solve them.

But having WhatsApp as a support channel had 3 issues:

1- With time, we discovered that people find dropping a message on WhatsApp to be very low barrier. Which means they wouldn’t take a moment to look around, be patient enough to find out how the issue that they are about to describe has already been solved inside the app. It’s just easier to WhatsApp us.

2- We also discovered that users had an unrealistic expectation of quick replies and quick resolutions on WhatsApp. Granted, we would be quick whenever possible. But if it’s 11pm at night and the user asks if a bug is fixed 10 minutes later, it can get a bit annoying.

3- I started dreading picking up my phone, seeing it full of support tickets every morning.

To solve this, we removed the WhatsApp chat button from our own app, and replaced it with an Email support button instead. All 3 problems listed above got resolved to a great degree.

We also made numerous smaller tweaks to optimise our support flow. One of the tiny but powerful tweaks was to automatically populate the email subject line with the user’s Shopify store url. That made it so much faster for us to look up the specific user instead of a meaningless back and forth of “what’s your store url”.

Our efforts have paid off. Unless we’re building new features, we spend only about 15-30 minutes per day on customer support.

**5- Learning: Say No, often**

Users ask for all sorts of functionality. It doesn’t mean you should build them.

Whenever we get feature requests, we add a card in our internal Notion board and judge the card against 3 factors

1- how many times do we receive the same request

2- does the feature align with the rest of our product

3- does the feature add core value to the user

Many times, we found users requesting features that would save them the hassle of using another app. Now, if that functionality enhances the rest of our app, it’s the right feature to add. But if it doesn’t, then we politely decline.

There are 2 types of responses we give to customers regarding feature requests:

1- Tell them that this feature isn’t requested by other users that much, and since we are a small team with limited resources, we may not be prioritising this feature in the near future.

2- Tell them that this feature is already part of our roadmap, and that we will reach out to them whenever it’s ready. I generally avoid giving timelines, to account for “life happens, plans change”.

This learning extends beyond just feature requests.

In the past year, we have received tons of business proposals, partnerships, integration requests, collaborative marketing invitations etc. Saying No allowed us to remain focused on what’s really important.

**6 - Mistake: Optimise top of the funnel**

I was under the impression that during build phase, we shouldn’t focus too much on optimisation. After all, you don’t want to get busy squeezing another 10% when the potential is to 10x.

In most cases, I think I made the right call. One place I made the wrong call was the user onboarding flow.

Until March 2020, users would install the app and directly land on the chat settings page, which is the starting point of the user’s journey. We were getting a steady flow of 10-15 paid trials initiated per day.

Adding a step of friction before this would be counterintuitive, right? It couldn’t possibly increase trials, right?

Sigh.

When we added one screen which asked the user upfront whether they want to continue with the Free plan, or start a trial for the Paid plan, daily paid trials DOUBLED overnight, while trial-to-paid conversion rate remained steady at 50%.

The experiment took us a day to build, and after a week we concluded what was clearly the winner.

I normally advocate for focusing on building vs optimising in the early stages, but in this case I didn’t know that optimisation was waiting to unlock 100% increase in trials.

My takeaway here is - always keep your eyes open for bottlenecks at the top of funnel.

If there’s copy on your website, or a specific sign up flow that might be holding you back from getting 2x the users, you need to unblock it early and realise compounded gains over time.

**7- Mistake: Competition will copy, don’t completely ignore them**

In the past year, we’ve seen competitors copy our app interface, in-app descriptions, button designs, app listing text word-for-word in many cases. Initially we were furious, but instead we kept our head down and focused on customer’s needs.

Eventually we started ignoring our competitors, which was a mistake. While we were not looking, competitors gained ground on the huge lead that we had built up.

While I recommend entrepreneurs to not pay too much attention to competitors, I don't recommend ignoring them entirely.

If you had to split your attention, give 95% to your users and 5% to competition.

You want to remain informed about your competitor’s moves, whether that’s them copying you, building new features you haven’t yet implemented, or changing their pricing.

In today’s competitive landscape and low barrier to tech, all tech can get copied. Hence, build your moats beyond just your product.

I now understand better the value of building a brand.

**8- Mistake: Charge according to customer value**

I think we really struggled with charging correctly. Based on a few conversations with other app developers, we assumed that the right approach was to straight up raise prices. We raised our top plan from $14.99 to $19.99 to $29.99. Our paying user base kept growing, albeit very slowly.

Where did the other customers go?

To our competitors who were busy catching up.

The vast majority of our users are small merchants who barely have a few hundred orders a month. By becoming more expensive, we were alienating the 90% of potential paying users coming our app.

After realising this, we dropped subscription pricing to $10/mo. We make a healthy margin on messages and thus larger customers end up paying us more.

We also moved all chat button features to the Free plan, and combined all other paid plans into one plan.

This greatly simplified things for the customer, for whom there were only 2 choices to be made in the pricing page.

**9- Mistake: Don’t get complacent**

What do you think happened in that flat part of the graph?

Ecstatic about our initial success, we took the foot off the pedal for a few months where we pretty much allowed things to run on autopilot. It was a great time, I thoroughly enjoyed earning money while I ate, slept, read, watched, and relaxed.

But during the same time, our competitors were hard at work copying our app features. They incorporated many of our basic paid features in their free plan, which slowed down our user growth.

We were happy with the revenue we were making, which had already surpassed all our expectations before the slowdown, but we started flatlining around January-February of 2020.

That's when we decided to take back charge of the situation.

We made rapid changes to the product and more importantly pricing, which I’ve covered in previous points. This helped us retake merchants, get back to growth, and plug the leaky bucket.

**10- Mistake: Expand your distribution channels**

If we had to go back in time, one thing we would do differently is go beyond Shopify. At the very least, we should have diversified into the Wordpress and WooCommerce ecosystem.

Initially we thought our rating and reviews volume would be enough to keep the #1 spot. Alas, we were mistaken.

There are many ways to game reviews, one is by forcing your users to leave a review. Unfortunately, the Shopify app ecosystem is riddled with more such apps everyday, and one of them set their sights on us and overtook our ranking in less than 3 months.

Thankfully, the effect we had on trials initiated barely registered. We are mostly losing users seeking a “completely free” solution to our competitor. But it can get worse in the future as competition continues cloning our app (down to our code snippets).

My takeaway from this is - depending on 1 distribution channel can be dangerous, especially if that channel is an app marketplace which you don’t own.

**11- Learning: Keep your expectations low, and keep surpassing them**

Sankalp and I kept enjoying everything this app gave us because it would always surpass our expectations. For example - we expected to hit $3k MRR by end of 2019, but we crossed $8k by then.

This kept happening time and again. And while there’s a risk of setting the bar too low, as long as you’re aware that you’re not doing that, it’s far more enjoyable than setting the bar too high.

Ultimately, we didn’t quit our jobs and start a business to lead stressful lives.

We want the businesses we build to work around our lives, enabling us to live more freely and be more happy.

For the most part, I think we have achieved that.

**EDIT:** 

Many of you have DM'd to ask about how I discovered the idea to pursue. I researched every damn Shopify app and tried to find an opportunity where there's not too much competition and where the existing apps leave room for significant improvements.

246,9vdbng,False,How to Grow,148,How to grow an Instagram account organiclly (and for free) COMPLETE (mostly) GUIDE,Entrepreneur,"I saw there was a post on this recently, and after reading the comments saw there was some good advice, and some bad. In today’s world online and social media marketing are becoming not only important, but actual tools to increase revenue and profit. There’s a bunch of ways to grow an IG account, and a bunch of ways to tank one. This will be a long post, so I’ll try and break into bits. Apologies for mobile

Sorry guys, I know I'm super late on this, I've just been really busy the past couple months. Here you go, and please don't hesitate to reach out for specific help or advice. Also I'm sure I missed some points, so feel free to add your experience. Just be very careful about using suggestions. Saw some advice in the comments on my last post that was good, and some that was bad. Do your research, and be careful. Have at it

&#x200B;

UNDERSTANDING THE AUDIENCE

&#x200B;

It really doesn't matter all that much what you're using your IG account for, whether it's to sell a product, to increase brand awareness, to create connections, or just to generate hype, if you don't understand your audience. Know the consumers you're trying to target and what kind of things they like and follow. Do your research, google searches, ask random people on the street, ask friends and family what they think and how would they feel. As with all things marketing, the most important step is to put yourself into their shoes and think strategically the best way to engage with them

THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO COME AT IT WITH A STRATEGY. Each post is an opportunity to gain followers. Your waves of followers will come from quality posts, so make sure you attack each post with a strategy and a hungry mentality. If you're on this sub, y'all are fucking sharks. Be a shark.

&#x200B;

THE ALGORITHM

&#x200B;

In all honesty, we don’t really know what the algorithm is, but understanding how it works is far more important. Basically, like Facebook, Instagram has a formula that ranks its content (posts) in the feed and in the explore page (more on the explore page later). It has variables such as time of post, total likes and comments, hashtags, location, details on the account that posted, and even includes software to recognize what is in each post, and boost or demote it that way. Therefore, if you tend to only like pictures that have luxury cars in them, IG will boost those pictures in your feed. If you only pics of food or dogs, IG will boost pics of food or dogs in your feed and explore page. Each account has a slightly different algorithm in this regard.

This is why it’s important first of all to understand your target audience, and get in their shoes, not yours. So if your product is a technology that primarily benefits middle aged woman, but you only post pictures of the technology, you won’t do as well as if you posted pictures that were applicable and likeable by middle aged woman. Like and comments are your direct assessment of your post. If your audience like it, they’ll engage with you. If not, they won’t.

Also the algorithm changes every few months, so what worked last year or even last quarter, probably won't work the exact same way now.

&#x200B;

POST FREQUENCY

&#x200B;

Some of the comments on the previous post touched on this, but gave some poor advice. Do NOT listen to anyone who tells you you have to post as frequently as you can or post twice a day no exceptions. This is shit advice. Anyone who makes a sweeping rule is clearly not a real entrepreneur, or at least not a very good one. Theres more than way to skin a cat. 

In general, posting twice a day is a safe option. Once a day, isn't bad either, 3x a day can work. I've had success with even posting 3x a week. I would say somewhere between 3-20x a week. But make sure you aren't oversaturating your feed. You can easily bother your followers by making too many low quality posts. Quality over quantity every time. I know this probably sounds vague, but the important thing to remember is each account is different and unique. Please feel free to ask questions specific to you in the comments and I bet as a community we can really give some good advice. 

&#x200B;

TIME OF POST

&#x200B;

Pretty simple here. 12-9pm EST tends to be best. 12, 3, and 9 specifically. This is when most people tend to be on IG. Sorry if you're international, but I would suggest a quick google search looking for best times to post on IG. Generally speaking, Sunday tends to be the least engaging day of the week, but I've still found plenty of success these days.

&#x200B;

CONTENT

&#x200B;

Quality content is so important to have. There are three types of posts you can make on Instagram. Just a regular picture, a video, or a gallery post, meaning multiple selections where the user has to swipe in order to see the full post. Generally speaking, videos that are 10-30 second long will perform best, but this is absolutely not a rule of thumb. All posts that have a clear resolution, aren't cropped weird, and are professional are capable of performing well. People are forgoing their websites to only use an Instagram page for their business. Therefore, you have to use professional and quality content on your page. I've only had one post that was blurry that performed well, and it was in the middle of a good week (all other posts were getting thousands, and some tens of thousands of likes and engagements). IG boosts accounts that show consistent positive results. 

I know that it can be hard to find quality content to post, so if you have questions in this regard specific to your account or business, let me know in the comments. 

Otherwise, there are a couple apps that let you pull down other profile's posts off the app. I like Grab the best, but it is a bit clunky to use. Buffer lets you do reposts, but I've had a lot of bad experience with Buffer, but one of my mentors has really loved it, so you can try it out and decide for yourself.

Always tag people in your posts as well. Instagram lets you tag up to 20 accounts in one post, and you can now tag in videos too! this is awesome. So find influencers in your niche and tag them. Find big accounts related to your niche, and tag them. Find pages your audience follows, and tag them. 

We also need to discuss the concept of a powerlike. A powerlike is when someone with a big following likes your picture and engages with you. Your post is then much more likely to be displayed in their followers feeds and explore pages. Certain accounts likes have more value than others, so use this to your advantage. 

&#x200B;

EXPLORE PAGE

&#x200B;

Your ultimate goal through organic growth is to consistently get on the explore page and get promoted this way. The explore page is the page you access through the little magnifying glass at the bottom of the mobile app, or the compass when using desktop (don't use desktop, IG's desktop sucks). It shows suggestions to you based on your previous likes and comments and who you follow. This is a great way to utilize OUTSIDE ENGAGEMENT, which I'll get to later. 

&#x200B;

HASHTAGS

&#x200B;

Probably the best improvement you can make on your content is the correct use of hashtags. Each post can have up to 30, so use 30. I also suggest “hiding” them in the comments section by posting them as a comment, but there’s no evidence to support that this truly makes a difference. Use hashtags relevant to your niche. If you’re niche is in to cars, but your using hashtags like #hairstylistlove or #cutedogsoninstagram, IG will actually tank you for incorrectly “gaming” the algorithm.

There’s a couple of strategies you can use. 10/10/10 is a good start. Basically, there are big hashtags (over 500,000 posts), medium hashtags (50k-500k posts), and small hashtags (under 50k). You’ll see these ranges vary depending on who you ask, but for 10/10/10, I like these ranges. 10/10/10 basically means to use 10 big hashtags, 10 small, and 10 medium sized ones to properly market your post. Pretty simple. There’s also 25/5, and all smalls. In this case I’d use 25 hashtags under 100,000 and 5 over, or all hashtags under 100,000.

The important thing with hashtags is to keep experimenting and find what works. Not all posts are going to do well in a good set of hashtags, and not all good posts require a good set of hashtags to do well. Ik that sounds confusing and tricky, but if you take the time, and put effort into making quality content, Instagram will reward you. They want people to USE the app, to SPEND TIME using their product. The more you use it the more you’ll gain.

Geotagging is using a hashtag specifically related to your area. So for example #beverlyhills90210 or #minneapolisweather. These can be great if you're specifically trying to grow your brand in an area. 

Tagstealing is a term I use, but basically, it means going into the explore page and searching a hashtag relevant to your niche. Find a post that performs well compared to that profile's usual posts. So if someone posts a picture and it gets 500 likes when all their other posts get 50, use the hashtags that they did. They already gamed the algorithm and did the hard part for you.

&#x200B;

SHADOWBANNING

&#x200B;

This is a widely misunderstood concept and its important that we cover it in its own section. Shadowbanning is where Instagram bans certain hashtags from showing your posts in the explore page. usually these hashtags are porn related or can be porn related. So for example, #petite is banned and won't show results when searched. You can just Google banned hashtags checker and find free online tools that determine whether or not something is banned.

&#x200B;

Shadowbanning is NOT however, Instagram demoting your posts for whatever reason. it is strictly related to hashtags

&#x200B;

CAPTIONS

&#x200B;

Captions are the voice of your posts. It gives you an opportunity to share your opinion, connect with your audience, drive engagement, or really determine the direction of your post. I almost always recommend having a call to action (""let me know what you think in the comments below"") to help drive engagement on your posts. Encourage people to want to interact with you, but don't be desperate. That shit turns people off. Some people have long winded, winding stories as captions, while others have maybe a sentence at most. It really depends on you and who you are. Be genuine and real with your audience, and they'll respond to that. Never try to do something just for the likes, always attack IG with the mindset of being yourself and putting your best content and effort into the page. 

You can use hashtags here, or you can post them in the comments section. I like utilizing the comments method because it ""tricks"" the algorithm by showing your post as having an extra comment right away. 

&#x200B;

LOCATION

&#x200B;

This is a tricky one but can greatly be used to your benefit. This mainly affects the explore page. Basically, you want to use a location that garners a lot of activity, and more importantly, people on their phones. Stadiums, famous malls, public monuments, or popular Instagram spots are good locations to use. I’ve had mixed results when using restaurants. If you’re trying to grow in a specific city this is wonderful. But make sure you get a little more specific, if you’re just going to do a certain city. Use a neighborhood instead, i.e. Brooklyn not New York, Beverly Hill not Los Angeles.

&#x200B;

OTHER TOOLS BESIDES POSTS

&#x200B;

This is going to be things like Stories, Live, IGTV. Instagram wants you to use the app, so that they can make more money off of ads. Therefore, they're going to boost you for using the other aspects of the app. Post stories once a day or 5x a week, as a general rule of thumb. An easy strategy with stories is to just do reposts on similar accounts and encourage them to engage with you. Minimal effort for decent reward. also turning the camera around and showing you, talking into the camera, showing your workspace, or you in the field is great as well. More effort, but also probably more reward. Live feed maybe once or twice a week, or more, if you have the content/activity. Things like talks, lectures, videos, lessons etc. Sometimes you can do giveaways exclusive for your live viewers. This encourages viewers to come back consistently and engage in your live stream. IGTV is the newest tool here, but I've best seen it used and used it in the form of interviews, similar to a podcast, or in lectures or announcements. Amanda Bucci has a really great use of stories, live, and IGTV, so check her out for inspiration. These are now so much more important for gaining followers. Make sure you're using hashtags and tagging people in your stories etc as well. 

&#x200B;

OUTSIDE ENGAGEMENT

&#x200B;

This is where you'll really separate your account and make huge strides in growth. I grew an account from 3k followers to 10k in 3 months throug this. You should be spending 30 mins to an hour a day, going out and liking and commenting on other people's posts, to help drive engagement to your page. If you haven't noticed by now, the key word in IG is engagement, and you have to give if you wanna get. You can open a post in the explore page, like it, leave a comment that opens/starts a conversation, and move on in literally less than 10 seconds. Great, swipe right, and do it again. and again. and again and again and again for 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after each post. I've seen this strategy work, but also doing this multiple times throughout the day. Experiment and find what works for you. Each account is different and unique. Each method is going to be different and unique. More than one way to skin a cat. 

Also make sure that youre replying to all your comments on your posts. This will not only increase loyalty and motivation among your followers, but also trick the algorithm. if you get three comments on a post, and reply to all of them, you now have 6 instead of 3. Always be engaging and active with your followers, and try to reach out to other accounts in your niche and bring them in.

I saw a question about bots and stuff, there are plenty of bots on instagram. If they leave a comment, then leave a generous reply, and ignore, unless they respond and seem to be more than just automated. Bots are another follow, but having a group of loyal active followers will grow your account much faster than a bunch of bots who don't engage.

&#x200B;

DONTs

&#x200B;

Don't buy followers. Most of them tend to be bots, or the wrong type of followers, and won't engage with you at all. Instagram tries to ban these accounts, which could negatively affect yours. Organic growth is infinitely more valuable than buying followers. 

Don't forget about it or give up. Stay consistent. IG rewards consistency. If you keep at it, you'll eventually break through. Ik trust me, it is very tough and difficult, but can be very rewarding as well. 

Don't post just to post. Make sure each post has care and effort. Think of it like a new baby each time. You are shaping and raising your baby to give it the best possible opportunity to succeed. If you have a kid just to have a kid and don't put care into, it's going to turn out like shit. Be diligent

&#x200B;

DOS

&#x200B;

Consider paying to boost your posts. Get a couple of posts to perform really well, and consider spending 10 or 15 bucks on each post. This can easily bring you a thousand or more followers, depending on your account and history. 

Do consider reaching out to influencers, asking for help, or a shoutout. This is a livelihood for a lot of people, and they will want to gain off your following as well. Most of the time, it's win win. 

Engage engage engage. If you come away with one thing from this, it's that engagement is key in Instagram, and you need to find ways to drive engagement on your page. Experiment, try new things, have multiple accounts and cross promote. 

&#x200B;

That sums up the generals guys, but I know that I missed plenty. Please please don't hesitate to bring up any issue or question you have, through either comments or PM. Im super busy right now, but will try to get to all of them. I've worked with single person accounts in past and helped people grow  over 100k followers. Currently, I'm working as CMO at a startup, and have experience in all things marketing and sales. I'm looking to get into coaching/consulting, and would love to use you as a guinea pig.

195,euavpc,False,Best Practices,117,"8 years ago Mark Cuban said “following your passion is a bad advice. Don’t follow your passion, follow your efforts”... check out his article below, I think it has some gems specially at the end.",Entrepreneur,"
I hear it all the time from people. “I’m passionate about it.” “I’m not going to quit, It’s my passion”. Or I hear it as advice to students and others “Follow your passion”.

What a bunch of BS.  “Follow Your Passion” is easily the worst advice you could ever give or get.

Why ? Because everyone is passionate about something. Usually more than 1 thing.  We are born with it. There are always going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really really want to do with our lives. Those passions aren’t worth a nickel.

Think about all the things you have been passionate about in your life. Think about all those passions that you considered making a career out of or building a company around.  How many were/are there ? Why did you bounce from one to another ?  Why were you not able to make a career or business out of any of those passions ? Or if you have been able to have some success, what was the key to the success.? Was it the passion or the effort you put in to your job or company ?

If you really want to know where you destiny lies, look at where you apply your time.

Time is the most valuable asset you don’t own. You may or may not realize it yet, but how you use or don’t use your time is going to be the best indication of where your future is going to take you .

Let me make this as clear as possible

1. When you work hard at something you become good at it.

2. When you become good at doing something, you will enjoy it more.

3. When you enjoy doing something, there is a very good chance you will become passionate or more passionate about it

4. When you are good at something, passionate and work even harder to excel and be the best at it, good things happen.

495,7myt3e,False,How to Grow,98,Merry Late Christmas Reddit: here's my guide on how I build and scale influencers on Instagram,Entrepreneur,"I see so many people struggling to grow their Instagram profile.

As someone who successfully builds Instagram accounts for brands, personalities, bloggers, and artists, I thought I’d share my process so if you choose to, you can follow the same process.

**It’s Christmas after all, so it’s my gift to /entrepreneurs for keeping me so motivated this year.**

This strategy does use some controversial tactics. They work and I continue to use this strategy to build powerful accounts. In fact, after Instagram’s recent algorithm changes, this has become more relevant than ever before. It’s not for everyone, but for those who see the benefit of social proof and want engaged targeted followers, this will work for you.

I’ve found for people who have no existing social proof/brand, you can grow at around 1500 - 5000 targeted followers per month, and have a steady conversion rate depending on your product/service. For artists/photographers, this can be a lot higher.

*I’ve broken this guide up into a few sections: Content Creation, Content Curation, Automation (yes, automation).*

**Content Creation:**

Unless you just signed on to be the next lead actor in Stranger Things, you’re not going to build an engaged following by posting rubbish content.

So let’s spend a minute discussing what kind of things you should be posting, and how to produce it.

*You're not selling a hammer, you’re selling a hole in the wall.*

You need to apply this mentality to the content your posting on Instagram. I suggest at least 80% of your content should **emphasise an associated lifestyle** that your product or brand is related to.

[Here’s a comparison](https://imgur.com/a/U99Hw) of two approaches that explain my point.

People want to see new photos from the left account, as it reflects a lifestyle that appeals to them.

This not only means far more people will be subscribing to follow the account’s updates, but it builds brand authority, leadership and loyalty with its followers.

Then, in between the lines, you can passively promote awareness for your products or services.

Instagram is a top-of-the-funnel marketing tool for most brands, so treat it like one.

Focus on brand awareness, loyalty and thought leadership, and then nurture people down the funnel every now and then.

*But I can’t afford to produce so much high-quality content?*

I’m not suggesting you go out and hire a photographer or produce all the content yourself. There are billions of photos on Instagram already. So, I re-post existing photos and give credit to the original photographer.

This is a very scalable, free way to provide high-value content to your followers.

You have enormous freedom to dictate what sort of style, message, tone etc. that your profile will reflect.

I suggest using hashtags to find 10-20 or so photographers with a relatively low following (>10k) who consistently post beautiful content that is in line with the overall identity you want your brand to communicate.

Keep an eye on what they’re posting and when you see something that would be appropriate for your profile, screenshot it, record their username, and line it up in your schedule.

I’ve probably reposted thousands of photos in the last few years, and have never come across someone requesting my photo be removed. In most cases, they’ll comment on the photo saying thanks for the shoutout!

A little tip, always make sure to caption something sincere about the photo, so the original poster is happy, and also you’ll quickly establish a relationship with them.

You may be comfortable doing something else, but if I’m helping someone grow their following quick, I suggest 80% of the posts are these stunning lifestyle related photos.

It works.

Though of course, some people are not comfortable with this. That’s fine, but this guide is focusing on how to grow your profile quickly and effectively, not slow and steady.

**Content Curation:**

*So how do you get awareness of your images?*

Recently, Instagram changed its algorithm to serve more relevant content to people’s feed, rather than in the order of what’s posted.

That means that the engagement of your next photo determines whether or not it’s seen by your followers.

In fact, 70% of content is not seen.

So to overcome this, you need to make sure you spend time curating or amplifying your content.

Here is the process that I follow to make sure I have a solid foundation for making sure content is seen.

Hashtags:
Forget #photooftheday. Focus on high engagement, low volume keywords that relate to the lifestyle that you’re promoting.

If you’re a luxury watch brand and re-posting photos of glamorous lifestyles and exclusive travel, focus on getting your images on hashtags like #yachtlifestyle or #jetlife - these are active hashtags that relate to a lifestyle that falls within a ’semantic cluster’ (for those of you who are into SEO) of your target demographic.

I suggest posting around 11-15 hashtags per photo. To make it seem less intrusive and spammy, add a bunch of full stops with line breaks in between them, this way someone has to click ‘read more’ to see the hashtags.

To make life easier, use a program like later.com or Grum.co to schedule your photos. Later.com has a great tool that allows you to save comment templates.

I suggest using this so that you can cycle through 5-7 different groups of hashtags. If each day you’re posting two photos, and rotating through your hashtag groups, you’re going to be generating a lot of exposure.

**Automation:**

If mistreated, automation can be harmful to your account. Used carefully and appropriately, automation can be very beneficial to grow fast.

For those of you who are unaware of automation, it means that you set up your account to automatically like photos, and if you choose to be very aggressive, automatically following and unfollowing accounts. It generates a lot of exposure and hundreds of people get a notification that you’ve engaged with them each day.

Some people also auto-comment and DM, however, I highly encourage staying away from this. It’s just spammy.

I find that automation is a great way to ensure photos get high engagement and therefore the overall exposure of the photo is considerably increased.

Even if you’re occasionally interacting with some low-quality accounts, by optimising it and making sure your engagement is high and relevant, it’ll make your organic exposure much greater as you’re shown on your followers’ feeds, as well as ranking on the hashtag's ‘Top Posts’ section.

For me, this is the jet-fuel that ignites an accounts growth and can be responsible for 10x’ing the speed of growth, and as long as you’re careful, it’s a sustainable way of building your profile very quickly.

Unfortunately, most people abuse it go on automation rampages, which is why there is such a bad stigma attached to it.

Done correctly, you can stay within Instagram’s limits and only target real people who have a genuine interest in your profile.

For those who are interested, [I run a service](https://www.instamark.io/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=1) where I'll set up automation for your profile, and optimise it over time.

I’m going to be posting a few more case studies and life-hacks in the coming weeks.

For me, investing in Instagram has been a great way to life-hack my travels.

If people are interested, I’m going to write an article on how I set up and grew a travel influencer account, and set up an auto-outreach process to reach out to top restaurants and hotels on Yelp offering exposure on my account in return for a complimentary service.

It works, I currently average 3.5% success rate from restaurants, which sounds low but I last month I was in NY, and set up an automatic process to reach out to Yelp’s top 1000 restaurants and had about 50 offers for meals for my girlfriend and I. Of the restaurants that I did go to and post about, I actually feel that I helped the restaurant quite a bit, as it ranked in the top-post section of plenty of high volume travel hashtags and had plenty of local people tagging their friends in the comments.

Let me know if you’d like me to write a guide on how you can do this. 

EDIT: I've received a lot of messages regarding my website not looking great on Mobile - I am fully aware of this and appreciate the concern. I usually have just grown through referrals and all i needed was a landing page for people to get in touch via, however I recently got the desktop version redesigned.

457,33ix6y,False,,315,Want to Buy an Amazon Course? Let Me Save You $5000,Entrepreneur,"Hi, I'm the guy that told you about why I prefer product-based business check out my post 

&nbsp;

here:http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/32qc9b/why_ill_always_choose_products_over_services/

&nbsp;

Today, I'm going to save you $5000 (keep in mind there are many complexities to Amazon you wont' run into 99.9% of them)

&nbsp;

If any of you have Facebook, and have any entrepreneurial aspirations you’ve seen it.  It’s Amazon course season and the prices are more ridiculous than ever.  So I’m a going to tell you to push the pause button on buying.

&nbsp;

These causes promise you the world.  They after “masterminds” cool software, and fancy getaways to Vegas maybe even Miami.  Well, I’ve made this post to steer you in the right direction and tell you everything yo need to succeed in the products business. Start small $500 could set up you up.

&nbsp;

Amazon

&nbsp;

To profit massively and have free time on your hands use FBA, Fulfillment by Amazon, service.  You need a Professional Seller account. It’s $40.00 bucks a month. Don’t cry. 

&nbsp;

Create a Brand

&nbsp;

The nature of any internet marketing is the niche.  Pick a product category you are interested in and makes money. The top categories on Amazon are Supplements, Health and Beauty, Kitchen and Dining, and Mobile Accessories.  There are other categories but these are the major players.  Choose a category with low competition your rise to the top will be quick.  Choose a high competition category and moderate success can still set you up.  It is best to aim for a mix of both, although it comes down to preference. So you creation of multiple brands is a must.  Two low competition categories are “Sports and Outdoors” and “Travel”…you’re welcome. 

&nbsp;

The In-Demand Product

&nbsp;

This is the hardest part of the journey.  Luckily, Amazon has a ranking system.  Additionally, you may want to make Google Trends your best friend.  To find products past the 100 BSR mark use this search string: [""Amazon Best Sellers Rank: #200 in Kitchen & Dining"" site:Amazon.com] Use Google Replace the number you want Replace the category you want as well Sometimes the number you want won't come up, the results will jump around, this is because of Google's algorithms concerning traffic for the most part.  Any product that is in the 1-1500 range is good. Do not get hung up on trying to find the “perfect” product. You want to build a brand, you’ll be investing in many products. See your products as stocks or investments.  Make sure your product is light weight and small to help you when it comes to shipping cost.  Do your research on regulations on and certifications for your product in your country (Supplements, I don’t suggest these on your first go around).

&nbsp;

Sourcing 

&nbsp;

Another level of difficulty, but you can make it easier if you know what you’re doing.  

Two ways to source:  You can Google [private label/wholesale/OEM  (insert product name here)] –or- you go to these sites:

Alibaba.com: Gold Supplier over one million in sales to avoid getting scammed use  Paypal

Aliexpress.com: wholesale marketplace

Dhgate: Wholesale, full OEM services sometimes, free shipping sometimes, FREE SHIPPING A HUGE PLUS

&nbsp;

ALWAYS ASK FOR SAMPLE

&nbsp;

Shipping

&nbsp;

If you can get free shipping go for it.
Shipping is a lot to fit in here.  But it is not complicated at all.  
Courses try to confuse you, to make you think it’s super difficult but it is not.  Factories have a lot of experience and can guide you through the process you follow.  

Want more details you go to: http://www.chinaimportal.com/blog/sea-freight-shipping-from-china-guide/

Calculate custom charges and shipping cost before it arrives, you don’t like surprises.

You need help talk to a freight forwarder. 

&nbsp;

FBA Requirements

&nbsp;

Make sure you aren’t shipping more product than you are allowed you have.  You’ll begin with 5000 unit limit unless your product is oversized like a yoga mat. 

&nbsp;

Have your supplier limit any additional instructions or papers on outside of the boxes shipped.
Amazon provides a shipping label, tell your supplier it should be the largest thing outside the box.  Amazon likes an invoice like document on top of products shipped (inside the box).

&nbsp;

Your product should have what’s called a UPC, you buy one here: https://www.cheap-upc-barcode.com/bc_cheap.php

&nbsp;


If this isn’t present in barcode form on your packaging, you will need stickers applied to the packaging  of each item you ship.  Sometimes your factory will provide this service free, or Amazon can apply them for you for a fee. 

&nbsp;

I usually have my first package from a new supplier shipped to my house first to see if they followed my instructions.  After the initial shipment, which should be small send them off to the assigned FBA warehouse. 
After correcting the factory you should be able to have them send it direct to the FBA warehouses. 

&nbsp;

Now your Products on Amazon

&nbsp;

4 things matter on Amazon, NOTHING ELSE.

&nbsp;

PICTURES: Picture quality correlates with sales stock photos aren’t going to cut it. Get pictures that feature your packaging.  Follow Amazon’s rules regarding pictures.

&nbsp;

REVIEWS:  You will need them to get sales.  Start with friends and family if not supportive.  Offer a giveaway and come to Reddit, get there email address, bug them until they leave a review.

&nbsp;

SALES:  You’ll need to bump your BSR.  This raises you for keywords your product should appear in .  After about 20 or so reviews from redditors, friends, and family then go to a…

&nbsp;

Launch Service

&nbsp;

The “big” secret courses are pushing.  You probably heard of Zonblast, great but overpriced.  A cheaper service to get the same exact results: Viral-Launch.com


One hundred bucks a month gets you as many launches as you want.

Follow up with customers for reviews.  You are buying reviews and a bump in keyword ranking.

&nbsp;

Repeat/Diversify your Bonds

&nbsp;

Oh, you’ve gotten some success…selling about 20-30 a day now with no ad dollars spend on your part. Good, pick another product and start again within your brand.


Then create a new brand and begin again. 

Repeat, Repeat…diversify your bonds (brands)

Anyone can do this… it is easy.  I even revealed “secret”… the launch service.

534,61lw7q,False,,130,Lessons learned for how I actually started making money online.,Entrepreneur,"I’m starting with the proof (sorta):


[http://i.imgur.com/1e8JoyN.png](http://i.imgur.com/1e8JoyN.png)


This is my google analytics for 2016. Looks like shit doesn’t it? It was mostly. I’m no rags-to-riches story, in fact, I’m still in the hole on my investment. However, I wanted to share with you a couple lessons I learned because I think I’ve started to turn the corner. I can at least see that there is indeed potential on this path, if I keep at it.

**I won’t waste your time, here are my main lessons. Also, I didn't plan to write this post. I just started it on a whim, so it's not going to be awesome:**

-	Don’t half-ass it/Don’t be lazy - If you’re going to do it, then do it. Invest in it – both time and money until you know you have done everything you can. If you aren’t willing to do that, don’t even start. 
-	Make a plan before spending a dime, and stick to it. - The plan is as important as the execution. Make a plan based on what is known to be effective, and go from there.
-	Dispel with the dreams of getting rich. You won’t – You will not create the next billion-dollar Facebook acquisition from your desktop. You just have some drive and a few ideas about making money online. 
-	You’re not a genius – Sorry, you aren’t. I’m not. Most of us aren’t. So, stop thinking your idea is going to revolutionize X, or is like A + B and is therefore better than both A and B. If you actually might be a genius or programming savant and have a unique idea, this isn’t for you. Don’t waste your time here, go finish your MVP, read about how to build an user base, and go do that. 
-	BUT if you’re like me, you have 4-5 ideas you think are amazing swirling in your head at one time. - Get this, they probably AREN’T all amazing. Choose one with the most REAL potential, not potential in your mind, and then work on it exclusively. 
-	Do not overlook the tried and true path – I never gave niche content sites and amazon affiliate marketing any consideration because I thought they were too hard to create and keep content going. I have since learned that they are in fact too hard to create content for and to keep going, but that it IS POSSIBLE if the dividing line between “possible” and “too hard” moves up, a lot. Just look at my shit-graph above. But, I ended up spending 9 years in an industry and over 15 years knowing how to make this money, never doing it because I thought it wouldn’t work, even though tens of thousands of people are doing it and making money. 


::SO::

Why am I here if I'm NOT going tell you the secret formula for getting rich? 
In November I was literally |__this__| close to giving up and selling my website on Flippa. See:

[http://i.imgur.com/0VI6NZK.png](http://i.imgur.com/0VI6NZK.png)
 
I was fed up. I had sunk about $1300 into something that was getting under 10 visits a day on a good day most days were 0 unless I was on it :(. I hadn’t spent any time on it in months, and I was looking to dump it for at least a few hundred to get some of my money back. I asked a friend if he wanted it, basically for free – just to pay me for my investment as he earned money – if he earned money. And even he turned me down. 
Like most shit I do, however, I stalled making the decision until about Dec 14 when I checked the traffic again just for shits and giggles. Lo-and-behold (!) however, I had a little more traffic… WTF. 
Now, is when my laziness had caught up to me and I had violated rule 1 “Don’t half-ass it/Don’t be lazy.” I actually started getting traffic about the beginning of November, but I only noticed it halfway through Dec. I had never put Amazon affiliate links on my site. Yes, the main reason I started the site to begin with, I never even finished doing because I figured – “I have time to do that, and I have no traffic anyway, so eff it. *my life sucks, this site sucks…” Even now, I decided to write up this long as post for some inexplicable reason, instead of writing would could be 2 or 3 articles for my site… wth.

Anyway, a month and a half after my traffic started to tick up, around Dec 14, I finally realized it and busted ass for a night and put affiliate links on there. And guess what:

[http://i.imgur.com/46rrmuf.png](http://i.imgur.com/46rrmuf.png)

That’s my amazon affiliate metrics. Now, I said in the beginning this is no rags to riches story. This is just the first half of the graph. I’ll show you the other half later. 


So, now is when I got serious. I added more affiliate links, I bought some more content, and am now in it for the long haul. I have seen the light as they say. That this really can work, if you focus on it.  


That is why I am here now. 


**If you want to make money online. Even if your idea is unique - You should consider Amazon Affiliate marketing sites.** I’m not going to post any links, but google for something like “amazon affiliate marketing” and you’ll find stuff. Read all of it. 


But, even if you don't choose to go this route, you can still learn from my mistakes: 


Don’t be lazy. Make a plan. Spend your money carefully. Realize you will not get rich overnight. In the meantime, focus on passive income and finding multiple streams of passive income. If you still dream of a huge payoff (or just a very high earning site) like I do, remember that huge payoffs require huge investment of both time and money. Passive income like this can potentially afford you both of those. Start here. You’ll find more success, and having experienced it, I can tell you that works wonders for your confidence and determination. 


Before I go. The reality is, I only got a spike because of Christmas traffic. However, that does mean it works. I have now earned $1200, almost my full investment. 


[http://i.imgur.com/Ap3vrd0.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ap3vrd0.png)

 
And here’s the last half of that graph.


[http://i.imgur.com/6akeBPe.png](http://i.imgur.com/6akeBPe.png)

 
It’s not the immediate riches I dreamed of, but if I stick to the plan, I’ll be able to stem the dropoff. In a month I could be in the black and finally earning passive income.


Best of luck!

458,ejt9g8,False,Lessons Learned,201,8 niches that will ALWAYS make money (A Guide),Entrepreneur,"There are 8 basic human needs that every person desires according to *Ca$hvertising* author, Drew Eric Whitman.

In his book on advertising and marketing, he states that there will always be a desire to obtain the following 8 things. Whitman calls them the Life Force 8:

&#x200B;

1. Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension
2. Enjoyment of food and beverages
3. Freedom from fear, pain, and danger
4. Sexual companionship
5. Comfortable living conditions
6. To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses
7. Care and protection of loved ones
8. Social approval

Because these 8 things are basic human wants, there will **always** be a market for it. Even as markets and trends fluctuate, you can expect to make money if you focus in on any one of the 8 categories and offer a product or service in it.

Yes, other categories exist but Whitman argues that these are the primary, deep down categories that all humans want.

A fun thought experiment with this list is to take your favorite brand or company and see where they fit on this list. Do you they only hit on one of the 8? Multiple? Where does Apple fit – I'd wager #8.

Every time I launch a new product or service I like to refer to this list and see if it falls under any of these. If it does, business will just be that much easier.

What do you guys think of this list? Agree with them? Disagree?

482,7d5hlf,False,,85,"My first month of blogging is in the books. I increased active website users 500%, got featured on Quora, and detail my 17 step process for every post",Entrepreneur,"I wish I would have started content marketing sooner.

After reading countless blog posts, books, articles...everything...it is ingrained in your head that __content marketing should be started from day one__. 

The reason for this, is due to the sheer amount of time it takes to start ranking for keywords in search engines. Everyone knows this, but for some reason I put it off until mid-October (after being in business since February).

I fully expected the traction to slowly trickle in and take a few months, but I was very surprised by the immediate results I have been seeing.

After blogging twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays) for a month, here are my takeaways:

## The Good
First, let's talk about the good things:

__1. From 0 to 44k views on Medium__
I had a Medium account for a while, but never posted anything until October 14th, 2017. [This post](https://medium.com/spreadstreet/an-easy-way-to-connect-digital-currency-services-to-google-sheets-21f18301f881) detailed a brand new Google Sheets add-in I developed for cryptocurrencies.

From Oct 14th to Nov 14th, I accumulated 44k views, 21k reads, and (yay!) 285 fans:

[Medium View Statistics for One Month](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/15xsArhJhAYqoWyIwiOSC0/21c18c948ae59d1cc0a6db96f65b8c6d/Medium_View_Statistics_for_One_Month.png)

You will notice right around Nov 6th a spike in views. This was because...

__2. One of my posts took off__

[10 Price Predictions for 10 Cryptocurrencies went mini viral](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/634QUjXcaswSYykkcye8o6/e653698d50583aefe7753f916d2a6b67/10_Price_Predictions_for_10_Cryptocurrencies_went_mini_viral.png)

My post on [10 Price Predictions for 10 Cryptocurrencies](https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/10-statistical-price-predictions-for-10-cryptocurrencies-b8167f076d5d) had a great showing, and something happened to it over the weekend.

This post by itself had half the views of all the blog posts I created. If we take a look at the referrers we see:

[Blog post referrers for mini viral post](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/1hHEp7kDDSCysMu0OEwu0c/fd110cdcc3f79bc36e5e5a4116596936/Blog_post_referrers_for_mini_viral_post.png)

E-mail, IM and direct is very vague, but a good portion comes from my existing mailing list. However, it also looks as though the post was shared quite a bit on Facebook, and Reddit. The Quora referrers you see is from taking the information contained in the blog posts, and answering questions on Quora.

This leads me to...

__3. 342k views, 1,100 upvotes, and 54 shares on Quora__

[Monthly quora views](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/1P1xBZa7CQagEWAym4uaeY/a395dbc198c1402c7d8a2101ef68c114/Monthly_quora_views.png)

One of my answers, [What is the Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2019](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-bitcoin-price-prediction-for-2019/answer/John-Young-390) also took off. This answer had 819 upvotes, and 218k views. 

This combination of answers led too...

__4. I hit the Top 10 Most Viewed Writers in Cryptocurrencies on Quora__

[Top 10 writers in cryptocurrencies category on Quora](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/5eBIDhHFFYeuMIMK2omIAg/41ac857bcb1b96113c8d461e95446c36/Top_10_writers_in_cryptocurrencies_category_on_Quora.png)

This was really cool to see, and I was very proud of the accomplishment. The other users in the list are some great minds in the space, so it was humbling to be mentioned along side of them.

__5. Weekly active users on the website increased by 500%__

[Spreadstreet increase in daily active users](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/1cKUtbqIROKYMuqCSm6sUY/b0a03ea2c048f309b17191a996661c8e/Spreadstreet_increase_in_daily_active_users.png)

And this is where I was shocked by the amount of users coming to the website so quickly. I figured it was going to completely trickle for a few months, and then start picking up after the posts started to rank.

__6. Total signups has started an exponential curve__

[Cumulative user count growth](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/2yFqMkAeX6ieSAq8syQIks/064e7cf16759f0542e209c1c6f450eca/Cumulative_user_count_growth.png)

I really hope this is starting a new trends for sign-ups. I have read many times about the product maturity growth curve, and it would be great for this to be a major inflection point within the business.

__7.  Most of the community has provided both encouraging, and educational comments__

My favorite part of this experience has been interacting with the readers. The comments have ranged from encouraging:

## The Bad
Not everything is all snowflakes and butterflies. I had some hiccups along the way:

__1. My upvoted answer on Quora was almost indefinitely collapsed due to (unwarranted) plagiarism__

This was strictly a misunderstanding, and 100% my fault. I used the analysis completed in one of my posts as an answer to the question mentioned above. My space-cadet self forgot to link back to the original article, and Quora's algorithm's detected plagiarism and collapsed the answer.

If your answer is collapsed on Quora from plagiarism, consider it a death knell. I pleaded my case with the Quora mods, claiming that the answer was my original content, I just forgot to link to the original article. They very kindly uncollapsed the answer, and I avoided a pretty big hit. I applaud them for their rightful justice.

## The Ugly

__1. Some people are downright mean and angry__

Names blurred to protect the...innocent?

[Mean comment number 1](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/1nELvSxY0wcM8WCMOwiGU6/244e78be778ab0c1645be1f7677164c5/Mean_comment_number_1.png)

[Mean comment number 3](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/4lKEEnizpuEA0eWoYoocWS/7cab83da9c5f7b869ee406d9e9e4ab3f/Mean_comment_number_3.png)

[Mean comment number 4](//images.contentful.com/7dugnl5p37zn/652LVcdaOA62m0WKWqc0uK/f394c11ea5733a8a3d675b974fcef3d2/Mean_comment_number_4.png)

My biggest and best advice for this - __do not give the trolls the light of day.__ You may want to get in a shouting match, but NOBODY WINS AN ARGUMENT ON THE INTERNET.

Although, do not view criticism as a troll. The number one thing you can do is continue learning, and through the mounds of shit you can find some of the best and brightest online. 

__2. I absolutely despise editing and creating pictures__

By far the biggest time sink is the editing process. I do not want to cover off on everything that has to be done (as it gives me PTSD), but making sure you have no spelling errors, headlines, bolds, pictures, etc...takes an ENORMOUS amount of time. 

In the future I will look to outsource a good portion of this, but sweat equity for now. 

## My 17 step process for (almost) every blog post

For my blogging, I have a 17 step process I follow for most posts:

__Creation Process__

1. Create a tool (my product is a spreadsheet add-in. The 'tool' is a helpful template that users can copy and use)
2. Make a YouTube video on the tool
3. Wordpress Post

__Then I crosspost with rel:canonical to:__

4. Medium 
5. Steemit
6. Reddit (multiple subreddits)
7. Indie Hackers (if relevant)

__Then I submit links to:__

8. Hacker News
9. Digg
10. Slashdot
11. Bootstrappers.io (if relevant)
12. Bitcointalk forum
13. Cryptocompare
14. Multiple Facebook groups

__Marketing automation:__

15. Add ~4 tweets to a Zapier automation that randomizes tweets once per hour
16. Add pieces to two different mailing lists through Mailchimp

__Then I utilize blog post to answer questions on:__

17. Quora

This has been my preliminary plan, and it has produced some pretty good results. I will obviously change depending on what is working and what is not working (for example, Quora and Medium are working EXTREMELY well, but Bitcointalk gets pretty much nothing). 

## What can I do better?
This section is for you. I really want to know:

> ""What can I do better?"" - John Young, asking you
> 

I am still very new to the game, and want to learn any and everything I can. Would love suggestions or critiques of the current process. 

## What's next?
I will continue to blog twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays) and will be testing what subjects and topics my readers want the most.

What I will focus on, is watching my cohort metrics. All of this traffic is great, but if I am unable to convert over to my product, then it will be tough to continue on.

44,7aco1w,False,Best Practices,76,Finding profitable niches is not hard. A step-by-step Tutorial for beginners that works every time,Entrepreneur,"There are quite a few ways to make some extra cash online. If you follow this subreddit, you probably know that already.
 
You’ve probably also noticed that one of the most challenging parts of online entrepreneurship is **finding the right niche.**
 
Look around, and you’ll find *tons* of information about how to do the whole “making money online” thing.
 
Whether it’s affiliate marketing, dropshipping, selling t-shirts, or whatever else, you’ll find a wealth of step by step guides that can teach you just about everything you need to know about strategies that work.
 
Sure, there’s a learning curve at play there. And it can get kind of overwhelming if you’re new to all this stuff. But with some time, dedication, and perseverance, you can learn what you need to know to start making a profit as an internet entrepreneur.
 
Whether your goal is to bring in some extra beer money with a fun, low-maintenance little side hustle, or to create something you can scale over time into a liveable, sustainable income, you can make it happen.
 
But you may have noticed something. Despite all the awesome free information out there, there’s one thing that, at the end of the day, no one can really spoonfeed to you.
 
And that’s **finding a niche.**
 
In a lot of ways, that’s really the tricky part. And it’s a central aspect of a bunch of different kinds of online businesses.
 
Maybe it’s not universally applicable, per se, but niche selection is essential for such perennial /r/entrepreneur standbys as affiliate marketing, dropshipping on Shopify, creating monetizeable Instagram accounts, and more.
 
It’s also important to what I do, which is Kindle publishing.
 
I know there are other Reddit posts out there about finding a niche, not to mention a million blog posts on the subject.
 
But even so, I wanted to share my own “in-the-trenches” knowledge and experience because I noticed there’s a lot of bad information online.

I love this stuff. I remember when I was starting out spending hours upon hours throughout the night (and often saw the sun come up) researching different niches. 
 
Again, my experience is with ebook publishing, but I’m also talking about broader concepts that are applicable in other entrepreneurial pursuits.
 
So here’s my advice on finding profitable niches. And it’s maybe a little contrary from what you’re used to hearing over and over again.
 
So let’s get started.
 
**This is a pretty long post, so here’s a quick TL;DR of the key points.**
 
* **Go for profit over passion.** Profit potential takes precedence over your own personal interest in a subject. Remember, you can always outsource your content and copy to someone who does know a lot about the topic.

* **Go for big, evergreen mass market niches that always sell.** I’ll explain why, and what these niches have in common.

* **Focus on solving a specific problem.** “Getting in shape” is a broad niche. “How to get a six pack in 6 weeks or less” is a *specific problem.*

Autosuggest is one of the most efficient ways to pinpoint those specific problems. This applies on Amazon, as well as on Google and Youtube. You can also find tools like KeywordShitter and AnswerThePublic that make it easier to find and collate that information.
 
#Should I Pick a Niche That Interests Me?
This is a pretty common question, and yes, I have been asked this by people quite a few times.
 
And honestly, this is something that comes up periodically here at /r/entrepreneur, I’ve noticed.
 
There are two pieces of advice you see a lot. And they’re mutually contradictory.
 
Some people will say, “Yes, go for your passion! You’ll be miserable if you’re grinding away writing content for a niche in which you have zero interest. Find what moves and drives you, and channel that passion. If you’re into cars, do affiliate marketing for auto accessories. If you’re into fashion, try finding a subniche in apparel and accessories.”
 
Others say the opposite.
 
“No matter how much you love something, when you create a business out of it, it’s going to feel like work. And this could lead you to resent something you used to love. Don’t make a business out of your passions or hobbies. Pick something toward which you’re more neutral, but that you know is going to sell.”
 
So which is it?
 
Both arguments honestly have some pretty good points.
 
**Personally, I like to lean toward the second option: choosing a niche based on the bottom line, not on personal passion.**
 
That’s not to say you can’t choose a niche you’re at least somewhat into. But here’s why I’m more in favor of Option 2:
 
* **A lot of hobbies and interests are, frankly, kind of hard to commodify.** If you’re into, say, French symbolist poetry, there’s not a whole lot you can really do with that. At least, not at scale.

* **With some things, commodification kind of “feels wrong.”** Think spirituality, that kind of thing. This is pretty individually variable, though, and I’m not here to make any value judgments of any kind.

* **Chances are, you’ll end up outsourcing most of the “grunt work” anyway.** A quick look through /r/juststart confirms that when getting started, most people write their own content. But as someone who’s published tons of books and stuff, I’ll say this: no matter how much you enjoy writing, doing it all day, every day, in high quantities, burns you out like nothing else.

Even if you’re a super gifted writer -- a professional writer, even -- you’ll reach a point where you’ll want to outsource that kind of thing.

Why? Because if you’re doing all the work yourself, you will reach a point where you can’t scale anymore.

For instance, let’s say your output is 1 book per month. And after a few months, I guarantee you’ll want to take a break to recharge.

But if you are outsourcing your work, you can get 3, 5, 10 books done PER month.

(Again, my experience is in Kindle publishing, so I’m talking mostly about content, info products, etc. But I’m sure it’ll apply to physical products, creating an app, etc.)

**At the end of the day, the goal here is to start a business and make money.** For that reason, it makes a whole lot of sense to focus on profitability, the level of competition, the potential for a “first mover” advantage in a nascent market, and other things like that.
 
Again, you might have a hobby or a passion that actually does lend itself well to starting a business of some kind. Selling products, writing a series of books about it, blogging about it and posting product reviews with affiliate links, whatever.
 
But don’t feel like you have to start with your own interests. If you don’t HATE it or if it does not go against your values, then it’s fine. (But NEVER go against your values because you’ll end up sabotaging yourself. For instance, I will not promote a business that is related to drugs, violence, or porn no matter how much potential there is because I will not feel good about doing it and I end up sabotaging myself.)
 
Not interested in learning about knee high and thigh high boots tailored for the thicker calves of plus size women, even though there’s a rapidly growing market for that kind of thing?
 
Find a writer who’s a plus size woman who loves fashion and wears a lot of boots during the winter. Get her to write up your product reviews, or write up general supporting blog content like fall fashion style guides and editorials about body positivity.
 
She’ll gladly write for you. And no offense, but she’ll end up doing a heck of a better job than you, because it’s what she loves.
 
And, what you end up paying her is a tiny fraction of the amount of money you’re ultimately going to make from that content. [Check out my post about what kind of freelancers to avoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/79ok2p/over_the_years_ive_hired_over_a_hundred_freelance/) to save yourself a lot of headache, though.
 
There’s a lot you can outsource, and for a lot less money than you might think. So don’t toss an idea just because it’s not a personal interest of yours.
 
The advice I give to my students is: get some stable, consistent cashflow going first, then you can focus on your passions.
 
You’ll enjoy these passions a thousand times more if you do this because there’s no pressure to make a profit from it. You’ll be way more creative also.
 
#Do I Need to Be Knowledgeable About My Niche?

I kind of touched on this one in the previous section.
 
It probably depends on what kind of business you’re running, what your goals are, and other variables that can be different from person to person.
 
But what I do want to emphasize here is that **you *don’t* have to feel like you need to be a world class expert on a subject to build a business around it.**
 
Don’t let yourself succumb to the whole “imposter syndrome” thing. You’d be surprised what you can do with some simple Googling in your free time.
 
We live in a freaking golden age of information right now. Thanks to the internet and smartphones, *you are literally holding the entire wealth of human knowledge in the palm of your hand.*
 
With just some determination, some free time, and the magic of Google Search, you can quickly learn the basics about almost anything.
 
And honestly, the basics are all you’ll really need.
 
When it comes to content -- whether it’s a book you’re selling, or a blog post housing affiliate links -- what matters is that you know more than your audience about how to solve their problem.
 
Someone needs to attach two pieces of wood together with a nail? You don’t have to be a world class authority on hammers to give them the answers they need. You don’t need to know about the rich history of hammers, or how hammers are manufactured. You don’t even need to be all that knowledgeable about building and construction in general.
 
You just need to know that your audience needs a hammer.
 
And oh, look, you have a bunch of great product reviews of the very best hammers for their specific kind of nail. Or, you’ve got a comprehensive ebook that gives a full step by step guide to hammers and how to use them to pound a nail.
 
**So don’t feel like you need to be a #1 authority or expert on your chosen niche.**
 
#How to Find a Niche: Start with the Timeless Evergreen Niches That Always, Always Sell
When people talk about niche selection, they put the biggest emphasis on specificity. They focus on narrowing things down.
 
Now, don’t get me wrong. That’s definitely something you should do. But that step comes later.
 
Before you begin, you want to focus on “selling what sells”.
 
There are big, massive, evergreen niches where there will always, always be a market full of people itching to break out their pocketbook and pay you for solutions to their problems.
 
Now, these niches have some pretty important things in common. And I think it’s worth talking about those things.
 
What is it about these things that make them so perennially profitable?
 
**It comes down to basic human desires. Love, sensory pleasures, material wealth, self-confidence, social success, self-actualization. These desires are basically universal, at least within contemporary Western culture.**
 
They revolve around things that people want on a very deep and fundamental level, in ways they’re not necessarily even fully aware of.
 
**Love and friendship.** For the most part, humans want to find a romantic partner with whom they can share both emotional and sexual intimacy. Someone to love them and support them.
 
**Social success**. People want others to like them. This ties into things like beauty and getting in shape, although that also relates to the desire to find a mate. It also ties into self-help topics, like how to be more confident, how to get better at public speaking, etc.
 
**Material wealth**. Good old “how to make money.” Whether it’s investing in real estate, starting a small business, or whatever, people are always looking for ways to make more money. Again, this also ties into the concept of social success.
 
**Entertainment.** People like to have fun. They like humor. They like to laugh. They like to read about celebrities or whatever, vicariously reveling in the sumptuous glamour and sexy scandals of the rich and famous. A lot of late 20th century sociologists and thinkers wrote about the concept of the “culture industry.” Think of that kind of thing.
 
**Self-actualization and personal fulfillment**. People want to feel content in their lives. They want to find a sense of peace with the immanent reality of their own existence. They want to find ways to create meaning and infuse their lives with a sense of purpose that makes them feel complete.
 
As I mentioned, there might be some cultural variance here. I am not a psychologist, nor am I a sociologist, nor am I an anthropologist or a historian. Someone more knowledgeable on these subjects might be able to weigh in here.
 
**So, here’s a list of the specific “mass market evergreen niches” I’m referring to. Each of them ties into at least one of the general human desires I was talking about above.**
 
* **Mass media.** Celebrity bios, stuff about TV shows or entertainment history, that kind of thing. Also “geek stuff,” pop culture stuff, etc. Think “pop culture,” which kind of runs the gamut from trashy tabloids, to comic book and TV show fandoms, and everything in between. Everyone partakes of the mass media culture industry. There are radically different audiences within it -- from blue collar housewives who devour the latest from TMZ, to sophisticated urbanites with a refined appreciation of contemporary interior design and decor, to people who are geeks and proud of it, guys who play D&D or have an encyclopedic knowledge of Star Wars trivia. Sports stuff is in this category, too. Even fashion fits here.
 
* **Diet and weight loss.** This is America. We’ve got a massive obesity epidemic going on. We’re constantly surrounded by foods that are bursting with calories, but that aren’t very filling. (Seriously, take a look at the nutrition facts on those little cans of Coke and stuff. It’s insane.) People are always trying to lose weight -- and unfortunately, in most cases, failing at it. It can take some time to find a regimen that works for their personal tastes and their lifestyle.
 
* **Fitness.** Another thing people want is to get fit and get in shape. This one pairs well with weight loss and dieting, but it’s really its own distinct niche. Getting fit doesn’t always mean losing weight.
 
* **Self development.** Self-help books are always a perennial bestseller. One of the most important things we need to do in this life is to understand ourselves, and sometimes even better ourselves. I mean, think about it. None of us chose to be here, and if we did, we don’t remember it. We’re thrust into this world, as conscious beings capable of joy as well as suffering, facing down the eternal coldness of the hard problem of consciousness. People look for ways to infuse their lives with meaning and a sense of purpose. They look for a compass to guide them through life’s confusing twists and turns.
 
* **Cooking.** Everybody eats food. Some more, others less. So cooking is another perennial niche you can consider. Cookbooks sell like crazy, believe it or not.
 
* **Dating and relationships.** Finding a romantic partner is another big part of human life, at least for the majority of people. There are also the many problems of long term relationships and marriage -- dealing with disagreements, keeping sex interesting after multiple decades, rekindling romance in the wake of an empty nest, etc.
 
* **Gaming.** This one’s maybe a little more recent and modern than the others, but it really is a golden niche. I guess you could really stick this into the “mass media entertainment” category, but I thought it deserved a mention on its own.
 
* **Making money.** Everyone wants to find ways to bring in some extra cash. Money doesn’t buy happiness by any means, but what it *can* do is secure the base of the Maslow Pyramid. And that’s really important.
 
There are more to this list. But what’s important here is what these niches have in common: an appeal to basic, deep-seated, universal human desires for things like love, acceptance, wealth, and meaning.
 
So these things are evergreen. There is always money to be made. You might be thinking, “Aren’t these super saturated and high competition?”
 
Sometimes, but they’re also massive and broad. There’s plenty of room in these markets.
 
#The Key to “Niching Down”
You might not actually need to narrow your niche down as much as people seem to think you do. After all, go too niche, and you’re faced with a limited market. Sure, you might make some money, but you’ll hit a ceiling.
 
Anyway, **the key to pinpointing a subniche is to focus on answering a specific question or solving a specific problem.**
 
“How do I lose weight?” is a big thing, but it’s not necessarily super specific. There are a lot of ways to lose weight. There are also a lot of reasons for losing weight, and a lot of different subsections of the population of “people who want to lose weight.”
 
You’ve got people who are morbidly obese, whose very lives may depend on dropping the extra adipose tissue that’s slowly destroying their bodies.
 
But then, you’ve got, say, women in their 30s who aren’t obese, but who want to lose a few pounds. Like, 25 lbs or less. It’s not a health issue for them, so much as an issue of beauty, confidence, and sex appeal.
 
The way each of those groups goes about losing weight is going to be different. Their specific problems are different, and they’re looking for different things.
 
So let’s say you want to write an ebook and sell it on Amazon Kindle. You’ve got weight loss in mind as the topic. Cool.
 
Now, you need a specific problem.
 
#The Power of Autocomplete: Finding the Exact Questions Your Audience Is Asking
So what’s an example of a specific problem? And how do you go about looking for them?
 
You can find them by doing some keyword research. It’s not just for SEO -- it’s also a way to get a peek into what your audience is thinking.
 
In my case, the focus is on what people search for on Amazon. These days, when people want to buy something -- whether it’s a product or a book on a subject -- they’ll usually go to Amazon directly, rather than using Google.
 
But in other businesses, Google or even YouTube might be where you want to focus.
 
Whether it’s on Amazon or Google, you can learn a lot about what people are asking and where the demand is at by checking out what comes up with the autocomplete feature.
 
You can also check out resources like AnswerThePublic.com to find these questions, or use a tool like KeywordShitter or Keyword.io. The latter two actually draw from Google’s Autosuggest feature, so it’s a quicker way of getting that info than doing it manually.
 
Either way, you’ll find queries and searches like these, which are what you want to focus on.
 
“How To Lose Weight Without Diet And Exercise?”
“How To Draw For Kids”
“How To Lose Weight Journal”
“How To Cure A Migraine”
 
Sometimes they’re actually phrased in question format, and sometimes they’re not but you get the picture.
 
Hone in on these specific questions and searches. Then, offer your audience a specific answer.
 
Whether you’re putting together a buying guide for protein shakes or you’re writing a series of ebooks about weight loss and getting in shape, **you can maximize your profits by offering a specific solution to a specific problem.**
 
#This is what’s worked for me over the years: BIG Evergreen Niche --> Specific Problem Within That Niche
I’m not the only person offering this advice, or at least I don’t think I am. But, it works.
 
I realize that this subreddit is pretty diverse. Not all of us sell ebooks, or create monetized content. There are people here with cleaning services, with restaurants and bars, with brick and mortar boutiques, and more.
 
So my advice might not be applicable in every single case. But if you want to make some extra cash online, in a way that revolves around informational content, this strategy has worked time and time again.
 
I do hope this was helpful to some of you guys out there. Let me know if you’ve got any further questions about this stuff.

572,czzr9f,False,,358,"I’m 19 and with minimal responsibilities and a lot of free time, how do I invest in myself to benefit my future?",Entrepreneur,"I come from a really poor family in Australia. My Mum and her boyfriend have been unemployed my entire life and I’ve spent so much of my teenage years locked away in my room playing video games and numbing my brain, I did below average in school and consider myself extremely socially illiterate. 
I’m not explaining for pity points I’m just giving context for advice. 

The toughest thing I feel like I can’t overcome is how I literally don’t know how society works.
I know that sounds weird but i never did anything as a child. I can confidently state that outside of school I spent 97% (I missed A LOT of school) of my time in-doors either playing video games or doing chores.

I didn’t fully understand as a child that I would typically need to work 40 hours a week to live and operate in society functionally, I was 16 when the idea started setting in that my parents were not normal and I have been incredibly isolated from how society functions and the norms of life. 

I have to admit, I didn’t take the measures I should have in realising this to set up a better future. I was still lazy, didn’t do work, bludged and half arsed EVERYTHING I did. I started a course  and dropped out halfway, I’m now doing and introductory course for a university which I still gives me so much free time in my week.

I live with my sister in a really small shitty flat and live really frugally. What do I with my time? I’m still somewhat socially illiterate and have no idea how to do things or start a business. I want to invest in myself.

Find which quadrant(s) your company fits in, and test those channels first.

* The size of the bubbles is the rough scale of the channel, based on public data. It’s best to start in the biggest channel bubbles first, since they have the most potential to scale.

* It’s roughly color coded: orange/yellows are channels better for e-commerce, blueish channels are better for B2B, and green is good for either.

346,8sqb7q,False,,242,If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money,Entrepreneur,"Most people don't understand online automation. They don't even realize that almost all their cyber-chores can be automated inexpensively. They think that Automation is too expensive and/or meant for larger enterprises. But fact is if any part of your business depends on the internet (And let's face it, this is 2018. Everything does) chances are automation can save you a lot of time. Whether it's automatically processing orders, keeping an eye on your competitors or just some cyber-chores.

Disclosure: I own two small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

It's hard to explain exactly what can be automated so I'll instead give you an intuition by giving you a few examples:

Online car rental - One of my clients rented out cars via several online car rental websites. Each day he'd log into each website, browse various pages (Some websites with multiple accounts) and create an Excel spreadsheet of all the cars that have been booked, updated locations of each car etc. This took him about 1-2 hours per day. For $300, he now gets an updated spreadsheet in his Google Drive every 30 minutes with no action required by him.

Form generation - Another SMB client provided legal services. They would access data from an Excel sheet, fill it out on a PDF form then print it and mail it to a government office. He would then track the application online on their website to know the status of the application every day. Now a script automatically reads the Excel sheet, fills and prints out the form and also automatically tracks the status of every application and updates it in another Google Drive sheet.

Competitor watch - Another client had to check their competitor's e-commerce websites regularly to keep an eye on their prices, this took them about 3-6 hours of work every week. Instead they now have a script that E-Mails them every time a price change is detected on a competitor's website within 5 minutes of the price change happening.

This should give you an intuition for the kind of things that online automation can do for you. If you have any questions feel free to comment and I'll try to give you as thorough an answer as possible!

I’m [Kristy Kim](https://imgur.com/a/QlICr3s), the CEO of TomoCredit, and we are creating the credit card of tomorrow with no fees, no interest rates, and no credit history required. Our underwriting system focuses on analyzing cash flows and alternative data sets to approve individuals for our card. You can check us out [here](https://tomocredit.com/?ref=entreama) if you're interested.

When I graduated college with a full-time investment banking role in San Francisco, I got rejected 5 times for a car loan, so I BOUGHT MY FIRST CAR WITH CASH. Also, I could not rent an apartment because I had no credit history. Moving forward, I realized that I was not alone in this situation. Over 30 million students or recent graduates have purchasing power with low or no credit scores. Millions of deserving Americans, especially millennials, cannot access affordable necessities- auto loans, mortgage rates, insurance, and more because of lack of credit history and knowledge of the U.S. credit system. Understanding this, I decided to build a new type of credit card that doesn’t rely on the old outdated credit score model.

Fast forward a few years and now TomoCredit is part of Barclays accelerator in NYC, we’ve been featured on Forbes, American Banker, and more! We have over 20,000 on the wait list and expect to launch in August.

I’m always open for discussion about startups, how to raise money, work-life balance, where to start, entrepreneurship, successes & failures, credit building, etc. Ask me anything!

EDIT 1: FAQ on user data, business model, etc.

""we do not sell data to anyone. we keep our user data securely, we follow all the major bank-grade security (it is required by law to issue credit cards, and we already have passed their review successfully) Also, we are FDIC insured.""

"" I can tell you with 200% confidence that we have not, and won't sell your data. We already have a great solid business model. we make good money from merchants. (interchange fee) we don't need to sell data to make money""

""Tomo makes money from standard interchange fee 2-3% from merchants, not from customers. (It is common, whenever you swipe your card, there is interchange fees that merchant covers) Typically credit card companies make money from three things: 1. Interchange fee from merchants 2. Interest rate (think of Capital one charging 10-30% APR) 3. Membership fees (like Amex charging you $600 annual membership fee). Tomo does not charge #2 and #3. We make money in clean, simple way- interchange fee only""

Stop listening to vague BS and stop watching unsubstantive pep talks with general common sense telling you to start an internet marketing company or some other bogus career.

Literally, go out and network with actual industry leaders, compel them to grab coffee with you, ask thoughtful questions and they will tell you what it takes to be successful.

###  The 7 Rules of Money

1. **Start Thy Purse to Fattening**: Make some money, or save some money. I prefer the first option, but if you immediately can't do the first then do the second. The point is to watch the money build up - watch the coins stack - ASAP. This is great for your psyche, and will provide opportunity to invest wisely later on.

2. **Control Thy Expenditures**: Don't spend more than you make on non-money making activities. Simple. You can create a formula for budgeting that works for you, but get the simple version down before you get complex.

3. **Make Thy Gold Multiply**: Invest! Invest in yourself, your business, or real estate. Why this order? Any investment in yourself is almost guaranteed to give a positive return. Buy that book, go to that seminar, take that course, hire that coach. Max this out every year. Then you'll naturally start to make more money. Once you can't spend any more on your own growth and learning, invest in your business / invest in your profession and occupation. If you own a business already, hire that new contractor or salesmen. If you're still working a 9-5, work less hours and put more time into your business. Finally, invest in real estate or similar funds. My  business is real estate, so I threw first second and third together into a killer combination. 

4. **Guard Thy Treasures from Loss**: Be wise, and don't invest in what you don't know. Don't jump at the first deal you see. A parachute isn't too open nor is it too closed. Be open to new opportunity, but don't stray from your area of expertise unless you're willing to become an expert in that field before investing.

5. **Make of Thy Dwelling a Profitable Investment**: E.g. live buy a multifamily unit and live 
one apartment, rent the other apartment(s) for an amount greater than the mortgage. Make sure you have enough saved up to cover vacancies, repair, and property taxes. 

6. **Ensure a Future Income**: The average millionaire has 7 steams of income, so never put all your eggs in one basket. This point also means filling your pipeline as much as possible (and having as many pipes as possible!). Always have a new project in the works, a new investment to consider, and a new lead to sell.

7. **Improve Thy Ability to Earn**: If you're not constantly updating your skillsets and understanding of the world around you, you're falling behind. Keep inertia on your side and maintain constant momentum to learn, try, and understand. Make learning a habit and watch your income and quality of life overall grow rapidly.
    
&nbsp; 
    
### Fulfillment in Life is Very, Very Tough if You're Struggling Financially

* It's very challenging to live a fulfilling life without money

* The laws of money are like the laws of physics: surefire & unchanging.

* Money is plentiful for those who understand its laws.

* Always have money coming in that assures a full purse. AKA - **always have a cash flow!**

* “It costs nothing to ask wise advice from a good friend.” **Alright, this one is huge.** The world is full of wealthy, wise, successful people who are more than happy to give away their greatest ""secrets to success"" to anyone who's willing to ask and lend an ear. When I was just getting started in real estate, I went to the top performers in my area and asked them how they did it. I literally copied what they told me to do, word for word. A decade later I flipped over 3,000 houses. Now I'm doing $20MM a year and not looking back. Thanks for the advice!

* This one relates back to [*Think and Grow Rich*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePaineCollective/comments/7j6qel/betterthananmba_book_1_think_and_grow_rich/). The reason why most people never become wealthy is because they never *truly* commit to accumulating wealth.

* **Pay yourself first.** Everyone and everything will want your money -- from Uncle Sam who wants another nuke to Uncle Sal who lost his job. If you don't pay yourself first you'll never understand where you money goes.

* **You should save at least 10% of what you earn. More if you can afford to do so.**

* Do not take financial from a mason (*how about advice on taking over the world?*). Instead, ask the experts for opinions on their field expertise.

* Build the fortune of a king before living like one. **Don’t spend your money as soon as you earn it.**

* Surround yourself with people who've mastered the laws of money and make lots of it. **You are the average of the people you spend time with!**

* **Do not put your money in investments which do not pay a dividend.** Again, it's all about cash flow baby! Fill that pipeline!

* Don't confuse necessary expenses with desires.

* **“A man’s wealth is not in the coins in his purse. It is in his income.”**

* Ensure a future income. Everyone gets old. **Make sure your income will continue to work for you when you no longer can.**

* Increase your ability to earn. Improve your skillsets, fill your mind with knowledge and train your hands with practice.

* The more we know, the more we may earn.

* **You cannot arrive at the fullest measure of success until you crush the spirit of procrastination within you... *I'm looking at you, Reddit*.**

### The 5 Laws of Gold

1. Gold comes easily and in increasing quantity to the person who saves at least 1/10th of their earnings.

2. Gold labors diligently and multiplies for the person who finds it profitable employment.

3. Gold clings to the protection of the person who invests their gold with wise people.

4. Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar.

5. Gold flees the person who tries to force it into impossible earnings.

&nbsp; 

* If you desire to help you friend do not do so in a way that brings their burdens onto you. **There are many ways to help people. You don’t have to choose the ways that restrict your time, money, energy, or ability to care for yourself.**

* The wise lender always has a guarantee of repayment should the investment go poorly.

* Above all you should desire safety for your money. Better a little caution than a great regret.

* Protect yourself with insurance. You cannot afford to be unprotected.

* Do not live beyond your means.

* No man respects himself if he does not repay his debts.

* The soul of a free man looks at the world as a series of problems to be solved. Meanwhile, the soul of a slave whines, “What can I do?”

* If you are in debt, live on 70% of what you make. Save 10% for yourself. Use the remaining 20% to repay your debts.

* **Stick with the plan. Money accrues surprisingly quickly and debts are gone fast with discipline and consistency.**

* **Work attracts friends who admire your industriousness, along with money and opportunity. “Hard work is the best friend I've ever had.”**

386,ga300y,False,Case Study,226,I sold $100K worth of videos and PDFs in 4 months,Entrepreneur,"On Christmas day of 2019, I released my first info product (a technical ebook [1]). Earlier this week, I released my second product (a short video course [2]). I announced both on Twitter [3][4], and I let word of mouth do the rest.

In the 4 months since, I sold $100K worth of videos and PDFs [5]. 95% of that is directly attributable to my Twitter account: some customers were my followers, and some customers were referred to by my followers. (The other 5% came from a paid marketing campaign I started recently.)

The fascinating thing to me is that I started posting on Twitter only last year. In my first 14 months on Twitter, my tweets were seen 35 million times, and received 1.7 million clicks of some sort (likes, retweets, link clicks, and things like that). Imagine how much you’d have to pay Google or Facebook to get that kind of attention!

256,44atb3,False,,253,"How To Grow Your Instagram Account From 0 to 50,000 Real Quick, Real Friggin Quick [Case Study]",Entrepreneur,"What's up /r/Entrepreneur! I've posted here before about my freelance business a few times but today I want to talk about Instagram. While it appears everyone is flocking from Instagram to Snapchat (thanks DJ Khaled) I'm still viewing Instagram as a channel that most businesses should and still can utilize to achieve serious success. 

Around this time last year, we launched the [@HustleGrindCo](https://www.instagram.com/hustlegrindco/) Instagram account and were unsure how exactly we'd monetize it. Since then, we've grown the account to more than 70,000 followers and are generating about 200ish new follows each and every day [[Check out our Dashboard](http://imgur.com/db7ZeXl) via [Dash Hudson](https://dashhudson.com/)]. In this post, I want to share with you one of the most tried and tested tactics we used to grow our account. 

My hope is that you'll take a page from our book, apply it to your own Instagram account and start bringing in results similar to us. In additional transparency, we're bringing in about $30k from sales directly related to IG posts and content. I point this out because we're still small fries when you compare us to brands like [@Frank_Bod](https://www.instagram.com/frank_bod/) or @ShopPrivateParty.

**Let's get to it...**

**Leverage The Following Of Other Instagram Accounts To Acquire New Followers**
-------


In the world of Instagram marketing, this tactic tends to be broken into two different categories:

1) Shout outs and

2) Product placements

A shout out is when you see one account promoting another by sharing their content or literally giving them a shout out in the caption.

When you're planning to leverage shout-outs, it's important to understand who you're targeting. Take the time to research your industry by searching for hashtags that are relevant and looking at the top posts. Let's say you're responsible for creating an Instagram account for a Yoga Mat company,[ the process might look like this](http://imgur.com/smuMpZJ).

You start by searching for a top hashtag.

Luckily, Instagram will give you recommendations on popular hashtags by simply searching a generic term. In the example above, I typed 'Yoga' and was quickly recommended hashtags like #YogaEverywhere, #YogaLove and #YogaEveryDamnDay. I clicked the first one and was taken to a feed filled with today's most popular posts that used this hashtag.

Once you've identified the influencer, it's time to reach out.

Some accounts will have their email directly in their bio while others will require a bit of digging. If you can't find the email on their website or via their bio, reach out via direct message on Instagram or comment publicly on one of their posts expressing that you want to chat about a possible opportunity.

Now that you know how to reach out, it's time to understand what happens next.

But before we do that, I'm going to share with you a mistake that I've made in the past that I don't want you to fall victim to as well. It's a strategy that could work a bit better if you have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend but if you only have hundreds or a few thousands - I'd avoid it.

What is it?

**The Free Product & Pray Strategy**
------


This is the idea of sending products to influencers after getting their address and just hoping that they'll share your product.

When we launched Hustle & Grind, we sent out products to about 25 different influencers all across the US and Canada with the hope of seeing a handful of Instagram and social media shots with our product. Of the 20, we were able to account for just four different influencers who actually shared the product on social media.

If you're going to take this approach, include instructions with your product expressing that you would love it if they pushed any photos to their social media channels. And to take it a step further, write them beforehand and confirm that they would be willing to share photos in exchange for product.

So what's the better approach?

**Hire Influencers To Take Photos With Your Shots**
-----

This approach to product placement gives you a 100% guarantee.

You follow the steps highlighted above where I talk about influencer identification and then reach out letting them know you want to hire them. Here's an example of the email I've sent in the past:


> Hey [Influencers Name] - Love your work on Instagram.
> 
> I saw you were a coffee fan on Instagram and thought I should reach out!
> 
> As a bit of info, I'm the co-founder of Hustle & Grind. A subscription service for entrepreneurs and professionals that sends coffee, gear and tools to people around the world trying to achieve success. We also offer a handful of different products like [inspirational posters](https://hustleandgrind.co/shop/purpose-18x24/) & [awesome mugs](https://hustleandgrind.co/product-category/mugs/).
> 
> We're looking for a few folks to send a couple products and have them upload those photos to Instagram in exchange for the gear. Is this something you would be interested in? You can check out some of our products in [our shop](https://hustleandgrind.co/shop/). We would love to make this work. Have you done Insta shots with brands before? Do you charge for this? If so, what's your rates like?
> 
> Let me know - Would love to figure out a way to work together.

Once you send them your outreach it's the waiting game. Some influencers will agree to take the photos for free and others will require payment. From what I've seen, the cost for an influencer to take a photo can range anywhere from $25, $50, or as much as $50,000 depending on their experience and following. Here's a photo and product placement that we had [implemented by an influencer](http://imgur.com/Iglau0T).

Paying for product placements has been a strategy that has helped some brands grow to online stardom.

A great example is of this in action is Frank Body, a coffee scrub company that has grown like wildfire using Instagram with an estimated sales of roughly $20 million in the last year. When talking about Influencers, during a recent podcast, the co-founders expressed that they paid Jen Selter $20,000 for a product placement.

At the time, Jen had around 6M followers on Instagram but today she has more than 8.2M followers and some sources believe she's charging $50,000 per Instagram post. One additional benefit when working with Instagram influencers is that they may also share on other networks [like this Tweet from Jen Selter promoting Frank Body](https://twitter.com/jenselter/status/509475180540735488).

**Paid Influencer Shout Outs**
-------

Nathan Chan of Foundr Magazine ([strongly recommend you check them out](https://www.instagram.com/foundrmagazine/)) refers to these strategic partnerships as one of the biggest drivers for growth on his company's Instagram account. At this time, he's grown the Foundr Instagram account to more than 400,000 followers and that number is growing daily!

Foundr spent about $100 on shout-outs in the first two weeks of their Instagram account, and it was $100 well spent. This became instrumental in getting them to their first 10,000 followers.

Similar to Foundr, we paid for a handful of shout outs to help grow from 10,000 to 25,000. The approach was very similar to what you would do for a product placement except the image shared can fall into three different categories: (1) Caption Shout out, (2) Caption + Image Shout out or (3) Screenshot Of Your Account shout out.

The most effective type of shout are those in which your entire account is screenshotted and the influencer tells their followers to check out your profile. It looks like a grid of 9 photos and your profile handle - this approach tends to drive the most followers because it's such a clear call to action and no question what you're asking your followers to do.

For a caption shout out, the influencer simply has to mention you in the caption of their post while with an image, they have to share an image of your choice. [Here's an example of a caption +image shout out in action](http://imgur.com/v1Pz03O).

**Strategic Shouts For Shouts**
------

What's even better than a shout for shout is one that's done for free.

As you build your account on Instagram, build meaningful relationships with people who have an audience similar to your brand. Establish these relationships by giving lots without receiving anything in return.

How can you make that happen? Shout out their accounts before you reach out to them asking for a shout out in return.

Now, you don't want the mistake of aiming for the account with 100k+ followers when you only have 10,000. Instead, aim to build a relationship with someone with 20,000 followers by commenting on their photos, liking their pictures and giving them a shout out now and again.

Once the relationship has been established, you will truly begin to form a connection. Or at least, that's what we've found in the relationships we've built on Instagram.

Today, we share shout outs back and forth with other accounts who are also committed to creating and distributing great content. Here's an example of a [shout out going back and forth between our account and @Rich20Something](http://imgur.com/vRQEsbe).

We both benefit from being placed in front of each others audience and likely gaining new followers in return.

**What To Do Next...**

Understand that this strategy is only going to pay dividends if you're very targeted with who you recieve shout outs from. If you're running a gamer account, you're not going to go after an fitness model. Ok, maybe you will... But... Be strategic!

Every three months I give away $3,000 (3x$1,000) to budding entrepreneurs. There's no string attached and anyone can apply. 

Here are the previous winner: 

* [round 1](https://sampriestley.com/entrepreneurship-grants-winners/)
* [round 2](https://sampriestley.com/entrepreneurship-grant-finalists-vote-now/)

**How it works**

* Write a short essay (under 1,500 words), explaining why you want the money and how it will help your business.
* Email it to grants@sampriestley.com by 30 Nov.
* I will choose 15 finalists by 15 Dec. And a public vote will choose the winners by 31 Dec.
* The top 3 applications with the most votes will each get $1,000.

That's the jist of it. The official page of the grants [is here, with some more guidelines of what I am looking for](https://sampriestley.com/entrepreneurship-grants/). 

Basically, you need to demonstrate both a need for the money and some proof that you are taking the business seriously. Please no ""I am raising 100,000 and this is 1% towards it"" or ""I have this idea that I might or might not do, please can I have money"".

**Why Am I Giving Away Money?**

I have a few motivations, but the one you're looking for is that it is an experiment I hope will pay for itself. The grants are funded by my blog (sampriestley.com), and to grow my readership I need more people finding it and I need more links to grow my SEO presence. I hope that by giving away the grants I will be able get in front of enough new readers to cover my costs.

I used to spend $1,000 a month on an SEO guy to do link building, now I spend $1,000 a month on grants. And if the experiment doesn't work out, at least I'm helping some people.

So if you think this is a cool idea and want to support me, please tell people about it! Or link to me from your site. Or write about the grants to your big-shot journalist mate.

Good luck!

499,ac8rqr,False,,488,My founding story,Entrepreneur,"I'm just an average dude from a middle class family in the midwest.

While an undergrad in college in 2011 I bought a $3k cargo van on craigslist and started offering pickup and delivery storage services. The first year my partner and I acquired about 50 customers. We grew the business and expanded to a few schools each year and did a lot of the work ourselves.

We didn't bring on any outside capital and fully bootstrapped the company. We slowly built processes and hired a team and took ourselves largely out of the equation. We eventually invested most of our profits into real estate development (self storage) and we now own two facilities and have two more projects in the pipeline.

This past year (2018) we serviced over 10,000 customers and generated about $3M in revenue. I'm officially a millionaire before the age of 30. I could work as little as 2 hours a day from anywhere in the world and continue to out earn most lawyers for the rest of my life. I work a lot more because I love building and the adventure of it. I don't say this to brag.

Its now my mission to convince other smart entrepreneurs to focus on service based businesses that you can start up with little money and little risk. You can generate real wealth and you can leverage it into other opportunities for even greater wealth down the road. In college I connected with a lot of other entrepreneurs and of the 20 or so people pursuing tech startups not a one succeeded. They all went and got real jobs.

By the time you finish reading this post, you’ll know how to use & deploy this simple hack which my agency uses to get 10X+ more ad engagement (social proof) for our clients, at no extra cost.

[Here’s a couple of ads on which we deployed this hack
](https://imgur.com/iYGdguB)

Deploying this won’t take you more than a couple of minutes, and results will be visible within 24 hours. You’ll get more engagement (likes, comments and shares), which will result in even more engagement, which ultimately results in higher CTR, lower CPM, lower CPC, lower CPA & more revenue.

**The Social Stacking Method On Facebook**

The standard Facebook campaign structure looks something like this > 
[The Standard Campaign Structure on Facebook ](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/standard.png)

You have a campaign which is made for a specific offer or a promotion. Inside of the campaign you have 100s of ad sets which are targeting different audiences with 100s of different ads. 

As the campaign progresses and you gather more data, you find a **winner ad** which performs better than any other ad. 

Then, you’ll make 100s of ad sets again. Each ad set will contain **the same winner ad**, but instead of having just one ad, you have **100s of copies of that same winner ad**. Absurd, right?

By having this kind of campaign structure, all of those 100s of copies of the same ad are going to pick up some engagement. 

Couple of likes, comments or shares… But what if you could stack up all that engagement a.k.a. social proof, to one single ad? Luckily, you can.

We call this “The Social Stacking”.

The idea behind the social stacking is very simple —  Instead of having 100s of ad sets pointing to 100s of copies of the same ad, you’re going to point all of your ad sets to a single ad. 

Here’s what’s different in the campaign structure > [The Social Stacking Campaign Structure ](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/social-stacking.png)

Here’s how the social stacking looks in practice >
[E1 \(MAIN\) is the main ad to which all ad sets are pointed to](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ads-Manager-101-1.png)

**How To Deploy The Social Stacking Method?**

As I’ve promised, deploying this takes no more than a couple of minutes. This method applies only to the newsfeed placement, on both Facebook (desktop and mobile) and Instagram (mobile only), where engagement can be seen in the form of reactions, comments and shares.

Open your Facebook Ads Manager and take the following steps:

**Step 1 —Select the ad**

Select an ad to which you want to point all ad sets (on the ad level of the campaign) and click *Edit*. [\(See here\)](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ads-Manager-Manage-Ads-Ads.png)

**Step 2 — Acquire the ad ID**

In the *Ad Preview* section click on *Share Preview* button, then click on the *Facebook Post with Comments*. If you’re running ads on Instagram, you’ll click on *Instagram Post with Comments*. [\(See here\)](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hack-1-1.png)

Once the ad loads, take a look at the URL. 

On Facebook, you’ll have 2 strings of numbers interrupted by */posts/* in the middle. Select and copy the 2nd string of numbers. [\(See here\)](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hack-2.png)

If you’re doing this for Instagram you’ll get only one string, which you’ll select and copy.

**Step 3 — Apply the ad ID**

In this step, you’ll need to either make a new ad set or duplicate the existing one (duplicating is faster). Change whatever you want (age range, country, gender, interest, etc) and then go to the ad level of this new ad set. 

Click on *Edit* again and then click on *Use Existing Post*. [\(See here\)](https://www.blog.udonis.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Use-Existing-Post.png)

Click on *Enter Post ID* and paste the ad ID you acquired in **STEP 2**.

 
Click *Submit* and then *Publish* the ad.

**Step 4 — Duplicate as many times as you want**

The easiest way to point more ad sets to this ad is to duplicate the 2nd ad set you’ve created (because it already uses an existing post from the 1st ad set). 

The social stacking method is also good because it allows you to add multiple new ad sets in a matter of minutes. This is particularly useful if you’re running robust split testing systems or launching a new product.

**The Next Steps…**

I posted here [2 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/) to share my story/solicit advice about creating a cheap flights emails list.

**Tl;dr:** I run a freemium email list that alerts people when there's a really good deal on international flights. I started it by popular demand from friends after I used my cheap-flight-finding-obsession to get $130 roundtrip flights from NYC to Milan in 2013. (you can check it out [here](http://www.flyforfreeguide.com/email-list/) if you're interested, but zero pressure to sign up or anything!)

Wanted to give you guys an update, offer some more firsthand data points, and most importantly, get continued feedback about what I could be doing better!

**General updates:**

* 2 months ago: 652 premium subscribers, 3,178 free subscribers, and $6,188 in revenue. Today: 1,687 premium subscribers, 7,847 free subscribers, and $24,376 in revenue. (Expenses are around $150/month for Mailchimp, Formcrafts, Zapier, MRR.io, and testing out Facebook ads.)

* Per the advice of u/Mwootto I transitioned away from monthly charges for customers. Now there's three options: quarterly, bi-annually, or annually. The feedback from customers has been very positive because it's less hassle for them to have constant charges, plus it's resulted in far fewer credit card processing fees to pay on my end.

* u/freddyarium gave some EXCELLENT advice that I wasn't doing enough to tell new subscribers what to expect from the list, and that the welcome emails were lackluster. I hadn't realized that shortcoming, but he (or she) was completely right. I went back and completely transformed the onboarding process, not only giving people a better sense of what to expect, but also creating an automated series of emails for free subscribers with testimonials and the benefits of upgrading to premium.

* Per the advice of u/exitstrategy1 I decided to increase the prices slightly. Originally I charged a flat rate of $2/month for premium subscribers. New premium subscribers now have the option of $9/quarter, $15 bi-annually, or $29/year.

* I hired a second person, Brian, to help grow the list. It was becoming unmanageable to spend hours looking for cheap flights AND more hours trying to do marketing & logistics for the list itself. The list wouldn't be anywhere near as successful today without a second set of hands.

**Major sources of new subscribers:**

* Media hits. A few weeks ago, Conde Nast Traveler posted a ""Deal of the Day"" to their website referencing one of the deals I found and sent out to my list. Brian got in touch with the writer to see if she was interested in writing about the list. As luck had it she was and a few days ago an [article](www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-02-09/top-10-cheap-flight-deals-of-2016) about the cheap flights list went up! In the two days since, there's been over 1,200 new free subscribers and more than 350 new premium subscribers.

* Reddit. It feels self-congratulatory to say it, but everyone here knows I'd be lying if I said otherwise. Posting these business case studies and other similar AMAs -- like donating my time to help people find cheap flights -- has led to at least 1,000 new free subscribers and 250+ premium subscribers.

* If you look at this [chart](http://imgur.com/WTnlzsI) of new customers created, the first two spikes are from successful Reddit posts and the most recent one is from the CN Traveler article.

**Less successful efforts:**

* Facebook ads. We tried some different possibilities for a week and put in $50 or so towards the effort, but it became pretty clear right away that it wasn't generating much ROI. Part of that is we're not well setup enough with analytics to track the lifetime value of free/premium subscribers and whether the ads are generating more money than they're costing. Might revisit this down the road, but any advice from people in the know is certainly appreciated.

The company has an incentive to reward the idea creator because if it's a valuable thought, then they will want to secure the future possibility of more valuable thoughts through positive PR.

433,hqhv3j,False,Young Entrepreneur,234,"Why todays entrepreneur ""culture"" is scary.. *A RANT*",Entrepreneur,"Hello all!

Hope you're all healthy and are crushing your goals awhile the world is up in flames with covid lol.

So this has been on my mind for awhile lately and I figured I'd come on here and see if other people have similar thoughts..

Todays entrepreneurial culture is scary.. And I think the perception created by social media is the reasoning behind it.

I live in LA. LA is a town where if you have sold 1 bamboo toothbrush on shopify, you're suddenly a successful entrepreneur. Or if you run a private snapchat promoting onlyfan girls, you're an entrepreneur. Oh, and my favorite, if you DONT have a i8, a dangling cross earring, a Gucci sweatshirt, and a house in the hills that's ""yours"", you are a waste to society because you're not an ""entrepreneur"". 

But then you talk to these ""entrepreneurs"" in conversation about taxes or ROAS or business structure and they have zero clue what you're talking about. 

On another note, let's talk about culture in general. Because of social media, EVERY college kid majoring in entrepreneurship suddenly think they are going to build a technology company in their dorm room and sell it to Linkedin for $500M when they've never even made $1 online. And yet those same kids are out drinking every single night because ""It's for the boys"".

People today are obsessed with looking successful rather than actually being successful. I'm sorry dude, but you driving through Beverly Hills on a Sunday for 5 hours in your bright blue chrome Ferrari makes you look like an idiot, not successful.

This post is more for humor and a rant, don't take it too seriously. And if you run a shopify store, good for you, that's amazing. I run multiple myself. Just sharing some sterotypes haha.

Let's crush the rest of 2020!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/hqhv3j/why_todays_entrepreneur_culture_is_scary_a_rant/,646,"I’m a devil’s advocate by trade and the only thing I really disagree with is taxes, ROAS, business structure; those are now outsourceable.

508,e1pn65,False,,111,THE 4-HOUR WORK WEEK by Timothy Ferriss - my full book notes and full summary/review,Entrepreneur," Hey everyone,

I thought this would be useful for those looking to outsource tasks for their business or wanted to find ways to reduce the amount of time they spend on non-important tasks. The book was quite long, so below I've first put my summarised version, and below that is a much longer version of my original written notes that i made whilst reading the book.

I've also made an animated version of them here: [https://youtu.be/K4JXPebwedU](https://youtu.be/K4JXPebwedU), so you can go over my summary notes via whichever form you prefer.

**Summary notes:**

* Hello, optimum insight here, in today’s post I’m going to summarise ‘The 4-hour work-week’ by Timothy Ferriss.
* Now this kind of work week is said to be for the new rich. Who are the new rich, you ask? The new rich are those whose currencies are time and mobility. They use these currencies to achieve full lifestyle design.
* Why is lifestyle so important, well think about this: when people talk about having £1m, usually what they really mean is that they want to have the lifestyle that this money can provide. Thus, the new rich focus on the lifestyle they want and leverage factors like currency differences to help them achieve this faster.
* The goal of the book is for you to obtain the lifestyle that the new rich have. The key to this lifestyle is to free your time and automate your income. This income must be location-independent, as once you free your time and location, your money is automatically worth 3-10 times as much.The point of this kind of freedom is to give you options as this is what real power is in life, having the ability to choose.
* Now there are four steps to achieving this life which anyone can follow.
* These four steps can summarised by the word: DEAL, which stands for definition, elimination, automation and liberation. This is the order I will follow in this video, but for those of you watching that are employees you must follow this as DELA, focusing on liberation from your job before automation.
* So the first step is definition. We all have different goals and priorities, Tim recommends having defined dreams to chase with timelines and written-out steps. Most people will never know what they want, hence the first step is the most important. The book specifies that these goals are not for happiness, they are for excitement which is actually a more practical synonym for happiness. So to help you with the definition step here are two things I want you to do:

1. Firstly, Ask yourself what would excite me?
2. Secondly, Use dreamlining to set goals. This is simply where you apply timelines to dreams. Tim splits his dreamlining into three parts, which are having, being and doing, for both a six and twelve month timeline. After having goals for each category, there is a number you must calculate called your required target monthly income. You work it out add the monthly cost of reaching these goals and add 1.3 times your monthly expenses to them represented by A+B+C+(1.3\*monthly expenses).

* Now the second step is elimination. To eliminate inefficiencies in any tasks, following the Parkinson's law and the 80/20 rule is vital. Parkinson’s law states that a task will swell in importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted to it. For instance, the more time available to write an essay, the more important and complicated the task may seem.The 80/20 rule on the other hand says that 80% of your outputs come from 20% of your inputs.
* Now looking at automation, you must learn how to outsource and be able to define clear rules and processes for assistants to follow before hiring them. Tim recommends that you identify your top five time-consuming non-work tasks and five personal tasks you could outsource for sheer fun. The result of this should be that you have more free time, whilst still creating large work outputs.
* Now outsourcing is important, but having the right type of business can increase your chances of success. The ideal business for those who want the 4-hour work week lifestyle would be one where you sell information products which you can micro-test with advertisements. Before I move on, remember that the goal is not to automate everything, you first want to eliminate as many things as possible, and thus only automate what is left, which should only be what is most important.
* The final step to be part of the new rich is liberation. For employees this means persuading your company to let you work remotely, which the book tells you how to achieve. Liberation means having a business or job giving you cashflow and location independence, whilst you put in fewer inputs and achieve higher outputs.
* One last thing I’d like to mention is that the dream lifestyle mentioned in this book is more doable that most people think. Why? Well because travelling can actually be very cheap, and furthermore rather than trying to retire completely, why not just have mini-retirements? why not work for 2 months and retire for one month and then repeat?
* Remember: true freedom is about having enough income and time to do what you actually want to do with your life.
* If you liked this post, please support me in making more by subbing to my channel 'Optimum Insight,' thank you.

**My full notes:**

**My story and why you need this book:**

* Tango for 5months, 6hr practices vs. couples with average 15 yrs together, they won.
* Epidemic: job descriptions = self-descriptions.
* New Rich (NR) use the currency of the NR: time and mobility = Lifestyle Design.
* **Leverage currency differences**
* People don’t want £1m, they want the lifestyle it can provide.
* Test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation:  

   * How do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?
   * What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it?
   * Is it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?
* Goal: free time and automate income
* Be a dealmaker:  

   * Manifesto: Reality is negotiable
* Deal: definition, elimination, automation, liberation.  

   * Employees must implement as DELA

**Chronology of a Pathology:**

* ‘Karooshi’ - phenomenon where people work themselves to death.
* Speed reading classes: found a market before designing the product = smarter.

**Chp1: Step1: D is for Definition:**

* Different goals/priorities, e.g. not the boss, but to be the owner.  

   * E.g. make a ton of money, but with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps included. What are you working for?
   * Rather than big payday, aiming for cashflow first.
* ‘If you can free your time and location, your money is automatically worth 3-10 times as much.
* Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: **What** you do, **when** you do it, **where** you do it, and with **whom** you do it. This is called the freedom multiplier.’  

   * Using this as criterion: the 80-hr per wk $500k pyear investment banker is less powerful than the employed NR who works ¼ hrs for $40,000, but has complete freedom of when, where and how to live.
* **Options** \- the ability to choose = is real power.
* Options are limitless but first step: **replacing assumptions**

**Chp 2: Rules that Change the Rules:**

* Won gold medal in Chinese Kickboxing National Championships by exploiting opportunities in the rules.  

   * Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested. Same is true in life
* Different is only better when it is more effective or more fun
* 1.) Retirement = a hedge against becoming physically incapable of working and needing capital to survive. Shouldn’t be goal because:  

   * Based on assumption you hate what your doing.
   * Most people will never be able to retire + maintain a good standard of living
   * You’ll get damn bored.
* Thus, retirement shouldn’t be the goal, but yes do plan for the worst case.
* 2.) Interest and energy are cyclical  

   * Alternating periods of activity and rest is important, thus do mini-retirements for higher productivity overall = having cake + eat it too.
   * Timothy does 1 month overseas relocation or high-intensity learning for every 2 months of work projects.
* 3.) Less is NOT laziness  

   * Our culture rewards personal sacrifice rather than personal productivity. Thus, not lazy to do less meaningless work to focus on things of greater personal importance.
   * Focus on being productive instead of busy.
* 4.) The Timing is Never Right  

   * conditions are never perfect, but if its important to you, just do it and correct course along the wat.
* 5.) Ask for forgiveness, not permission  

   * Try it and then justify it, as long as not going to devastate those around you.
* 6.) Emphasise strengths, don’t fix weaknesses
* 7.) Things in excess become their opposite  

   * Goal is not idle time, but more positive use of free time doing what you want as oppose to what have to do.
* 8.) Money Alone is not the solution  

   * By pretending money is solution you create a constant distraction preventing you from seeing just how pointless it is.
   * The problem is more than money
* 9.) Relative income is more important than absolute income  

   * Absolute income is measured via one variable: the dollar
   * Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours.
* 10.) Distress is bad, Eustress is good  

   * New Rich (NR) don’t aim to eliminate all stress.
   * Distress: harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident.
   * Eustress: healthy. Role models push us to exceed are limits.
   * Its destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all forms.

**Chp 3: Dodging bullets:**

* Conquering Fear = Defining Fear. Once defined, looked at how he could deal with these scenarios.
* Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalisation.

1. Define nightmare
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage?
3. What are outcomes of more probable scenarios?
4. If you were fired today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
5. What are you putting off out of fear?
6. What is it costing you to postpone action?
7. What are you waiting for?

**Chp 4: System reset:**

* Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic.  

   * As 95% people are convinced incapable of achieving great things, they aim for mediocre. The level of competition is most for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming.
   * Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides endurance to go along with any goal.
* **Most people will never know what they want.**
* Goals are not for happiness, are for **excitement** which is the more practical synonym for happiness. E.g. follow your passion (your excitement).  

   * Thus real question is not what you want or your goals, BUT it is **what would excite me?**
* Boredom is enemy not some abstract failure.
* He uses ‘**dreamlining**’: applying timelines to dreams. Differs from goal-setting:  

   * 1.) The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps
   * 2.) Goals have to be unrealistic to be effective
   * 3.) It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.
* Gave students tasks of reaching impossible people. Goal is to have 3-4 email exchanges before asking for help from these powerful people.
* Dreamlining process:  

   * 1.) What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world?  

      * 2 timelines (6 months, 12 months) - list up to 5 things you dream of:
   * 2.) Drawing a blank? 5 being questions  

      * One place to visit
      * One thing to do before you die
      * One thing to do daily
      * One thing to do weekly
      * One thing you’ve always wanted to learn
   * 3.) What does “being” entail doing  

      * Convert each being into a doing to make it actionable.
* 4.) What are four dreams that would change it all?
* 5.) Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your target monthly income (TMI) for both timelines. A+B+C+(1.3\*monthly expenses)
* 6.) Determine three steps for each of the four dreams and take the first step now.

**Step 11: E is for Elimination:**

* Aim is not to do more, aim is to accomplish more by doing less via elimination
* Last chapter you defined what you want to do with your time (definition), now you have to free that time whilst maintaining or increasing your income.
* Remember its DEAL, but employees must do DELA. Entrepreneurs can automate, then liberate themselves in turn.
* Effectiveness: doing things get you closer to your goals.
* Efficiency: performing a given task in the most economical manner possible.  

   * 1.) Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.
   * 2.) Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.
   * WHAT you do is infinitely more important than HOW you do it.
   * Apply efficiency to the right things using Pareto rule: 80/20 principle  

      * 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.
* Goal: find your inefficiencies in order to eliminate the and find your strengths to multiply them.
* Tim didn’t realise that working from every hour from 9-5 isn’t the goal; it’s simply the structure most people use, whether it’s necessary or not.
* Maximum income from minimal necessary effort is the primary goal.
* Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. *Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.*  

   * **Being selective is the path of the productive.**
* Employees should have goal of negotiating a remote work arrangement
* **Parkinson’s Law** dictates that a task will swell in importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.
* Solution: use Parkison’s and 80/20 to identify few tasks contribute most to income and schedule them with very *short* and clear deadlines.
* Poisonous people don’t deserve your time, to think otherwise = masochistic.
* **Have clear list of priorities made the day before.**  

   * Learn to ask yourself “if this is the only thing I accomplish today will I be satisfied with my day?
* No multitasking
* Make shorter deadlines - use a countdown timer

**Chp 6: The low-information diet:**

* Cultivate a selective ignorance - learn ignore all things are irrelevant, unimportant or unactionable.
* Reading 200% faster in 10 minutes, no comprehension loss:  

   * a.) Use pen or finger under each line
   * b.) Begin focusing on third word then move third from last word = peripheral vision.
   * c.) Try again but with only two snapshots/fixations per line
   * d.) read too fast for comprehension but with good technique for five pages, then go back to reading at a normal speed.
* 1.)Go on immediate one-week media fast.  

   * Use LeechBlock to block sites for certain time.
* 2.) Develop habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this info for something immediate and important?”
* 3.) **Practice the art of nonfinishing:** starting something doesn’t automatically justify finishing it.
* Comfort challenge: get phone numbers - 2 per day for 2 days.

**Chp 7: Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal:**

* Learn to be difficult when it counts, e.g. school, having reputation of being assertive will give you preferential treatment without having to beg every time. E.g. asking 2-3 hrs of questions when don’t get an A.
* Interruptions:  

   * 1.) Time wasters: e.g email that is unimportant.
   * 2.) Time consumers: tasks need to be done but often interrupt high-level work, e.g. responding to emails or phone calls, personal errands.
   * 3.) Empowerment failures: times where someone needs approval to make something small happen. E.g. fixing customer problems.
* First limit email consumption and production, never do first thing in morning, do most important task first.  

   * Have 2 times for checking emails, tell your colleagues. Or call if emergencies.
* Have 2 phone numbers = 1 urgent and 1 non-urgent.  

   * Don’t encourage people to chitchat, make them get to point immediately.
* It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient  

   * 1.) Order preference/urgent nature of issues; email, phone, in-person meetings.
   * 2.) Respond to voicemail via e-mail. Use ‘if...then’ structure. This prevents follow-up questions.
   * 3.) Make sure they define PURPOSE of the meeting. ‘What are topics? Thanks in advance’ then answer these questions/topics via email so no need for meeting.
   * 4.) If you cannot stop a call from happening, *define the end time.*
   * 5.) Again pretend your busy if someone comes to your cubicle, wear headphones/fake phone call. Ask intruder to email you.
   * 6.) Puppy dog close: use to help superiors develop the no-meeting habit. Say, “lets just try it once” reversible trial.
   * Make sure you achieve more outside of meetings to covert to permanent routine.
* Time consumers:  

   * Only produce in batch - utilising economies of scale.
   * Apply batching to other things, e.g. bill payments, you will save time which you can measure the cost savings off via working out your hourly rate.  

      * Can do this by removing 3 zeros and halving your annual salary to get hourly rate approximate.
      * If problems from batching E.g. losing sales, cost more than time savings, then scale back to a less-frequent batching, otherwise increase batching time gaps.
* Empowerment failures: establish rules to give employees power, e.g. to fix problems themselves as long as cost is under $100. Suggest a one week trial to your boss.
* Summary of this chapter:  

   * Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact.
   * Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones
   * Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.
* Tools:  

   * Evernote
   * GrandCentral
   * YouMail
   * Doodle
   * Timedriver
   * Xobni
   * Jott
   * Copytalk (dictate up 4 mins, get transcription in hrs)
   * Freedom
* Comfort challenge: say no for next 2 days to all that won’t get you fired.

**Step 111: A is for Automation:**

**Chp 8: Outsourcing life:**

* 1.) Get an assistant - even if you don’t need one. Learn to command, start with a test project  

   * Use domestic help for language-intensive tasks and foreign assistants in the early stages.
   * Elance
   * Virtual assistant ($6.98)
   * Remember your goal is *to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.*
   * *Remember:* eliminate before you delegate/automate - make sure its important.
   * **Principle one: define rules and processes before adding people.**
   * Hiring a team rather than solo VA is safer, e.g. if gets ill.
   * Forbid VAs from subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. Brickwork is good.
   * Never use debit cards for online transactions or with remote assistants. Reversing unauthorised credit card charges is painless.
* 2.) Start small but think big  

   * Look at what has been on to-do list the longest
   * Each time change tasks or are interrupted, ask “could a VA do this?”
   * Examine pain points - what causes you the most frustration and boredom?
* 3.) Identify your top five time-consuming non-work tasks and five personal tasks you could assign for sheer fun.
* 4.) Keep in sync: scheduling and calendars  

   * BusySync
   * SpanningSync
   * WebEx Office

**Chp 9: Income Autopilot 1:**

* This chp is for those who want not to *run* businesses but for those who want to *own* businesses and spend no time on them.
* Ideal model: a product where test less $500 and can lend itself to automation within four weeks, and when running can’t require more than *one day per week* of management.
* **Cash flow and time:** with these two currencies, all other things are possible.
* 1.) Pick an affordably reachable niche market  

   * Find your market, then develop a product for them.
   * Ask yourself:  

      * What groups do you understand? What do you own and what groups of people purchase the same? Find related magazines and find out cost of advertising
* 2.) Brainstorm (do not invest in) products  

   * Create a premium image and charge more than competition  

      * So can sell fewer units
      * Lower-maintenance customers
      * Higher profit margins = safer. 8-10x markup.
      * Should take no more than 3-4 wks to manufacture.
   * Option 1: resell product
   * Option 2: License a product.  

      * 2 parties:
   * Option open to most people = option 3: create a product  

      * Make prototype, then take to a contract manufacturer or find generic or stock product that can be repurposed for a specific market. Have then make, stick a custom label on it = “private labelling”
      * **INFORMATION** products meet our criteria best

**Chp 10: Income Autopilot 11:**

* You must micro-test your products using inexpensive advertisements
* 1.) Market selection
* 2.) Product brainstorm
* 3.) Micro-testing, e.g. auctioned products on eBay to test demand before purchasing inventory.
* 4.) rollout and automation

**Chp 11: Income Autopilot 111:**

* Once you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs itself.
* Contract outsourcing companies and allow them to communicate among themselves to solve problems and give them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you.
* The more options offer customer = more indecision and so fewer orders.
* Art of “undecision” minimizing the number of decisions your customers can or need to make.
* Not all customers are equal: prevent problem customers from ordering in the first place. Those who spend the most complain the least.  

   * Use a ‘lose-win’ guarantee, e.g. delivered in 30mins or less or its free.
* Look Fortune 500  

   * 1.) Don’t be CEO or founder
   * 2.) Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on website
   * 3.) Set up Interactive Voice Response (IVR) remote receptionist.
   * 4.) Do not provide home addresses

**Step IV: L is for Liberation:**

**Chp 12: Disappearing Act:**

* Steps for employees to work remote:  

   * 1.) increase investment: want company to invest in you as much as possible, so larger cost if you quit.
   * 2.) Prove increased output offsite, e.g. by calling sick.
   * 3.) prepare the quantifiable business benefit
   * 4.) Propose a revocable trial period
   * 5.) Expand remote time  

      * Sherwood ensures his days outside of the office are his most productive to date.
   * Alternative: Hourglass approach: where you get a short remote-agreement and then negotiate back up to full-time out of the office.
   * Practice the art of getting past “no” before proposing.
   * 6.) Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or your desired level of mobility.  

      * Don’t underestimate how much your company needs you. Perform well and ask for what you want. If you don’t get it over time, leave. It’s too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.

**Chp 13: Beyond Repair:**

* Most people aren’t lucky enough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30-40 years of tolerating mediocre.
* The phobias keeping people on sinking ships:  

   * 1.) Quitting is permanent. No it isn’t, can continue career at later point.
   * 2.) I won’t be able to pay the bills  

      * Well you should have a new job or source of cash flow before quitting.
      * Also, not hard to eliminate most expenses temporarily and live on savings for a brief period.
   * 3.) Health insurance and retirement accounts disappear if i quit  

      * Untrue.
      * Can get medical and dental coverage for $300-500 per month
      * Transferring 401 (k) took less 30 mins
   * 4.) It will ruin my resume  

      * Do something interesting and make them jealous.
      * Fine as long as you don’t sit on your ass after quitting.

**Chp 14: Mini-Retirement:**

* Most people dream of pot of gold at end of career rainbow. But travelling can be done VERY cheaply.
* Why not redistribute usually 20-30 yr retirement throughout life instead of all at end.
* Mini-retirements are recurring = lifestyle. E.g. Tim does 3-4 per year.
* True freedom is more than having enough income and time to do what you want.
* Must also be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed culture, for which you must be free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set.
* Use credit card points for free travel and purchase tickets far in advance (3 months or more) or last minute, and aim for departure and return between Tuesday and Thursday.
* You may realise that travelling the world and having time of your life can save you serious money.
* Clutter creates indecision and distractions, consuming attention.
* Tim says take absolute minimum with you when travelling, and set aside a “settling fund” to purchase things needed.
* Most lifestyle for dollar: Argentina, Thailand, Berlin.
* Minimalism: eliminate 80% belongings. Keep 20% use 80% of time.
* Give a trusted member of family and/or your accountant power of attorney.
* Get all required and recommended immunisations and vaccinations for your target region.

**Chp 15: Filling the Void:**

* Don’t want too much idle time, want to live more.
* Questions: if you can’t define or act upon it, forget it. Be smart and put your effort where it can make the biggest difference for yourself and others.
* Continual learning and service is key in life
* To live is to learn - go abroad and learn language + one kinesthetic skill, e.g. sport.
* 1.) Revisit ground zero: do nothing
* 2.) Make an anonymous donation to the service organisation of your choice.
* 3.) Take a learning mini-retirement in combination with local volunteering.
* 4.) Revisit and reset dreamlines
* 5.) Based on the outcomes of steps 1-4, consider testing new part- or full-time vocations.

**Chp 16: The top 13 New Rich Mistakes:**

* Perform a 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and personal life
* Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have absolutely nothing to do with work.

711,4lv8fl,False,,274,Follow Along as I Flip this Website - Case Study,Entrepreneur,"I am starting a new case study where I will be documenting my attempt to flip a website that I just purchased from Flippa. However, unlike most case studies where people hide certain parts and details from the public I will instead be sharing everything. That means you will know the exact URL of the site that I purchased and I will share everything with you all as I progress.I know that case studies are lot more interesting and you can learn better when you can see real examples of what I am talking about. Enough of the chatting, let's jump straight into this new case study and I will explain what this is all about.

&nbsp;

Before you get into the case study I want to give you the option of reading this one my website where all of the images can be seen within the post and it is easier to read. I also want to say that I have nothing to sell you or anything close to it. So if you want to read it there you can do so [here](http://www.passionintopaychecks.com/flipping-websites-introduction)

##Introductory Video##

I have put together a video that talks about many of the things that I cover in this article. So if you would rather watch a video you can watch that here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE3SxtNnqts

&nbsp;

However, I go into more detail in the actual article FYI. Also, I plan on using Youtube very frequently in this case study so be on the lookout for new videos.There is going to be a video that will accompany every single case study post because I like having it being presented in two different mediums.

##The Website I Just Bought##

Around a week ago I made a new website purchase from Flippa and you can view the website's Flippa listing here - [https://flippa.com/6439965-hvactraining101-com](https://flippa.com/6439965-hvactraining101-com)

&nbsp;

Screenshot of the Homepage - [http://imgur.com/T6Iv1QN](http://imgur.com/T6Iv1QN)


&nbsp;

I paid $1,250 for the site and you will soon see that I got a really good deal. As you might be able to tell from the URL, this site is focused around training and education for becoming a HVAC technician. This is a lucrative niche to be in and Adsense pays very well. I do not have control of the site yet due to the transfer process not being completed. However, I am hoping within a few days everything will be finalized and I will take full control of the site. In the meantime, I figured it would be a good time to put together the introduction post for this new case study!

&nbsp;

##Why I Bought this Website##

Now that you have a general idea of the website that I purchased, I now want to explain the reasoning behind the purchase. There are 3 major reasons for this purchase and I will explain each one of them below.

&nbsp;

**GREAT Price**

As I mentioned earlier, I bought this website for $1,250. However, that doesn't mean a whole lot unless you know how much the site is making each month.

&nbsp;

Screenshot of the earnings for the last 12 months - [http://imgur.com/NptxCHy](http://imgur.com/NptxCHy)

&nbsp;

Average Monthly Profits:


 - 3 Month = $126
 - 6 Month = $128
 - 12 Month = $229.50

&nbsp;

Let's use the 6 month average of $128/month as our baseline average. Since it is making on average $128/month and it was sold for $1,250 then that means I bought this site at a multiple of 9.76x! Most sites in today's market go for 20x-30x multiples. As you can see, I got a great deal on this site. Although the great price was the biggest reason for me buying this site there are other factors that persuaded me as well. You need to remember that just because you can get a website for a good price it doesn't mean it is a good deal. There are other factors that you need to look at as well.

&nbsp;

**Extremely Under Optimized**

This site is currently being monetized mainly by Adsense and a very small amount from Quinstreet. From my experience with testing and optimizing Adsense layouts for my site in my Website Investing case study I know the common ad layouts that work best for maximizing Adsense revenue. With that being said, I can quickly determine if a website is being under optimized in terms of the ad layout. One of the first things I did when analyzing this site was examine the ad layout it was using.

&nbsp;

Screenshot of the website with the ad layout the previous owner was using - [http://imgur.com/wqleLVA](http://imgur.com/wqleLVA)

&nbsp;

There is only ONE ad per page being used, that's it. Google allows up to 6 total ads to be used per page and you can imagine how much money is being left on the table because of this. I am estimating that I can probably double the earnings for the site practically overnight once I add more ads to the site. Adding more ads in combination with my favorite Adsense plugin, AmpedSense, I will be able to easily boost the earnings for this site quickly. It is also worth mentioning how lucrative this niche is and how much advertisers are willing to spend on a per click basis.

&nbsp;

The average CPC for the top keywords this site is currently ranking for in Google - [http://imgur.com/ifxiy8B](http://imgur.com/ifxiy8B)

&nbsp;

Look at those average CPC numbers, they are insanely high! I could be making up to $25 per click for some of those keywords, which is so absurd to me. Combine these extremely high CPC with the fact that the site currently only has one ad per page and you can start to understand just how under optimized this site truly is. I also plan on utilizing other ad networks such as Quinstreet and Campus Explorer more as well. These two networks are targeted at the education niche which works very well with my site. I will be testing to see if these convert better than normal Adsense ads.

&nbsp;

**Goldmine of Untapped Keywords**

One of the biggest opportunities I see for growing this site is to target local keywords related to HVAC training. As of right now, the site has only scratched the surface when it comes to trying to rank for state/city keywords. Currently there are only two pages on the entire website which go after local keywords, those two pages target Texas and Florida HVAC search terms. These two pages are two of the more popular pages in terms of total amount of traffic.

&nbsp;

See the screenshot of the Google Analytics - [http://imgur.com/NB0xJ4G](http://imgur.com/NB0xJ4G)

&nbsp;

Two out of the top five most popular pages for the entire website are focused on local search terms. However, these are the ONLY two pages that target local search terms on the whole site! There are 48 other states, although there may not be search volume for all states, and countless cities that are not being targeted. Why do I think this is such a good opportunity?

&nbsp;

For a few reasons:

&nbsp;

 - Local keywords are a lot easier to rank for in Google than more general keywords
 - This site has been able to rank for two states successfully already and it proves it is possible
 - Traffic going to these local pages is WAY more targeted and will convert at a much higher rate, which means more commissions for me
 - There are so many more states and cities that get a good amount of searches that I can target

&nbsp;

To give you an idea of the type of keywords these local pages rank for, you can see the top keywords that the Florida page is ranking for in Google:

&nbsp;

Top ranking keywords for the Florida page - [http://imgur.com/j7uKzl2](http://imgur.com/j7uKzl2)

&nbsp;

As you can see these keywords don't get a ton of searches each month, but ranking 1st for a keyword getting 90 searches a month is better than being ranked 10th for a keyword getting 1,000 searches a month. I have started to do some keyword research for other states and I am liking what I am finding so far.

&nbsp;

Keywords that I have found which I will be targeting with future articles - [http://imgur.com/8CCCCWU](http://imgur.com/8CCCCWU)

&nbsp;

I will go into more detail about my keyword research in future articles, but I wanted to give you an idea of what my strategy will be! I also wanted to share why I am super excited about the future potential to grow this site by targeting local keywords.

&nbsp;

##Risks##

Yes, there are many good things about this website, but there are always risks involved no matter what the investment is. The same thing goes for this site. Below are some of the risks that I currently see.

&nbsp;

**HTML Site**

This website is a HTML site and I will need to transfer it to Wordpress ASAP. I have been doing some research on this process and it shouldn't be too hard to get this over to Wordpress. In doing so it will make adding content, managing the back end and just about everything else easier. Also, I am hoping that when I transfer it to Wordpress that it will become more optimized for Google which will increase keyword rankings.

&nbsp;

**Declining Earnings**

Looking at the last 12 months of earnings you will notice a drop off from last year till now.

&nbsp;

Earnings from the last 12 months - [http://imgur.com/WsotZsj](http://imgur.com/WsotZsj)

&nbsp;

In May of 2015 it looks like the site earned right around $500, which is much higher than the $128 that it is earning now. However, the last 7 or so months have been consistent which is a good sign. Even though the earnings are much lower now then they were a year ago it is good to know that this site has the potential to earn $500/month because it has done it before.

&nbsp;

**Slightly Declining Traffic**

In the last 12 months the site's traffic has declined, however, it looks like it is picking back up. 

&nbsp;

Traffic from the last 12 months - [http://imgur.com/aiYZW9W](http://imgur.com/aiYZW9W)

&nbsp;

The decline is nothing serious, but there is a drop on traffic. Let's take a look at the complete history of this site's traffic so we can get a better idea of what is going on here:

&nbsp;

Complete traffic history - [http://imgur.com/tYmboVn](http://imgur.com/tYmboVn)

&nbsp;

The above screenshot is from 2012 all the way up to right now. In the grand scheme of things you can see that the traffic is still doing well and it looks like it is on the upswing now. Those three risks mentioned above are the three biggest risks with this site at this point. It is always good to note the risks and do everything you can to prevent them from causing a problem.

&nbsp;

##My Growth Strategy##

Whenever I purchase a new site I always create an outline or plan on how I will grow the site. Right now, I have some basic ideas on how I will grow this site, but as I go on I will continue to change and optimize my strategies to be more effective. Below I have outlined my current plans to grow:

&nbsp;

**1. Add more Adsense Ads**

The very first thing I will do once I get control of the site is add more ads per page. I am predicting that by just adding a few more ads per page I will be able to more than likely double the earnings. I will touch on exactly how I will be optimizing the ad layouts in future posts.

&nbsp;

**2. Test other Ad Networks**

I will be doing a lot of testing and experimenting when it comes to the ad networks. I plan on trying out Adsense, Media.net, Quinstreet, Campus Explorer and finding the combination of those 4 which produces the most revenue. The Adsense and Media.net ads will perform well on the more general pages while Quinstreet and Campus Explorer ads will be geared towards the local search terms. There will probably be other ad networks I will try out but these are the four which I will be using right away. If you are aware of any other ad networks out there which are geared towards the education niche please let me know in the comments below!

&nbsp;

**3. Target Local Keywords with new Content**

I have already touched on this, but I will starting to produce content targeting these local keywords ASAP. The sooner I add the content to the site the sooner it will start to rank and bring in traffic. I will not be writing my own content and instead I will be outsourcing all of it via Upwork. I will show you all how I go about outsourcing content production and you can see my process for doing that.

&nbsp;

##Goals for this Website##

My goal for the website is to have it valued at $10,000+ within 12 months. Let's break down this larger goal into smaller chunks which will make achieving it easier and more attainable.

&nbsp;

**Earnings - $500/month**

To get the site valued at $10,000 the site will need to be making $500/month using a 20x monthly multiple. Right now, the site is making around $130/month so it has a ways to before it reaches the $500 a month mark. However, after doing some Adsense optimization I think we could push the earnings to around $300/month without much work. From there, it will come down to trying to bring in more traffic!

&nbsp;

**Traffic - 5,000 Visitors per Month**

Why 5,000 visitors? Because that is how much traffic it is going to take to get to the $500/month goal. Let me explain how I came to this conclusion:

&nbsp;

The average RPM for this site is currently $50, which means for every 1,000 page views the site earns $50. After I optimize the Adsense layout for the site and add more ads per page I think I will be able to double the RPM to $100. Using the RPM of $100 the site will need to have 5,000 monthly visitors to earn $500. So 5,000 monthly visitors is the traffic goal I have set and aiming for! The site is currently getting around 3,000 visitors per month so I will need to add an extra 2,000 visitors to get to this goal.

&nbsp;

**Meet 9-year old, Mikaila Ulmer of Sugar Land, TX.**

Her company, Bee Sweet Lemonade,  is the beginning of a Lemonade empire in which the idea came from when she was stung by bees when she was just 4 years old — twice in one week.

“After that I would freak out about the bees — like overreact — and then my parents wanted me to do some research so I would be less afraid. And doing that research I found out how incredibly important pollinators they are, and that they were dying,” Mikaila said. “And I decided to create a product that helped save the bees.”

She dug up an old lemonade recipe from her great-grandmother’s cookbook, and added honey — her way of calling attention to the plight of honeybees.

Beekeepers have reported losing 42 percent of their colonies in the past year. That’s the second highest annual loss on record

Whole Foods Market heard about her efforts to save the bees and is now selling her lemonade in 32 stores across four states.

407,7erlr3,False,Case Study,103,Hush-hush. Secrets to Instagram no one would share.,Entrepreneur,"Hey good people! So - I have been obsessing over Instagram for a bit more than an year and I have been through so much. I can't even begin to tell you. 

In the following blog I will share with you all my experiences, failures and successes with facts backing me up. 

I started out on Instagram with a Travel niche account about 11 months ago. This account I wanted to build 100% genuinely. No botting. No faking. Nothing. I spent 3-4 hours a day on Instagram. Liking and commenting on content **that I actually adored**. Not just spamming likes/comments to get attention.

It took a lot of patience. I started with 700 followers (family/friends mostly) and ended up with 11.3K followers. We are talking about 3-4 hours a day for 11 freaking months. 

During these 11 months. I've done everything from buying and using virtually every bot out there. Opening around 30 accounts with different niches (botted). Buying offshore servers and running Fake Agent scripts. FL, MP, VT - I did it all. I bought 1000 Instagram accounts at one point. I botted them. Lost 300 of those accounts (got caught) - other 700 are still running. Spent a fortune on proxies, VPN, VPS, off-shore servers, FA, Bots and PVA accounts. 

Let me back up a bit (Glossary) 
**VPN / VPS** (Virtual private servers - I can't bot 1000 accounts on my laptop. I had to buy access to VPS with high config (24 cores / 64 gb ram) to run bots as they are resource intensive
**Proxies/IP** (You can run 5 Instagram accounts on one IP address. So on my main IP (home) I ran 5 accounts. If I ran more than 5 I would get blocked. So I bought proxies. (dedicated proxies) I ran 3 accounts per proxy. 
**FL,MP, VT** - These are just some of the bots I used. 

Here is what I learned overtime. Something you will eventually realize yourself. Most of this you already know. 

**FACTS / LESSONS**

**1. Instagram Intro**

Instagram isn't stupid. Botting is not going to help in the long run. Yes I did manage to grow accounts from 0 to 38K in like 6 months but those days are long gone. Instagram has improved a lot! Its literally working 24x7 to crack down on these bots. So - this is a NO NO. Once again - this could have been done before. But no longer. Every other day I'm running into new problems with botting. My advice - don't chase this. (FL,MP ... all will soon go off)

**2. The Righteous Men** 

Growing 100% genuine is retarded. And I was one of the retards. Face it. Everyone is doing hanky panky with social media. Politicians, Celebs, Kids ... everyone. 

https://gizmodo.com/5970857/youtube-took-2-billion-views-away-from-sony-universal-and-others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hhhuuRGfaU&
http://www.refinery29.com/2017/06/157127/katy-perry-fake-twitter-followers

As you can see - everyone from Sony to Katy Perry to POTUS has fake followers. So - you are the one who is losing out by not making any hanky panky. This is a FACT. 

You can never grow BIG by being righteous unless you wanna waste a decade on it. If you got time. Then you can. 

**3. World of Spam**

Even kids have learned to spam and grow. This has become a trend. Look into follow train / like train. Find out on Instagram about this. You will see what I mean. 

Example: 
https://www.instagram.com/p/BbyinUwlVtx/?taken-by=kyliejenner

Latest post by famous Kylie Jenner. See her comments. 
You'll find tens of thousands of teens commenting LB, CB and some other non sense. 
These are SPAM tactics used by teens and kids. LB = Like back. You like their photo. They'll like back. CB = comment back. FB = follow back. 

**WHY THE HELL DO YOU THINK EVERY ONE IS RESORTING TO FAKE FOLLOWERS, SPAM TACTICS, FAKE VIEWS, PODS, BOTS?** (Something to think about)

Anyways - you can spam on top celeb accounts (LB,CB) and if you are obsessed with it. You can get 1-2k likes and upto 100 comments. (Res assured these comments will be SUPER generic and copy paste)

**4. Engagement Pods**

To me this was the closest way to make engagement happen. 
These are groups of people on Slack, Telegram, Whatsapp and EVEN in Instagram DMs who engage with each other. 

Its simple. I will like your photo. You like mine. 

But these 'pods' (if you find the right ones) are well moderated by admins - have decent people. Good quality Instagram accounts and all. 

You can safely get 2K likes and 500+ comments if you are in the right pods. **It will be a lot of work but its worth it**

The trick to engagement pods is to join ones that have high quality bloggers. 
There are also some networks that have exclusive pods for 10k+ accounts, 50k+ accounts and 100k+ accounts. You can imagine what miracles these can do for your posts. Getting 100 comments and 1000 likes from 100K+ profiles is MAGICAL.

Advice - DO NOT use engagement pods that have 'rounds'. Those are filled with spam like / CPA Instagrammers who are there only for the purpose of scamming people. 

Join engagement pods that are of continuous cycle. I'll make a post on engagement pods and secrets to using them if I get a lot of requests for those down below. 

**5. Holy Grail - the Instagram Algorithm**

While everyone will beat around the bush as they don't know any better. 
At the time of this article being published - this is Instagram Algorithm. 

Instagram gives you 3 options to go big. 
1. Pay them cash ( a ton of it - my advice? NEVER do that unless you're a millionaire)
2. Reach top post page for your hashtag (this will get you noticed between your niche audience)
3. Reach explore page (this is just pushing your content out into the 'front page' of Instagram)

Lets talk about 2 and 3. 
Algorithm = 

If your post gets a TON of traction within first 60 minutes of going live on Instagram you will reach top post page for your hashtag. 

Case Study - I reach top post page for the most competitive hashtag once while learning about this. 

#love  (hashtag love)

I made a post and injected 30,000+ likes to it (purchased) within first 10 minutes of post going live. 
I then managed to get 50 comments from 100K+ profiles via engagement pods. 

By 15th minute I was on #love top post page. 

This is how to reach the top post page.

Lets say your hashag is #travel. You wanna get to top post page for that? 
Its easy. 
Search for #travel and see top posts under that and see how many likes they are getting. 
Find out average likes of all posts under top post page. 

So among 9 posts maybe average likes is 7000 likes for #travel.

You need to get 7000++++ likes within first 60 minutes to reach top post page for that hashtag.

If the hashtag is BIG and you keep your engagement running for first 60 minutes then you will probably stay on top post page for 24 hours. 

**RESULT?** Millions of people will naturally bump into your post. Make it pretty so they end up following you. 

**LESSON** Faking likes and reaching top post page = real traffic + real likes + real people / followers

About reach explore page.
You need way more traction than this. 

Technique is to reach top post page for 15 competitive hashtags. That by itself pushes your posts to explore.

CASE : Once I targeted 30 top hashtags. Injected 30k likes to my post. Managed to get 177 comments in under 60 minutes via engagement pods from HQ accounts (10k+,50K+,100k+) ...

I hit the explore page.

**RESULT?** I gained 1100 followers in under 24 hours. They all engage with me till this day. 

This can be down on a massive scale. 


**6. Content is King**

Yes it is. But everyone has good content these days. Every kid is decent at Photoshop and Lightroom and every iPhone is capable of doing wonderful things in terms of photography. 

Content is king - I guess so. Don't sweat on it. That part everyone can do and easy. 



----


Thats all for now. God damn. Haha. 
I had a lot on my plate I guess. Haha. 

One more thing - this is all that I have seen and noticed. Not encouraging anyone to juice stats or leave bots that they are already using or start buying fake shit. Do what you feel is right. 


**I'll do another post on this sharing in depth about each topic (Engagement Pod, IG Algo in depth, Techniques used by Celebs, Social agencies to grow fast by faking it)**

**Let me know if you guys need any of those topics covered!**

Cheers!

398,akewzr,False,,101,15 Years in Business- Surrounded by successful people- Here's (the start) of What I know.,Entrepreneur,"EDIT: I really appreciate your comments (and the gold but not sure what it is yet)

I made the second post on this an hour ago. Thanks BM.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I made a comment the other day on a [post on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aj33zx/who_are_the_top_1_and_what_do_they_do/) that was quite poignant to me and was related to possibly the biggest theme in my own life the last 2 years.

I don't come on here much and rarely comment. I'm not sure why I come to r/rentreprenuer these days but I think it's because I find it interesting to browse through what goes through other peoples minds in relation to this subject. I tend to see the same things repeat themselves quite often and I guess I just kind of have an urge to get a few things off of my chest that I hope may help a couple of you out.

If anything I say on these posts comes across as negative or harsh towards 'wantrapreneurs' or early starters, please forgive me- I too have been where they are several times throughout my career and I have made many many mistakes.

(Pre post edit- I've added the \* symbol to sentences where I may trigger offence but in fact this is something I have been guilty of myself)

There are several crossovers within the points which I maybe should tie up and summarise at some point and please bear in mind that other than emails I am not an experienced or particularly good writer.

Well here goes... I'm going to start with a few 'Don't Do's'.

1. **Aiming for the Stars**

Once or twice a year I meet up with an old army buddy of mine. Every so often we do it in his home town and he brings a couple of his mates from school he still drinks with- every damn time there's this one guy who calls me Mr Money (I don't think Im anywhere as wealthy as he thinks I am) . He's obsessed with money and entrepreneurship despite never having set anything up himself, he quickly turns the conversation to my current and previous endeavours and then proceeds to start pitching me with some of his own.

I think what annoys me the most about him is that he reminds me of how naive and pie in the sky I was myself in my early twenties. Most of his ideas are either far too lofty and ambitious to be the basis of a credible starting point or are too complicated/ niche/ in an unknown market to be in any way feasible to make a start on.

The worst part though is that these ideas always have the aim of making millions.

I have personally lost more by either giving up or not putting enough effort into ventures that would be nice little earners because of they were exactly just that. When I was 24 I completely messed a business that turned over half a million and paid me personally about 80k because I didn't think it was scalable enough to make me a millionaire by the time I am the age I am now.

I'm still not a millionaire and other than by creeping over the line at some point by the way of investments I have no real desire to be.

My advice to anyone starting out is to think small... like really small. And really simple.

The smaller and simpler it is, the easier it will be to start. It will also make it easier to replace yourself by paying someone else to do most or all of the work for you. You can then work on expanding the business and/or diversifying your business interests.

My position now is that I have several 'nice little earners' and am in the process of starting another. The bulk of my weeks work is in what I call my 'job business' where I am basically a part time consultant to a large multinational. The remainder is on my side hustles. These side hustles employ people who do most of the work and my role is in providing the direction and authority that most people need (more on this later).

The main thing on these side hustles is that they are fairly run of the mill, they're not that 'economies of scalable' and they're in no way revolutionary.

They're just simple, startable, runnable and profitable businesses.

2. **Looking for too much advice**

This should really head up the list. The fact that many of you are here will be that you are looking for advice\*. Like I said in my opening comment, Im not looking to put anyone down.

My own searching for the missing secret, that one little tip (or list of a hundred) or that 'thing' that I was clearly missing has cost me more than anything else, if not more than every other mistake combined.

If I had just trusted my gut more and worked through a few more (as Bob Ross puts it) Happy Little Accidents I would have gotten to where I am now far sooner and far more enjoyably the first time round.

&#x200B;

We don't know what we don't know- this much is true. But the important thing to get clear on is- How much do I need to know right now?

&#x200B;

Overcoming the anxiety of not knowing everything one would ever need to know to make a success of things and just getting going and keeping moving is probably one of the biggest contributors to success I have seen in others and is certainly the biggest in my own rise from the ashes.

One of the main reasons I feel qualified to write on this subject is not just my own 'average success' but that fact that I am very fortunate to know and count among the friends of quite a large number of self made people. I'm not sure how unique I am in this respect but I think I must be somewhat unusual that many friends, family and friends of friends are business starter/ owners. As a keen observer and one time habitant of a special kind of 'Self Help Hell' I have spotted common themes in so many of them that I almost feel that I can't be wrong about them.

My own going from a bit of a f&\*k up to what I now consider to be a very ideal situation by aligning my own behaviour with the more useful ones that I have observed in those others, really validates to me what I've learned.

&#x200B;

The reason I make and stress this point is that the things I have seen work for other people is almost entirely at odds as most of the things that the 'gurus' and self aggrandising entrepreneurs you see on youtube and on the top ten non fiction books list all the time.

&#x200B;

One of the things that most of the gurus keep telling you is that you need to keep reading and learning and consuming everything that the 'success' industry has to offer. I completely disagree with this and other than a healthy interest in ones (slow and steady) personal development I really think that most of it should be avoided.

I think we all learn better by simply doing and that there isn't really that much to learn.

A) You don't need to know what the routines and habits of billionaires and ultra successful people are, besides, most of the writers of these types of books are more than likely way off about just how normal these 'superhuman' people really are.

B) By reading a lot of this cr@p you are more than likely decreasing your chances of achieving your own version of average success. You may, as I did, get into the really bad habit of comparing yourself to people that are so far out of your league in terms of luck/ circumstance, confidence and natural ability that you can beat yourself into a depression.

C) By reading the stories and autobiographies of famous entrepreneurs you are reading the story they like to tell, which will have to be in line with what they have told other people in private or at paid after dinner parties; and hence will unlikely be exactly the truth. There will also be a lot of a survivorship bias in their recollections of the epochs in their journey.

&#x200B;

Not one of the really successful people I know did any of this searching for the holy grail of advice. In fact they almost all did the opposite- they got busy, trusted their gut and in multiple cases actively avoided external advice expect for single issue specific problems where they would speak to or hire a consultant.

&#x200B;

By telling yourself that you will be able to do it if you can just read this list of a few more books or go to this seminar- you are telling yourself that you lack the actual natural ability that many successful people rely upon for the bulk of their progress.

I'm not saying that some of the stuff in the plethora of books on the subject won't help at all in any way, but I am saying that you really don't need it and much of it is misleading, unnecessary and bad for your self esteem.

I could probably bang on about this some more but I'm going to leave it at that for now.

\-You can do it and you don't need a motivational book to help you do so.

&#x200B;

3. **Desperation to have a business/ Lack of patience.**

One of the things I see on here a lot is really a desperation to be an entrepreneur and wanting to do so right now rather than later\* (when conditions are more suitable) and while I suppose everybody's desire to do so will be as unique as them, I think a lot of people fall into the categories below.

Sadly, again, I think that the self help industry and its regurgetators helps fuel the 'screw it just do it' mantra- but for myself and those that I know that have gone on to (eventually) do well, setting things up right and making each next step was on a firm footing have been key.

Yes you have to take risks and sometimes fail\* but throwing all caution to the wind and going all in on the first turn of the cards doesn't pay off in my experience.

Here are some examples of desperation and impatience:

* Not fully understanding how money works and think the only to feel safe/ comfortable/ happy is to have lots more of it\* and due to being also lower educated\* that the only way out is to be a successful entrepreneur\*. Jumping into starting a business before one is mentally and financially ready in order to cure a lack of wealth.
   * For the vast majority of people who were born into the lower classes of wealth\*, it's common to think that the best way to rid of the default empty insecure feeling is to have more money and that the only real option do so is to be a business owner- this is some ways true but can easily lead to desperation.
   * \- Learn to understand how money works and live below your means before you start trying to make more of it.

&#x200B;

* Feeling that one is different and hence somehow better than the majority of everyone else; and therefore should exist at the top of the food chain\*. Starting a business rather than exist alongside the hoy polloi.
   * Also somewhat true but can also easily lead to desparation.
   * It wasn't until life turned me upside down and smacked my a$$ did I realise that humility felt better deep down and was more useful.
   * \- Get used to the fact that you are very very average in the big picture. You will be a better leader, salesman and producer/ purveyor of goods if you put your fellow man on an equal standing.

&#x200B;

* Hating something at work- either the job itself or someone in it.
   * No \* as only partially guilty here.
   * Hating ones boss/ colleagues or feeling superior to the work can often be the source of desire for entrepreneurship and in my opinion is a bit of a recipe for disaster. If you are in this boat I really strongly recommend you learn how to tolerate and get on with people and the drudgery of boring work. Entrepreneurship has plenty of that in store for you.
   * You will have a hard time with your staff, suppliers and customers if you can't put up with dealing with a few d!(kheads. While owning the business will give you a bit more choice and control over who you deal with and how, I think that people who find it hard to get on with people wherever they go tend to be the source of many of their own problems and will fair no better as the one in charge.
   * \- Learn how to get along with people before you start.
   * \- I dont believe in being manipulative in anyway but there are indeed some truly horrible people out there, you have to be able and willing to outsmart and feign commonality with them or they will take advantage of you.

It's definitely not wrong to desire to be an entrepreneur and I dont suppose there really is a bad reason to start. I guess the point I'm making is that owning a business isn't a 'get out of a sh!tty situation' card but should be more of a chance to be a little bit more of yourself and to give the market a slightly better product or service than exists presently. Don't get involved with things you aren't capable of understanding and don't start for the wrong reasons and you should be okay.

4. **Overthinking**

I said there was going to be some crossover here and I think this is one of them points.

Too many people don't get started on things or start on the wrong things because they overthink key parts of the journey- usually far before the situation has arisen.

Again this can lead to the addiction to business and self help books- it keeps feeding the unknown unknowns conundrum and even worse lets people think they are doing something about their desire for entrepreneurship.

There will be problems, there will be boredom, there will be hard times. The road ahead meanders through the hills and mountains; a continuous hike of ups and downs- the plateaus are few and bring with them their own fears and worries.

Get going and learn as you go. You'll figure it out. If you're realistic about what you're setting out to do, the problems you'll face will be more manageable and more in line with your current capabilities.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'll call it there for now and if you're interested I guess I'll keep writing.

334,bmupp3,False,,385,"$10,000 /month & still broke",Entrepreneur,"This isn't a success story. Rather, it's an opportunity to learn from another man's mistakes.

&#x200B;

This is the story of my Dad.

&#x200B;

He first started working in construction at the age of 14. He refused to go to school, so his Father put him to work. He worked alongside people who only spoke spanish, & learned the language by observing their gestures and mapping their words & tones to those gestures.

For years, his Father tried to get him to quit, to go back to school. My Father refused, even spending the first year working for free (had every penny of his money taken for ""rent"").

&#x200B;

At the age of 16, he moved into a friends house. This way, he could keep his earnings.

&#x200B;

At the age of 19, he had his own successful construction company. He would do most jobs all by himself, occasionally hiring a hand to help do big jobs like building a house from the ground up.

&#x200B;

He has had 3 ""business failures"" over the years. The first when he went to jail, the second when the recession hit, and the third when he decided to move across state to live closer to his wife's family for her sake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Currently, he brings in an average of $10,000 /month. Oddly enough, he's always complaining about being broke & oppressed by ""The Man"".

&#x200B;

The reason, is his expenses:

* Car Payment (600 /mo)
* Truck payment (800 /mo)
* Land payment (1200 /mo)
* Cable + Internet (400 /mo)
* Utilities (500 /mo)
* Wife's monthly attention seeking shenanigans... errr... Emergency Hospital Bill (5000 /mo)
* Food (400 /mo)
* Cleaning supplies & personal care products (100 /mo)
* Phone Bill (400 /mo)
* A new thing (toy/trip/tool upgrade/etc) - Whatever Money is Left.

&#x200B;

Total Amount Spent: $9400+/- per month.

&#x200B;

I asked him why he doesn't just cut some of his expenses, even showed him how to use YouTube/The Internet in an attempt to convince him he doesn't need cable. I even suggested turning in the truck he knows he got screwed over on, take a loss on it, and just buy a just as capable older one for about $2500.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His answer was this:

""I worked my ass off my whole life. I think I deserve to reward myself a little, don't you?""

&#x200B;

Having listened to ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", this response instantly clicked something in my head & everything suddenly made perfect sense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I offered him a free mp3 of ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", even transferred it to his phone via bluetooth during one of our trips (occasionally work alongside him). It's only 3 hours long, and after 1 year, he still ""hasn't had time"" to listen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The lesson is this:

It doesn't matter what you make, if your expenses mirror your profits.

You could bring home $1 Million every month, but if you're spending it all on liabilities, you're as broke as the rest of us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bmupp3/10000_month_still_broke/,720,"Or perhaps $10k per month really isn't that much money...

629,e8apjs,False,,95,"My first full time year in lawn care - revenue, expenses, profit, investment",Entrepreneur,"I started a lawn care company ([The Lawn Squad](https://thelawnsquad.com/)) in 2017 while a college student pursuing my degree IU in Bloomington, indiana. 2017 was slow and I didn't take it very seriously but I had a website and a GMB location and a lot of my competitors didn't. I got a little bit more serious in 2018 but still stopped answering the phone and chasing new leads half way through the year because I got overloaded with school work.

2017: $11,638 in revenue and $4,629 in expenses for a profit of $7,009 on a commitment of only about 165 hours throughout the year ($42 per hour)

2018: $39,253 in revenue and $6,310 in expenses for $32,942 in profit on a commitment of about 800 hours ($41 per hour). I ended 2018 with 30 recurring customers.

**Initial Investment**

Early on I used the family truck and mower to do some jobs. I put the majority of the profits back into the business in both 2017 and 2018 and grew slowly while purchasing used equipment. Here is the overview of what I acquired - all in cash with no debt.

**Equipment overview:**

* 2009 Ford F-150 – 7/1/18 – 95,000 miles – $8,000 + $3,000 transmission in July 2019 – $11,000 total
* 36″ 2016 Gravely Pro-Stance Mower – $5,000
* 60″ 2016 Gravely Pro-Turn 260 – $8,000
* 12′ open trailer – $2,000
* Toro Self Propelled Residential mower – $250
* Used 100 Gallon Dual Tank Sprayer – $400 + $100 in repairs
* Stihl Weed Eaters, Blowers, Misc – $1,000

**Total Investment – $27,750**

**2019 customer numbers and financials**

I ended 2019 with 55 lawn care clients and 20 weed control and fertilization clients in Bloomington for a total of 75 customers. I got the weed control applicators permit in March of this year and it was a great decision.

I sent out 320 job quotes and 36% accepted my proposals. I worked 1,940 hours over 32 weeks for 54 hours per week (5 admin, 2 quoting, 47 on the truck).

**Total Revenue: $106,200**

**Expenses:**

* Labor: **$9,000** / 28% of total expenses (hired part time employee who worked 22 hours a week for most of the season)
* Landscaping supplies: **$5,980** / 18%
* Repairs / Maintenance: **$4,250** / 13%
* Weed Control Supplies: **$3,860** / 12%
* Fuel: **$2,990** / 9%
* Wear and Tear / Depreciation: **$2,100** / 6%
* Jobber Software: **$1,548** / 5%
* Insurance (WC, GL, Auto): **$1,200** / 4%
* Equipment Rentals: **$600** / 2%
* Dumping (leaves, brush): **$377** / 1%
* Clothing: **$450** / 1%

**Total expenses: $32,355**

**Total Profit: $73,645**

**Hours worked by owner: 1,940 (54/wk for 32 weeks)**

**Profit per hour worked: $37.96**

If I hired a competent crew leader for $16/hr the total payroll liability after workers compensation and payroll taxes would be about $20/hr.

Assuming the employee is 20% slower than me at doing the work the total hours worked by that employee would have been 2,328 (1,940 x 1.2). Multiply that by the $20 / hr liability and the **expense would have been $46,560**.

**If you add that expense to the profit and loss statement my profit goes from $73,645 to $27,085.**

But this is what I plan to do next year so I can focus on high value work like bidding jobs and doing larger landscaping projects and finding weed control customers. This is a good exercise to know if I'm charging enough to build a scalable business. I plan to raise my prices on most of my customers this next season.

**Strategy and Marketing**

From day 1 I haven't paid for marketing and I've gotten the majority of this customers from my Google My Business location in Bloomington. Sales and marketing have been my weakest link since day 1 but I have never needed to do those things to grow my business.

I got a few early clients to leave 5 star reviews and that has helped me rank. Bloomington has a population of less than 100,000 so it wasn’t extremely competitive. My [GMB location](https://goo.gl/maps/qxdTyKWAcWyCLFyX8) has brought me 90% of my customers and referrals and word of mouth have brought 10%.

My biggest advantage is that I turn quotes around quickly using Jobber and can look at Google Maps and measure the property so I don’t have to drive around looking at places to quote them. I've **found that every hour I let pass before sending a quote the odds decrease drastically of securing the job.**

**Plans for 2020**

FIRE THE BAD CUSTOMERS. 20% of my customers cause me all my headaches.

I have to recruit and hire a good employee. I also need to learn spanish.

I need to purchase another truck and trailer so I plan to shop in the 5-10 year old range and try to get a reliable truck under $10,000.

Marketing, sales and SEO will take a priority spot because right now I'm reliant on the Google My Business location too much. I plan to do some customer appreciation by sending thank you notes out to my clients before Christmas.

451,86nx0c,False,,227,I Lost $10K Investing In A Website. Now I Make $3K/Month From My Website Investments,Entrepreneur,"**I've invested in 4 websites in the past 4 years.**

I've made A LOT of mistakes, especially on the first two, but learned A TON and my past two sites have been incredibly good investments.

Anyone read Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad? Most people are confused thinking their mortgages and car payments are their financial assets, when really they are their biggest financial liabilities.

Anything that puts pure profit back into your pocket each month is a true asset. That's what you want to be investing in.

**Here is my website investing story and what you can learn from my mistakes!**

**1. Don't believe revenue claims**

Yep I was naive and did this with my first site. The owner claimed it made $350/month and offered to sell it to me for 4X monthly valuation at $1,300. 

I bought it. Huge mistake. It was only making $20/month. Surprise! 

Completely my fault. I had Google Analytics data, would have been super easy to do a simple conversion rate calculation and figure out this was not even possible.

Anything under 4X monthly valuation be extremely wary, try to purchase closer to 15-20X monthly valuation which is the average fair market valuation on sites such as Flippa where I've purchased sites.

Additionally, verify revenue by using Flippa verified Adsense sites and double checking with Google Analytics and Industry benchmark RPMs.

**2. Don't buy fad, trend or app-based sites**

Mistake #2 where I lost $10K.

I made 75% of it back in a year, but still a huge :( for me in the investing game.

I bought a fad site based on an iPhone game app. Don't do it!

Buy sites based on stability, not trends.

**3. Buy a site you know you can increase revenue on, through traffic or ad changes**

I bought a site making $370/month at a 20X monthly valuation fair deal. I switched and added ad providers bringing that to $1,200/month. 

Already made my full investment back. It's been 10 months. Now making $1,200 pure profit each month. YES. 

**4. Newest site purchase at a 10X monthly valuation last month.**

Goal is to double traffic this month, make back the site investment price in 5 months. 

That's my investing story, hope it helps you avoid some of the mistakes I made!

506,9v5ouf,False,,94,How to grow your instagram account organically (and for free),Entrepreneur,"EDIT: will be making a pt2, although tbh I’ll probably just call it a full guide. I will be posting around 12pm EST tomorrow

I saw there was a post on this recently, and after reading the comments saw there was some good advice, and some bad. In today’s world online and social media marketing are becoming not only important, but actual tools to increase revenue and profit. There’s a bunch of ways to grow an IG account, and a bunch of ways to tank one. This will be a long post, so I’ll try and break into bits. Apologies for mobile


THE ALGORITHM


In all honesty, we don’t really know what the algorithm is, but understanding how it works is far more important. Basically, like Facebook, Instagram has a formula that ranks its content (posts) in the feed and in the explore page (more on the explore page later). It has variables such as time of post, total likes and comments, hashtags, location, details on the account that posted, and even includes software to recognize what is in each post, and boost or demote it that way. Therefore, if you tend to only like pictures that have luxury cars in them, IG will boost those pictures in your feed. If you only pics of food or dogs, IG will boost pics of food or dogs in your feed and explore page. Each account has a slightly different algorithm in this regard. 

This is why it’s important first of all to understand your target audience, and get in their shoes, not yours. So if your product is a technology that primarily benefits middle aged woman, but you only post pictures of the technology, you won’t do as well as if you posted pictures that were applicable and likeable by middle aged woman. Like and comments are your direct assessment of your post. If your audience like it, they’ll engage with you. If not, they won’t. 


HASHTAGS


Probably the best improvement you can make on your content is the correct use of hashtags. Each post can have up to 30, so use 30. I also suggest “hiding” them in the comments section by posting them as a comment, but there’s no evidence to support that this truly makes a difference. Use hashtags relevant to your niche. If you’re niche is in to cars, but your using hashtags like #hairstylistlove or #cutedogsoninstagram, IG will actually tank you for incorrectly “gaming” the algorithm. 

There’s a couple of strategies you can use. 10/10/10 is a good start. Basically, there are big hashtags (over 500,000 posts), medium hashtags (50k-500k posts), and small hashtags (under 50k). You’ll see these ranges vary depending on who you ask, but for 10/10/10, I like these ranges. 10/10/10 basically means to use 10 big hashtags, 10 small, and 10 medium sized ones to properly market your post. Pretty simple. There’s also 25/5, and all smalls. In this case I’d use 25 hashtags under 100,000 and 5 over, or all hashtags under 100,000. 

The important thing with hashtags is to keep experimenting and find what works. Not all posts are going to do well in a good set of hashtags, and not all good posts require a good set of hashtags to do well. Ik that sounds confusing and tricky, but if you take the time, and put effort into making quality content, Instagram will reward you. They want people to USE the app, to SPEND TIME using their product. The more you use it the more you’ll gain. 

There’s also concepts in hashtags called shadowbanning, geotagging, tagstealing, and some other things as well. But I’m crunched for time, and if y’all want more I can do a part 2 going into more detail. 


LOCATION


This is a tricky one but can greatly be used to your benefit. This mainly affects the explore page. Basically, you want to use a location that garners a lot of activity, and more importantly, people on their phones. Stadiums, famous malls, public monuments, or popular Instagram spots are good locations to use. I’ve had mixed results when using restaurants. If you’re trying to grow in a specific city this is wonderful. But make sure you get a little more specific, if you’re just going to do a certain city. Use a neighborhood instead, i.e. Brooklyn not New York, Beverly Hill not Los Angeles. 



Okay I’m sorry guys I want to include more because there’s a lot more to use but I really have to go. If you are curious you can message me directly, or depending on the response I can make a part 2. Good luck, and keep grinding!

759,5q7xsq,False,,149,Just found out that I am losing my job with company of 10 years. I just relocated to a new area on my own dime and am almost zapped for savings. I'm starting a window cleaning small business tomorrow and I'm scared out of my mind.,Entrepreneur,"I don't know exactly what I am wanting out of this post.  I think it's mostly (or completely) therapeutic.  I was in the process of starting a carpet cleaning and restoration business on the side with intentions of quitting by the end of this year but this timing is terrible.  I'm starting with window cleaning because it could easily be a part of the carpet cleaning business but has little start up cost now.

**Edit**  Thank you everyone for the encouragement, advice and even the offers to help me.  I am going to be taking many of you up on it.  It may be this evening before I am able to get back to each of you but I will keep this post updated. 

A little more background info on me.  I do not have any formal education beyond high school.  I have been working in the electronic security industry (security systems, fire systems, access control, cctv) for the last ten years. I started out as a technician and worked my way up to running operations and sales for one of the most profitable districts for one of the largest companies in the country in just about 5 years.  I have relocated four times in the last 2 and 1/2 years (three mergers) with the last one being just a few months ago on my own dime because my family loved Florida and wanted to get back to the place that we love.  In order to keep my job with the company with this recent relocation I had to step down from management and take a sales position (as it was my decision and not at the request of the company).  As a part of the most recent merger I just found out through some of my management friends that I will be let go either this week or next week.  Like I said in my original post, I am very scared but I know that I will make it in the long run.  To quote one of my best friends when he was in a similar situation, ""I'm a bad MFer and I will be just fine.""

Thanks again everyone.  I look forward to getting more info from each of you this evening.  

**SECOND EDIT**

I am taking a short break for a bite to eat at my house.  I have made two sales today.  One is a Mexican place that just had their windows cleaned last week and is unhappy with his current guy. I am doing it on Saturday morning for $65 this time and will do it for $140/month going forward.  Should take about 2 1/2 hours each time once I am up to speed.  Once I am done eating I am cleaning a small fitness center for $36.  I just finished cleaning a Hallmark a few doors form the fitness center for free because I could not convince him to let me do it now.  I offered to do it for free because I wanted to get one under my belt before working on the fitness center.

185,cd2uxy,False,,232,5 months ago I made a post about buying a coffee shop and everyone told me not to do it. I am back with an update.,Entrepreneur,"Here is the link to the old post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/agcxwr/about\_to\_invest\_in\_50\_of\_a\_coffee\_shop\_and\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/agcxwr/about_to_invest_in_50_of_a_coffee_shop_and_dont/)

&#x200B;

So.. Obviously I bought the shop (50%) or I would not be here.

&#x200B;

I am not really sure what to update but I figure i might do this every so often.

&#x200B;

The larger facts. I ended up buying 50% of the shop for about $15,000 and then put another $12,000 into equipment we needed as a loan to the business.

&#x200B;

We shut down for a month (we thought it would be a week) to start breakfast and make the place work, work on recipes etc... we still don't have breakfast going! But this was by choice after I really looked at my option. We  will start breakfast (a much simpler menu that we originally thought) in about 2 more months.

&#x200B;

Instead we decided to get the current business really tuned in and grow another aspect of the business which is pizza and wine/beer.

&#x200B;

The first month was us being shut down. The next month we made half of what the business made in his 2 months before I joined.  The third month we doubled his usual months and at this point we will be 4x what his usual month was 6 months ago. This has allowed us to now have a staff of 5, buy more equipment, have money in the bank, and run the business much more efficiently.

&#x200B;

I attribute most of this due to efficiency, signage, the crowd I brought to the place,  2-3 events we do a month that focuses on wine/pizza  w/guest chefs come and collaborate with us, A slightly better social media presence, better consistency and service, summer months,  press.

&#x200B;

The things we are focusing on now which will grow our business are wine and cheese service during the week with charcuterie, breakfast and being open on sundays. 

&#x200B;

After that we plan on opening up another coffee shop and a pizza place to do pizza full time. 

&#x200B;

I have not started repaying that loan to myself and don't think I will for another 6 months since we are buying some expensive items like a truck.

&#x200B;

I am sorry this isn't organized well but I  figure it could be interesting.

&#x200B;

I figure this info can be a jumping off point for questions if there are any.

&#x200B;

If not I will just update again in another 6 months or so.

&#x200B;

edit: I wrote this before reading the old post because I didn't want to be influenced by it but I want to address some realities vs expectations.

&#x200B;

1. The partner is an amazing baker and coffee lover. He is dedicated and really is amazing.

&#x200B;

he is an amazing partner but we do have to work hard at communication and he starts late which has actually affected #2.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2.     2/3 of our monthly costs can be covered automatically by other coffee shops wanting our pastries. At this point we are turning anyone down who isn't within walking distance.

we deliver but don't focus . on it because we have only in the past month been able to consistently deliver on time. luckily pizza and booze has more . than covered this and we probably cover 1/8 of our costs instead.

&#x200B;

3.      We can easily raise our prices by 20% and be competitive.

&#x200B;

we did on most things and no one bat an eye

&#x200B;

I am really sorry about formatting... as always I am open to feedback!

235,fxq5km,False,Best Practices,71,"I found 18 growth hacking examples to inspire you for your next campaign. (Not only popular ones like Airbnb and Dropbox, even one from Tiger King).",Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I was looking for an inspiration for myself and compiled this list. I was coming across to popular examples like Uber and Airbnb, so I dived deeper into the growth hacking ocean to put something different on the table.

I included both popular and unpopular hacks to the list to inspire you, so here I go.

**1. Puma**

Puma asked Pele to tie his shoes before the kickoff and Pele did it. As expected, the cameras focused on Pele and his Puma's and made people realize the world's best footballer wore a Puma.

[https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=pele+tie+shoes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pele+tie+shoes)

According to the book “Three Stripes Versus Puma”, Pele was paid $120,000 to crouch and lace his shoes. This might be the best case of influencer marketing until this day.

**Takeaway:** Ask yourself who, when, where.

Who can introduce your product to your target audience best? When is the right time and which online or offline platform can you use to get maximum exposure?

**2. Unsplash**

Unsplash has a corner named “Collections"". They ask influencers (mostly micro-influencers) and invite them to pick their favorite photos and create a collection.

Then Unsplash promotes the collection on the website, newsletter and social media platforms. Flattering right? Yes, at least that’s what the influencers think.

The chosen influencers will often share their collections with their followers. And Unsplash gets free exposure + tons of user-generated content.

**Takeaway:** People like to be praised and be the center of attention. You can benefit from other people's audiences.

**3**. **Vitaly Uncensored**

This is quite unconventional and it's dangerous.

Vitaly Uncensored is a strange adult jokes platform. And people barely knew they existed until the Champions League final in 2019.

Until Kinsey Wolanski (co-founder and girlfriend of Vitaly) caused an international stir after running on to the pitch with a swimsuit written ""Vitaly Uncensored"" all over.

Naturally, people searched for the term and social media platforms like twitter flooded with reactions.

Vitaly Uncensored now has more than 32 million registered users and has raked in up to £3m in advertising as a result. And she was fined just £13,000.

**Takeaway:** A Growth hacker doesn't always follow the rules. You can sometimes break them as long as it is bringing you growth.

**4. Ahrefs**

Ahrefs can win the gold medal in the growth hacking Olympics.

They're the most popular SEO tool and don't use Google Analytics. Neither do they use the  Facebook Pixel. Instead, they hacked the most prominent SEO conference (Brighton SEO) with a 10 cent coffee cup.

[https://imgur.com/a/VvlP1Xo](https://imgur.com/a/VvlP1Xo)

Imagine how much attraction they had at the conference. Everybody was instantly aware of the existence of Ahrefs; those cups worked as an ice-breaker to open new conversations and possibilities.

**Takeaway:** Make a list of conferences and offline events that you can join. And think of how you can direct the conversation to your brand.

**5. Gmail**

If you were an early adopter of Gmail, you'd remember this one. You could only create a Gmail account if a friend invited you.

And every referrer had a limited amount of invites, which made it more exclusive and triggered the fear of missing out (FOMO) marketing technique.

It was simultaneously so exclusive and so viral, some people auctioned Gmail invites on eBay. It worked well because Gmail was offering better features and quality of service compared to the alternatives in the market.

**Takeaway:** Knowing behavioral psychology is a great asset for a growth hacker. Even a little psychological trick can be the foundation of a new growth hacking strategy.

**6. Please don't tell**

Gmail used exclusivity and FOMO triggers in their digital marketing strategy. What if you want to do it offline?

Crif Dogs is a hip place known for its innovative hot dogs. There is a strange vintage phone booth corner in the restaurant.

One day, a person walked in and used the rotary dial phone and CLICK, a secret passage door opened to a cozy bar. And the bartender treated him with a tasty cocktail and gave a card to this lucky person on the card written: ""Please Don't Tell"".

As you may relate, that person has felt like he discovered the most astounding secret in the world. He then talked about this experience to all of his friends and it caused a social chain reaction.

This word-of-mouth marketing strategy transformed this place into the busiest bar in New York City. So busy it's almost impossible to make a reservation.

**Takeaway:** If you can make someone feel special with a big secret, you can create a community of privileged brand advocates.

**7. Zynga**

You must remember the era of FarmVille, MafiaWars or Zynga poker. These were the Facebook games that made addicts out of our friends, parents and loved ones.

How?

You know the classic pricing decoy: Small $3, medium $ 6.50 and large $7.

Zynga re-engineered this by offering three choices to the user: grind, spam or pay. Well, since people didn't want to pay to continue playing games, they started to terrorize their friends by spamming them with invitations.

This had a huge viral effect but after a while, Facebook put an end to this spamstorm.

**Takeaway:** Try to approach popular marketing tactics from a different angle to create your own growth strategies.

**8. CD Baby**

""Your order is on the way"" you probably have received an email similar to this one. But I don't think you ever received something like what Derek Sivers wrote:

*Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.*

*A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.*

*Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.*

*We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved ‘Bon Voyage!’ to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, Sunday, December 11th.*

*I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby. We sure did.*

*Your picture is on our wall as “Customer of the Year”. We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!*

*Thank you once again,*

*Derek Sivers, president, CD Baby*

He spent 20 minutes writing this masterpiece and it exploded on the internet. This content got forwarded thousands of times, CD Baby got gazillions backlinks and new customers.

**Takeaway:** Differentiate your e-mail marketing strategy or copywriting efforts. Sometimes it is as easy as to put a smile on your customers' faces.

9. **Tiger King**

The Tiger King docuseries on Netflix have reached super-hyped status. One of the protagonists is called Joe Exotic, he is a sympathetic asshole. But I was not aware that he's a badass growth hacker too.

Joe Exotic intimidated his archenemy and biggest competitor by renaming his tiger show.

Just to add context if you don't know the show.

Joe Exotic keeps more than 200 tigers in his wildlife park. On the other hand, there is that lady (Carole Baskin) who is catter than cats and trying to save tigers under the banner of Big Cat Rescue. And they're trying to sabotage each other, all the time.

So to get more visibility to his tiger show and steal Carole's audience, Joe Exotic started a new show under the name""Big Cat Rescue Entertainment"".

In the end, Carole sued Joe in a $1M lawsuit.

Now, this obviously is not ethical and can hurt your reputation, I'm not suggesting you do the same. But this case can inspire you to be creative with your brand name. It could be interesting to include terms that people are already searching for.

10. **Fortnite**

Fortnite’s growth hacking strategy has changed the way of marketing around games forever.

Here is the default strategy of every game until the Fornite era.

1. Make the game.
2. Spend millions of dollars to promote it like crazy in conferences and ads of all sorts.
3. Launch the game, do the grand slam, collect the money and sail for the next game.

That's why we see a new Call of Duty, Battlefield, Fifa and similar games each year.

Well, Fortnite was not even popular in its first year but they found ways to retain their existing customer base with three tactics.

1. The game was completely free.
2. Huge in-game updates, which they called ""Seasons"".

Every ten weeks, developers brought new mechanics, weapons, maps, characters and so on into the game. They announce these seasons with trailers and encourage gamers to create hype.

So if you're a Fortnite player, you'll know, every ten weeks you'll have a new game to play.

1. Limited-time game mods

They regularly launched new game modes for a limited time to create FOMO. And gamers kept coming back to not to miss this one-time experience.

Meanwhile, they monetized the game by selling in-game items like character and weapon skins or dance moves.

In a very short time, they acquired a huge fan base and created their own celebrity streamers. The rest is history.

**Takeaway:** Acquisition is often an overrated aspect of marketing. In growth marketing, it's equally important to keep your current customers happy and transform them into your fans. (Focus on retention)

11. **Crimibox**

Crimibox is an online interactive detective game that lets you become a Sherlock of your case. We prepared a FB chatbot quiz themed ""Which detective is hidden inside"".

The assumption: If they are interested in knowing which kind of detective they are, they are potentially also interested in solving a murder case.

Crimibox asked several questions in a chatbot and helped them find out their inner detective. At the end of the quiz, they offer them to solve a murder case and direct them to the crime scene. This scene was Kickstarter.

Crimibox increased its subscriber number from 2K to 10K in 15 days and successfully launched on Kickstarter!

Why did it work?

1. It was super targeted.
2. People always fall for personality quizzes

**12. Shazam**

What do you do when you Shazam a song?

You try to suck up all sound from the music and Shazam does something quite ingenious at that moment. It encourages you to hold your phone up to speakers.

And this move gets everyone curious like ""Why the hell is she lifting her phone to the speakers?"". So yes, this is nothing but a word-of-mouth marketing strategy at its best.

It's not possible to measure the analytics or conversion rate but over 1 billion downloads say something.

13. **Uber**

How could a brand single-handedly take down the traditional taxi business? By knowing the enemy and the customer.

Hailing a cab after a night out is a pain in the ass, likewise in bad weather conditions. Uber knew that, and at the beginning, they focused on these key events.

They also picked a subtle fight with yellow cabs by highlighting the areas where Uber excels like; easy payment, lower prices and no more taxi-hailing.

People that were using the service were coming back, so they offered a $20 free ride to the new users to lure them in. After that, things went very fast, now we look at taxis like they're an endangered animal.

**Takeaway:** There is always room to fit in with your product and outsmart the competition. Understand your competitors, customers and the environment to come up with smart tactics.

**14. Hotmail**

Hotmail's growth hacking strategy is super simple and many companies like Apple copy-pasted it.

Hotmail placed a default signature line to every outgoing email and invited receivers to create a free account. Afterward, Apple and others used the same e-mail marketing strategy to spread awareness and grow their customer base.

**15. Hubspot**

Hubspot created a free tool that measures your site's performance by grading key factors like SEO, mobile performance and so on. Then it gives you tips to optimize your site.

People shared this tool with each other, it got many backlinks and quite a lot of attention on social media platforms as well.

No surprise, Hubspot grew its email list and grew to 15.000 users with the help of this one tool.

**Takeaway:** Many brands create little add-ons, apps and tools that solve a problem for their target audience. Afterward, they launch it on platforms like Product Hunt to get free exposure.

**16. Airbnb**

Airbnb leeched its competitor Craigslist's blood and used them as a distribution channel for a long time.

Their growth hacking strategy consisted of two parts.

**One**

They encourage their audience to cross-post their listing on Craigslist with a link back to their Airbnb profile. This way, hosts increased their chance to get rented and Airbnb got new users.

Eventually, it got tons of free traffic and generated thousands of users.

**Two**

Next, they contacted existing Craigslist hosts and asked them to sign up on Airbnb.

These two strategies helped them to grow their customer base and traffic without spending a dime.

It worked because it was a win-win.

Another one from Airbnb

You know how important the pictures are when it comes to renting or buying a house. The founders of Airbnb knew this too.

To grow bigger, they started to photograph their hosts' apartments. After the platform grew big enough, they hired an army of pro photographers to make their customers happy. And make some more $.

**Takeaways:**

Your target audience is already hanging out somewhere on the internet, find them and think of new ways to transform them into your customers. Don't expect value if you don't provide value.

**17. Dollar Shave Club**

Picking a fight with a strong argument is a deadly growth hacking strategy. Dollar Shave Club used video marketing to declare war to razor industry giants by asking these simple questions:

\- Do you like spending $20 a month on a brand named razor?

\- Do you think your razor needs a vibrating handle and flashlight?

And Mike, the founder, gives the solution to his audience in this witty video.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI&t=1s)

The video went viral and got 26M views. Please watch if you're not one of the 26M people.

**Takeaway:** Think of a problem in your industry and, use content marketing, show how your product could solve this issue. Especially video marketing is an effective way to show your brand personality and deliver your message.

You can learn everything you need to start with video marketing by reading this eBook:

**18. Dropbox**

Dropbox is known for its creative onboarding process and referral program.

The marketing strategy is quite simple. The product itself offers storage space in the cloud and they reward people with more space by gamifying the onboarding process.

Just like in the story Hansel & Gretel, they embellish this hard process by offering little treats. And the main course was their referral program where they offered 500MB free extra storage.

It works like this. You refer Dropbox to a friend, she signs up and you both get 500MB extra storage. 1 stone, 2 birds.

So the cost of customer acquisition for Dropbox is 500MB. This is definitely one of the nastiest growth hacking techniques.

**Takeaway:** One, If you can give extra value, you can make the onboarding process fun and rewarding for your users. Two, design a double-sided referral program. Offer something to the referrer and the referee.

817,cn5ts6,False,Case Study,97,Automation #6: How one customer automated their entire full time job,Entrepreneur,"A while back i made my first post on automation ( [If you're not using automation you're wasting your time and money](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8sqb7q/if_youre_not_using_automation_youre_wasting_your/)) and got a fantastic response (And, full disclosure, a few leads too). Today I'd like to talk more about three short examples that are some of my favorite projects.

Disclosure: I own three small businesses and also work as a freelance automation developer. Both of my businesses are highly automated and I've helped over 30 clients save more than a combined 100+ hours every day.

In India, there's a unique concept of something called a 'mandi'. The basic idea is that come Harvest time, farmers in India drive their produce down to a special & regulated market called the mandi where they negotiate and sell their produce to one of many wholesalers located there. There are no central bodies/electronic systems to track trades. Retailers will then buy produce from these wholesalers.

I had a client who built and sold access to spreadsheets containing the price of goods being sold by wholesalers. Essentially, most wholesalers have WhatsApp groups where they periodically send updates as to what price they're willing to sell tomatoes, cucumbers etc for. The client's entire day job was to keep an eye out on all these groups and maintain a spreadsheet of the price each wholesaler is willing to sell for each produce item.

# The automation

Reading/writing/updating spreadsheets is a piece of cake for automation software. Reading WhatsApp messages is not. Among other things, most wholesalers had different formats. One might send ""tomatoes 20 potatoes 40"", a typo might say ""tomatoes20potatoes 40"" and so on.

Owing to this, i had to go through a long, long text history from each of the wholesalers and write a lot of code to pattern match the right answer. Still, it was only able to read roughly 99% of the texts, which was good enough for the client.

The script essentially ran in the cloud, the client only had to use their phone to log into [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) every day. After that, they're free to go about their entire day, making sales, running another side hustle or just relaxing. The data was being updated automatically.

Total cost? Roughly $1600. Most of the cost went to the pattern matching.

# Lessons learned

With only $1600, a business owner was able to completely free up as much as 8 hours of their time, every day. It went from a high effort business to a money printing machine, with the only effort needed on their end to focus on sales and getting more customers.

Automation opportunities are everywhere. Even if you value your time at just $10 an hour, there's 2080 work hours in a year, a saving of almost $20800.

So take out five minutes of your time, think about cyber chores in your business. Things that are done entirely on a computer and consider automating them.

As always, i hope this post gave you a unique perspective on the power of automation and just how diverse, powerful and necessary automation is!

If you have any questions, please feel free to comment. I'm a bit strained for time but i always try to answer as many as i can!

The channel had no views before, and its getting no views after.

**Big Edit Here, I was Wrong. They did rely on keyword research for their website.**  
**They wrote or bought SEO content for their website, posted it around, optimized it and managed to get it to a pretty high rank (which is quite difficult and or expensive, congrats on that btw its not easy). They included their videos on those SEO pages guaranteeing views. AND ALSO they went viral posting things on reddit whenever possible. This is a GOOD strategy, and hard to pull off. But the numbers don't add up so im still convinced its the viral spike that had the biggest effect.**

**What he actually did to succeed \[edit\](in combination with the above):**

1. pick a subreddit thats is relevant enough to your video
2. title your video in a way that would be appealing to the subreddit
3. post your video and pray it doesnt get removed before it can get traction

My question is: Why are you misleading people to thinking that your keyword research was responsible for anything other than the standard few views here and there?

I suspect its because he wants to ride the wave as long as possible, and who could blame him, and also because he wants to convert his accidental success into authority to tell other people how to do it. Its some more *Internet Entrepreneurs Making Money Teaching Other People To Be Internet Entrepreneurs Bullshit.*

I just think it sucks that the information that may actually be useful falls through the cracks.

Just a little further research, They are ranking for a few high-volume keywords, and their youtube videos are on those pages for example:This page: [Here](https://yourautoadvocate.com/guides/unsold-new-cars/) is ranked #11 for the keyword ""[what happens to unsold cars](https://analytics.moz.com/pro/keyword-explorer/keyword/overview?locale=en-US&q=what%20happens%20to%20unsold%20cars)"" which has a monthly search volume of 5,376. They might be getting a couple thousands of views per month on this one page alone.

637,68sgdd,False,,173,Online business guru is jailed for two years for fraud. He claimed to be an 'internet millionaire' with mansions and private jets while in reality lived in a modest terrace house.,Entrepreneur,"From this news article: [Self-styled 'millionaire' who boasted of a jet-set lifestyle and promised riches to people who followed his tips was a conman who lived in a terraced house in Middlesbrough](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3284292/Conman-posed-internet-millionaire-actually-Middlesbrough-conman.html)

Some highlights:

A fraudster who convinced his victims he was an 'internet millionaire' using films he made in sprawling mansions and expensive cars was actually running a scam from a terraced house in Middlesbrough.

Lee McKenna promised that for a £2,000 sign-up fee, his followers would earn up to £1,000 a day using the tips in his promotional videos.

He shot the films while strolling around huge mansions and leaning on a silver Bentley in a bid to make himself look successful.

Self-styled “internet millionaire” Lee McKenna promised that for a £2,000 sign-up, customers would earn up to £1,000 a day by watching promotional videos and following his business tips.

...

He even visited a large property which was for sale and asked to film a video tour 'to show his fiancee'.

He then passed the house off as his own and even returned when the occupants were out to photograph himself on the driveway with a Bentley.

Another video was shot in a mansion in Wales which he rented for 24 hours.

....

But results never materialised and he instead tried to pressure customers into spending even more money on his ventures such as ‘Yournetbiz’, ‘substantial success’, the ‘Empower Network’ and ‘BigIdea Mastermind’

... 

One woman initially bought a product online for £5 - but then began to get emails from McKenna, promising she would make £20,000 if she paid £2,000 into his scheme.

The woman said she had little money, but he convinced her that she would make that money back within days.

She was told she was a 'quitter' when she questioned McKenna's outlandish claims.

652,7f6e80,False,,96,Instagram Blue Print,Entrepreneur,"A few days ago I made a post about Instagram secrets which got a lot of hype. Later I made a post about the Facebook Fraud which too got a lot of hype. 

These both posts had a lot of common questions. One of them being the blue print of Instagram that worked for me after 11 months of research. 

If you haven't already - PLEASE - have a look at the post **The Facebook Fraud** or else you'll just hate all the techniques I'm going to discuss in this post. Yes - THEY ARE dishonest (a lot of cheating) - but I guess if Facebook, Instagram and billion dollar social media agencies are OPENLY fucking everyone over for making an extra buck then why should we be the righteous men? 

If you choose the honest path then I guess you should better leave all social media platforms as they themselves are nothing short of blackhat thieves.

**The Blue Print**

(Once again this would make sense if you had read the other two posts I made)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7ezgco/the_facebook_fraud/
https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7erlr3/hushhush_secrets_to_instagram_no_one_would_share/

**Step 1**

Make an Instagram account that has possibility of getting monetized. At the end of the day - if you're going to work hard to build an Instagram audience / fan base - it has to give you something in return right? 

There are some niches that are BOOMING and always will get a LOT of hype on Instagram. 

Don't get me wrong - almost everything can be monetized but some niches are easier and quicker to monetize.

My **personal** experience is that niches related to beauty, fashion, travel, hotels (basically industries that are super visual) will always convert quick. 

Think of your potential sponsors and then build up a niche related page accordingly. 

If Fashion - your sponsors would be - fashion brands, fashion events, fashion retailers, malls, beauty products, beauty services (salons, parlors) and so much more - almost every big city has a MILLION fashion retailers. They wouldn't mind giving you $1000 for a post.  (If that statement makes you feel a bit confused - wait a bit - I'll explain later)

If Travel - hotels, restaurants, bars, travel boards - all these would be your potential sponsors. I can name 1000+ travelers who travel the world for **free** and do it on the back of their YouTube / Instagram. Its pretty doable. And they get invited to stay at 5 star resorts - they travel first class AND they still get money on TOP of it. 

**Step 2**

Post regular content. This one is so obvious. Have a clean feed that has a unique look and feel. A lot of Instagrammers develop a set of colors (filters) that they use for all their photos to make their feed look 'unique'. Not much to talk about here. Post good content. Thats all. A few tutorials on Lightroom and Photoshop and you're good to go. 

**Step 3** (Cheating) 

Social validation is the key. Its the classic example of a bar. A girl would be more attracted to a guy who has himself surrounded by a few girls (and guys). That is social validation right there. A girl that is in demand would want a guy who has some social proof. This is just so BASIC. 

I'll tell you a short story. This is like year and years ago.  A far relative of mine opened up a small snacks canteen in his town. The place had a small area for seating on the inside and a bit of outdoor seating for customers. The place (street) where he opened up this snack bar was one that saw a lot of school kids pass by as there were a lot of schools located nearby. 

What he did next was epic. He literally paid $10 each to a bunch of kids to come at his canteen everyday after school hours and sit and eat for free. As much as they wanted.

What happened next was the fun part. All the other kids noticed that these kids are sitting there having snacks and just hanging out. You can guess what happened then. **Social proof**. Automatically in a weeks time the place started getting flooded with these school kids. They all made this place **THE** place to hangout after school hours. 

Every retailer does this in some way or the other. When I go out to dinner on a weekend with my friends - we obviously **JUDGE** the places (options) we have by the crowd size. I'd rather go to a diner which has 5 customers already than go to one that looks deserted. You see how we think? Its just so obvious. Don't you think?

This applies to social media too. If 5000 people have likes your photo and then I see it. I have a higher chance of liking it (obviously if the content is decent enough). If your photo has a handful of likes - I probably won't like it UNLESS your content is just mind blowing. 

If I see an Instagram page that has 1 mil followers I **immediately** assume that this person is a big deal. Its just so natural. Do I care if that 1 mil followers are real or fake? Man who the fuck got time to check and shit? Haha. Yes, for us people who are actively building a base on social media and are marketers - yes we may give a fuck - but the general population? I guess not. 

They'd see that 1m on your Instagram page and worship you. 

Step 3 is simple. Buy yourself some social proof bruh! Ain't no way around it. Wait until you have like 100 posts (upload 4 a day that would mean in 25 days you have like 100 posts) and start pumping them fake followers.

Do it to point where you have 100,000+ followers in about 3 months since you started. That would mean 90 days of posting and pumping. 
Lets put it out at 1000 followers per day x 90 days = 90,000 followers
4 posts per day x 90 days = 360 posts

**Step 4** (This happens alongside step 3)

During the time in which you build your posts and followers (fake) - you will have to get yourself some engagement to match the growing base of followers right?

This is where engagement pods come into picture. For the millionth time - these are groups of Instagrammers who come together on a chat platform and exchange engagement. 

99% of the engagement pods are **FREE**. My advice? Its really not worth joining a paid engagement pod. You'd just be disappointed. 

Just Google for Instagram Engagement Pods - there are a hundred of those out there. Join them all and see what works best for you. 


**So far**
You have some social proof. You have a clean feed. You have 100k+ followers. You have 300+ posts. Your posts get 800-1000 likes per post and 100-200 comments per post via engagement pod. 

**Step 5** (Laundering the blackhat followers into whitehat followers)

This is the step that all billion dollar social media agencies that manage celeb accounts do that most of you always ignore. 

There a TIME and place to convert it all into reality. 

We faked it until step 4 and by step 5 we need to make it.

Gaming the Instagram algo to get a ton of real followers daily. 

Instagram algo is changing drastically. Every day they are trying out something new or the other. Just like Facebook - Instagram is trying its best to fuck you over so that it can make money. So - if honest way is you motto - be ready to spend a million dollars to attract Pakistani and Egyptian followers who are bots and never engage (see my posts about The Facebook Fraud if you don't know what I'm talking about).

To my knowledge - as I'm writing this post - Instagram is playing around with its algo.

Instagram wants to get more local and less global (user experience/interaction). It wants peoples reach to become more local (so that if they wish to go global - get their posts noticed beyond their base - they'd have to pay) - Thats what Facebook did.  

Instagram now will show you content (explore / top post feed) based on what you interact with and whom you interact with. If you're follower a user A and that user liked a photo X then the chances are that you will see that photo X. I hope that makes sense. 

If you interacted with a user (watched their live video / checkout their stories in the past) - Instagram will show you that too. 

This is both good news and bad news. Bad news as top post page is no longer global and more tailored to the user (you). 

What you see on top post page for X hashtag won't be the same as the other user (unless if they're your friend / follower).

So the reach is getting more limited (Thanks Instagram for fucking us over - we came - you said we could have fun on your platform for free but sooner or later you had to get greedy!)

Off topic - Its funny when redditors get horny when someone (a redditor) offers something for free to the public and redditors go like  (sure - sooner or later you will make it a paid thing and you'll fuck us over) - Haha. Funny isn't it? Thats exactly what everyone does isn't it? Somehow or the other they make that cash back. Either they sell your data for pennies like you're nothing but a piece of shit or they make you into an advertiser so you pay them cash and still get fucked over. Lol.

Moving on ... In this step - you will need to inject (cheat) fake likes to your posts. There are a billion companies that provide this service called auto like. Meaning - whenever you post on Instagram you get X amount of likes based on your package right when you post. So lets say you buy a package that gives you 5000 likes per post whenever you post within like 15 mins of you posting. 

Thats a ton of social proof man. This will push your post and make it appear 'trending' to Instagram and make your post appear on top post and explore page to a wide audience. 

Get this done - buy a small package for the start - maybe 1000 likes per most and gradually increase it to 5000 likes per post. 

But wait. What is point of all of this? 

**HERE IS ANOTHER SECRET** - Getting thousands of likes (fake ones) from these services + getting a thousand real likes FROM engagement pods (that are filled with authority accounts like 10k,50k,100k,500k and so on) will get your post to appear to millions of people. 

As in this way you start out local - but you go global as all those people on pods are from all around the world - so NOT ONLY they will like your posts - but with you having a ton of likes - their own followers will see your posts. Thats when it goes global.


**STEP 6** (Becoming Jesus)

Here is when you wash away all your sins. Its funny how every teenage girl who is obsessed with Instagram knows this but most mediocre marketers don't. 

**THE GIVEAWAY**

You have no idea how many giveaways Instagrammers (the ones who are serious) do.
Thats the same with YouTube isn't it? All the YouTubers I follow (most  of them are really famous) - they all have these giveaways right? Be it iPhone or a trip with the YouTuber itself or a chance to meet the said YouTuber and so on. 

Instagrammers are doing the same. 

You NEED to take part in giveaway loops. If you don't know what this mean (giveaway loop) then you are NOT AT ALL a serious Intagrammer. Basically - you connect with 5-7 Instagrammers  that are  IN YOUR NICHE and are big. Lets say you connect with 7 of them who are travelers (you too are one) and each of them have like 100k-500k followers right? You start a giveaway. You each put in X amount of $ and one of buys a bunch of iPhones and other X/Y/Z things to giveaway and you start a giveaway loop. That way you gain followers from each others base.  

You must be thinking (but my base is of fake followers - what will I give?) - **nothing**. Haha. Not for the start at least.  

You should make 2-3 giveaways every month for 2-3 months and you'd SURELY reach 500K with JUST that. 

Don't believe me? Checkout this company called Sunny Co Clothing. Its a swimsuit company and they got 600k Instagram followers in 48 hours. You know what they did? Everything I described above AND they went all in with giveaway. Basically they told that everyone who reposts their (Sunny Co) photo will GET a free bathing suit.  

What happened in next 48 hours? They gained 600k real followers? 
You see? You gotta be serious and smart if you gotta go big man. Stop fooling around with them bots and shit. Stop hating the game. Sooner or later we all wash away our sins. Haha. 

Partnering with the right Instagrammers for loop giveaway can be tricky but then again if you're in Instagram pods filled with amazing Instagrammers and you get to know them then you just have to shoot out a message to them. Chances are they too know you as they'd be commenting and liking your photo on a daily basis right? 

So it becomes easy. 

Yes - it will cost you money. But you gotta have money to make money. 

YouTubers these days do a lot of drama. Wherein they act and make drama as if there is a fight between two big YouTubers ... they start making diss tracks and exchange insults (drama) and what not. 

Everyone falls for this ... but its all a hoax. In this way - they both (the both Youtubers) get to have more subscribers.

Lets say I have 1mil subscribers on YouTube. I am Nate.
And lets say you have 1mil subscribers on YouTube and your name is Joe. 

What happens when Nate makes a diss track about Joe? 
And then Joe makes a diss track about Nate?

Haha. Obvious. The both get A TON OF VIEWS and all that drama?
Its funny as most of these drama people on YouTube after a few exhange of disses they make an apology video and become friends. 

That base of followers? Its get exchanged and they BOTH go BIG.

So funny that no one realizes this (the marketers on Reddit specially).

Its all game bruh. Either you play it and get that Lambo or someone else will and then you'd sit and cry. 

**STEP 7** (Making money)

Well by this time - say you have 500+ posts, with all the fake and real and engagement pods combined you have 10K likes per post - you are somewhere near 500K followers - its all good man. Haha. 

This is when you FIRST start trading shoutouts with the BIG sharks. If you're a traveler and you're sharing your Travel experiences via Instagram then reach out to those who are the BIG sharks. Ones which have big big big fan base. I'm talking about those who have 1mil or more. You have so much going on - the people you approach would surely reply to you won't they? 

Meet up with them - its FUN - collaborate - exchange drama - and exchange base (NO COST INVOLVED here) 
You see? Its all going to become real now. 

You got a fashion page? Get in touch with the big fashion bloggers and meet with them - call them - make some drama like YouTubers do. Repost each others stuff. Get the word out. Go even more bigger.

Do this for a while and the next step will happen naturally.

**FINAL STEP** 

Gotta get that green stuff right? 

Honestly speaking - by this time - based on your niche - brands would be on their knees asking you to advertise for them. Would it matter that 6 months ago you started out with fake followers? I guess not. Haha. By now you have 600K+++ and only 100/200K is fake. So no harm to anyone bruh. 

If you have an engaged community then you can safely charge $600 per 100k followers. At 600K that would mean ~$3K per post.

But then again - you should have experience working with brands. If you're a traveler - during the first few months (once you've crossed 100K by fake followers) - you should mail hotels for free stays. I **doubt** anyone would say no.  

Once you grow to 200-300K then approach larger hotel chains (5 star hotels and resorts) and ask them for more longer stays. I can name a 1000 travelers who travel the world on the back of their Instagram. 

Just keep doing this. 

By the time you reach 500K+++ you'd have all hotels inviting you to stay with them. They'd pay for your round trip. Expenses. AND pay you cash too. 

Aren't most of the travelers who are famous on YouTube and Instagram doing just that? Why can't you? 

**Phew - Thats all for this post guys! This is a LOT of stuff. You guys can complain all you want down below. Just remember  - if you ain't driving that Lambo - someone else will - and if Facebook and Instagram themselves LOVE stealing views and money, faking stats - then why can't you? Its all fair if in the end you come out clean is all I'm saying.**

Good Luck to all. 

FYI - DO NOT ask for recommendations on where to buy fake shit. Google is your friend. If you want to join pods or buy fake shit. Just Google it. When joining a pod - be sure that you DO NOT pay to join one. More often than not, you'd regret it.

But now, he owns a multi-million dollar trucking company called [Sudu](https://sudu.io/) that connects underserved entrepreneurs to giant companies such as Walmart and UPS.

**Humble beginnings**

At the age of 16, his military father left his mother to raise him and his two siblings. They lived in homeless shelters, and Amari at one point, had to commute over four hours a day to continue attending high school while also working.

He eventually landed a job with a company where he negotiated significant enterprise contracts. He helped the business grow to annual revenues of $4.5 million, but was let go from a higher rank that he was promised. He said he didn't expect it and it was really a low time in his life, but this inspired him to become a successful entrepreneur.

**Starting at the bottom**

Amari decided to started a telecommunications company in 2010 with just $300 and a 1990 Ford Ranger. However, before long, he managed to grow it to almost 200 trucks and to 5 U.S. locations. While at it, he also realized that there were bigger opportunities to create a tech company to connect underserved entrepreneurs (minorities, women, and veterans) with larger corporations. He then built his own business to fill the void.

In 2015, he launched Sudu, an online marketplace that leverages technology to connect small and medium-sized trucking companies (which make up 90% or the trucking market) to major corporations that ship goods. He chose the name Sudu, which is a Chinese word that means speed and tempo, because he says he believes it speaks well to the speed and efficiency they provide the industry through their technology which is considered as the ""Uber"" for truckers.

**The recognition finally came**

Because of his genius, Amari became in demand to speak at international tech and entrepreneurial conferences. He was invited to address the Nelson Mandela Fellows Panel and the Build Your Own Brand conference and retreat.

He also started winning major awards such as the 2016 NMTA Minority Business of the Year, the 2017 Georgia Trend Magazine Trendsetter, and the 2018 Atlanta Business Chronicle InnoVenture Award. He has even been included in the Venture Atlanta Top 10 Startups to Watch list.

Within just three years, his company, Sudu, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia, grew to having more than 300,000 trucking companies within its network, especially minority, women, and veteran-owned trucking companies. He has also been able to cut deals with large corporations such as Walmart, P&G, Delta Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, Georgia Pacific, and UPS.

961,82fmhn,False,Best Practices,156,"Employees first, customers second",Entrepreneur,"

It would be very hard for you to convince me otherwise, but this is the number one rule for a successful business. 

From day 1, I have had made the promise to myself that I would treat every employee that worked for me as if they were the *most* important piece of the puzzle, and two years later the results have been unprecedented.

Let’s dive in to why I made this promise in the first place:

**Money only motivates for a short amount of time, expecting money to be the only thing you give an employee is like trying to build a cement block house on a wooden foundation, eventually the weight will topple the structure over**  (this is an example of when an employee is burnt out) 

Think about this, what is stopping your employees from working elsewhere if the only source of gratitude is their paycheck?  The only thing your providing them is something they can receive anywhere! 

My theory is this: 
An employee will second guess him/herself to venture somewhere else when they consider:

My excitement when they ask for a day off just to rest, and my willingness to step in and cover them. 

My encouragement to leave an hour early to make it to their kids dance recital or little league game. 

My endless praise after every job, for their diligence and hard work (even if some minor things need to be touched up - I own a paint company, and it would be very very easy to be picky, sometimes I won’t even tell them a customer needs touch ups, and I’ll go do it myself without them knowing to keep morale high) 

My offering of free lunch each day, yes, they can bring their own lunch, but to me, they can save up to $50 each week if I provide it for them. 

Giving them weekends off no matter what! We had a job run a little over time last Friday and I called our job for Monday and rescheduled instead of having them come in on Saturday to finish. 

This, is how you grow a successful business:

**Accommodate your employees!**

As a result, my employee retention is near 80%. Even if they are tempted to make more money elsewhere, which has actually happened, the intangibles are what keeps them happy. 

By the way, I would say 4/5 reviews we get online from customers who’s house we’ve painted mention how wonderful the crew is, how polite, respectful and happy they are! It’s amazing. 

We’ve all worked for an employer that didn’t show us this appreciation, the key word is “worked” as in no longer working for. Thinking about it, they could have gave me a raise and I still wouldn’t work for them! It was like pulling teeth trying to get a day off to do something with my family. 

I hope this helps you in your entrepreneurial journey, because it truly has made an impact on mine! Best of luck to you all. Happy Businessing! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/82fmhn/employees_first_customers_second/,402,"But.... You sound like a doormat. If you get even one or two people who take advantage of your good nature, you're sunk. 

Also, not pointing out issues is setting up poor performance and 'good enough' attitudes that'll compound with time.

Strike a balance of management. (Very difficult)

147,cyt7yn,False,,100,The one thing that turned our $350k a year stressfest into a $3MM a year profitable business that runs without me,Entrepreneur,"We made ""the shift"" in 2014 and it changed everything. 

In 2013 we did about $350k in revenue at a 20% margin. It was a stressful firework show. We were tapped out. There was not enough time in the day to grow any more.

We pointed fingers and **blame things outside of our control for our shortcomings.**

**It was clear that our employees were the problem.** They were unreliable and were constantly messing the simplest things up. They were missing work. They couldn't be trusted to do anything so my partner and I did almost everything. We complained and pointed fingers and vented to our friends that it was impossible to hire good employees who wanted to work hard. None of this got us very far. 

**The shift was the moment we stopped pointing fingers and started taking the blame for things going wrong within our business.** 

Instead of texting the employees the night before about their shift we scheduled them out a week in advance. Even if we weren't sure exactly what they'd be doing. We overemphasized their schedules and set up automated emails and texts to constantly remind them as the day approached. 

Instead of training them by walking around the warehouse pointing at things we spent time recording training videos with perfect voice overs. We quizzed them at the end of the training videos with real on-the-job problems. 

Instead of having them do 25 things and trying to train them to do all of them well we simplified the job. A handful of employees did all of the customer service and we took that off the plate of the drivers and crew members. We had employees focus only on warehousing so our crew members didn't have to do that job as well. Instead of training 300 employees to create invoices and size items we had them take photos and then a few very specialized employees could size and create every invoice. 

**A few amazing things started happening.**

They started missing work a lot less. They messed up a lot less. Customers complained a lot less. Turnover hurt a lot less. Average employees started performing like our outstanding employees with 3 years experience.

And on and on and on. We didn't just do this with our employees but also our customers and suppliers. Everything about the business got easier.

2014 was a growth year but it was a lot less stressful. 2015 was even better. Fast forward to 2018 and we did almost $3MM in revenue on a 20% margin and it was stress free. I even stepped away from the company in 2016 to focus on real estate development while my partner and a few of our key employees ran everything. 

**You have a lot more control than you think you do. Start acting like it!**

\--

As soon as you stop blaming your employees for messing up and look at your processes you'll be more likely to succeed. 

Stop blaming Murphy's law for fires arising and start spending time preventing the fires.

Stop blaming the economy for your lack of customers and analyze your sales and marketing strategy.

Stop blaming your customers for demanding refunds and look at the promises you're making them.

Stop blaming your suppliers for missing deadlines and look at your communication and how it can be improved. 

Stop blaming your partners for not pulling their weight and look at the expectations and start to manage them.

Sorry for the rant. I hope this helps somebody out there. **Post over in** r/sweatystartup **if you want some solid advice from some smart people.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cyt7yn/the_one_thing_that_turned_our_350k_a_year/,988,nice ad ,2019-09-02 18:51:51

269,3da3ie,False,,254,PlentyOfFish Sells for $575MM in Cash,Entrepreneur,"Here's why this news is interesting to me. I've followed Markus Frind, the owner, since 2006 when he was blogging more (here - https://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/); when he posted his $901,733 Adsense check (here - https://plentyoffish.wordpress.com/2006/06/07/small-companies-google-adsense-is-the-future/); when he was regularly posting on webmaster forums; and when he was attending Affiliate Summit Conferences to network.

He started Plenty of Fish from his small Vancouver apartment back in the day. He knew how to program, he loved creating websites, he had an idea for a simple business (basic dating site), he created it, researched his ass off about how to grow it, and did what any of us would do when launching a site.

He had no funding, not marketing or sales team... just himself and hard work for many years. 

I've watched him creatively test things over the years like his own ad platform, different monetization (Neverblue affiliate offers), etc and one thing remained constant - he always worked his a*s off and always continued to focus on growing his site.

Today he gets $575mm in cash for his 12 years of hard work (plus all the money he made while operating the site). Really cool story. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3da3ie/plentyoffish_sells_for_575mm_in_cash/,787,[deleted] ,2015-07-14 18:01:55

343,6vio36,False,,358,If you're looking to just dip your toes into the water of entrepreneurship - Mobile Notary is a great start,Entrepreneur,"I work in a mid-sized southern city. My bank paid for me to get my Notary Public designation. I have to stamp forms for free when they come into the bank, but after work I can charge. I run an ad on google for $3/day and the amount of money I've made over the past month is insane. I had to bring other employees of the bank into my company to handle the volume. SO many people need a notary to travel to them for various reasons - and I offer other services like mailing/shipping and I carry mail stamps and envelopes for a little upcharge. I take credit card through square, which is so easy. 

It isn't so much the business itself that I'm happy about though. I've always dreamed of starting my own business, and this is giving me the confidence to try the other things I've wanted to do.

Ironically, it's the least prepared I've been on the ventures I've started. I literally just ran an ad, and the business was up. If you're lacking the confidence to self-employ - or you've never fully taken the leap - I think something like this would be a great middle ground because it shows you how you can run your own company and incorporate all aspects of running a business. 

I know so many people who get too involved in the details before they make their first dollar, and then they get discouraged when the work needs to get done.

**If you'd prefer to read the script instead of watching the video, here it is:**

 

**The Lean Startup By Erick Reis**

**The Book’s Main Idea**

The book’s main goal is to help readers avoid the number one mistake that makes start-ups fail i.e. launching a product or a service without the entrepreneur knowing who the product’s customer is and what those customers really want. 

To quote the author:

*“Success is not delivering a feature; success is learning how to solve the customer’s problem” Erick Reis*

*You can get this book for free with a trial of audible using the link in the description of this video. Subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you don't miss any future summaries.*

The Lean Start-up focuses on teaching readers how to better their start-up businesses by exposing them to a new way of thinking that is able to mitigate their risk going forward which automatically increases their likelihood of finding a product that sticks. The book does that through introducing the readers to a systematic and scientific method that enables them to get all the information they need to make fast and decisive decisions when starting a business. 

“*The ability to learn faster from customers is the essential competitive advantage that start-ups must possess”’* *Erick Reis*

**A Look at the Main Topics Discussed In the Book**

Here is a taste of what to expect from the three phrases of the book. 

&#x200B;

1. **First phase: VISION**

In the book, Reis, through his experience, explains why start-ups fail. He tries to make readers understand that the battle for a successful start-up is first lost in the vision where entrepreneurs follow a conventional approach of starting a business; which dictates that immediately they get an idea and it has been approved by either their friends or family, the idea becomes legit and ready to be launched in the market. 

According to the Lean Start-up, the conventional approach is wrong because it makes entrepreneurs launch start-ups based on untested assumptions, which increase the possibility of them creating a perfect product that nobody wants. 

*Reis says that the first goal of a start-up is to figure out the right thing to build, the thing that customers will want and will be willing to pay for as quickly as possible*. 

Under the topic of vision, Reis teaches the readers how to kick start a start-up the right way. He uses a super formula, which makes the reader better at starting a successful business. Here is a glimpse of the formula. 

&#x200B;

* *Step 1*: The reader is taught how to come up with a user experience vision.  
* Step 2: The reader is taught how to identify critical assumptions on their idea, which determines the success of the start-up. 
* *Step 3:* The reader is educated on how to experiment with critical assumptions. Here, Reis uses the Zappos example where he explains how Nick Swinmurn, the inventor of Zappos, came up with a successful business by simply experimenting with his assumption, ‘people can buy shoes online’ by first posting photos of shoes online to test customer demand.
* *Step 4:* The reader is taught how to build an MVP (minimum viable product)- A sample of the reader’s product that highlights the main features of their idea but takes less time, effort and money to build, that they can use to test their idea with.  

&#x200B;

1. **Second phase: STEER**

This phase the book focuses on teaching the reader how to steer his/her start-up business through using the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop formula.

In the book, Reis says the lean start-up methodology is based on a cycle of rinse and repeat; the build-measure-learn. What the reader is taught from the steer phase is how:

&#x200B;

* He can identify the leap of faith assumption from his idea.
* He can use various methods to test his assumptions.
* He can release his product to the market. 
* He can learn to define his baseline metric of judging the performance of his product to the market and how he can use it to measure his products success or failure. 
* He can assess his products results and know whether to pivot (adjust to a better one) or persevere (retain the idea).  

&#x200B;

1. **Third phase: ACCELERATE**

In the book, Reis uses the vision and steer phases to set a foundation for the reader’s last move to take to have a successful start-up, which is acceleration. In acceleration, Reis teaches the reader how he can move past the feedback loop faster and go on to set the innovation and growth ball rolling. 

Under accelerate Reis focuses on teaching the reader the following topics.

&#x200B;

* BATCH- This part explains how the reader can use a small batch approach to get his product going as soon as possible. The author goes on to say that smaller batches work better for lean start-ups because they enable the entrepreneur to detect a problem early as well as enable him to get quick feedback from a customer. 
* GROW- In this section, the author teaches readers how to identify and concentrate on the right growth strategy for their start-ups. To illustrate how important a right growth strategy is, Reis gives an example of how Sabeer Bhatia, the owner of Hotmail, grew the business by figuring out her best growth strategy, which was adding signature that carried the message, “Get your free e-mail at Hotmail” onto every outgoing email.
* ADAPT- This part teaches the reader how to develop an adaptive culture using the ‘five why’s system’. 
* INNOVATE- This part teaches readers how to set up their start-up as an innovative company that has an organized way of producing new-innovations and start-ups. 

**Conclusion**

The big take away from the book, **‘The Lean Start-up’** is; entrepreneurship is management so for the reader to succeed in it, they need to manage their start-up business as the institution it is and avoid jumping head first into ideas.

731,8l16gc,False,Best Practices,67,Templates will save you from yourself,Entrepreneur,"One of the critical aspects of a successful business is time management and one critical element of time management is reducing your administrative burden.  

No matter what kind of business you have you will inevitably run into a certain amount of administrative work to keep it afloat.  Typical administrative burdens include the following:

1.  Quote proposals for new prospective clients
2.  Processing Sales Orders for completed deals
3.  Drafting Delivery Notes (In the case of a physical product) with Packing Slips for boxes
4.  Drafting Sales Invoices with payable terms, and enforcing those terms by following up with overdue clients
5.  Payment Entry to check off client payment.
6.  Offering tracking information or status updates to clients after they have ordered and before they have received their product/service.


The list could go on, it could also include prospecting for new leads, handling social media inquiries, fielding customer service inquiries, and so on.

Because you're just one person, and you might not have an administrative assistant going into this game, guess who is responsible for handling all that?

If you want to stay competitive with people who **DO** have an admin assistant, and an intern named Blake that brings them coffee to boot, you're going to need to find ways to reduce this burden on you so you can focus on what's important, building your client book and fulfilling their demand for your product/service.

Enter templating.

You probably have run into the word before or know it well already, but how often do you use them?  

There's plenty of software out there, but the one my virtual assistants and I use is Gorgias templates.  It's a Chrome extension, you can enter in a large amount of text (with formatting) and then when you type a keyword into Chrome and hit tab, it replaces it like a giant word replacement on your phone.

But the question is, what to template?  

There is a notion in business that nothing ever happens just once.  Which is why I would assert you should template everything.

Now you might be thinking, ""sure, sounds great, but who has the time to template everything they write?""  

To which I would respond, who has the time *not* to template everything they write? 

Once you've written the e-mail, it's there, just waiting to be templated.  Take a look at your sent folder.  Billions and billions of e-mails that, with a copy-paste and an editting out of specific information in 5 seconds, you can turn into a template.  Look at all that time you wasted sending e-mails that weren't templates!  The horror!  You could have been taking Ukulele lessons with all that time.

It's easy to go overboard.  I templated my text message that I send to my pot dealer.  I don't know if he's noticed yet.  You don't need to go that crazy about it, though.

But there's a second advantage to templating all of your business e-mails, and that's a key thing that you really want to prepare yourself for:  

Extracting yourself from your business.

For the first two years of my company it was literally like a baby that became a screaming toddler.  I never left it alone, never took a break, and never trusted a single other person to do anything that I was doing.  After all, it was my baby, and I knew best.

I was dumb, that's a way to work yourself to an early grave.  If you like working 16 hour days, falling asleep crying, and waking up for more of the same, feel free to follow my example.

If you got incapacitated in the middle of your one-person show, would it just collapse?  What value would the company have?  If it relies entirely on you, it has no value independent from you.

Templating your business functions removes the business from you in a very important way.  As you template it, you also systematize it.  As you systematize it, so can you delegate it.

Alright, so onto a practical exercise:

1.  Normal Mode - Start templating e-mails you've sent to people in the past, especially the ones you're sending all the time.  You know the ones.  Download Gorgias or whatever one suits your boat and template away.  You can now delegate simple tasks to someone like a virtual assistant, or do them quickly yourself.

2.  Advanced Mode - Now, start to look at your templates and see how they interact and connect.  Draw flow charts for how templates should follow one another.   Make entire business processes lightning fast/efficient this way.  You can now start to delegate entire business processes out to others.

3.  Super Advanced Mode - Build in metrics into these flow charts, and you can start to tweak the templates to be perfect.  Building lead generation templates?  Sure would be great if it was optimized for response rate.  Building sales templates?  Sure would be great if they were optimized for converting leads into clients.  Now that you've got a system, you can diagnose that system and make it better, faster, stronger...  To do this, you can do something called AB Testing -- suppose you prospect 50 people per day by reaching out on their contact forms.  You can send 25 of them one template, and 25 of the same template but altered slightly, and do it for one week.  After a week, you've sent 175 e-mails of Template A, and 175 e-mails of Template B, all at the same timing interval so excluding that as a control variable, and then you gauge it -- which template received more responses?  You can discard the less effective one, keep the more effective one, and start anew by tweaking it again in another way.  By doing this, even if the system is not great at first, all it will take is time to refine it.  If you approach it like a scientist studying the results of his/her experiments, you will not fall victim to your own internal prejudices about what you think a good e-mail is.  You'll have the cold, hard facts to prove it.  

Hope this was helpful and as interesting as a post about a dry but useful subject can be!  

Have a great week everybody, or as we say in template,  have a great week (FIRST NAME)

291,angrnq,False,,195,Why You Shouldn't Quit Your Job To Start A Business,Entrepreneur,"Sounds crazy right?

Someone on the internet telling you to NOT quit your job to start a business.

In this day and age, entrepreneurs are seen to hate 9-5 jobs.

I guess I'd consider myself apart of that group (who likes 9-5 jobs?)

But if you're considering quitting your job to start a business, maybe rethink it.

Realistically, if you have a well paying job working 9-5, there's still a block of time where you can work on various side-hustles/businesses.

Let's consider the 24 hours you have in your day as someone who works a 9-5 job.

Sleep 7 hours / day?

Maybe work around 8 hours / day?

Lets say leisure, commute and daily meals takes up 4 hours?

There's 5 hours in your day unaccounted for. 5 hours a day on a side-hustle/business is A TON of time to get things started while you're still in the beginning stages.

And in my honest opinion, if you can't make a business work while you're working a 9-5, the chances are you probably won't be able to make it work once you've quit.

I don't want to discourage any aspiring entrepreneurs here, but sadly, it's the harsh truth.

If you put your head down and actually WORK and your income starts to exceed the income of your 9-5, then quit.

But I genuinely think it's a dangerous environment to have around the entrepreneurship community.

Risking your entire lively hood, and for some, even their kids lifestyle. Just because some 22 year old on Instagram quit his job and is telling you to do it too.

Fuck that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/angrnq/why_you_shouldnt_quit_your_job_to_start_a_business/,771,"Quitting your job because someone hiding behind his computer in his father house told you to do is plain stupid.

Don't do it!

Quitting your job because one 22year old boy on IG said it is trending thing to do is stupidity.

Quitting your job when you have a safety net is a better option.

Before Mark Zuckerberg went all in to pursue his Facebook vision, he had his parents' house to fall back on if things didn't turn out well.

Ask many successful entrepreneurs and they will tell you the same thing. They all had their safety nets.

You can't afford to carelessly quit your job to face entrepreneurship when you have dependents. 

Listen to me, entrepreneurship isn't as glamorous as we paint it. It takes a lot of hard work.

For the past 5 days I have never gone to bed before 3:00am simply because I want to surpass my January result. So much creativity and time are going into my work.

The best time to start your own business is when you are on another person's payroll.

If dedicating 5 hours to your side-hustle daily won't help it grow, then it means you are either in the wrong business or nothing is ever allowed to prosper in your hand. If you like dedicate 24 hours to it, you will still be a full-blown failure.

When I wanted to start [EntrepreneurBusinessBlog.com](https://EntrepreneurBusinessBlog.com) which has today grown to a globally recognized brand, I did it using a [blogging business plan](https://www.entrepreneurbusinessblog.com/blog/2017/06/14/successful-blogging-business-plan/) I drafted while working for the government (we call it NYSC in my country).

I didn't wait for the compulsory one year service to be over before deciding to figure out what I was going to do with my life. I launched my business blog immediately.

Two years down the line, I'm now running it as a full-time business.

Ideally, your business should be generating at least twice your paycheck before you ever consider quitting to focus on it.

384,4e7v4o,False,,186,"Even if they know ""buy low, sell high"", most entrepreneurs don't know the next two things in that sentence.",Entrepreneur,"Something I learned a few years ago that will help most entrepreneurs is working capital management. And that means adding two more phrases to that list: ""collect early, pay late"".

Collecting early and paying later reduces the cash trapped in your business, cash that you have to find or finance. Simply collecting from customers early and stretching your payables literally unlocks cold hard cash.

I was recently looking at buying a company that had about $50m in working capital. They were extending 140 days to customers but paying on 30 on the nail to suppliers. Competitors were balanced at about 90/90 - collecting 50 days earlier and paying 60 days later. We calculated that we could have literally paid for the company just by rebalancing that situation to match the competitor, releasing tens of millions in cash to allow us to pay off the note very rapidly.

If your business is trading well but struggling for cash, look hard at your receivables and payables, and figure out if you can collect earlier or pay later by negotiating better terms. You may be surprised at the impact.

You can also look at inventories, but that is another story.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4e7v4o/even_if_they_know_buy_low_sell_high_most/,683,"so you are effectively forcing the weaker parties to loan you money without receiving interest...

225,fwir3y,False,,226,A conversation I had with a landlord on a commercial property,Entrepreneur,"My cousins wife recently opened a hair salon about 6 months ago and signed a commercial lease with a landlord. With it being such a new business it basically had no financial cushion to deal with the fact that they have been shut down due to COVID19.

She pays $6,500 a month in rent...which if she's opening and have paying customers is perfectly fine...but she's not open and she can't afford to pay the rent, pay her mortgage, and feed her family with basically no income and her landlord has been a real pain in the ass with her demanding rent. So she asked me if I could help as she felt like I could clear the air.

For the sake of this conversation lets call this business ""Mrs. Hair LLC"" and name will be ""Mrs. CW (Cousins Wife)

So we arranged a meeting with the landlord and his lawyer. We sat down and the lawyer basically said that they would be demanding rent and if its not paid by the 7th they will begin eviction proceedings and sue for damages.

My poor cousins wife was distraught and upset that her dream could go up in flame. So I took lead and I asked ""Who are you going sue""

To which the landlord said ""Mrs. CW"" and I said ""Who signed the lease?"" to which the landlord said ""Mrs. CW"" and I said ""no, what does the lease say""

We pulled out the lease, the lease was signed by ""Mrs. Hair LLC""

I said ""You will be suing Mrs. Hair LLC, which really what is the business worth right now?"" the landlord stumped and I go ""its a hair salon, what kind of assets that are of value do you think you can extract from a hair salon that's barely existed 6 months? How much do you think shampoo is worth?""

To which the landlord (the lawyer was staying pretty quite) said ""He could still sue"" I said ""You can, question, how long was this property vacant before Mrs. Hair LLC signed the lease?""

Landlord said 7 months

I said ""ok, and how many free months of rent did you give Mrs. Hair LLC?"" and the landlord said ""2"" and I said ""Ok, the situation is crappy for everyone, Mrs. Hair LLC isn't able to operate her business, therefore she can pay her rent which is money that I'm sure you were counting on to pay whatever it is that you need to pay...but let me ask you then essentially before Mrs. Hair LLC moved in you made no money on this property for nearly 9 months right?""

Landlord goes admits I was right

""Our economy is driving straight off a cliff, what are the chances if you decide to evict Mrs. Hair LLC and sue Mrs. Hair LLC for breach of contract or whatever it is your going call it that this property could take twice as long to find another tenant considering the economy will be in shambles? You also have to ask yourself after this virus situation improves...will you be able to get someone to pay $6,500? Or maybe $6,000 or $5,500? On top of that you sue Mrs. Hair LLC and come to discover the LLC essentially has no assets for you to collect on so even after you win you don't have the ability to collect on or maybe we can come up with a different plan.""

His lawyer pointed out that I was right, that he could only sue the company and that chances are he'd easily win however its unlikely he'd ever be able to collect anything worth of value from it. So the landlord said fine what did you propose.

Now in this case it was a 5 yr lease at $6,500 a month for a net contract value of $390,000.

Mrs. Hair LLC will write them a $2,000 check as an ""upkeep fee"" and no rent will be due for the next 4 months. If in 4 months the situation does that improve we will sit down again and discuss what should be done...if business improves then the $24,000 in lost rent will be added onto the additional 50 months of rent for an additional $480 a month. So after the 4 months her rent would go up to $6,980. At the end of the day he walks away with the same revenue, and maintained a client in the property and kept his cash flow going.

We negotiated a bit, and agreed on a $3,500 upkeep fee, $1,500 would be a ""late fee"" and not applied against due rent.

They walked out of the room (the landlord and lawyer) and discussed whatever they discussed and came back in and they agreed to the terms, and that his lawyer would draft up a document to be signed. I told the lawyer I'd like him to send the document to my lawyer for review who already has a copy of the lease and is familiar with the situation to review and if everything is fair and square she'll sign it and pay them the $3,500 upkeep fee.

I'm happy to report agreements have been signed, parties have been paid, and my cousins wife has a bit of breathing room.

I share this story to encourage all you business owners to work with your landlords, creditors, and vendors who you owe money too. The fact is this sucks for everyone. But at the end of the day if we work together we will come out of this better then if we just fight each other tooth and nail.

My cousin gave the landlord some free money, but she got a reprieve on rent and hopefully 4 months is long enough for her business to open back up and for her to get the cash flow going again. I hope that $3,500 is enough to keep the landlord above water...or at least slow the sinking of his ship.

**Edit** there is no personal guarantee. She didnt want her business to affect her personal finances and so she put down a hefty deposit it was 6 months rent plus she paid to have the location renovated instead of having the landlord do it. 

Now if she breaks her lease/etc she does lose that deposit",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/fwir3y/a_conversation_i_had_with_a_landlord_on_a/,848,[deleted] ,2020-04-07 11:16:56

481,9wcvnb,False,AMA,111,60+ Most Asked Questions by Entrepreneurs​ on Quora and Reddit. I have provided the answers as well. AMA,Entrepreneur,"I have compiled a list of 60+ most asked questions on Quora and Reddit and written my action oriented answers.

Here are 20 questions.

**Q1: How Reddit And Quora Got Past The Chicken And Egg Problem Of Having No Content/Users?**

*Topic – Scaling*

Quora and Reddit solved the “empty site = no users/no users = empty site” problem in similar ways.

The founders of both services spent the first months filling them with content themselves. On Quora, the founders simply answered and asked lots of questions under their own profiles. But the reddit approach was a bit more interesting. Instead of just using their own accounts, the founders would create fake users to make it look like there were multiple people submitting links.

Their ‘submit link’ form featured a third slot: “Username”. According to Steve Huffman, reddit co-founder, it took several months until they didn’t have to submit content themselves to fill up the front page. They also focused on keeping everybody in the same place in the beginning. reddit had no subreddits, and Quora was mostly focused on technology. Instead of having users spread out, everyone was in the same place, making the community feel bigger than it was.

&#x200B;

**Q2: How Do I Research My Competitors?**

*Topic – marketing*

A quick Google search will show your so many things. But, the only bulletproof way to research your competitor is to ask their customers. Talk to their customer that how is your competitor serving them. After talking to multiple customers, you’ll get all the insights of your competitors.

&#x200B;

**Q3: How Do I Build An Audience On Social Media?**

*Topic – marketing*

If you don’t have money to buy ads, there are only two ways that can significantly gain you followers. These are following other accounts and shoutout for shoutout.

Start following people who might be interested in your product. In return, many of them will follow back. To follow those relevant people, open your competitors’ accounts and start following them. Once you have around 500 followers, start doing shoutout for shoutout. This means that you ask your followers to follow someone else’s account and in return, that account will also share a related post to their followers.

&#x200B;

**Q4: How Do I Evaluate Social Media Marketing?**

*Topic – marketing*

There are two methods. One is ongoing analytics, and another is Campaign analytics.

Ongoing analytics are necessary for keeping up with the overall pulse of general conversation about your brand and company. Once your brand tracking is set up, you can just let it run and check in regularly to see how everything is going.

Campaign-focused metrics, on the other hand, help you understand the impact of targeted marketing initiatives and will vary from campaign to campaign, depending on your goals for each. An effective social media measurement program will likely include both ongoing and campaign-specific measurement.

**Q5: How Does A New Business Get Its First Client?**

*Topic – marketing*

Most people say that you need to build a website, set up a store, buy a hotline number before starting a business. The exact opposite is what you should do. You first need to get a client and then spend time on these activities. You can get your first client by asking your friends and family. Your very customers will be your friends, friends of friends, local neighbors, or even your family

&#x200B;

**Q6: How Do I Find Investors For My Startup?**

*Topic – funding*

One of the deciding points for an investor to fund a startup is to see the x-factor. It should be positive and high.u(T) = u(0)e(xT)u(t) = user at time T=Tu(0) = user at time T=0x = x factor

If you have an idea only, then it’s unlikely that you’ll get any funding. You need to start getting customers to get funding, and customers will only come when you have a working product or prototype.

&#x200B;

**Q7: Why Do Venture Capitalist Say No And How Do I Make Them Say Yes**

*Topic – funding*

There are two ways to measure a startup traction.

One is increasing in revenue over a period of a week. If a startup is offering its services for free then the measure would be the increase in active users. If you see that the rate of growth is just 1% over a week which means that startup would grow only 1.7x over a year. If the rate of growth is 5% per week then startup would grow around 8x in a year. Venture capitalists pay a lot of attention over this growth. If the growth per week is 1-2% they say No because they can invest money in some other startup where they can get a better return on their investment. To make them say Yes, increase the growth to at least 5% per week.

&#x200B;

**Q8: How To Know If Your Startup Idea Already Exists?**

*Topic – Getting a startup idea*

If your idea consists of having something over a website, you can use Google hacks to search if your idea already exists or not. Make a list of 2-3 phrases that perfectly describe your product. Enclose those keywords within the quotation mark and search on Google. Google will show only those results where it finds the exact phrase. For ex, if your idea is having an online store for a pen with light, just google “pen with light”, “light pen”, “luminescence pen”. Don’t forget to use quotation mark.

&#x200B;

**Q9: What Should I Do If I Have An Idea For A Startup, But I Have No Money Or Resources Whatsoever?**

*Topic – Getting a startup idea*

First, you need to use the money in your bank account. The next point of contact would be family and friends. Make sure that you give a share of your company to them so that they’ll be more interested. The third point of contact is the bank. Take a loan that is enough to build and validate a prototype. Once you’ve built the prototype, show it to your potential customers and note down their feedback. Get customers rapidly. Then show the feedback to investors and you’ll have the funding.

&#x200B;

**Q10: I Have An Invention Idea. What Do I Do To Check That Someone Hasn’t Already Invented This Idea?**

*Topic – Getting a startup idea*

Do a quick google search and check if it’s already taken or not. Go to the US Patents and Trademark site ([http://www.uspto.gov/](http://www.uspto.gov/)) and then search.

&#x200B;

**Q11: What Are The First 5 Hires Should I Make?**

*Topic – Hiring*

In a startup, it’s not like that cofounders don’t work on bottom rated tasks like replying to someone’s comment on Instagram. Cofounders do the same things that employees do. There’s no hierarchy present.

Hiring depends on the skills of co-founders. In I Innovate, we have three co-founders. One is good at marketing, one is good at sales, and one is good at finance. So, the spots left are product development, designers, editors, and engineers. So, we’ll be hiring based on these skills.

&#x200B;

**Q12: How Big Should A Stock Option Pool For Employees Be?**

*Topic – Hiring*

15-20%. Standard vesting for options is 4 years, with a one-year “cliff vesting” and monthly vesting after that. “Cliff vesting” in this context means the employee must be employed by the company for a minimum of one year before the employee earns any of the options.

&#x200B;

**Q13: Should I Form My Company As C Corporation, An S Corporation, An LLC, A Partnership Or A Sole Proprietorship?**

*Topic – Legal*

Start it as an S corporation. If you have to issue both common stock and preferred stock then start it as a C corporation. An S corporation can easily be converted later into a C corporation. LLCs are popular but are equally complicated. Partnerships and sole proprietorships are to be avoided because of the potential personal liability to the owners of the business.

&#x200B;

**Q14: How Should Equity Be Divided Among Co-Founders Of A Start-Up?**

*Topic – Legal*

The most common method is based on the money each co-founder is putting in a month over the next 12 months. For example, if one co-founder is putting $400 per month and another is putting $600 per month then the first cofounder gets 40% and another gets 60%.

&#x200B;

**Q15: My Clients Pay My Invoices After Months. What Should I Do?**

*Topic – Payment*

Get paid upfront. If you think that having a contract will solve the problem, it won’t. Problem is, contract just means that you can try to go through court to get the court to order them to pay you. Even if you win in court it does not mean you’ll be able to collect. Have some samples/portfolio, show them that as proof of your ability to do the work, then get the money and only after that make them their stuff.

&#x200B;

**Q16: I Want To Quit My Job And Open A Startup. Is This A Good Idea?**

*Topic – Miscellaneous*

Quitting a job to start a company is always a good idea. However, before taking this risk, I recommend you to keep everything ready like a business plan, model, idea validation, etc. It’s better to figure out that something is wrong in your idea when you have a job than when you don’t.

&#x200B;

**Q17: Do I Need A Business Plan To Be A Successful Entrepreneur?**

Topic – Miscellaneous

No, it’s not mandatory. But having it gives you so much deeper knowledge of the business. I remember that I also refused to create a business plan for the first 4 months. I thought that I knew almost everything about my business but I was not completely correct. When I created a 12-page business plan, I realized that I learned so many things about I Innovate magazine that I didn’t know earlier.

&#x200B;

**Q18: What Is The Proper Definition Of A Startup?**

*Topic – Miscellaneous*

A startup is a temporary organization used to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. “Temporary” is emphasized because a startup’s goal is to cease being a startup, to graduate up to be a large business or to fail and move on to another opportunity. An early-stage venture that isn’t capable of this type of rapid scale-up is a small business, not a startup.

&#x200B;

**Q19: Which Is More Important – Idea Or Execution?**

*Topic – Miscellaneous*

An idea is just a multiplier but the execution is what matters. A good idea means a high multiplier. So, If execution is good then having a great idea means it’ll be multiplied by a high number and will result in more revenue.

&#x200B;

**Q20: What Should Be A Startup’s Top Priority In Its Early Age?**

*Topic – Miscellaneous*

There are only two priorities for a startup in its early age. One is customer acquisition and another is product development.

Just want to back the OP up,

Negative comments? only show how little you might understand about marketing. While we will bitch and moan about someone else actually DOING something and delivering, even if it is copy and pasting... it got your attention and you had a look at it. -That is the sole purpose- 

&#x200B;

Linking to his own site is a bonus and while it might look kind of salesy or whatever your 'preference'of bad feeling might be the research (even if it was copy and pasting) is there. the work is there. Now all he or she has to do it keep working the stage to get enough traction, depends on ops stats and all.

All in all, its a great collection for starters, not all readers will find every question applicable. I obviously disagree with a few but why would I want to start a drama thread when I see this is actually brilliant.

Commend the OP or move on.

Do i need to have a degree to know that that there will always be people that will disagree or that the method of marketing will differ for everyone, no. 

Note to OP: you probably know this but the haters will always appear out of nowhere. This is a great way for marketing in some  industries.

449,hir7ge,False,,122,You've been brainwashed as an employee and it's prohibiting your company's growth.,Entrepreneur,"For those of you who are starting your business fresh out of working a 9-5, this one’s for you. (and for you dreamchasers waiting to pull the trigger...you got this.)

**You’ve been trained pretty much your entire working life, and most of your scholastic life to earn money and SAVE it.** 

*We’ve been taught this for many reasons:*

One of which being that ***it’s what used to attract employees to work for large companies back in the day.*** 

The most attractive selling point to potential applicants was the wonderful 401K plan, or the Pension that was offered. (and your parents probably taught you this because that's all they knew)

**We all know how GREAT and STABLE these options are…NOT.** 

Anyway, you’ve been trained so long to operate this way - so now, as a business owner, **if you don’t consciously make the switch from “Saver” to “Investor” your growth will be limited.** 

*Here’s my experience on this theory:*

I help contractors understand sales and marketing principles in their business. If I tell a contractor how I got started by spending a large amount of money on advertising avenues such as HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Thumbtack or another paid lead generation service, the push-back I usually get is how they aren’t comfortable with spending money on leads. 

I have to literally re-wire their thinking to understand that **the only way for your company to grow is for people to find you when they need you,** and the fastest, most efficient way is to pay your way in the **beginning**. 

It’s scary to them because they do not see this as an investment that yields a return, instead, they retreat and revert to their old-fashioned thinking that by spending the money (which they have not yet been trained to allocate as an advertising expense) **will result in a ""loss"" as it would if they were to spend money on a vacation or something when they worked for someone else as an employee.** Equating these two things is done more out of habit than through logic and reason. 

For a company that wants to grow, but has a leader with this mindset of penny pinching when it comes to advertising, that company will never reach the potential heights it could, and most importantly, it will take way too long. 

**My advice is to have a system to JUSTIFY your spending**

***To go from “Saver” to “investor”*** you must track your investments so you can justify re-investing over and over again. For example, If I set a budget of $1000 for paid leads for my House Painting Business, I’m going to track my:  


* Opportunities (Estimates Given)
* Sales (Closed Business)
* Secondary Leads (Friends of people I met through this advertising channel that have allowed us to give them an estimate)
* Secondary Sales (Closed business of friends or neighbors of people I met through this advertising channel) 

That $1000 investment could’ve landed me well over $25000 in business. However, the “saver” business owner is probably still running around passing out flyers wasting his time. 

If you want to grow FAST, PAY your way, track your investments, justify your investments, rinse and repeat.   


I also want to emphasize how important it is to track your ""secondary leadflow"" - again, attributing organic lead-flow through customers met through the advertising channel.

317,d5g9v7,False,Best Practices,85,Want more clients? You need to use the Ben Franklin effect,Entrepreneur,"When Benjamin Franklin was running for his second term as a clerk in the Pennsylvania legislature one of his colleagues gave a big speech criticizing him.

Franklin still won that second term, but he knew he had to get this hater on side as soon as possible.

As a keen observer of human nature Franklin deployed an ingenious tactic, the excerpt below (taken from his autobiography) explains how it was done:

""Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days.

""He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour[.](https://imgur.com/a/JdM8OJ9)

When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.""

**So what happened here?**

This is an example of *cognitive dissonance*.

When our minds can't reconcile our behaviors with our beliefs, we change our belief to match the behavior.

After lending Franklin the book, he justified his actions for doing so, and started to like him as a result... you don't lend a book to someone you dislike!

This psychological phenomenon is affectionately known as the Ben Franklin effect.

The reverse is also true, you grow to *hate* the people you harm.

Which helps explain war-time atrocities, because during times of war we de-humanize enemies to justify killing them.

In 1969 Jecker and Lecker [studied this phenomenon](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872676902200407) by giving students a chance to win money in an intellectual contest.

After the contest the study participants were broken up into three groups:

**In group 1,** the researcher asked them to return the money because he used his own funds and was running short.

**In group 2,** a secretary asked them to return money because it was from the psychology department and funds were low.

**In group 3,** they were not approached at all.

Then they were all surveyed to see how much they liked the researcher.

Group 1 rated him higher than Group 3, showing that a personal request for favor *increased* liking.

Group 2 rated the researcher lower than Group 1, showing that an impersonal request for favor *decreased* liking.

This has obvious benefits in sales and marketing.

Further [studies have shown](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289539480_The_Favor_Request_Effect_Requesting_a_Favor_from_Consumers_to_Seal_the_Deal) that in a sales setting even just *asking* for a favor (not necessarily receiving one) can significantly increase the acceptance of discounted offers.

It changes a sales setting from a competitive one (me verse them) into a reciprocal one (everyone gets something out of this deal), thus increasing your odds.

**Key takeaway:** Ask potential clients to do you a small favor. Doing so makes you more likeable and changes the perception of your interaction, leading to more sales.

211,b30hre,False,,140,Ever wonder how businesses doing $2m+ in sales are running their offices so efficiently?,Entrepreneur,"Like, how are people doing $3 or $4m even million in sales per year handling all that WORK?

I want to provide you an expert inside look at exactly this. I run my own cleaning business, but I also provide trained virtual assistants to local business owners. We run well over 50 local businesses for the owners now and over the years I have accumulated so much knowledge on how the biggest companies do it.

So, here are 10 things I have learned from running 50 businesses for the owners:

&#x200B;

**1. Implement systems BEFORE massive growth**

Practically every business doing $500,000 and above in revenue has implemented some systems to keep things running smoothly. But really, many of the core ones should be in place by the time you are doing $20,000/mo in revenue. If you don’t have them and start getting busy your business will start to crumble.

&#x200B;

To really scale you need, at a minimum:

\-A follow-up system

\-A hiring system

\-Reputation management system

\-Your sales structure in place (Sales process, KPIs and so on)

\-Consistent marketing strategies

Plus, a dozen small ones that save time here and there.

&#x200B;

**2. Write processes down NOW, so you can delegate later**

Closely related to the first, many of the owners I know actively write down their daily workflows, processes and preferred method of doing each task down, because they know it saves time and makes it 10x easier to bring help on later.

When everything is already written down, bringing on a VA or manager becomes a piece of cake and makes turning over the work to them painless.

They understand the more processes they have, the freer they become.

&#x200B;

**3. Keep Your Business Organized**

Most of the business owners we work with start to separate the different pieces of their business into distinct areas. This allows them to keep each part of the business healthy and performing, instead of trying to do everything together and making a mess.

When you separate your business into areas like marketing, sales, customer service, team management and operations, it becomes far easier to get everything done by allowing you to do the most important tasks for each area.

&#x200B;

**4. Understand Client RETENTION is #1, not new customers.**

This may be the most important point on the list. As you really grow, retaining your existing customers becomes the biggest bottleneck to growth, not how many new customers you can get in a month. This is where “churn” comes into play, as you cannot gain enough new customers to replace existing ones that drop off every month or tear.

You will find this starts to become a big problem at $50,000/mo but becomes huge when you hit 7 figures.

So, the businesses we run in the best shape understand how crucial this is, and work to create awesome retention strategies to make their clients AND teams know they are appreciated. They go above and beyond to fix issues, instead of just refunding and moving on.

Start developing your client retention before anything else and it will serve you well.

&#x200B;

**5. Upsell at every point**

Similar to #4, the best business owners understand that they can get more revenue from existing customers than they can from new customers. There is more money to be made on the back-end than there is on the front-end, because you have already proven yourselves to your customers and they trust you to do a good job.

Upselling is a priority when you make a new sale, but also to your existing customers. Text them to tell them about a new service you offer, occasionally throw in a free extra, ask them if they’d like to upgrade to a deep clean or need their windows cleaned. Don’t bug them, but do ask them because chances are, they need it done and just haven’t thought of it yet.

Implementing a solid upsell strategy took our average ticket size from $168 to $217 over a year…that is a lot of extra revenue when you do hundreds of bookings every month.

&#x200B;

**6. Sell add-on services**

Coming off point #4 & #5, offering additional related services is a huge way to increase your revenue, particularly in-season. For example, if you are a cleaning company, then partnering with a window cleaner and home organizer during spring cleaning season is a very attractive offer for your customers. If you are a painter, try partnering with a pressure washer.

This is such a wonderful way to help your customers out and earn more money without doing more work.

Are you starting to see a pattern? The bulk of your revenue starts to come from everywhere else instead of from new customers. Referrals, upsells, gift cards, and add-on services start to represent an increasingly large chunk of total monthly revenue.

&#x200B;

**7. Take Deloads**

And this may be the second most important point of all…the most successful business owners I know all take frequent breaks, even if they feel like they can keep going.

Key here is building the systems we talked about early and having a VA or manager to run things to allow you the freedom of time off. When you don’t have these things in place it means YOU are the only thing keeping your business chugging along.

When you have built your business in a way that allows you to take a week off, that is when you know you are able to scale.

&#x200B;

**8. Always Trying New Stuff**

Marketing and sales changes so quickly, that if you keep sticking to the same method year after year it will eventually become a hindrance instead of a help. Most big  businesses double down on their core strategies, but they do make time to experiment with new ones all the time.

Honestly, this one really falls under “always be learning”. The owners I know who run the tightest ships are always learning and implementing new things in their business, often for fun.

&#x200B;

**9. STOP MICROMANAGING**

It makes everything worse. You must learn to trust your team, otherwise you will effectively be a manager forever. That is why hiring the right people to step beside you is so important, because if you can get that right you know you can trust them to look after things.

The owners we struggle to help the most are the ones who try to micromanage our VA and their teams on every decision, and then blame them for a poor job done when they look away for one minute. You must learn to give people autonomy and trust, or else you will burn yourself AND them out.

You know something interesting? People who run $10 million…$20million and above businesses, they often just tell their team what to do once, and don’t check back in on it, because they know it will get done. It allows them to make far more progress at scale.

&#x200B;

**10. Become emotionally mature**

Distance yourself emotionally from your business a little. Being overly invested often means you will achieve less of your goal. I see this all the time, and it is closely linked with owners who micromanage all the time.

Your business is your baby, I get it. But if you keep treating it like your baby and get personally hurt by every bad review or thing that goes wrong, you are heading for a crash. It sucks your momentum and positive energy away that you could be using to grow your business.

When I started emotionally distancing myself from my businesses (just a little), I found that I was able to view the problems and solutions needed objectively in a way that was never clear to be before. It gave me the energy to go ahead and get started on them, instead of feeling like I was drowning in problems.

This is true of many of the top business owners I know.

I don’t want this to just be another list that you read and scroll away from. This isn’t something I am just putting out there for likes, but to give you some real actions to take that will transform your business.

Go ahead and see what you can implement on this list in the weeks ahead, and you will start to reap the same benefits they have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/b30hre/ever_wonder_how_businesses_doing_2m_in_sales_are/,877,love this thanks  ,2019-03-19 17:49:14
356,b6w4nq,False,,211,Starbucks spent millions getting facebook followers and now they have to pay to reach them,Entrepreneur,"[Starbucks spent 10 years](https://youtu.be/0BaSjglvEf8?t=1746) spending big money each year, I’m guessing 10s of millions of dollars, getting followers on Facebook. The plan was simple. The goal was to get followers and then reach them organically and drive value over time.

Right now they have 36 million followers on Facebook.

Well it turns out Facebook likes making ad revenue. It turns out Facebook owns the platform and has all the control. Slowly over time Starbucks started noticing their Facebook posts were only reaching 1% of their following. How could this be? We spent all this money to get these followers and now we can’t reach them. Facebook’s response?

You can reach the last 99% if you boost your posts and continue to pay for ads. Facebook has every right to do this. Its their platform. Its their algorithm. They have the users and they call the shots.

Starbucks spent millions getting the followers on someone else's platform with no control and now they are paying again to reach them.

This concept expanded to YouTube, Google, Yelp and Amazon [here](https://sweatystartup.com/the-dangers-of-relying-on-a-third-party-platform-to-drive-revenue-episode-39/).

**This is another reason why I love** [**service based businesses**](https://sweatystartup.com/businesses-i-love/)**.**

Businesses with sales that are driven by actual interaction that goes beyond a click or an online ad are most insulated from the above risks. If you can speak to your customers on the phone or by email it’s a lot easier to control that and nurture that on your own terms.

Taking that one step further if your business reaches customers on a [local level](https://sweatystartup.com/think-local-and-start-small/) and those customers can interact with each other in the form of word of mouth marketing you are further protected. Your customers are not only face to face with you but they rely on each other for recommendations and there are synergies with all the different marketing drivers.

**edit: Starter Story is on Product Hunt today! [Check it out](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/starter-story-2) and show support if you can.**

Here is my interview with Matt Griffin, the founder of Combat Flip Flops, a footwear company with a great mission behind it.

Matt has a really unique story. He was inspired to start the business after some of the things he experienced while deployed in the military. He is grossing up to $350k/month. He also had success on Shark Tank!

### Background

My name is Matt Griffin, and I'm the CEO of [Combat Flip Flops](https://www.combatflipflops.com/)--a team of people that believe we can bring sustainable, peaceful solution to armed conflict with education and economics.

Combat Flip Flops is an e-commerce company employing artisans and entrepreneurs in Afghanistan, Colombia, Laos, and the United States.

With a team of five, Combat Flip Flops distributes products direct-to-consumer through our website, Amazon, and a handful of boutique dealers. Collectively, we refer to our customers, dealers, and supporters as “The Unarmed Forces.” In 2017, The Unarmed Forces (UAF) funded 217 years of school for Afghan girls and cleared 2814 square meters of landmines in Laos.

As the CEO, I manage the corporate team to help drive messaging, social media, and sales. Alongside me is Andy Sewrey, President, and Donald Lee, CMO.

[Photo of me on Shark Tank](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/combat-flip-flops-main.png)

### How the idea came about.

I’m an army brat and a single child of divorced parents. I bounced around a lot as a child, but I claim Iowa as home. When I was 18 years old, I left Iowa for West Point and started my career in the Army. As a member of the class of 2001, life quickly transformed after September 11th, 2001.

155,hoq3md,False,Lessons Learned,406,How a $8.00 investment got me a recurring $100 monthly sale,Entrepreneur,"Hello everybody! I hope you’re all doing great today! I’m a long time lurker, first time poster, but I have a story to tell you.

About a week ago I was listening to The Side Hustle show and heard an episode about a woman from Michigan who started a pet waste removal company (essentially poop scooping). She was able to replace her pharmacy job and was able to build it into a six figure income. 

I was blown away. I’m a textbook over thinker who’s built out businesses and websites over and over again (only getting to the point of launch and then abandoning everything out of fear or lack of connection). BUT THIS. THIS WAS SO SIMPLE I COULDN’T OVERTHINK IT:

1) Low Startup Costs

- Free Wix site (looks legit af) edit: ended up buying domain for the traffic after posting lmao
- I design my own business cards and flyers
- Just need initial tools and recurring expenses are only trash bags, gloves, masks, and gas.

2) Low Time Commitment

If you charge $14 per visit, have 30 clients, and show up weekly, you could be making up to 60/h if you route your clients correctly. WHICH MEANS that you get your time back, which is truly the only thing I care about at the moment. 

3) Easy to preform

Other services businesses such as pressure washing, house painting, and cleaning were all to high risk for me. Didn’t want to blow someone’s paint off while pressure washing, or hire a whole crew to paint, or clean anything with a rag. Not interested.

This is literally scooping poop into a bag and tossing into the customers bin (unless they want haulaway services in which case you can charge even more!)



All of that to say, I finally pulled the trigger with my fiancé’s support and we went out yesterday in the heat to hand out flyers. Yes, it was uncomfortable and hot and sweaty and weird walking up to peoples doors to slip in a flyer. BUT it only took my $8.00 to get my flyers printed, about 2 hours of my time, and not even 12 hours later I got a call from someone looking to schedule cleaning AND BI-WEEKLY SERVICES. Which means that I’m looking at just about $100 extra dollars per month for 1 client and MAYBE 2 hours max of my time actually scooping.

$50/h picking up poop. 

And KEEP IN MIND: if you’re making as much as I am right now ($15/h 40h/week) then literally all it would take is convincing 30 people to book your services and you can leave your job. Income REPLACED AND EXCEEDED.

I was hyped all night yesterday and just wanted to share it with my favorite sub. A lot of your stories and ideas have influenced me to think that there’s actually a different way to exist instead of being monitored by your whack ass bosses all day. 

Side Note: there’s a lot that goes into a business but over the course of the last 3 years I’ve acquired almost every skill I need to start a business myself. This didn’t happen overnight. It was piece by piece. Wondering why tf I was learning illustrator. Why I learned to edit videos. Why I made so many website mockups. It all felt like an endless cycle. But when I found the idea that made sense, it was as if all my skills were acquired for this purpose. Keep learning! It definitely will reap benefits in the future! 

TLDR: I actually put advice to action and booked a $100/month client with only $8.00 and 2 hours of putting up flyers on doors. Rate works out to about $50/h for minimal effort.

Thanks friends! Here to answer as many questions as I can if you have any.

676,ckee2b,False,Case Study,143,"How I Made $10,000 on YouTube Before Age 18",Entrepreneur,"TL:DR at bottom

[**Video version if you'd rather.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTaFeqfYMN4)

**How I made $10,000 on YouTube before 18.** Over 99% of the money was made from Google Ads running on my videos. [I've added a screenshot of the YouTube analytics for proof](https://imgur.com/4NLR3Cg), I also made some money from Amazon affiliate marketing, enough to put me over the $10,000 threshold, but a drop in the bucket overall.

**I started by making videos on just about anything and everything...** I was really interested in how video editing works, and how it could be put to good use. I decided YouTube was the best and easiest option, because then I also get free feedback on how to improve.

**For my first 20 videos everything I made was terrible**, just awful. You can tell a video is really bad when even the creator of it cringes at it when watching it back, but I uploaded them anyways, and promoted them on Reddit, because I had no idea how to fix them. The great thing about Reddit is that everyone either hates whatever you post, or everyone loves it, and when people hate things they love to tell you exactly why. 

**Soon enough I was creating much better videos**, they still weren't anything great, but a viewer could sit through them. It was at this point I hit my break, one video got almost 1,000 views in the first day off of Reddit (and basically no views after this), in a completely new niche to me. So what did I do? I deleted all of my other videos, and decided to just keep doing what was working. The next video got 3,000 views in the first day, once again, off of Reddit.

**I kept this up for the next five videos**, but the seventh video was different. It got almost 3,000 views off Reddit, like normal, and then got another 3,000 views the next day, then dipped off, but not permanently! After that it got a huge spike, capping at 5,200 views in one day, and stayed consistent from then on at 2,000 views, until it hit ANOTHER spike, capping at 6,700 views in one day, then dipped off into the ~1,000 views a day range for good. [I've attached a screenshot of the analytics for this](https://imgur.com/0enxEWq). The main difference for this video was simple, much higher average watch time, and much better click-through-rate (good thumbnail and title).

**This kept up, about one out of every seven videos would do absurdly well** for a long period of time, for about my first 70 videos. These videos make up for a majority amount of the income, as you can see if you looked at the [previous screenshot](https://imgur.com/0enxEWq), that video alone made $1,300. I spent just over 2 hours making that video, meaning I was making over $650/hr while working on it at 15 years old, because it's still making money to this day.

And that's what I did, it was that simple.

**Almost anybody can repeat this exact same thing**, and there are plenty of ways to make even more with YouTube, after all it is the second most used site on the entire internet, only behind Google. The method is easy, write down a list of things you are an expert at (or if you're good at bullshitting you don't even have to be an expert), they can be anything. I'd recommend a list of 10 or more if possible. Then, download the chrome extension VidIQ, and search all of those on YouTube, try a couple of keywords for each, such as for this channel that brought me $10,000, the niche's name is ""Don't Starve"" but ""DS"" also pulls up results. Look on the right sidebar for the [VidIQ score](https://imgur.com/utFYczZ), anything with a score of over 60 search volume, and under 30 competition is an easy win for views.  Go through your list looking for the best scoring result, whichever one is best will be what you make videos on. If nothing is over 60 search volume, and under 30 competition, make another list, or if you can't even so much as make another list, give up, you won't make it if you can't overcome that small an adversity.

**Create a channel**, and start making videos in the niche, post them even if they're terrible - but make sure to improve your video making skills with every video you release. Get feedback from that community through promoting the videos. Eventually you'll have a video do well, keep doing whatever caused that, and start to work on custom thumbnails, and SEO at this point. This will allow your videos to get recommended to people through YouTube itself, letting you tap into a massive audience for free!

**Now, if you want to make even more money,** that's also possible, but **it will be more difficult**. Mostly because the easy niches are harder to find. The niche has to bring in money from something other than just Google Ads, my personal favorite is through affiliate marketing. Say for instance your niche is fitness, you could push people to buy your favorite workout gear off of Amazon or almost any other site you buy off of, and YouTube will send you millions of potential buyers for free. Even if you convert just 0.1% of 1,000,000 viewers, selling a $1,000 workout machine at a 10% commission, you will make $100,000 off of ONE VIDEO.

TL:DR I figured out the formula for causing a video to go ""viral"" within a small niche, and repeated it over and over. The formula is high average watch time, high clickthrough rate, and at least 100 views on the video, within a niche that has low competition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ckee2b/how_i_made_10000_on_youtube_before_age_18/,504,[deleted] ,2019-07-31 21:00:52

We closed on the sale of the business yesterday and walked away with over half a million in cash. 

I woke up today woth almost ZERO responsibilities and I feel like a new man. I’m glad we stuck with it and saw it through to an exit event!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/98ec5c/sold_my_business_yesterday_and_i_feel_like_a_new/,511,[deleted] ,2018-08-18 19:40:16
90,es5qxv,False,Operations,154,"My most successful business ever, the jewelry cleaner.",Entrepreneur,"Starts in 2011. I went to a shopping center which had a food court for lunch and as I was walking in I saw a older man at a Kiosk selling a Jewelry cleaner. He dragged me in and he had this whole nifty little sales pitch.

I'm a sucker for a good sales person, and he was good. You ever seen videos of that famous potato peeler sales man in NYC? This was the same type of system but with a liquid jewelry cleaner. Anyway I bought a bottle of this stuff and off I went.

I took it home to my then girlfriend soon to be wife and showed it to her. She liked it, and it worked really well on her jewelry. 

A week or so passes I go back for lunch to the area again, same man is there. We chit chat for a bit. He seemed like a nice guy. This repeats the following week, this time he invites himself to lunch with me. We get to talking, he mentions how he has some bills and wants to a bulk sale.

At the time I was trying to get my girlfriend to do something productive. Long story short as I feel this might be a long post I bought out his supply for $750. This included the solution, the bottles, the stuff he used, and a sunday of learning how to mix/sell/etc.

**Lets go to retail**

I did some thinking and some looking. I didn't really want to sign up for a Kiosk somewhere as I didn't want to commit that hard to this product. We had 3 sizes 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml. So we found some flea markets and you just had to pay for the table and setup and sell.

So we started doing the flea market scene, and we sold product. We made money, but it was a lot of work for what we made. Also another thing dawned on me.

This shit lasted forever. The 500 ml bottle was $14.99 the 250 ml was $9.99 and the 100 mll was $4.99. The issue being if you bought a 500 ml bottle you'd basically spend years going through that bottle. So as we'd sell the product we were basically eliminating customers.

After talking to the old man, his trick to success was traveling. But that wasn't on the table.

So we shelved the idea, by this point we had basically recouped the $750 (I actually don't know if we did...but it would have been close)

**6 months passes**

Life goes on, 6 months (or so passes) when one day my friend invites me out to dinner and drinks with a friend. Guys night out.

Turns out his friend is a general manager at a local privately owned jewelry store. We get to talking about business and he talks about how he's frustrated by customers wanting discounts and how often times the only way he can close the deal is by offering a discount.

This sparks an idea in my head, but its not really fleshed out and I don't want to pitch it right now so I ask him ""If I had a way for you to give out less discounts would you be interested in hearing me out?"" he said ""Yea sure I'd hear you out"" we exchanged info.

**Flesh out the idea**

So I have a background in sales and marketing and have been through quite a bit of sales training and one thing I learned at one point was that gift giving can be a way to head off discounting a product. A $5-$10-$25-$50 gift can sometimes present more value to a customer then say a $500 discount. 

So I have this jewelry cleaner, that honestly I'm not interested in retailing. The fact is this cleaner...is not that special so its not like I have some protect-able product here. However what if repackage this product as a gift for Jewerly stores to give to customers?

I find some cute 30 ml bottles, I find some nice microfiber clothes. small ones. I also find a little package I can put all of this into.

All told I can buy enough (minimum order which could make 200 sets) bottles, microfibers, and containers and my cost per package would be right around $2.50

So I buy everything and I produce 50 little ""Gift Packages"" of a Jewelry cleaner, a microfiber cloth, all in a nice little bag. I print up some labels and title them ""Jewelry Cleaner"" 

I then do some googling, pull up some articles talking about gift giving in sales basically dig for proof that my idea WORKS.

I call up my new friend the general manager and tell him I got a way and an idea for him to get higher margins by offering less discounts and I want to show him.

**The Meeting**

Going into the meeting I had a targeted price point of $5 with a min purchase of 50. 

I go into the meeting I start by showing him the cleaner. I show him how it works, how shiny and pretty it makes everything. I then show him my evidence how gift giving can be used to counter discount requests. And I walk him through a situation.

Customer comes in, $3,000 piece of jewelry. Customer says he's going pay $2,500 you counter with ""I'm sorry sir we are quite firm on the price, however what can provide you is this free jewelry cleaning kit so you can keep your investment pristine"" (Pitch was better then this)

If a customer doesn't ask for a discount, give it away as a gift as a thank you.

He asked me how much I said min order is 50, $5 a kit. He counters saying $3 (I'm not about to make .50 cents a package) I counter with $5 and I'm firm he goes ""$4"" I go ""lets slip the difference at $4.50""

We shake hands he pays me $225 and I hand over 50 kits.

**3 Weeks later**

General manager calls me, says he loves the kits his sales rep have almost given them all away and he believes they are working. He works another 150 kits and wants to know how fast I can get them to him. I say sweet, need a week to deliver. 

He then tells me he doesn't want my crappy art work on the bottle, but his own brand. I know a graphic artist (the one I used the first time) can take his logo/print it on stickers and we will put his brand on the bottles. We get his logos printed, and it was basically a straight pass through (whatever the cost for the stickers was he paid)

2 weeks later (it took awhile to get the stickers) we deliver 150 kits. 

**Restock**

I see a real business here. I got a product, I got a customer, I got a system setup. I do some more research buy spending about $1,000 on bottles, packages, and microfibers I can get my cost of a package down to about $1.65 if I remember correctly. 

I do the order, I then put together a little outline of a power point with stats and examples and research on a one pager (back and front) with my contact info on why my product is a great product for jewelry stores to give away for free.

**Time to hit the streets**

I took a week off from work, I loaded up my car with 500 packages, I had another 1,000 packages ready/in production at home. With more capacity available. 

I map out all my jewerly stores in my area and go door knocking, after a week of busting my ass I have a bunch of contacts. 

I cold call those contacts until I can get meetings. I scheduled about 14 meetings. Most of them happened, most stores bulked at my offering however I picked up 3 clients all who purchased around 100 kits each. At an avg price of $4.50-$5.50. (I Had created a price sheet, encouraging larger orders)

**Lets review**

I had 4 different stores ordering from me, each spending around $500 (at the time I was guessing) a month with me. With an avg margin of 65%-70% (not factoring in my labor of course) Basically a really solid side hustle for me, I was bringing anywhere from $1,000-$2,000 a month and my then girlfriend was doing most of the production and I was handling the business side of things + delivery.

**5 months passes**

I had added another store on my client list, I was now bringing in about $2k a month when my first client called me up. Told me every year all the jewelry stores in the region would come together for a little conference and they would also have vendors come show of their products and pitch their ideas. It was $5,000 for a table.

$5,000 was a serious chunk of change to consider, but the way I figured it the business had funded it and it was worth the risk. 

**Prep** 

I had flyers with my research (basically my one pager) I had created before and after pictures of dirty jewelry/after cleaning and I had gone to 3 of my clients and got them to agree to record a quick testimonial on what my product had meant for their bottom line I also got them to agree to be a reference for any store that wanted to pick their brain on my product, how they used it, and what it meant to their sales. (In return I bribed them with 50 free packages)

**Conference**

Conference comes around, never had any clue we had so many jewelry dealers show up. I actually got quite a bit of interest in my product. One guy in particular wanted to retail my product online but wanted slightly larger bottles. I also had a grand total of 20+ stores tell me they wanted to sit down and see if my product would be a good fit.

**Results**

* One very large order from a guy who wanted 5000 100 ml bottles he plan was to retail my cleaner (I'm fine with this) I agreed to sell him the bottle whole sale for $2.25 (my cost was just under $1)
* 11 stores agreed to buy my packages, this was a grand total of 1,500 packages.

All in all I had a $2,000 monthly steady stream from my clients before this. I had one large order for just over $11k and 11 smaller orders for a combined business of $7,125.

**Time to get a shop and an employee and legitimize this business**

I worked with a lawyer and we created an LLC to protect myself, I then rented out a small shop and I hired one of my wifes friend to help us out with production. We setup a system of production and started knocking out orders. It took us some time to deal with the influx of orders but we eventually got it under control. We also had logistical issues with printing of labels/getting them on which I worked with my printer I used to solve.

Basically we would charge a one time $500 fee if they wanted order their own logo and we'd print up 1,000~ labels for them. We'd then charge an extra .15 cents a package for every package after that for packages with their own branding on it.  Very rarely did we even have to reprint the brand labels. 

**A year in**

I had a ""factory"" about $6k in income per month, and a reliable ""employee"" we could call in to work for us when we needed it. After every thing was said and done were clearing anywhere from $2k-$2.5k a month. 

**Growth plan**

My now wife and I sat down and we talked about growth, we had some fixed costs that weren't changing for the foreseeable future and honestly we would like to one day grow this business to something we could support ourselves on very comfortably and had a goal of about $15k-$20k a month in profit.

Our big hope was the guy who ordered 5k orders. The issue was our product didn't sell that well for him and he told us he had no intentions of repurchasing from us. However what was working was the jewelry stores giving away our product for free (and we later found out a FEW of them were retailing our product but not many) so the direction the company had to take was to focus on what worked, get jewelry stores on board to give our product away for free.

We created a referral program where every min order a jewelry store referred us to resulted in us giving them a courtesy 25 free packages on their next delivery. Over time we grew our network to 20~ stores.

**Another year passes, conference time again**

Conference came up, we signed up again. This time we had an even more powerful presence. Long story short we ended up with about 35-40 stores ordering from us monthly.  After doing a lot of digging. I felt we had reached a point where our current logistics limited us. 

**Logistics**

We were in a funny space, we were bringing between $10k-$15k in revenue with a net profit of somewhere around $6k-$7k. In order for us to grow we had to get out of the region. The challenge was I made a really good living at my day job and would have to leave that job to really grow the business. However we were having the conversation about possibly having kids, and so forth the stablity of 9 to 5 was attractive and at the end of the day putting $6k-$7k which was partly a part time job was an attractive offering.

So we made the choice to sit on the business, add clients where we could but maintain our customer base.

Part of me wishes I'd have quit my job and gone into this full time...but decisions are decisions.

**Relationship goes on the rocks**

Keep this section breif, after about 2 yrs our relationship was on the rocks. My job was sucking. I was in a bad head space. This affected our business, we lost some clients because of poor service on our part.  It didn't take losing many clients to have our fixed costs to have a huge negative impact on our margins.

I wish I could tell you things improved but they didn't. We ended up getting divorced and through neglect the business fell apart. My ex wife had a lot of influence in the area, and I made the decision to pack my bags and move. 

That was the end of that.

**Details that I can remember on the business**

I sourced my bottles, microfiber, and bags (that I put everything in) on alibaba or whatever that site is called (you guys know what I'm talking)

The cleaner that I used was a mixture of something called purple something (It's been a few years, and honestly we bought it like twice) that was the base concentrate we would then mix it with water and window cleaner, now windex cause I believe we needed window cleaner with ammonia/or other scents in it.

The cleaning solution itself...honestly wasn't all that impressive all things said. I mean it worked, but it wasn't revolutionary by any means of the imagination. And the cleaning solution itself was ""almost free"" a small amount of the purple cleaner with a couple bottles of window cleaner would make like 5 gallons. Per bottle cost came in at like 1-2 cents for the solution. Most expensive part of the package was as follows

I also found it very cost effective to order the window cleaner in bulk, at first we were buying straight up from the store but we saved a pretty penny by buying in bulk.

* Bottle
* Package (bag, which we would change at store request/etc)
* microfiber
* Solution was a non-cost consideration (basically it was so minor I didn't even think about it)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/es5qxv/my_most_successful_business_ever_the_jewelry/,1213,"I mean it's a nice story but something is just a little off about the whole thing I can't quite put my finger on it.

All in all the ending was very anti-climatic.

#What Is Gratitude?

When I think of gratitude I think of it as a way of living. It has been proven to benefit many (and some unexpected) areas of our lives - from health to happiness to the way we interact with others. I think because of its origin in Buddhism, I automatically associate it with mindfulness. Gratitude and mindfulness are very similar: focus on the present moment as well as appreciation for what we have now instead of always wanting more.

Feeling and expressing gratitude shifts our focus onto the positive things in life, compensating for our brain's natural inclination to focus on threats and worries.

[Image.](https://andrewkirby.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/31779332_535657853495874_3059657744446390272_n1-1024x1024.jpg)

Because of this, gratitude creates positive emotions like **joy, love, fulfilment** which all undo the grip of negative emotions like **anger, anxiety and sadness**.

#The Proof

The world’s leading expert on gratitude is Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor of psychology at the University of California. Dr Emmons examined the effects of writing gratitude diaries on almost 200 college undergraduates. Students were divided into three groups, and each group wrote 10 weekly diaries focusing on gratitude (blessings), hassles and annoyances, or neutral events. Those in the gratitude group were told:

> *“There are many things in our lives, both large and small, that we might be grateful about. Think back over the past week and write down … up to five things in your life that you are grateful or thankful for.”*

At the end of 10 weeks, those in the gratitude group were feeling more positive about their lives as a whole, more optimistic about the upcoming week and spending more time exercising. Yet the gratitude group did not lead to a more positive mood, as the researchers had anticipated. 

Perhaps focusing on gratitude only once a week was not frequent enough to change mood. Therefore, the researchers conducted a second study which increased the frequency of the diaries to once daily (for two weeks).

Results showed that, as the researchers had predicted, those in the gratitude condition experienced a more positive mood during the two-week period than those in the other groups, and they were also more likely to report doing acts of service, such as helping someone solve a problem or offering emotional support to others.

The researchers then wanted to test the effect of gratitude on long term health. The third study asked 65 adults with neuromuscular disease either to write gratitude diaries for a 21-day period or to just fill in the assessments of mood, well-being, and health without actually having an intervention (control condition). Those in the gratitude condition also had their partners rate their mood and life satisfaction.

Results showed that the gratitude group had more positive views of their life as a whole than control participants. They also reported a more positive mood and less negative mood on a daily basis during the study period. Their partners also reported that the gratitude participants had a more positive mood and greater satisfaction with life. With respect to health, the gratitude condition actually improved participants’ sleep — both amount and quality. Perhaps focusing on life’s blessings reduced the worry and angst that keep people awake at night.

In summary, writing gratitude diaries seems to be beneficial no matter what. Just two or three weeks of filling out gratitude diaries each evening seems to improve mood, optimistic outlook, and life satisfaction, as well as making you more likely to help others. If you want to gain a health benefit from gratitude, you may need to persist with the diaries for two or three months. This practice takes only five or 10 minutes a day, but when done repetitively, reorients your mental compass towards focusing on the positive.

#How To Be More Grateful

When I was researching for this, almost everything I read had a list something like ""12  ways to become grateful"". Just look at this [Google search](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=how+to+be+more+grateufl&oq=how+to+be+more+grateufl&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2515j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). It is now more clear to me than ever that writers don't care whether their readers actually implement the advice given: no one is going to pick one out of twelve and actually execute repetitively.

So I told myself I wouldn't stop looking until I found the best way to become more grateful, and after using this method for a month I think I've found it.

The five minute journal.

Now, you don't have to purchase, you can do it all at home, but you should include all six features of the five-minute journal. The journal that Tim Ferris uses.

This is my whole routine (includes gratitude practice).

**1. Inspiring Quotes**

You can get inspiring quotes for free on [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-motivational-quot/mganbjhcinhhpelabgdgnogoaedcakke?hl=en), your [Facebook timeline](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en), or on your [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daily-quote-quote-of-the-day/id586028606?mt=8).

**2. Be Grateful**

Quality questions create a quality life. That's why I love questions like ""What am I grateful for?"". Write down, every day three things that you're grateful for. Then spend 2 minutes dwelling on these things, you see, you've gotta feel grateful not just logically grateful.

 This is a really important point so I'll elaborate a bit more. All that I've talked about, this whole ""being grateful"" thing is not a logical thing. You can't reason with your mind by saying ""I'm better off that 99% of the world so I'm grateful"" or ""I have a nicer car than my brother so I'm grateful"". You must feel grateful. I know this is weird, especially if you pride yourself on being a ""logical man"". But in this case, you've got to give that up and let yourself feel. So keep looking for things that you're grateful for until you feel it in your core.

**3. What Would Make Today Great?**

Now, I'm kind of going on a tangent away from Gratitude, but the five minute journal is such an incredible part of any morning routine that I'll just say exactly what I do every morning.

Have you ever heard of the Reticular Activating System? 

It's the thing responsible for determining the lens through which you perceive reality.

It's why anorexic people ignore all the evidence that says they're underweight and focus on the evidence that says they're overweight.

When you ask yourself ""What would make today great?"" you are influencing your RAS to point out and engage in activities that will improve your wellbeing; you're building new pathways in your brain that allow you to ""see"" what you can do to improve your happiness every day.

**4. Affirmation**

Uh oh, if I didn't scare you manly man away with the poem I've definitely scared you away now. Hear me out.

Imagine for a moment you want to build more self-confidence.

So, every day, you wake up and write down, “I’m confident and comfortable in my own skin.”

On your way to work, you pass a beautiful stranger. Your eyes meet. They smile, flirtatiously. You return the favor.

As you continue to about your day—and take note of more reference experiences that further your new belief—you comment to yourself, “Ah, this must be happening because I’m confident and comfortable in my own skin.”

This isn’t fantasy; this is how you prime your brain to accept new beliefs.

The Daily Affirmation is for this very purpose: to commit to writing the person you’re committed to becoming.

Do this often enough, and in time, you become the very person you once wrote about.

**5. (Evening) 3 Amazing Things Happened Today

Through rigorous analysis of nearly 12,000 diary entries provided by 238 employees in 7 companies, Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer discovered a remarkable discovery:

*Employees who experienced consistently positive emotions, strong motivation and favorable perceptions of their organization were those who celebrated their small-wins.*

In their own words,

>*""Our research inside companies revealed that the best way to motivate people, day in and day out, is by facilitating progress—even small wins.""*

The best time to celebrate small-wins?

**In the evening before bed.**

A book recommendation from a friend. A beautiful walk in the park. The barista remembering how you like your cappuccino … there are countless small-wins in your life each day.

Are you taking note of them? 

**6. What Could I have done to make today better?**

Every evening, after putting his things in their place and enjoying a meal with friends, Benjamin Franklin would examine his day by asking an important question:

“What good have I done today?”

Similarly, in the Five-Minute Journal, you’re invited to ask yourself, “How could I have made today even better?”

Here’s why:

Let’s imagine, returning to the previous example of building more self-confidence, you wanted to approach the beautiful stranger you passed on your way to work, but couldn’t muster the courage.

Maybe you didn’t know what to say. Or, you did, but your existing habit of shyness prevented you from doing so.

In response to, “How could I have made today even better?”, you might write down, “I could have complimented them,” or, “I could have asked them their name.”

Over time, completing exercises like the above shift how you look at obstacles and help you automatically take the action you actually want to take.

193,e8mtcr,False,,217,I quit 12 years of government work to start a mushroom farm!,Entrepreneur,"Hey team, I thought I would share my story. I always found r/Entrepreneur helpful and loved reading other people stories of success and failure, so thought I would share my story so far.

This all takes place in New Zealand, and none of my products are marketable in the USA. I will use USD if I give any figures to make it easier for people.

**My history**

I worked for the government for 12 years, spread across the Military and Police. I enjoyed what I did, but circumstances arose that my partner and I wanted to move away from Auckland and down to Christchurch. New Zealand is about the size of Colorado, with 4.8 million people, a million people less than colorado. This is just to put the market I service into perspective. The population of Christchurch is 380k.

**Leaving my job to pursue a better life**

Last year we had decided we wanted to move to Christchurch, and I knew it wasn't going to happen if I was in the Police (transfers are almost impossible) so I needed to make my own way. I decided on starting a truffle farm. I had some funds available and was able to potentially purchase a piece of land to get it going, but 6 months later and one faild land transaction I decided the risks of starting a truffle farm were too steep for me and my partner to take on, so I changed from truffle farming to mushroom farming.

**The birth of Oak and Spore**

I started Oak and Spore at the end of last year. My goal for the business was to create a small scale mushroom farm that I could operate on my own. We found a house that had about 120m2 of area I could devote to this endeavour. It has a two car garage, with single car garage at the back, and a concreted area to the side. I got to work building what I would need to grow mushrooms.

**The plan**

My plan has been to create three different parts to the business. These parts were also similar to my goals

1. Fresh mushroom sales (goal to produce 50kg, or 110lb, per week)
2. A website where people can purchase products to grow mushrooms at home -  [https://www.oakandspore.co.nz/](https://www.oakandspore.co.nz/)
3. A youtube channel to document my progress -  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAb4KY7PfwoWV0OzoJ8bWkQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAb4KY7PfwoWV0OzoJ8bWkQ)

**Mushroom sales**

I built the facility which consists of three primary parts. A lab to conduct work with mushroom cultures, an incubation room where inoculated bags of mushroom substrate (food) would sit while the mycelium ate its way through it, and a fruiting chamber which is environmentally controller so I can produce mushrooms all year around.

The process to grow a mushroom to put is briefly is this. Mix ingredients together that we call a substrate, which the mushroom mycelium likes to eat. Sterilize the substrate so there is no competing bacteria, mould, fungi, to consume it. Think of canned food, it's sterilised so no bacteria builds up on the inside. Now after sterilisation you introduce mycelium to the bag, seal it, and put it into incubation. After 3 week to 6 months, depending on the type of mushroom, you can open the bag and place it into a fruiting room and mushrooms will grow.

It's been a hard road but I am comfortably producing around 20-30kg of fresh mushrooms each week. I work one farmers market on the weekends and retail my mushrooms for about $32usd per kg, or $14.5 per pound. I can sell upwards of 20 kg at a good market, and this leaves me mushrooms to spare.

Currently I am working on my certification so I can sell my mushrooms to other business such as restaurants or vegetable stores. I do not need this certification to sell directly to the public, which is why I can sell at farmers markets.

My farmers market sales are good, but I am waiting on my certification so I can expand.

**Website sales**

My website services all New Zealand, and cannot sell to the world. With our biosecurity laws I cannot export mushroom products. Website sales supplement my market sales, with some weeks performing really well, and others not. I have a very limited advertising budget, with $2 per day on google, and $2 per day on FB. I have built my website myself and I am trying to get ranked on the first page of google when you search keywords in New Zealand. I have been monitoring this with by the phrase 'mushroom spawn nz' and over the last few months have gone from page 8 to page 2 of google, so I am nearly there.

I really enjoy the online side of things and do spend a lot of time researching google to better learn how to use their services. My webpage might seem simple, I used Wix to create it, but it serves my needs. I thought about changing to shopify but don't really have the time to start over again.

**My Youtube**

My youtube is one part I really enjoy. The first videos I made were quite average, but recently I started to add my own humor into them as I learnt to use Premier Pro a little better. I was happy with the results of my latest video seen here  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxixK3KuhBw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxixK3KuhBw) Give it a watch and feedback would be great. Why do I youtube? I suppose I like showing people my progress and helping them out. There are a lot of hobby mushroom growers out there and my videos can help with out with some more niche parts of the mushroom growing world.

Am I working to monetize? Yes, after a while I hope to monetize, but i've been doing it for a year and hand just passed the 500 subs and 1000 watch hours mark. You need 1000 subs and 4000 watch hours to monetize, so it's still far off.

One way I have monetized it was joining Amazon associates, which they allow a youtube channel to do when they hit 500 subs. The income from this is negligible, but my goal is that it pays for my Premiere Pro subscription, which it's nearly going to do for this month. So far I made $20 usd from Amazon associates in the last 30 days, and my subscription is maybe $25 a month. Small steps right!

If you enjoy my Youtube please subscribe, I will be adding educational videos as well as videos updating people on my mushroom growing journey.

**Profit and loss**

Here's the part you all love, and I'll give you some insight. The business has only turned a profit the last two months, but I've only been selling fresh mushrooms the last two months.

Total the business cost me maybe 31k usd to setup, this includes all running costs for the first year, a VW Caddy van, a trailer, and some other assets.

my operating expenses for this year have been 13,464k, and I have purchased about 17,872k in assets.

The operating costs were a lot of small purchases that are often a 1 off. As the months go on the business costs will decrease and plateau.

I channel 43% of all household expenses like power, water, property taxes to the business.

The last couple months I have finally started to get some profit, and this month should hopefully wind up with a couple thousand in the green.

I do not pay myself a wage, and I do not account for this, so if I was paying myself a wage the business would be making zero. I can afford not to pay myself because my lovely partner works and I can focus on the business.

All profit gets channeled back into the business for expansion.

**December profit loss as of 10th december. Still only 1/3 the way through the month, so expect totals to be near 2x times higher**

Total operating expenses  - $178 usd (no labour or costs for my time added)

Gross income                       - $1507 usd

Invoices owed to me          -  $506 usd

**By the end of the month I would forcast - I will update this at the end of the month.**

Total operating expenses  - $500 usd (no labour or costs for my time added)

Gross income                       - $2500 usd

Invoices owed to me          -  $1000 usd

I think I will end december with maybe $500 in base running costs, as I still have to add power, water, internet charges etc. I am spending another 300-400 usd on making a new air conditioning system for my fruiting room. But this is money reinvested to improve my setup.

**Future plans**

When the new Year comes I plan on getting a reefer container which will double my output, this will be used as another atmosphere controlled fruiting room. My goals with this is to set it up as a modular build, so I can just add new containers as I need to expand. I am also looking at a new type of mushroom which isn't produced to any great quality in NZ. in the long term I would like to step in and become the primary producer of this. I am sourcing new equipment from China for this endeavour.

There is a direct relation with mushroom production to profit. My mid term (5 year) goal is 1 tonne, 2200lb, per week. I need to grow the business to get there, and it's a slow process. What I have done so far has sort of been a proof of concept or a pilot. I know I can make it work now so am looking to keep expanding next year.

I hope next year I can turn 30k usd profit (without paying myself) and hope to increase this year on year.

In my spare time I will continue to work on my Youtube and hopefully increase my viewership.

**final thoughts**

It's been a very hard road so far, and anyone who has created a business in an area that they knew absolutely nothing in can attest how challenging it can be. But it's been rewarding and I am very proud of what I have done on my own.

I always try to respond to people who want to talk to me about my business, so if you have any questions fire away!

Excuse bad grammar or spelling, it was never my strong point.

972,72s4wq,False,Other,172,"Want to be an entrepreneur? Be prepared to give up everything. Or don't jump in. Long winded, heartfelt, rant with a little wisdom woven in.",Entrepreneur,"The journey of becoming an entrepreneur is not for the faint of heart. It's a journey of ambition, desire, and passion that will force you to question your purpose, your will, and it will push the limits of your sanity. My journey is not over yet, however I am 7 years in... and I started off with a nice 6 figure job, plenty of money in the bank, 3 houses, a couple of cars, a motorcycle and a great social life and lots of friends. Regardless of how smart I thought I was, and my grossly miscalculated unrealistic timeframes, nothing turned out how I thought it would. The houses gone, the cars gone, the bank account is gone, and for a while a couple years back... my electricity was gone too. And, I thrived in it. I would wake up at the crack of dawn every morning and go to a coffee shop until they kicked me out, I would buy a few bulk candles and go home and work until my laptop battery died. Then I would get up, rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong, there were successes along the way too. However, dealing with your successes isn't the hard part.  

If you plan on taking the plunge to be an entrepreneur. Don't start with the expectation of ""funding"" or taking investment. Start with having enough persistence and tenacity. notice I didn't say intelligence. This is not a game of wit, it's a game of being driven, and crazy enough to keep going when everyone else says stop. It'll make you question your sanity, and if you're like many entrepreneurs, you'll need to fight fear, doubt, and depression along the way. It's not all doom and gloom, but there are same ground rules I highly suggest... I've had to many people I know lose everything they have to gain nothing, and some even felt the need to take their own lives. My heart still sinks and my tear wells still fill up, anytime I think about my friends who are no longer here. I've lost to many people who have tried taking this journey. Ok, so let's get to a few ground rules.

**1. It's ok to fail.** You're supposed to fail. Do it fast... learn from it, don't dwell on it. Dust yourself off and do it again. You only need one success to out weigh all of your failures. 

**2. It's going to be harder than you think,** and take longer than you hoped for... don't give up.

**3. Don't take advice from the last person that gave it to you.** Along your journey you will find many people who are willing to help. Pay attention to what their specialty is. They will give you advice on everything, however take everything with a grain of salt... take technology advice from technologists, take story advice from marketers... and know that the marketers will give you technology advice and the technologists will give you marketing advice. Listen politely, but weigh it accordingly. 

**4. Some people are time wasters, and/or assholes.** Cut the strings as quickly as possible. I don't understand the psychology... however there are some people out there that get off wasting your time, and money, and lie for some ungodly reason. If they're promising you something, get to it as quickly as possible. 

**5. Believe in yourself, even when no one else does.** People will tell you you're wrong, you're crazy, and your ideas will never work. If those people are sitting in a cubical, or behind a desk, and they work for someone for a living. They're probably not a visionary, and they'll give you the dos and don'ts they were taught. I had an opportunity to hear Mark Cuban speak yesterday. He tells a story of how everyone told him he was wrong and it would never work... only a couple years before he cashed out for billions.  

**6. Cash is king.** This has been my hardest lesson learned. Get to revenue as quickly as possible. If you're not solving a real problem, people won't pay you. If you are solving a problem, they will. It's that simple. I found myself multiple times on my journey being a technology in search of a problem. 7 years later and I'm not a billionaire yet... I hope I'm getting close. Figure out who is going to pay you and why. 

**7. Have fun. Make friends.** This is so important. I lost a majority of my ""normal"" friends. People I work wth are friends as long as I pay them. However, there are angels I've met along they way. Not angels like ""tenure angels"" but angles like people who are there for me when I need them most, and make sure you're there in the same capacity. This journey is lonely... and I've met some of the most amazing friends, mentors, and good hearted people on this journey Barbary, Johnny, Dean, Ryan, Brian, and a hand full of others. Be a good friend, give first, and don't expect anything in return. 

**You don't get what you don't ask for.** Ask! What's it going to hurt. If the word No hurts you... get over it, or don't take this journey. If you want something ask for it. Even if it seems like an impossibility. On occasion, you'll be surprised.

251,5n64fo,False,,191,"$80,000 profit in December with an 8-page website (Case study)",Entrepreneur,"I recently got the chance to email Luqman Khan and share more of his story on how his 8 page website - an Amazon affiliate site - **generated more than $80,000 in December alone** thanks to free Google traffic.

The concept of his success comes from an article I wrote at the end of 2015 where I suggested to my readers they started trying to rank for things in Google with 2016 in the headline.

I even did this myself, ranking for a popular 'X 2016' term which sent me tens of thousands of visitors from Google.

Luqman's entire strategy was based on ranking for 'best [product] 2016' throughout the year.

On just his fourth month after launching the site, Luqman had made $4,500 in commissions (after sending $100,000 in sales to Amazon).

5 months later, he would see himself profiting more than $40,000 in November and $80,000 in December. The December spike can mostly be accounted for with an increase in online shopping.

The entire article is more than 5,000 words but I don't want to just 'link out' so here is the strategy in a nutshell.

* Find products that people will be searching for in 2017 that are the best in different categories

* Create a review page highlighting the products which you think are the best and link to them with an Amazon affiliate link

* Make sure the review page is optimised for '2017-related' terms

* Try to build links to the site from web 2.0 sites, directories and other resources (it's hard to build links to these types of sites naturally)

* If you have an existing site, try to 'piggyback' off the authority where possible.

* If you're building a new site, don't stress about the domain and branding. Just get started and get something up (results are going to be what makes you take this more seriously)

* Keep building links / adding more content in your spare time. Improve the quality of the content to make it a great resource

I have made it a little bit simplistic here but that is the gist of things. 

The reason I like sharing this kind of case study is because you don't need a huge budget or incredible tech skills to get started. 

The opportunity and potential is there, you just need to put the time in.

994,bdpo1q,False,,109,"Successful entrepreneurs and people who've managed to form a routine that helps you achieve your goals, what do you do when you notice yourself being lazy, how do you get back on track?",Entrepreneur,"So Ive got the makings of a good routine, I can plan my time well and my anxiety has dropped loads because I plan for things now, I can actually get work done without that nagging feeling that I've forgot something.

That being said there will be days where I miss a few things from my routine, skip a gym day here, dont adhere to my diet, put off work until the next day. What usually happens from this is it can snowball into a couple days of not doing anything.

If this happens on a Monday it feels like Ive wasted the whole week as I started off on a bad foot and if I'm not diligent that feeling will persist the whole week and makes it harder for me to get stuff done as it's messed with my routine (I know this is false it's just my mindset and I'm working on it).

The way I'm approaching it now is that if it happens I must forgive myself for being lazy and go from where I am. If Monday was a bust Tuesday is ""reset day"".

On reset day I clean the house, plan my meals out for two weeks, go over my gym plan, work on what's absolutely critical for my business then plan to follow my routine normally from the next day on.

Rather then feel like Monday was a bust and let it ruin my whole week, I take control on Tuesday and put the train back on the track so to speak.

I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this kind of laziness and how they combat it.

I hope it's OK I'm linking the app I created to solve my own problem, https://apps.shopify.com/scout-cart-recovery - it's a completely free app that I hope will make this process easier for you. And here is a post I wrote which is just the actual phone call script I use if anyone else is interested to try it https://www.connectwithscout.com/thank-customers-call-script/*)

*I originally wrote this post on the Shopify subreddit but came across this bigger thread and wanted to share here too. It was my first post ever to Reddit! And now I'm addicted.*

I am an ecommerce entrepreneur selling on Shopify, and I was having a problem with abandoned checkouts. For every sale I was making, there was an abandoned checkout (someone who filled in their personal details but didn't complete purchase). The Abandoned checkouts were totalling about $3,500 per month at one point. And my auto-emails were only recovery about 10% of them. So I felt bad, because I felt I was leaving over $3,000 on the table. I sell a niche product so I knew they were all HOT leads. Luckily some folks were leaving their phone number so I just decided to call them and ask why they didn't complete their purchase. At first I assumed it was because maybe the price was too high, or shipping cost was unexpected, but even after sending a discount code in the email, it wouldn't really help.

**Long story short** - calling my abandoned customers just to get feedback was crucial because I learned that there isn't just 1 or 2 reasons why people abandon. There were literally dozens and dozens. It sounds like common sense to me now, but you can't really learn what your customer expects or thinking until you talk to them.

**Fast forward, my recovery rate went to 55%!!!** Talking to abandoned cart customers was a huge help to my business, not just because talking to the founder put my customers at east and earned trust, but because then i learned what their challenges with my offering was and I changed the copy and design on my website to make it clearer.

**This then gave me the idea to call ALL of my customers**
If it had a 55% recovery rate, I wondered how it would affect repurchase rates. I only do about avg 5-6 sales per day (avg price of $90), so it's been easy to call everyone the next day. I just call and say ""thank you"" - no strings attached. I show them how much I appreciate their business and their trust in my business. On the call I also ask them if they need anything else from me, if they have any questions. Sometimes I even track their orders and call the day the tracker tells me it's been delivered, so i call to say ""I see the package has delivered, how do you like it? Did it arrive OK?""

This REALLY helped me build trust. So many customers even thanked me for my time in calling them (I think because I would say I'm the founder, they would think I'm some big shot and that really made them feel appreciated). My repurchase rates visibly went up, and so did the word-of-mouth buyers. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this with the group. Customer relationships I feel get overlooked. Myself included, I feel many of us get caught up in the email marketing, and FB retargeting, and other marketing automation tools, but we lose sight on the real face to face. Especially for small businesses whose brands are unknown, we need to go above and beyond and make a name for ourselves. Other bigger successful brands have just that...trusted brands. It allows customers to open their wallets more easier (or without even thinking) because they know they can trust their problem will be solved, or their passion will be served.

**ALSO, Saying ""thank you"" has mental and health benefits**
I read that showing gratitude at least once a day keeps away toxic emotions like greed, jealously, and anxiety.

Curious, what are some other ways some of us here are building bulletproof customer relationships?

509,diqpom,False,Case Study,132,"After trouble sleeping we created sleep headphones and sold 1,000,000 pairs",Entrepreneur,"Being a family doctor, I needed a way to get back to sleep after taking patient calls in the middle of the night. My husband, computer programmer Jason Wolfe, suggested listening to soothing music to fall back asleep, but headphones were bulky and earbuds were extremely uncomfortable. Since there were no headphones specifically designed for sleeping on the market, we invented our own.

We came up with the idea of putting soft speakers inside of a headband. I wore it that night, was able to fall asleep faster, and was amazed to find that it had stayed on all night. The idea actually worked! As a doctor, I saw so many patients taking sleeping pills, so I thought that maybe we should make some more to see if it could work for other people too.

We set up a website, and even before we were done putting it together, someone stumbled upon it and emailed me. I asked him how he even found the page - there was no shopping cart, and we didn’t even advertise it. He said that it was because the name just seemed to fit. He typed in SleepPhones.com on a whim! That was all the validation we needed for our product name. When we made him one, he loved it. Then the orders started coming in from all corners of the world. Since we were hand-making each one individually, we were busy just fulfilling orders along with working in our day jobs.

I sewed and my husband soldered the first 500 sets at our kitchen table. Now, we are winning multiple regional and national awards, and my husband and I are committed to ensuring people all over the world live and sleep better.

One guy in Kentucky told us that he was skeptical when his wife ordered SleepPhones because he was snoring. Well, after a week, she started to sleep so well that she started snoring. So then he had to order SleepPhones® for himself!

**How did you fund the idea initially?**

We started the business very organically. We went to Jo-Ann Fabrics to buy their on-sale fleece. We ordered speakers from Mouser.com. My husband bought a sewing machine for me for my birthday, and I bought him a soldering iron for his birthday. Getting off the ground was really inexpensive. The first major investment was filing for a patent. We used our savings to pay for that. We’ve been profitable since the beginning because we just bought what we needed.

**‍What motivated you to start your own business?**

We had no previous business background. I was a doctor, and my husband was a game developer. We were motivated to start the business because there were no similar products on the market. As a family doctor, I was able to assist \~20 patients a day. With SleepPhones®, that reach has grown exponentially. We are motivated by helping people all over the world achieve quality, restorative sleep.

Our family and friends thought it was a cute idea in the beginning. We didn’t say much about it for a few years while we were growing it at the beginning. When it was obvious that it could be a commercial success, everyone was very supportive. We didn’t quit our day jobs until we were sure we could live on the business earnings.**‍**

**Do you have any advice for someone just starting out?‍**

One of the things we’ve learned is to follow our gut rather than fully trusting “experts.” There are many people who speak very confidently and want to sell you their services. If they didn’t really listen to you when you were telling them your needs, they probably can’t really help you.

Over time, our success has attracted people who want to either ride our coat tails or push us down. Our knockoffs are a problem, but we can also choose to view it as flattery. Ultimately what motivates us is simply that we are really helping many people throughout the world get better sleep.**‍**

**How do you protect yourself from competition?**

The best defense is a strong offense in our case. The more SleepPhones® we sell, the more we are able to insulate ourselves from knockoffs. As the originals and the best, we need to continue to innovate, releasing new and more advanced products over time. While patents and other IP are helpful, and we have several, it doesn’t benefit the world to spend an inordinate amount of time and money paying lawyers. It’s more important to win on the business side of things and sell products to the people who want and need them. So having the best products and the best business strategy is our offensive strategy.

**What are the top 3-5 apps your business could not run without?**

As a mother of two, I cannot always be in the office. With our internal messaging system, all internal communications are archived and I can review conversations between employees and contribute when need be. Shopify lets us sell securely to people all over the world. G Suite allows us to collaborate and share files seamlessly in real time.

**Are there any releases you can tell us about?**

We are transitioning from being a purely hardware company to incorporating software. My husband, a former video game developer, has created an artificial intelligence system that will help the world figure out what types of music helps people sleep the best. The project is in Beta testing now, and it is available for download in the Apple and Android App stores.

164,eq4ght,False,,63,"Here's the EXACT 8 step process behind a Facebook ad campaign that grew a marketing subscription (SaaS) business from almost zero to $160,000/month+ in revenue",Entrepreneur,"Facebook ads are hard. But there's a process behind creating successful campaigns.

In this post, I’m going to outline the **8 step process** that we used to take a marketing subscription/SaaS from about 100 paying monthly users, **to more than 3000 paying monthly users using paid acquisition on Facebook.**

*Short backstory: The product was a monthly Instagram growth service. (Examples: graminator, simplygram); The same advertising dynamics will work for any subscription services/SaaS with a lower price point.*

***In the end, the campaign generated more than $1,100,000.00 in lifetime revenue from only $92,707 in ad spend:*** [*https://imgur.com/a/InMj9dM*](https://imgur.com/a/InMj9dM)

*For the 6-7 months that this campaign lasted for, we were generating about 500 new subscriptions (paying users) a month.*

*The customer lifetime value for the product was around $350 ($25 for the first month +$50/100 month after that) and the cost per new user acquisition was under $30.*

*Before the campaign, although the client had a product/service that the market wanted, the exposure that he was getting organically was too slow and limited for any significant growth so he reached out* *to us* *(* [https://infoscaling.com/](https://infoscaling.com/) ) *for help.*

*After a few weeks of adjusting the funnel and testing new campaigns, we built a campaign that was able to acquire new customers at $25.08 per sale. (Which meant break-even in the first month and profit after that)*

**Here's the process that you can use to replicate this:**

# 1) Clearly define the main target avatar and best segments of the market

One of the most important steps that define chances of success in paid advertising is defining who you’re speaking to (and who you’re going to target) in your creatives.

From analyzing our clients  current user base, we found that the top-paying (they stayed the longest) customers were fashion and beauty influencers (and wannabe influencers) and **adjusted the copy&creatives to speak to them.** We also adjusted the targeting accordingly (you’ll see it in #7).

Targeting the audience (both with actual ad targeting and adjusting the creative) that is most likely to pay the most has an effect on LTV and subsequently ROAS (return on ad spend).

# 2) Find the best converting offer/free trial model (crucial)

Although this business was founded back in 2015, it took almost 3 years to get it to actually produce any substantial revenue. One of the major reasons why it took that long was having an offer that the market didn’t respond to. The initial offer (free trial)  was 25 free followers. ( [https://imgur.com/a/GxiL6fF](https://imgur.com/a/GxiL6fF) )

The conversion rate (from visitor to claim offer) was high - but the conversion to paying customers from that offer was terrible.

We first needed to find an offer that was actually converting to paid users at a high enough rate.

We got the client to switch the offer to a 2-day Free Trial .  [https://imgur.com/a/QCVSmQ1](https://imgur.com/a/QCVSmQ1)

However, using an Instagram growth service for just 2 days was too little time for the vast majority of users to see any growth of their accounts so they didn’t see any value in keeping the service.

Next, we tried with a 50% OFF for the first month - with a promise to get 250 targeted followers and reach 15,000 Instagram accounts. The visitor to conversion rate was much lower than in the first 2 cases, but people who bought kept paying. This was exactly what we needed.  [https://imgur.com/Znx2q9a](https://imgur.com/Znx2q9a?fbclid=IwAR27IJseBaxAaeHLxbiHPwJCEvyoh3KVIat0yXK1DdMMOGagM-1ELUXgjdY)

# 3) Invest in ad creatives production

3 years ago, you could use stock photos on Facebook and your ads would still work. This is no longer the case. You have to invest time and money in quality creatives (especially video) if you want your ads to work.

Here are the main types of ads that we test when we start working on a new project:

a) **Animated videos** — they’re expensive but work really well for a lot of products (eg. SaaS). We tested a few of those but the results were not satisfying in this case.

b) **Videos recorded by a client or his audience**  \- testimonials/presenting the product. These are easy and fast to create and work really well in a lot of industries.

c) **Image ads** \- there’s an unlimited number of variations that you can try here (the more your budget allows you, the better. Split-testing is key)

We instructed the client to get 20 different testimonial videos from his customers and created 15 animated videos for testing.

The top-performing ad was a simple testimonial video recorded in a car. The testimonial was from a fashion influencer with a big following (implying that they can too get a big following)  so it perfectly hit the target avatar, built trust and presented the offer.  **(You can see the video  (and the other ones) in 5).**

# 4) Analyze data & adjust accordingly

After the first 30 days of the campaign, the campaign generated first 400 users and grew the MRR from $5,000 to $25,000. [https://imgur.com/a/zYmh79s](https://imgur.com/a/zYmh79s)

We found that Instagram Ads generated 95% of total sales in the first month. Although the CPA was slightly higher than on Facebook, we couldn't have enough traffic volume on Facebook in order to scale like we wanted to.

[https://imgur.com/a/zYmh79s](https://imgur.com/a/zYmh79s)

Also, most of the buyers were women between 25–45 years old ( that also influenced our decision on what testimonials to use in ads).

**You need to constantly be monitoring the data and adjust your campaigns accordingly & make decisions based on the data.**

# 5) Optimize ad creatives

After testing the initial creatives and finding the best ones, **you need to optimize those further** (with the goal of reducing the CPA).

The hypothesis was, if we took the best performing video ad and add subtitles and the right text on the top of the video (classic Gary V style) — we’ll increase our CTRs, decrease CPCs, and ultimately reduce our CPA which started going up a bit.

We came up with 10 different headlines for the video and tested them all. Few of them worked really well.

We continued **testing different variations throughout the campaign**, both to decrease the CPA and have fresh creatives to counter banner blindness.  [https://imgur.com/a/vrAkcyt](https://imgur.com/a/vrAkcyt)

Here's a lot of different video variations that we used:  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=13xv8WWTkUjiksYCuk28CB3cnRMW04SeQ](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fopen%3Fid%3D13xv8WWTkUjiksYCuk28CB3cnRMW04SeQ&h=AT134kkV8DATK24X25KQbKItwvHINHhKEqYK-RYabDHB6RanxbRtPDWhTfWL2NTKGtr7jgluGqyqFk0pd5E5e-4nLrXF1f31Rw7_mFv3y-P0QxMRilxOh0iWcyP07vA7jWQ)

# 6) Utilize conversion events, custom conversions, and the pixel.

Setting up the Facebook pixel properly on the campaign start is **crucial** to every campaign’s success.

The funnel looked like this:

Ad -> Sales Page -> Checkout Page 1 -> Thank You Page 1

Ad -> Sales page -> Checkout Page 2 -> Thank You Page 2

In order to be able to segment the audiences for retargeting and to track the success of the ads, we set up the basic FB pixel (page view) on all pages, and set up the purchase pixel on the thank you page to track purchases.

All the campaigns on the account were optimized by using conversion events and custom conversions. **Generally, the event you want to optimize for is the event you want (eg. Purchase/Lead/Click).**

The more data your pixel gathers, the better it can optimize in the future, which helps with long term campaign success.

# 7) Scale with lookalike audiences

From a technical perspective, scaling your winning campaigns mostly depends on finding new audiences you can show your ads to.

When we start working on a new account, the first step that we take is creating custom audiences of people depending on what stage of the funnel they’re in (or visited; tracked by FB pixel).

The more custom audiences you create — the more **relevant you can be to different audience segments within a funnel**(by showing different types of content/offers depending on what stage in the funnel they’re in).

From custom audiences, then, we create lookalike audiences. **The best lookalike audience you can have is buyers (purchases) lookalike.**

Here are some of the lookalikes we’ve used in this campaign.

a) Purchases (7 days) -> Lookalike 1%, Lookalike 2%, Lookalike 5%, Lookalike 10%

b) Purchases (30 Days) -> Lookalike 1%, Lookalike 2%, Lookalike 5%, Lookalike 10%

c) Purchases (90 Days) -> Lookalike 1%, Lookalike 2%, Lookalike 5%, Lookalike 10%

d) Purchases (180 Days) -> Lookalike 1%, Lookalike 2%, Lookalike 5%, Lookalike 10%

As you can see, just by having ONE custom audience broken down into smaller audiences based on a specific time frame (7–180 days) — you’re able to create 20–30 different lookalike audiences for the scaling stage.

Also, since we knew from the data that the best-paying customers were fashion influencers, we extracted the emails from those buyers, created a custom and then lookalike audiences from that. **This was one of the best performing cold audiences.**

Later on, when you have a few thousands of actions (ideally purchases) recorded on your pixel — you can throw out the targeting and let the FB pixel to do the heavy lifting for you. **This works best when you’re scaling worldwide and have a potential market of 10–20MM customers.**

# 8) Leverage warm & hot retargeting audiences (CPA Reduction)

Retargeting people and moving them from one step of the funnel is crucial to any campaign's success.

In retargeting campaigns, we were getting better CPA on Facebook than Instagram (because we could retarget them on the desktop for very little $) and our retargeting ads were super relevant.

When we started scaling the overall CPA on cold traffic went up to $30-$35 per sale, **so having a good approach in the RTG campaigns became necessary.** (It **always helps** to do this right and we focus on retargeting a lot in all of our clients' campaigns.)

The results for retargeting were 575 sales total at $17.51. **This significantly impacted the overall CPA and kept it where it needed to be.**  [https://imgur.com/5GWKunr](https://imgur.com/5GWKunr)

We found that 2 out of 10 custom audiences we were using were most profitable & brought in the most sales so we focused on those. (Instagram page engagers (30 Days) and checkout abandoners (Last 7 Days & Last 15 Days))  [https://imgur.com/a/wV2Ttza](https://imgur.com/a/wV2Ttza)

# 9) Stay Compliant With FB TOS

And the bonus lesson from this campaign is… you should never build a business in a way that it’s totally dependent on other platforms. Although, having an extra $1,000,000 is not too bad IMO :)

The business was destined to be shut down sooner or later. I knew that one day Facebook / Instagram will crackdown on Instagram growth services - which happened in the end and the business was prohibited from advertising. The client also started experiencing problems with service delivery due to crackdown on bots.

We work with a lot of clients and being compliant with TOS is absolutely necessary - Facebook's really sensitive and you don't want to lose the ability to advertise. (Although FB advertisers will know that you're never really safe)

761,fmqdmk,False,Lessons Learned,43,Survivorship bias : What a Mathematician During World War II Taught Us About Our Mental Biases,Entrepreneur,"During World War II, researchers from the Center for Naval Analyses conducted a study on the damage done to returned aircraft after missions. They then recommended adding armor to the areas that showed the most damage to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire. 

However, Abraham Wald suggested differently.

Wald was a Hungarian mathematician and a member of the Statistical Research Group (SRG), where he applied his statistical skills to various wartime problems.

He noted that the study was only conducted on the aircraft that had survived their missions. It didn’t paint a complete picture when the bombers that had been shot down were not presented for the damage assessment.


 
With that, the holes in the returning aircraft were areas that need no extra armor — since the bombers could take damage and still return safely. On the other hand, the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed are those areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to crash and be lost.

Wald then proposed that the Navy reinforce areas by adding more armor to them — which was a perfect demonstration of how to not fall prey into the survivorship bias.

What is Survivorship Bias?

Survivorship Bias is a logical error that leads to false conclusions by concentrating on the people or things that made it past a particular selection process. And when we do this, we tend to overlook those that got ignored, typically because of their lack of visibility.

It happens a lot in our day-to-day lives and negatively impacts our decision-making. A great example is copying what successful people have done and receiving advice from the so-called gurus and experts:

Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college and became wildly successful. But for most college dropouts, it means unemployment and having more immediate student debt.

Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar are getting paid highly as football players. But the truth is, most players never make it into a game in their lifetime.

 
Motivational gurus talk about following your passion and trusting your gut feelings — but there is no shortage of people who followed their passion and ended up seriously wrong.

When we’re listening to the success stories in any field, we get inspired by the companies, portfolios, and people who made it to the top. What we don’t hear and see are those who tried and failed because generally, people don’t talk about them.

How to Avoid Falling Prey into Survivorship Bias?

Understand the survivorship bias itself helps to prevent it from happening in the first place. When you get clear with what it is, it becomes easier for you to see it again and again everywhere.

The next step is to seek the other part of the story that is missing.

Take “following your passion” as a piece of success advice. We first look at successful people who have followed their passions — and indeed, they accomplished what they desired at the end of the day. However, you need to ask ONE other question:

Did people fail because of not following their passions?

If the answer is yes, then we can come to the conclusion that “following your passion” is the key characteristic to accomplish success.

However, the truth is that there are a lot of people who followed their passions and yet failed. This simple question forces us to look at both positive and negative evidence — and only make our assumption certain when there is no way to prove otherwise.

Seeing the Full Picture

Being aware of survivorship bias and knowing how to avoid falling into it comes with massive upsides. On the surface, it helps you see through the incomplete information others provide intentionally.

But ultimately, it saves you from wasted resources like time and money by helping you to reach a good, well-informed decision. If making better decisions is important to you, you can check out more about it in my articles on mental models and cognitive errors.

405,7fp9a1,False,Lessons Learned,119,Drove a business to the ground because of fast growth and several mistakes. What I've learned from this experience,Entrepreneur,"Hello Entrepreneurs (and wantrepreneurs),

I've noticed a lack of business failures shared on the subreddit, so decided to tell you a story about how I drove my business to the ground less than 12 months ago, ending up with 300k worth of products and everyone surrounding the business fucked over. Primary reason for this - we were expanding too quickly and I know some of you might think - how is that possible? Well let me give you a full overview of what happened and what I've learned from this experience.

First of all I wanted to mention that I'm mostly used to running online business ventures, so this was a new experience for me and I might have done some things incorrectly due to that reason. It wasn't a failure just because of fast growth, but I see it as primary reason, because retailers continued pushing me and I had to make a really quick decision, which ended up fucking up my whole business. Anyway, let's get into the story.

What we started with was a toy / learning instrument within baby niche. It came to me as an idea while researching several smaller niches within infant / baby industry. Since it's highly competitive space, I loved going into it and researching current solutions for a certain problem, which is exactly what I did with this one. Found several products that were selling really well locally within a certain smaller niche, but a lot of people complained about them either online or from my personal experience, so I knew there should be something better. When I did my research, found out that the product I first looked at was the best selling one. I started talking with few employees from a different venture I ran, that had a one-year-old baby and used the product, then dove deep into the web searching for all the feedback I could gather. Primarily the product had 3 huge issues a lot of people were complaining about and I came up with a way to fix every one of them with minor changes to how the product works, which seemed like a great opportunity, because it became far superior to the best selling product out there. 

So my next step was to find a manufacturer and get some orders shipped, check the quality of them before starting mass production. Tested several manufacturers, got the whole process down and I did a test marketing campaign out of 15 boxes sent to my house (for quality assurance) - in total 90 products (6 per box). Sold almost half of those between family members and friends, the rest (roughly 50) went like crazy online and I received much more traction than I wanted to. The ad became very popular between several ""mommy groups"" on facebook and pinterest, had nearly 1000 people sign up to the website for emails before I had a product to ship to them. In total I invested $50 to get the first push on facebook and it went ""viral"" from there, where the post was liked over 10k times organically. 

Anyway, next step was mass manufacturing. To fill the need of so many people interested in the product, I paid for several molds right away and went with first big order of 1000 boxes, 6 products in each one, in total 6000. They came out really good and by the time it was manufactured and shipped to my warehouse, the pre-sale email list grew to nearly 2000, out of which I converted 1682 right away. Average order quanitity was 2.2, so I sold more than half of that within the first few days they arrived, which pushed me into ordering more. The sales were doing really well online with facebook advertising, with pinterest organic growth and through outreach to mommy blogs, where I was paying $200-1k per post (depending on traffic levels of their website and engagement rates). 

Within the first 4 months I sold out every single time I made a new order. This grabbed attention of several foreign and local retailers. Eventhough I don't have much experience with retail sales, I accepted to take their order for $5k worth of products (to test in several stores), it shipped, sold within less than a month so they came back and ordered $90k worth of product. This I was barely able to do and had to slow down online sales to fulfill it, because I didn't have the right manufacturer to support both huge retail sales and direct to consumer at the same exact time. Plus I noticed that online sales were slowing down, so decided to go with a retail order instead. This made me have ""sold out"" sign right at the top of my website for 28 out of 40 upcoming days.

This is where it goes south - fast forward few months, where I was mostly doing retail sales at this point, primarily orders of several hundred thousand reordered every few months and whenever I had some spare ones to sell - they went straight into my online sales channels, but at this point I'd say 75%-80% was sold between several retailers. Since the primary reason I wasn't able to grow any further was because of my manufacturer's moderately low capacity, I decided to look for different ones who could fulfill larger orders. I tested several of them, the quality seemed fine on one of them, where they could do roughly 15 times larger quantities than my previous manufacturer, so I got the molds from old one, made new copies and started manufacturing with the new one working with me. 

The very first big orders fulfilled by new manufacturers ($225k and $87.5k) were returned because of their lower quality, so I flew to check the quality of these orders - it was terrible. In comparison to what was sent to me previously by the same manufacturers, I couldn't even see a single bit of my product that was the same as I received them. Anyway, at this point I had over 300k worth of completely screwed up products and came back to the same manufacturer that delivered lower quantities, started making more and dealing with those retailers that returned my products. At this point they didn't want anything to do with me, even when I agreed to provide high quality assurance from that point forward. Mostly it was because I wouldn't be able to fulfill their huge orders due to limited capacity of my old manfucaturer.

I still continued looking for better manufacturers that could deliver big quantities and didn't find a single one of high enough quality and was left with more than 300k of worthless products, pissed retailers and no more online traction. Tried selling online again with the same small manufacturer, but I was barely able to have a positive RoI, because while I was dealing with all of this, the previously mentioned high selling products fixed the same exact issues and took back the industry.

There were quite a few mistakes I did, but I continue to learn from everything I do. I'd say most of the wrong decisions were made, because I was literally pushed by them, saying 'we need an answer from you within the next few days'. In the end I was still in the green (barely), but out of any business I ran prior to this or after this, it has lead to most mistakes, which means most things to learn from. I shouldn't have gone retail (or slowed down with it, primarly selling online, because that's where I have the most experience), I shouldn't have fucked over my first manufacturer the first chance I had in order to increase sales and I should have taken a better look at new manufacturers before purchasing large quantities of those products. 

Since I saw it as a really great industry, right now I'm still working in the same niche, just a different product that is superior to what I sold back then. That said, 95% of my sales are done online (Amazon and my own website with fulfillment by Amazon). Since then we have rebranded and sell under a different name, because we built up a reputation for all online channels being sold out constantly (which a lot of moms were talking about on forums and similar websites). We didn't want to be associated with that, so decided to rebrand. It's also not the same exact product, but fulfills a very similar need.

***********************************************************

**TL;DR -** Started successfully selling a product online, built up traction and interest from several retailers, fulfilled a lot of orders, but I had to switch to bigger manufacturer, which fucked up the qaulity of my product. Over 300k worth of products were returned and by the time I was able to fix the issues, a previous competitor took back the industry. Learned to chill out, play it where I'm more comfortable making sales and not to screw over good manufacturers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/7fp9a1/drove_a_business_to_the_ground_because_of_fast/,658,"Sorry to hear about this.

It seems like another Facebook marketing guru I haven't heard of pops up every week, with another piece of garbage on learning how to market something on Facebook. So here's the simple truth: They are not teaching you anything revolutionary. Everything you could possibly need is available, for free, from Facebook themselves through this thing called Facebook Blueprint. 

https://www.facebook.com/blueprint/courses/path/all-content

Every possible thing you would need, from beginner to experienced Facebook ads user, is here. There is even an official certification (paid) that gets you certified **by Facebook** once you go through the course and complete an exam. Want to learn how to structure campaigns for a small business? There's a [course](https://www.facebook.com/blueprint/courses/category/small-and-medium-businesses) for that. Are you an experienced ads user and want to learn about the Power Editor? There's a course for that (http://facebook.exceedlms.com/student/home/show_enrollment/42769427). There's a course for almost every single thing within Facebook, for free. 

EDIT: ""But catch3!!! I'm a fish farmer and I like how the super special online guru holds my hand through the whole *spiritual* process of setting up my campaign with a **sales funnel** to target other fisheries in my area! The courses on Facebook Blueprint don't have ANYTHING related to my niche! And we have an exclusive forum where we can sing songs and hold hands together!"" - Ok, then use an online guru, just make sure that you're getting what you paid for. 

I know this comes off as ranty, but I'm sick of these gurus taking advantage of people who don't know that most, if not all of the information they are looking for is out there, for free.

Actually, a majority of House painting companies are 1 or 2 people painting houses...doing everything...

**Estimating**

**Keeping track of numbers**

**Following up**

**The actual painting**

**Doing touchups**

**Answering the phone...**

**Etc etc...**

So, is there anything wrong with this? Of course not. Nothing wrong with people going out there and making a living. Actually, some of the BEST painters I’ve seen come from this 1 and 2 man operation.

Here’s the problem…

**They’re afraid to delegate.** They are so used to being hands on that they can’t see themselves taking on a CEO type role.

What’s that do?

**It limits their capabilities.**

What I did differently:

**I’ve never been a professional painter,** actually, the only painting I ever did was one summer with my Dad. That’s the only exposure I’ve had.

But, due to a passion to help my dad get back on his feet, and my fire for entrepreneurship…I ventured in just two years ago.

**I quit my bank job and took the leap.**

I rapidly gained exposure by using paid lead resources, like HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, and Thumbtack. The more jobs I booked, the more confident I was to bring on another person.

and another...

and another...

Eventually I began delegating roles and responsibilities.

**We were repeating the same process over and over**... My job as the owner was to do my best to make it as easy as possible for my painters to complete.

Since then (I'm in my 3rd year) I’ve grown my company to a $60,000+/m painting company… We have 10 employees and average 4-5 houses per week.

My daily responsibilities:

**Check in with project managers**

**Do estimates (occasionally)**

**Follow up with CRM software**

**Follow up with customers**

…

**That’s it.**

No office, no company vehicles…just a system, that works.

Some houses we paint in a day, others… two or 3 days depending on the size and the specifications.

**And to be honest, my theory was simple…**

***“I’m going to treat house painting like every other business that succeeds out there… someone at the top delegating and calling the shots with a birds eye view”***

It’s impossible to do everything from the bottom level… and if you’re operating a business like this I strongly suggest you begin delegating and developing systems so you can truly get in the driver seat.

**Book recommendation: The E-Myth**

I’m sharing this because a leap of faith got me to this point, and **I want others to see that it’s possible to make money outside of what everyone else is doing**. There’s a ton of money to be made in this type of industry, and there’s a ton of people out there willing to do the work for you. You just need to provide a good enough foundation **(system)** for them to do it in.

198,ersrhv,False,Young Entrepreneur,178,My failed taxi business circa 2006 and how I lost money,Entrepreneur,"**The Setup**

It was 2006 I was in Germany and I was all of 17 yrs old when one night my friend and I went to an event at a night club. I ended up talking to the club owner late at night and he had a problem.

His club wasn't in a main area of town and he needed to get people into his great club, but taxis were expensive, and he wanted to control the experience. 

In my drunken state I knew I had a few things

1. Technological savy

2. My friend was the manager of a rental car agency

I said ""What if I could make an exclusive VIP transport service from people's homes to your club and back for say...10 euro round trip within 20 KM of here""

We agreed to meet up in a few days to discuss the details...when were both sober.

**The Plan**

I went home and hashed out a plan. He's have a big event at his club, I would rent out vans hire drivers have people RSVP to the event each person pays 10 Euro and that covers transportation to the club and from the club. In return the club will also pay me a commission on drink sales (Idea came from my friend who is a DJ) in addition the club will provide us with bottles of Champagne and Wine to provide to the customers as we drive them to the club. 

Idea being people say ""Yes we want to go to this event at this club, pick us up here"" when we pick them up we offer them wine or champagne we drop them off at the club they party, have fun, what not when they are done we drive them back home. We help solve his logistical issue, we get people in the club he pays us a commission on drink sales, we take 10 euro from everyone.

**Present plan & Negotiate**

We meet up I present my plan...he fucking loves it. I asked for 2.5% commission he bulked...he countered me at a 500 euro flat rate we agreed on .75%

**Logistics**

I head over to my friend who is a manager at a rental car place that doesn't mind cash and he says he can supply me with up to 10 vans. They can fit 8 passengers plus the driver pretty comfortably along with a cooler for the wine/champange 

Club plans on having a small time boxing match, along with a few popular DJs from the year, hourly drink specials, etc.  Plus 10 euro round trip transport to and from the club. 

Club starts promoing it...579 people RSVP saying they want to use the transport service to get to the club and back. 

O boy o boy I'm starting to feel like I'm kinda fucked didn't expect this many people...and i'm 17 (I lied and told the club manager I was 23)

579 * 10 is 5,790 euros at 8 passengers per van times two trips I'm going need to plan to conduct 146 trips...that's a lot of trips. Start doing the math, 

* 4 vans 4 drivers 37 trips...that's alot
* 5 vans 5 drivers 30 trips...that's alot
* 6 vans 6 drivers 24 trips...that's alot
* 7 vans 7 drivers 21 trips...getting better
* 8 Vans 8 drivers 18 trips...ok...
* 9 vans 9 drivers 16 trips...ok this is maybe doable?
* 10 vans 10 drivers 15 trips....ok lets do this.

So some vans will be doing 2 trips, some vans will be doing 1 trip. But lets be real I'm not actually going be able to get 8 people in each van, on each trip, at the same time...so I'm going need to plan for more. Goal...20 trips 10 each way to get all 579 people in, and 579 people out.

Ok

Que many, many, many, many, many, many, hours and days of painstakingly going through addresses and scheduling/communicating our most efficient routes. I was doing everything VIA excel and google maps. Goal was to have a few vans do 2-3 trips and then for people further out have those vans do one trip.

**Lets take a break and talk money**

579 people times 10 euro is 5,790 euro. 10 vans at 90 euro a van is going run me 900 euros leaves me with 4,890 euro. I got 10 drivers...I got gas to pay...I also got a friend whose going be at the club coordinating this massive fuck twat of a operation I got myself in. That's 11 people to pay. Talk to the club, he agrees to provide food and non-alcoholic drinks free of charge to my drivers. So that's a bonus, ok lets pay each of my drivers 120 euros each.

That's 1,200 euro, lets offer my friend 150 euros plus I gave him another 300 euro for helping me through the many hours of logistics. thats 1,650 euros. I now got 3,240 euros.

Ok gas...I budgeted 60 euro per van. So thats 600 euro. Now i'm at 2640

Club owner tells me my guys need high vis vests plus some kind of uniform...find out that's going run me 30 euros a guy. So 330 euros. 2,310 euros left.

I'm feeling alright

**3 Nights Before The Event**

My friend and I spent 4 hours each night trying to get ahold of all the party goers confirming their pick up times. 

Bad news plans don't go to plan.

93 people opted out of our service...I had already agreed to hire the drivers, I had already arranged for the vans and I had already bought all the stuff. Sunk cost business time. 93 people is 930 euros. Still got 1,380 left over. Plus whatever the club ends up paying me.

**D Day**

Event starts at 7:30 PM...we all meet up at the rental car agency at 3 PM I fork over 900 euros surprise surprise insurance isn't included in the 90 euros. Come to find out its 15 euros a van. I decide that 15 euros a van is worth not getting fucked. There goes another 150 euros. Ok I'm currently out of pocket 1,380 euros. (Shirts/Vests/Vans/Insurance) that was basically all the money my 17 yr old self had at the time. I had yet to collect a dime in revenue (drivers collected money when we arrived, we also had a plan B with the club if the passengers wanted to pay on card they'd pay 10 euros to the club and the club would pay me my 10 euros)

We get to the club at 5:30 PM my friend (god I should have paid this dude more, honestly without him I'd have been fucked) hand out sheets of paper with addresses, names, phone numbers, and routes (drivers would use a GPS to get to the houses) to pick up our guests. 

6:30 PM first van leaves the club...to say my heart was pounding was an under statement. 

**Some words of caution**

At this point none of my drivers have professional drivers licenses, we had no business license to be operating this service, and we had no business insurance of any kind

**First van**

First van comes lands at 6:55 as scheduled and heads out for its 2nd pick up.

Shockingly...pick up went surprisingly uncomplicated

However we did have 36 people not show up/cancel last minute with us. Doing the math in my head thats minus 360 euros. I'm sitting at 1,020 euros...(I had a spread sheet on the laptop)

All the vans made it back to the club in time, with the last one unloading at 7:50. To say like my 17 yr old self felt like a fucking bad ass would be an understatement.

Also all 450 people had paid us! Well about 25% of them paid the club, but the club owner quickly came out and paid me.

**Rest**

From about 8 to 11 PM was a down period for us. People were having fun, we chilled out had dinner, I snuck in some shots...I was shaking. In my 17 yr old self head I had a 1,000 euros in my pocket before I got my commission.

**Lessons are going to be learned**

Turns out just because people come together to the club, doesn't mean they leave together. Starting around 11 we had the first set of club goers wanting to go home. I tried to hold them in the hopes of getting 2-3 more people into one van and they lived really far out...

After about 15 minutes of stalling club owner came to me and told me if I pissed off his guests he wasn't going pay me my commission...club was full lots of drinks were being sold that .75% was going be a heft chunk of change...ok fuck it send em out.

**Clock strikes midnight**

From about midnight onwards it become hectic with the hours of 2-3 AM being fucking insane. We were sending out vans, waiting for vans to come back. Our entire schedules had been missed up because our vans weren't dropping off the same people they had picked up. Which sometimes meant we had vans dropping off one couple at their house and then having to drive 40 minutes across the area to the next couples home. Customers weren't happy, I told my drivers to explain its part of the negative of having such an affordable transportation option. A few customers threatened to complain to the club...I didn't wanna lose my commission all in all I ended up refunding about 350 euros.

I'm sitting at 670 euros.

**The sun rises**

My last van pulled into the club at 5 AM. Only 2 vans had vomit in them (hell yea only two 150 euro clean up fees!) I tell all the drivers to rest as I close up with the club owner. After that we head to the gas station fill up, then to the rental car shop, drop off the cars, and go to McDonalds and we all go home.

Club owner congratulates me on a job well done. Tells me he brought in 19,985 euros on drinks and pays me 150 euros. Fuck I wish I hadn't refunded that 350.

Leave the club with a planned income of 520-15 euros.

**The Dust Settles**

Take my guys to gas station, we spent 150 euros more on gas then I expected...
Take my guys to McDonalds and pay the biggest single McDonalds bill I've ever paid of 142 euros. 

I'm left with 78 euros at the end of the night.

Yes..

I'm sitting at the table...realizing my friend...he got 150 euros for that night plus 300 for helping me he walks away with 450 euros in his pocket. Most of my drivers after tips earned somewhere around 200 euros. I spent 6 weeks busting my ass...and I'm neting 78 euros.

**Cops Show Up At my House**

Its a few days later I'm at home, door bell rings. Open the door and its our local police they ask me ""Are you PJExpat"" I go ""yes"" they go ""Did you run a driver service for this club?"" I go ""yes"" they go ""Did you have the proper license to do so?"" I go quite. 

I hadn't paid taxes, I hadn't arranged for any sort of insurance outside of the rental car insurance, and I was pretty sure I was in violation of multiple laws...the cop looks at me and goes ""How old are you"" I meek out ""17"" he goes ""what the hell""

Long story short the two cops ask to come inside, we sit down and they basically give me the riot act. Saying that several taxis noticed us operating and called us in. And they did some investigation and tracked everything back to me. They advise me of a high level over view of what I need to do in the future. They also advise me what I did was incredibly fucking stupid and that had something gone wrong like a car accident I could be in a load of shit...they then ask me how much I made...and I told them 78 euros.

They laugh and go really? I pull out my spread sheet that shows how much I brought in, how much I spent, and what I had left over.

The cop sighned and said ""So I guess you can now understand why taxis charge what they do...all that work for 78 euros"" I go ""yes"" and he goes ""and had one major thing gone wrong...you'd have lost...a lot of money"" I go ""I understand"" older cop looks at me, compliments me, tells me if I want to do this business go do it the right way, and they will let this slide

**2 weeks later**

Rental car company calls me, explains that I have 9 speeding tickets to pay and owe 270 euros.

Great

I have now lost 192 euros

**3 weeks later** 

Club owner calls me and asks me if I'm willing to do this again I lay the truth I made minus 192 euros plus I'm 17 yrs old and don't have a legal business.

686,bqv8gj,False,,49,List of 18 business models,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone! Xavier here from [Houston](http://houston.substack.com). While putting together this week's list of problems that startup can solve I compiled this other list of business models that a startup can pursue from a couple of articles and thought it can be useful to you guys so here it is:

**1. Advertising**

The advertising business model has been around a long time and has become more sophisticated as the world has transitioned from print to online. The fundamentals of the model revolve around creating content that people want to read or watch and then displaying advertising to your readers or viewers.

In an advertising business model, you have to satisfy two customer groups: your readers or viewers, and your advertisers. Your readers may or may not be paying you, but your advertisers certainly are.An advertising business model is sometimes combined with a crowdsourcing model where you get your content for free from users instead of paying content creators to develop content.

**Examples:** CBS, The New York Times, YouTube

**2. Affiliate**

The affiliate business model is related to the advertising business model but has some specific differences. Most frequently found online, the affiliate model uses links embedded in content instead of visual advertisements that are easily identifiable.

For example, if you run a book review website, you could embed affiliate links to Amazon within your reviews that allow people to buy the book you are reviewing. Amazon will pay you a small commission for every sale that you refer to them.

**Examples:** TheWireCutter.com, TopTenReviews.com

**3. Brokerage**

Brokerage businesses connect buyers and sellers and help facilitate a transaction. They charge a fee for each transaction to either the buyer or the seller and sometimes both.

One of the most common brokerage businesses is a [real estate agency](https://articles.bplans.com/real-estate-business-startup-guide/), but there are many other types of brokerages such as freight brokers and brokers who help construction companies find buyers for dirt that they excavate from new foundations.

**Examples:** ReMax, RoadRunner Transportation Systems

**4. Concierge/customization**

Some businesses take existing products or services and add a custom element to the transaction that makes every sale unique for the given customer.

For example, think of custom travel agents who book trips and experiences for wealthy clients. You can also find customization happening at a larger scale with products like Nike’s custom sneakers.

**Examples:** NIKEiD, Journy

**5. Crowdsourcing**

If you can bring together a large number of people to contribute content to your site, then you’re crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing business models are most frequently paired with advertising models to generate revenue, but there are many other iterations of the model. Threadless, for example, lets designers submit t-shirt designs and gives the designers a percentage of sales.

Companies that are trying to solve difficult problems often publish their problems openly for anyone to try and solve. Successful solutions get rewards and the company can then grow their business. The key to a successful crowdsourcing business is providing the right rewards to entice the “crowd” while also enabling you to build a viable business.

**Examples:** Threadless, YouTube, P&G Connect and Develop, Cuusoo

**6. Disintermediation**

If you want to make and sell something in stores, you typically work through a series of middlemen to get your product from the factory to the store shelf.

Disintermediation is when you sidestep everyone in the supply chain and sell directly to consumers, allowing you to potentially lower costs to your customers and have a direct relationship them as well.

**Examples:** Casper, Dell

**7. Fractionalization**

Instead of selling an entire product, you can sell just part of that product with a fractionalization business model.

One of the best examples of this business model is timeshares, where a group of people owns only a portion of a vacation home, enabling them to use it for a certain number of weeks every year.

**Examples:** Disney Vacation Club, NetJets

**8. Franchise**

[Franchising](https://articles.bplans.com/start-franchise/) is common in the restaurant industry, but you’ll also find it in all sorts of service industries from cleaning businesses to staffing agencies.

In a franchise business model, you are selling the recipe for starting and running a successful business to someone else. You’re often also selling access to a national brand and support services that help the new franchise owner get up and running. In effect, you’re selling access to a successful business model that you’ve developed.

**Examples:** Ace Hardware, McDonald’s, Allstate

**9. Freemium**

With a freemium business model, you’re giving away part of your product or service for free and charging for premium features or services.

Freemium isn’t the same as a free trial where customers only get access to a product or service for a limited period of time. Instead, freemium models allow for unlimited use of basic features for free and only charge customers who want access to more advanced functionality. For more on the freemium model (and other pricing models popular with SaaS businesses), see [this article](https://articles.bplans.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-a-pricing-strategy-for-your-saas-startup/).

**Examples:** MailChimp, Evernote, LinkedIn

**10. Leasing**

Leasing might seem similar to fractionalization, but they are actually very different. In fractionalization, you are selling perpetual access to part of something. Leasing, on the other hand, is like renting. At the end of a lease agreement, a customer needs to return the product that they were renting from you.

Leasing is most commonly used for high-priced products where customers may not be able to afford a full purchase but could instead afford to rent the product for a while.

**Examples:** Cars, DirectCapital

**11. Low-touch**

With a low-touch business model, companies lower their prices by providing fewer services. Some of the best examples of this type of business model are budget airlines and furniture sellers like IKEA. In both of these cases, the low-touch business model means that customers need to either purchase additional services or do some things themselves in order to keep costs down.

**Examples:** IKEA, Ryan Air

**12. Marketplace**

Marketplaces allow sellers to list items for sale and provide customers with easy tools for connecting to sellers.

The marketplace business model can generate revenue from a variety of sources including fees to the buyer or the seller for a successful transaction, additional services for helping advertise seller’s products, and insurance so buyers have peace of mind. The marketplace model has been used for both products and services.

**Examples:** eBay, Airbnb

**13. Pay-as-you-go**

Instead of pre-purchasing a certain amount of something, such as electricity or cell phone minutes, customers get charged for actual usage at the end of a billing period. The pay-as-you-go model is most common in home utilities, but it has been applied to things like printer ink.

**Examples:** Water companies, HP Instant Ink

**14. Razor blade**

The razor blade business model is named after the product that essentially invented the model: sell a durable product below cost to increase volume sales of a high-margin, disposable component of that product.

This is why razor blade companies practically give away the razor handle, assuming that you’ll continue to buy a large volume of blades over the long term. The goal is to tie a customer into a system, ensuring that there are many additional, ongoing purchases over time.

**Examples:** Gillette, Inkjet printers, Xbox, Amazon’s Kindle

**15. Reverse razor blade**

Flipping the razor blade model around, you can offer a high-margin product and promote sales of a low-margin companion product.

Similar to the razor blade model, customers are often choosing to join an ecosystem of products. But, unlike the razor blade model, the initial purchase is the big sale where a company makes most of its money. The add-ons are just there to keep customers using the initially expensive product.

**Examples:** Apple’s iPod & iTunes, and now MacBooks & Pages, Numbers, and Keynote

**16. Reverse auction**

A reverse auction business model turns auctions upside down and has sellers present their lowest prices to buyers. Buyers then have the option to choose the lowest price presented to them.

You can see reverse auctions in action when contractors bid to do work on a construction project. You also see reverse auctions anytime you shop for a mortgage or other type of loan.

**Examples:** Priceline.com, LendingTree

**17. Subscription**

Subscription business models are becoming more and more common. In this business model, consumers get charged a subscription fee to get access to a service.

While magazine and newspaper subscriptions have been around for a long time, the model has now spread to software and online services and is even showing up in service industries.

**Examples:** Netflix, Salesforce, Comcast

**18. API | Data**

The API business model startups serve the emerging developer economy, typically monetizing via a subscription, SaaS like model based on API usage, in other cases monetizing via transaction fees if processing currency. ****

**Examples**: Stripe and Twilio.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all business models that exist—but, hopefully, it gets you thinking about how you might structure your business.

Every niche. Every problem. Every business. Every idea.

There's 10 coffee shops / cafes (not to mention various other takeaway shops / bakeries that sell coffee) in my one local high street (Powai,Mumbai) that can be walked from end to end in 5 minutes flat...and another one opening soon.

And several dentists, easily 10 barbers / hair dressers, 2 travel agents, 5 or 6 newsagents, 3 supermarkets, 5+ bakeries, a dozen or so food takeaway shops, 3 Chinese restaurants, 4 Indian restaurants etc etc

Do you think just none of them noticed other people were operating similar / the same businesses as them?

I'm sure they did. Yet they all thrive.

That's on a small local high street that you can spit and reach the other end on a windy day.

The internet is global, has 3.2 billion people on it, grows by 30 million new users every month and at a conservative estimate has $327 billion + dollars (and growing) spent on it every year.

Are you really worried about competition / saturation / your idea having been done before?

Seems like a minor concern, if a concern at all, to me on a platform so big that it can never be fully tapped.

Competition is nothing but a sign of a healthy and in demand market with money to be made, customers to sell to, products to sell to them, traffic to be found and all that other good stuff you need to sustain a business.

Embrace it. Run with it. Just do it.

I built  a SEO tool ([rankz.io](https://rankz.io?ref=reddit) ) , in a very competitive market, with established players and this motivates me to ignore all those who says it's already been done.  

Don't try to re-invent the wheel or look for something totally new / untapped / secret / that hasn't been done just look at what's already making money and emulate it and then along the way try to find small ways to differentiate yourself from your competition so you can stand out in the long term.

Do it better than them.

980,52fts0,False,,89,"[SEO] I wrote a massive list (180+) of link building strategies, here's an in-depth tutorial on how to do the 3 I use most",Entrepreneur,"I've spent the last few months putting together a huge list of link building strategies ([here](http://www.theseoproject.org/link-building-strategies/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=entrepreneur)), which I published around a week ago and has been going a bit crazy on twitter.

But, with 184 strategies and 60,000+ words, it's a bit on the intense side, so I thought I'd do a sort-of ""mini-post"" here with a few of the ones I personally use the most often.

**Disclaimer**: These are ""proper"" strategies and they require actual time and effort. I will not be advising that you got to fiverr and buy a gig with 5000 backlinks. In fact, please  NEVER do this. Nothing against fiverr, but 99% of the SEO-related stuff will do more harm than good.

Also, this isn't actually copy/pasted word-for-word stuff that's on my site, I wrote this with /r/entrepreneur in mind.

Anyway, here we go:

**#1 - The Skyscraper Technique (coined by Brian Dean)**	

OK, so I'm sure almost everyone here who's dabbled in the world of SEO/link building has heard of this one, but honestly, it gets the attention it gets because it's one of the best and makes total sense.

Here's the basics of what it entails:

* Find a “proven linkable asset” (this is basically ridiculous SEO terminology for ""find something - e.g. blog post, infographic, video, whatever - in your industry/niche that already has a tonne of links).
* Make an even better version of it.
* Reach out to anyone linking to the original (now inferior) content, and convince them to link to yours instead. 

So, first, you need to find something with a bunch of links in your industry, as you'll be making this even better and (hopefully) nabbing links from the original.

Here are three ways to do that:

- Go to Ahrefs (or Open Site Explorer/Majestic/etc. - any backlink checker basically); go to ""Site Explorer""; enter a popular website in your industry; hit ""Explore""; select ""Best by Links"" on the sidebar; and boom; you now have a list of the most linked-to pages on that site (i.e. potential ""proven linkable assets"")

- Go to Buzzsumo (you'll need to sign up for a free trial - no credit card info needed if I remember correctly); enter a broad keyword related to your niche; you'll now see a list of the most shared content over the past year along with exactly how many shares it's had. You can even click the ""view backlinks"" button if you want to check that side of things too.

- Go to Google; search for a broad keyword related to your niche; use something like [this free SERPS bookmarklet](http://www.onlinesales.co.uk/tools/tools/bookmarklet-serps.php) to scrape all the Google results on the page; paste them into Ahrefs Batch Analysis tool; you'll now be able to see how many backlinks all of these pages has.

If all these of these techniques isn't enough to get your creative juices flowing, I don't know what is. I personally just note down any pages that I feel might be contenders for improvement (and also have a lot of links) in a Google Sheet [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1INGBuWWBCblwUErJYTt5Dlpsj8t1hQWMtY1BqtLQlWo/edit?usp=sharing).

**Note**: If you want to steal that spreadsheet, just go to ""File"" > ""Make a copy"" and you can copy it to your Google drive.

Now, once you've decided upon a piece of content to skyscraper (i.e. improve), you're going to want to figure out what will actually improve it.

Here are 4 ways that work for most pieces of content:

- Making it longer
- Making it more up-to-date
- Improving the design
- Making it more thorough

Generally, the more you can improve the content, the better results you're going to get (I know, surprising, right?). I feel it's important to stress that not everything is improved by being made longer. For example, [isitchristmas.com](http://www.isitchristmas.com/) is literally a one word page, but I think you'll agree, it's perfect as it is and making it longer would only detract from its value. There's really nothing that would improve it.

Bottom-line: Be careful when you're brainstorming improvements; you might accidentally make something worse.

Anyway, when you've created your improved piece of content, you're going to want to reach out to anyone who linked to the old piece of content and tell them about your new improved version.

Here's how to do this:

- Go to Ahrefs (or whichever backlink explorer you prefer) and export all the backlinks pointing towards the original page you improved. In Ahrefs, you can do this by going to ""Backlinks"" on the left-hand menu, then just clicking ""Export"". This will download a CSV of all the backlinks. 

- Sift through the links manually and look any pages that you feel would benefit from linking to your new improved content over the original. You'll want to get rid of any crap during this stage (e.g. the spammy directory pages - just keep the links that you feel look good). 

- Find the contact details for the website itself ([Ryan Stewart has a great tutorial on finding contact information here](http://webris.org/find-anyones-email-address/), so start there).

- Reach out to these people via email (or on twitter) and let them know that while reading their post, you noticed they linked out to X (i.e. the old content you've improved), and that they might want to update the link to Y (i.e. your new improved post). You can find templates for this all over the net, so just use the one that works best for you.

Now, obviously, not everyone is going to respond or update the link (in fact, the vast majority won't). Brian Dean - the guy who coined this term - says he got around a 10% conversion rate (if I remember rightly), but it really depends on the industry. Sometimes it'll be more than this, sometimes it'll be less.

Here are a few tips to maximise success:

- Make the effort to find the webmasters name for reaching out (you can usually find this by looking at the content published on the site - the name that appears most is probably the owner of the site)

- Follow-up a week-or-so later, but don't hassle people. If you don't get a reply the second time, leave it.

- Prioritise the links you really want the most (by this, I mean consider commenting on their site, getting involved with them on twitter, etc. - this way they'll know who are you when you reach out to them, and will be more likely to actually respond and update the link). You can't do this for everyone in most cases, so like I said, prioritise!

- Oh, and don't just improve the original content a tiny bit, make it miles better. Nobody is going to bother updating a link to your list of 11 things when the original was only 10, there's just no point.

P.S. Here's [Brian Deans actual skyscraper post](http://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique) if you want to learn more about this.

**#2 - Get Featured on ""Link Roundups""**	

If you're not familiar with link roundups, they're essentially just posts that some bloggers publish each month where they link out to the best new content they've come across that month (i.e. stuff in their niche).

Here's [an example of one in the SEO industry](http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tips/best-internet-marketing-january-2015/).

^^ You can see that he lists the best posts he's come across that month and links out to them.

If you've invested countless hours creating an epic blog post or video or something, link roundups can be a crazily easy way to land a few extra links. 

Plus, you don't have to feel bad about contacting these people either; most of them have committed to publishing one of these ""roundups"" every month (or sometimes even weekly) and therefore, they're actively on the lookout for epic stuff to feature in their next one. So, provided you're not sending them some absolute crap (please don't send them links to your product pages, for example), you're actually doing them a favour and helping them out.

Here's the basics of what it entails:

* Find those who are publishing ""link roundups"" in your industry/niche on a monthly/weekly basis
* Find the authors contact details (again, check out [this post by Ryan Stewart](http://webris.org/find-anyones-email-address/))
* Reach out and let them know about your content (don't be pushy, just let them know it exists and that they might want to take a look)

Now, the easiest way to find these link roundups is using Google itself...

Go to Google and type in one of these ""search operators"" (note: replace the keyword with a broad industry-related keyword):

- [KEYWORD] + intitle:roundup
- [KEYWORD] + inurl:roundup
- [KEYWORD] + intitle:round-up
- [KEYWORD] + inurl:round-up
- [KEYWORD] + intitle:""of the month""

**Note**: Here's [another Google Sheet you can steal](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vI8v14hr4irlZL2jFxxG_ba8LjgLSRZ7Tc2E8EHyehA/edit?usp=sharing) (just make a copy) that has a bunch of other ""search operators"" - all you have to do is enter a keyword in the orange box and it'll automatically update. Just copy/paste the full operators into Google one at a time.

Now, what do these crazy looking ""search operators"" actually do?.

Simple: they search for your keyword in Google, but also restrict the results to ONLY pages that contain the word ""roundup"" in the URL or the title (depending on which one you use). Most of the results will therefore be link roundup pages in your industry.

Here's [an example for the keyword ""marketing""](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=marketing+%2B+intitle%3A%22roundup%22&oq=marketing+%2B+intitle%3A%22roundup%22&aqs=chrome..69i57.5849j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

^^ You can see that many of the results are clearly the type of ""link roundup"" pages we're after.

**Quick tip**: I'd recommend filtering these results to show only those published in the last 3 months, as this will ensure that you're only finding link roundups that are still being published. If you don't do this, you'll see some roundups from years ago that bloggers have since neglected to publish on a regular basis. You can filter your results by clicking ""Search Results"" > ""Any Time"" > ""Custom Range"" then entering a 3-month range on the Google search results page itself (note: you'll see the ""search results"" dropdown just under the search box).

Anyway, the next step is to extract all of these pages from the Google results and pop them into a spreadsheet. Again, you can do this with [this SERPs bookmarklet for Chrome](http://www.onlinesales.co.uk/tools/tools/bookmarklet-serps.php).

Next, you're going to want to visit these pages one-by-page and double-check that they're actually the link roundup style posts we're looking for. It's also worth checking that the blog is still active and that they're still publishing these roundup posts each month/week (note: you can easily outsource this to a VA).

Once you've got rid of any that aren't relevant, you need to grab the names + contact information for the blogs themselves (see above in the skyscraper technique for more information on doing this). 

Lastly, you need to reach out to these people and let them know about your content + suggest that it might make a nice addition to their next ""roundup"". 

Here are a few tips to maximise success here:

- Personalise the email as much as possible (e.g. don't write ""Hey guys"" if you can avoid it - use the bloggers actual name)

- Put most of your effort into the most suitable ones (not all of the roundups you find will be a perfect fit for your content, so put most of your effort into contacting/pitching to those that are genuinely a great fit).

- Follow-up ONCE (don't bother people too much, but there's nothing wrong with a simple follow-up a week-or-so later if they don't respond. you might be surprised at how effective this can actually be).

**#3 - Broken Link Building**	

OK, so this is yet another strategy that is far from new, but trust me, new isn't always better (ever heard of [shiny object syndrome](http://impossiblehq.com/shiny-object-syndrome/)?)

Broken link building is actually pretty self-explanatory: you find (relevant) websites with broken links, tell the webmaster about them, and in the process, suggest your content as a replacement link.

Here's the basics of how to do it:

* Find pages you want a link from (these are usually ""resource"" pages, but can be anything really)
* Find broken links on that page
* Reach out and tell the webmaster about this issue (and either suggest that they might want to replace the broken link with your link, or simply that they might want to add your link to their page)

**Note:** Something you really need to understand before doing this is that if you're planning to suggest a replacement link, the link you suggest MUST actually be a good replacement. Don't suggest a blog post you wrote about ""the best email marketing software"" as a replacement for a (broken) link about ""10 of the most healthy breakfast cereals"". It doesn't make sense.

""Resource""/""links"" pages work well for this strategy because you don't always have to actually suggest a replacement link; you can often simply suggest that the webmaster just add your (useful) link to their page as it may benefit their visitors. Example: You find a list of SEO resources (like [this one](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/58-seo-resources/)); you can imagine that if you had published a great resource in the SEO niche, it probably wouldn't be that difficult to get it added to the page, especially if you point out some broken links on the page, as any webmaster that gives a crap about their website will want to fix these ASAP.

Anyway, the first step is to actually find pages that are likely to have broken links (that you also may want a link from)...

Like I said, resource/links pages are the best place to start; here are a few ""search operators"" you can use to find these pages:

- [KEYWORD] + intitle:resources
- [KEYWORD] + inurl:links
- [KEYWORD] + intitle:links
- [KEYWORD] + inurl:resources

As with the previous two strategies, you're going to want to scrape these into a list using the [SERPs bookmarklet](http://www.onlinesales.co.uk/tools/tools/bookmarklet-serps.php). I then suggest copy/pasting the list into [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nOjgsc5vMXoeACXgtBV8QsS23nw17DDCgHTj8BT-oAM/edit?usp=sharing) (again, just copy it to your Google Drive to steal it)

Next, you're going to want to visit each page and ask yourself these questions:

- Would potential visitors to this page find any of my content useful? (yes/no answer)
- Are there any broken links on this page? (and do I have any content on my site that is genuinely a great replacement for this link)

I suggest tackling these questions one-by-one (i.e. figuring out if you have any content that would be beneficial to the visitors of the page) and if so, see if there are any broken links.

Here's [a free Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/check-my-links/ojkcdipcgfaekbeaelaapakgnjflfglf?hl=en-GB) that highlights any broken links in red. Open each of the pages you answered ""yes"" to on your list and run it. Note down if there are broken links (and also which links they are if possible).

OK, sounds a bit complicated right, so let's take a look at an example:

Consider the list of SEO resources I mentioned a little earlier. It's clear that my list of ""link building strategies"" would probably be a nice addition to this page (as visitors would probably find it useful) so the answer to our first question (i.e. would potential visitors find any of my content useful?) is ""yes"". Now, we look for broken links on the page. If there are any, we now have a ""hook"" that we can use to contact the webmaster. The idea is this: if they're going to have to login to their Wordpress to fix some broken links, they may as well add our super-useful link while they're there too (especially as we actually helped them to find/fix the broken links in the first place).

When you've done this for all the pages on your list (or got your VA to do it - recommended), you need to hunt down the webmasters contact details + name (again, [this guide](http://webris.org/find-anyones-email-address/) will help)

Finally, reach out to each webmaster and tell them about the broken link(s) + suggest that they add your link to the page too (or replace the broken link with it).

**Note:**: It's also possible to use this technique on other, non-resource pages too. For example, if you felt your link would make a nice addition to a certain blog post someone had written, why not look for broken links on other pages of their site and point them out to them? They'll have to log in to their wordpress dashboard to fix these regardless of where they are on their site, and if you want your link added to a blog post of theirs, they may be more inclined to actually add it as you've already helped them out.

Here are a couple of tips to maximise your success here:

- Tell webmasters exactly where the broken links are (i.e. the page they're on, the exact link that's broken, and the anchor text of the link - this will make it a whole lot easier for them to locate it and fix it).

- ONLY suggest genuinely valuable links that fit the page in question

698,8jcjrb,False,Young Entrepreneur,64,I finally made the plunge. Running a business for myself.,Entrepreneur,"Hey all, so I finally did it. I have been a wantpreneur for a long time now. From dropping money on drop shipping to “trying” to build my own website to sell novelty bottle cap openers (poppingbottlesopen.com) don’t worry there is nothing on that site but a homepage. I’ve had a thousand ideas that never got released. But, I finally have a product/service that I am actually selling. 

I am a chef by trade that has built restaurants for others from the ground up. Multiple local awards for my food and I found myself, after my wedding, out of a job. The boss said that I took too much time off for the wedding. Fed up with putting in my heart and soul into something for somebody else I decided it was time to do something for me.  

I took a few months off, talked to my contractor friends and decided to venture out on my own. I haven’t closed on anything yet, but working on many things on many fronts:

In the short term, I am finally selling wares!! I have a spot at multiple farmers markets and selling out every Saturday even though I am upping my pars. There is a Tuesday market that is less profitable ($400 sold on average) but, I see the Tuesday market as covering all my reoccurring costs for the week. All in costs were about $1500, this includes square reader, banners, tables, tent, farmers market fees, health inspections, cups, you get the idea. A little bit of luck on my side, I currently work at a restaurant that is letting me use their space as a commissary at zero cost. On the first market I sold nearly $800 of juice and food. Every market is about $140 in food costs and I work it on my own or with my wife, so “free labor.”

Long term I have a lease to open two concepts at a brand new Food Hall. A burger and pizza joint and in the same footprint a juice bar. I won critics choice best burger in my city so I have a reputation and good will that I will build upon. And, I figure these two concepts will capitalize on am and pm business. Also, I want to incorporate alcohol into my juice to bump up the margins. 

Medium term I would still like to have my own brick and mortar juice bar before the food hall opens in a year and a half. The most appealing thing about this concept is that it requires minimal startup. No hood system, no highly qualified chefs or cooks, and a quick turnaround on product. I know it is aggressive, but if I can have a solid year of business I can work out all the kinks and up my purchasing power. Long term I think the juice concept can have multiple locations and even franchise the whole operation (5+ years)



I know it’s not huge, but people are excited that we are at the markets, I am excited to be there and I know I’m on the right track to becoming financially independent. The shelf life for a chef is low. You can bounce around from place to place until you aren’t able to stand for 12 hours at a time then what? No 401k, no insurance, no safety net. I know there’s no guarantee in this world, but as the saying goes - your parachute won’t open if you don’t jump. So you might as well take the chance.

120,cmcdcq,False,,158,My mom started a company when she turned 50.,Entrepreneur,"I wanted to share something with you guys, because so many of us struggle with the idea that its too late to become a founder, or too early, or not the right time.

I want to tell you about my mom, Sophia. She's an immigrant from Taiwan.

She lived her childhood in an orphanage. She was abused. Abandoned. She never gave up. She broke out. Then broke out her brothers and sisters. She found my grandfather and forced him to give them a home. She went to night school and sold trash during the day. She got into the best high school in Taiwan. She taught herself English. When she spoke out against the Vietnam war, she was forced to leave. She came to America. Married my father. Traveled the world. When my parents got divorced she was left with nothing, she had never worked before.

She got her first corporate job. Within 5 years she was the best salesperson in the company. One day after she landed a huge contract, she came into work and the VP of the company introduced her to the man who would be taking control of the contract, instead of her. Then they asked her to get the coffee to discuss the transition. A few of the staff protested, but most didn't say anything.

She quit. She called me. We started a company. Her first ever venture at 50 years old. I was 20. We had nothing, I worked full time as a paralegal to help pay the rent, each day divided into 8 hours of company, 8 hours job, 8 hours everything else. We worked out of Starbucks for 2 years, didn't get an office for 3. We would share a single cup of tea and ask for refills, we were BROKE.

That company now has 200 employees and does $18M in annual revenue. (Mom. I am so proud of you!!!!!!)

Oh. [You might find this photo interesting](https://imgur.com/Mt1y2Zv). She was asked to testify before the US senate on small business a few years ago. The entire room cried when they heard the story. Yes. That’s Eva Longoria next to her.

An article in the Post said that nobody remembered what Eva said, because of the testimony of Sophia Parker about a little company called DSFederal who gives away its profits to orphans around the world.

It is never too late. It is never too soon. You can do it! I know your struggle, every day, I know how hard it is. But I want you to know something.

In the end, after all the struggle, after all the pain after all the sacrifice.

YOU WIN.

Stay at it, start today.

We have some experience in the prototyping/design/manufacturing process.  Past work includes an electronic footsizer for Reebok, display racks for Rockstar & Coca-Cola, a needle-less syringe, and a portable PMF device for research at UC Riverside, and various other etc.

Would anybody be interested in such a guide?  Yes = up vote, No = down vote

Let me know if there's anything specific that you would like to learn or why you think the guide idea is complete crap.  Thanks!

975,ep2bk6,False,Lessons Learned,186,Hitting $10 per month on my podcast's Patreon page!,Entrepreneur,"A few months ago I decided to create a podcast, which examines the video game industry, entrepreneurship and gaming nostalgia, which I try to approach as an unified field. Being that this is not exactly a hot and popular domain, I decided to try out something I was considering for some time - a Patreon page.

Now, getting Patreon backers is unlike any other of my previous ventures. I immediately decided to skip on the first Patreon suggestion and not ask my friends or relatives for support. In my view, Patreon has to be more of a promotional mechanism than a monetization means, at least in the beginning. I get why Patreon wants the cash of my loved ones, but I believe it means little to me or my podcast (called IM Gaming).

Instead, I began working on the podcast, churning out episodes and promoting my Patreon through it and my social media - naturally, this doesn't work either, but you still kind of want to do it for that off chance that someone is going to pledge $1 to you for some reason.

However, I got the idea of reaching out to people who have some kind of a gaming venture themselves (a game in development, published game, YouTube channel, or anything like that) and with whom I have already worked through some of my other gaming micro ventures.

I informed some of them about the podcast and asked for support, while I also offered to provide them with additional exposition both in the podcast and on the Patreon page. So far, I was fortunate enough to find three good souls and they took me to exactly $10 per month, while they're also at least somewhat interested in my content.

Besides building a core audience, this also provides me with that essential proof of concept I was looking for - which is that some think that my podcast isn't utter crap. Also, getting new supporters feels awesome!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ep2bk6/hitting_10_per_month_on_my_podcasts_patreon_page/,388,"first of all... congrats OP! that's a start and everybody who's making thousands/month on patreon started with 10 at some point... i read a lot of comments, i know that OP is 37 and likes doing smaller projects that add up and all that....

now to those comments that say this isn't enrepreneurship, because it's $10/month... first of all, you all sound like you've never been able to generate 10 bucks and your opinions sound stolen.. like you just listened to some garyvee (who i'm sure would congratulate OP and never say he isn't an entrepreneur, because he's hustling next to a job and i assume, if possible, some day he'd rather have his 10 projects that substitute his employee salary and quit the job) and other celeb-entrepreneurs and at the end came up with a nonsensical, extreme opinion on entrepreneurship... if that's how you think and talk to people, i reeeaally hope you're not actual CEOs with employees...

second... you realize, you can't say a business isn't a business until it can pay the founder (or any other arbitrary amount of money) and then talk about angel investors and shit like that... remind me, how much revenue did facebook, twitter, instagram, pinterest, google, snapchat and many others generate in the beginning? and i mean revenue, not profits.... some of them continue to lose money every single day... does that mean, those companies aren't actual companies and the founders/CEOs aren't entrepreneurs, because they can only sustain themselves with outside money? you tell me... 

i believe in many different approaches to entrepreneurship... a slow and steady growth like OP wants, fast but unprofitable growth that at some point hopefully leads to billions in profit, or a rather quick but always profitable growth, that doesn't need investors but actually sells a product and grows with it's customer base.. even building an audience as an influencer and then later starting to sell something that generates passive income is a form of entrepreneurship to me...

there is no official definition of ""Entrepreneurship"", so you guys can't act like what you're saying is true.. it's your opinion and nothing else (well, it's also wrong, but whatever :P)... as this text is just my opinion.. Also.. ""Entrepreneur"" is french  and means ""undertaker"" (not the wrestler), and actually comes from the verb ""to undertake"" or ""entreprendre"".   
""To undertake"" means:   
1. To take upon oneself; to start, to embark on (a specific task etc.) |   
2. To commit oneself (to an obligation, activity etc.)...   
so basically, ""to do something"".... to start a podcast, a business, a nonprofit, a blog, anything that hopefully will lead to money as the audience/customer base grows....

so, that's long enough.. even though i could rant about this for days :P i'm sorry about the length, but i guess nobody will actually read it anyway :D again, congrats Ivica! ",2020-01-15 13:27:15

587,6qi8c1,False,,116,I decided to start a business with absolute 0 experience. This is my first week.,Entrepreneur,"Sup Reddit,

Long time lurker here haha. My name is Daniel and for the past week I decided to jump the gun and start a business ([take a look](https://hinkaku.ca)). For the longest time I have always wanted to jump into streetwear because it was something I was passionate about. I want to share my adventure with you guys just as some of you had shared with me. Please note the steps I have taken does not guarantee success, this is just what I did.

#**PART ONE: where the hell do I start?**

Starting off my journey, I was looking at a variety of options. I did not know where to host my business. Should I have done something local or online? Wait wait hold up, before that do I even have a design? No. That was the first thing I had to do. Design.
A logo is essential for a brand. It is something that represents the business and something that is recognized. I had already decided for my brand name to be hinkaku (japanese for dignity). To accompany the name, I designed a sakura flower (using photoshop) like a badge. A badge is to be something worn, which I thought would have been perfect for apparel.
However, it would suck to have just one design to sell, so I came up with three more for an opening launch. You can see them [here](https://hinkaku.ca/collections/shirts).

#**PART TWO: choosing the platform**

Transitioning from part one, I have finished my designs, but now I needed a supplier. Here were my two choices:

- Printful
- Local

The pros of choosing printful:

- They are a fulfillment service which means they handle shipping and printing, I just have to manage the designs and marketing.

The cons of choosing printful:

- Shipping rates are soooooooooo expensive. $8 to ship to Canada for one tee(all my buds are in canada and I know for SURE they will not pay $8 to ship...)

The pros of going local:

- You can see the process and physically check the quality. 
- The one I had in mind had cheaper prices than printful (usd to cad conversion is bad) and the prints were heavenly

The cons of going local:

- Gotta buy in bulk (12 shirts were the minimum $180~ CAD). I did not have that type of money. ( I am a student)
- You have to do the shipping

It took me a while to decide, but after receiving only 5 pre orders (from friends), I knew I would not meet the required twelve threshold for my local printer. I decided to use [printful](https://www.printful.com) and [shopify](https://www.shopify.com).

#**PART THREE: Shopify free trial**

Signing up with shopify, you are able to receive a 14-day free trial, and an additional 7 days (there should be an email asking if you want a 7 day extension). The printful integration with shopify is very well done. All I have to do is position my graphic, add a description and set my profits. Printful will automatically push the products to shopify. That simplifies so much for me. I don’t have to handle inventory or anything. Moving on, I had to design the site. This was by far the most fun I had so far. Shopify’s template builder is really simple to use and lets you focus on designing. No coding required! I played around with all the free templates and found that narrative suited me the best. I used burst by shopify for a few images, but also provided some of my own (backgrounds). Use the 21 days to carefully craft the site and make it look good, focus on making everything perfect and an enjoyable experience for the customer. Some of the addons I used were: BEST currency converter, Quick announcement bar by hextom, and printful. You can check out the site I built [here](https://hinkaku.ca).

#**PART FOUR: Launch day!**

Yes I was nervous. Everything I have done previously was for this moment. There was something magical about opening a store haha. Anyhow, I was quick to realize there would be absolute 0 sales because no one would know about my site! This was when I knew I had forgot something important… I did not advertise beforehand. Now I was a sitting duck with no sales. My shop was open but nobody came in. Luckily, I was still in my free trial period, BUT this was still precious time lost. I made an instagram account and facebook page and started posting some content with hashtags relevant to my product/ audience. This was alright though, although I still had 0 sales going through, I reached out to the friends that have previously pre-ordered about my opening and offered them a best buddy discount. This was done using Printful’s sample order (5 items per order 3 times a month and FREE SHIPPING). Your friends will be your first local sales. Shoutout to my friends that supported me I thank you so much. Anyways, the problem still arose though, where do I get traffic for my site?

#**PART FIVE: Advertising**

I am a complete n00b here so this is a lesson to learn for everyone and myself haha. This was my first time learning how to advertise so after reading some articles, I decided to use instagram to spread the word. The first advertising was just to spread awareness that my site exists (first post on my instagram). I went for impressions and picked up some attention. I got a couple followers, a couple likes, a couple visits to my site, but no sales. 0 sales meant that the advertising money I spent ($6 cad) was down the drain. No return no nothing. My money just disappeared like that. I felt pretty sad, so I decided to whip up a promotion this time thinking that could work. My second advertisement (second post on instagram) featured free shipping for the united states (used carousel ad type to showcase the products). I personally thought it looked pretty great, but upon launching the ad, again I was met with defeat. Again, some more followers, likes, and visits, but no sales. This was another $6 down the drain. Advertising was defeat for me. Though I heard it takes time to learn how to advertise, I treat this as a learning experience.

#**In Summary for Week One**
- 0.68 in profits after operation costs (still in the green my dudes)
- 7 followers on instagram
- 6 local sales
- 125 visits to my store
- 0 online sales

To those who read to the end, thank you.

I have had so much fun so far and am looking to improve. Got any advice? Share it with us :D

There are many ways to climb a mountain, this is just one. I may or may not reach the top, but regardless it is the journey that counts.

141,gojsak,False,,126,I took my company fully remote and left the city in 2018,Entrepreneur,"I run a small service business with 5 full time employees. 40% of our revenue is locally in Boston MA and the rest is spread out among Philly, DC, and several small college towns. 

My partner and I lived in Boston growing the business from 2014 to 2018. It was great being together with the team and we grew the business up close to $3MM a year in sales. 

Then my wife and I had a baby. We got tired of renting a shit hole 2 bed apartment in the crappy part of town above a hardware store for $2500 a month. 

We decided to shop for a house. We realized that it was gonna run $750k for a 1950s house with no garage 30 minutes outside the city. Between the taxes, weather, our $30k annual office expense, etc we decided to go 100% remote and leave. 

My wife and I made a list of things we loved. Craft beer, cycling, college sports, food, live music, nightlife, hiking, yoga, etc. 

We wanted a 4 bedroom new house for under $300k 10 minutes or less from downtown. We needed to be within 1.5 hours of a major airport. We needed it to be over 50 degrees on average in January. 

Athens GA was the only town in America that met our criteria. We visited, fell in love, and moved.  

It was the best decision we made as a company. We didn’t miss a beat as far as productivity. One of our main guys moved to Charlotte. Another lady moved to Chicago. 

We saved $50k on office expenses. $30k in living expenses. Much higher quality of life. Spent a little more on travel. 

Then this COVID stuff happens and I thank my lucky stars even more.

No one should go through a tough time alone, and sometimes a genuine conversation is all we need to feel a bit better. 

I had to completely crumble to rebuild myself into a better person. I felt discouraged by societal stigmas concerning mental health and ""being a man"" to talk about my feelings openly. During my darkest moments, I was afraid that my friends might judge me. I was afraid that my parents would be overly concerned or not understanding, and reaching out to professionals seems daunting and expensive. 

The solution we've come up with provides the type of non-judgmental and inclusive community that I wish I had at the time.

Thought some of you might appreciate it.",Entrepreneur,"Episode 1: Food For Thought is a business idea revolving around the recent shift we’ve seen in the food delivery and easy grocery pickup business. What if there was a service that allowed you to select the meals you want to cook, and it automatically added all the required ingredients to your shopping cart along with the recipe to make the meal. 

One could take it a step further and allow a user to select multiple recipes and the system could combine the ingredients to avoid over and/or under purchasing ingredients when avoidable. Possibly even remembering customers orders to avoid reordering an ingredient they should have had leftovers of from their last order. 

A few businesses you might be able to partner up with:

Walmart - with their new grocery pickup system. This could be an added convenience for those customers.

Waitr - Waitr was a small startup who focused on delivering for restaurants that didn’t typically deliver. Now they have added grocery delivery to their list of services. This could potentially pair nicely if you’re able to convince them to work with you. 

Tasty - Tasty started off making simple stop motion recipe videos and have now expanded to cook wares that are selling in Walmart. Obviously this company is hungry for growth.

Obviously there are a million different ways to approach this idea. I can’t wait to see how to bring it to life. Be sure to let me know in the comments if you decide to pursue this, I’d love to follow your progress.

A lot of folks think that things need to be perfect before you get going. You'll see how laughable that idea is in a second.

Some of you may have seen some of these pics from our [big case study](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/) but there are quite a few additional ones in here as well.

Okay, on with the post:

So this post was prompted by a question someone asked a few days back about not being able to compete with a big company. I responded by saying 

*""Your biggest risk of failure is yourself and the typical cognitive errors new entrepreneurs make: misappraisal of competition, trying to compete on price, poor branding, trying to reinvent the wheel, offering too many options, and the list goes on. The biggest risk of failure will NOT be your competition charging less than you do"".*

I thought I'll expand on this a bit.  

**Here's what's stopping folks from launching and growing a successful business!**

**WANTREPRENEUR MISTAKES**  

Most of these end with folks convincing themselves that their thing won't work. They're not even business mistakes, because there is no business. They are ""How can I stay safely on the sidelines"" mistakes. Some of these also fall nicely into the ""lies we tell ourselves that sound awesome"" mistakes as well:

1) I won't be able to compete with Amazon or <insert huge company>?"". Stop this silliness. This is not how any of this works.

2) ""I won't be able to offer it at that price?"" And? Most decisions happen in isolation on your site. If your brand connects, you price at what you want.

3) ""Let me add a twist to this idea"" So, with no knowledge of the industry, you're better off reinventing the wheel vs executing on what you can SEE works? I mean I get little twists, but the bigger the twist the more risk of failure you introduce.

4) ""Let me figure out how to tie in Zillow's Api"". People complicate things, get overwhelmed, and never get out the gate. If you can do it with a spreadsheet, do it with a spreadsheet to get started.

5) ""I can't figure out what to use"": shopify or woocommerce, wordpress or squarespace, blah blah blah or blah blah...at the end of the day, expect less than 0% impact on your success from any of these decisions. Choose one and get to work!

6) ""The market is saturated."" No it isn't! This is the greatest bullshit ever. Beats everything else in this post actually. This is a convenient, socially acceptable way to say ""I'm scared"".

**LAUNCH MISTAKES**  
A lot of these fall into the let me do the minimally viable product thing that is the commonly accepted startup mantra du jour. ""I've heard the concept repeated so much, let me try to apply it.""...well, we'll see how this often turns out.

1) ""I'll get out the gate with an ugly site just to validate"". Great! Nobody will put their credit card into your shitty site and you'll conclude it won't work.

2) ""Let me see how many emails I can collect to prove this will work"" Hmm, I validate with credit card charges instead. 5 people buying from me is more of a validation that 500 emails captured on a pre-launch page.

3) Validating at all! If your idea is so unique that it needs validation, you've increased your chances of failure. Why make your first business risky, when there are gazillion things that other people have already validated for you?

4) Making people guess what you're selling. People should know what they're getting on your site in a split second. If you can't say it in one quick sentence on the above the fold section of your site, something is wrong.

**OPERATIONAL MISTAKES**  

Now if you've gotten to this point, you actually found a way to have a functioning business. It's incredibly hard to get there. Yet the opportunities to mess up at this point are still substantial.

1) ""Let me lower my prices so I can compete"". Unless you're selling widgets, you should be competing on brand, not price.

2) ""Would be awesome if the customer can customize everything"". One product/service at one price is the holy grail as far as I'm concerned. As a new entrepreneur each additional variable increases your logistical challenges, and confuses your customer. The more options, the lower the conversion rate, all things being equal.

3) The Peanut Allergy problem. I came up with this phrase to describe this problem:  A simple solution will fit 95% of your customers. You'll need some additional solution to fit the other 5%. That additional solution often ends up hurting the 95%. Do you take nuts out of your chocolates because some people have peanut allergies? Hell no you don't. You let that go and focus on serving the majority of your customers.  I see so many people fall victim to this one.

4) Long ass forms: Collect the minimum data you can collect to close the sale. Anything extra you need ask AFTER the sale is completed. The more fields the lower your conversion rates, all things being equal.

5) Being fucking cheap! I'm not even in the mood to put this nicely. You don't buy the cheapest jeans, you don't buy the cheapest watch, you don't buy the cheapest phone. You go all out buying silly shit, but you want the cheapest (or free) everything when it comes to investing in YOU. This shit kills me every time I see it.

6) Focusing on the wrong things: What matters? GETTING CUSTOMERS. What does it take: Branding & Marketing. If these aren't taking up 90% of your time, you're shooting yourself in the foot. What folks spend time on instead? ""oh this sweet widget that will cross populate emails to my cms so I can save 30 seconds on client interaction..and on and on...all of this fancy stuff can come later. Build a business first, get revenue and then go to town. I was doing $60K per month off of Google spreadsheets, google calendar, and gmail. Focus on Getting CUSTOMERS!!!!!

**Wrapping it up!**  

And that's it. A non-exhaustive list, but this captures most of the stuff that I see folks doing and saying to either stay on the sidelines or set themselves up for failure.

Will everything here apply to every single situation, of course not. But I bet for quite a few of you that are stuck, there are quite a few things on here that will connect right away. 

**And I know that because I've been there!** 

I want to see you guys win, but this is [my reaction as I'm reading a lot of comments on reddit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ0yD-9CDwI&t=0m17s) haha.

These aren't mistakes though.  6 years ago I could have tried to compete directly against a major competitor (I'm talking the only one in my space that has IPO'd and is worth around $100M, advertises everywhere, and everybody knows their name) but I didn't.  I chose a different business model instead that makes my product somewhat complimentary instead.  6 years ago I was able to see that one market in particular for my product was completely saturated with a race to the bottom in price.  So unlike everybody else who came after me I didn't enter there.  It seems to have worked extremely well for me. ",2015-06-22 16:43:01

142,4xead3,False,,376,"Woodies: 1 Million Revenue, 0 Employees | Every Tool I Use",Entrepreneur,"Hey /r/entrepeneur Cory here from Woodies.   **Thanks for the Gold!**

I just read the post about some guy un-subbing because of all the click-bait, shit-posts, so now that he's gone, I thought I'd contribute really helpful content!

While making this list, I cannot believe how many freaking services I use, it's kind of ridiculous, I probably need to cancel a few.  

I've been running Woodies for 5 years now, and my vision has become clear.  I want to make as much money as possible while maintaining complete control of my business.  I have no employees, I have no partners.  I'm on track to *hopefully* do a million in revenue this year.

I'm looking for anything that saves me time.  I'm a graduate of the four-hour workweek school of thought and my goal is to outsource everything I can, and automate everything that allows me to multiply my efforts.  

Here is the full list of apps and SaaS that I use to run Woodies:

[***Shopify***](http://shopify.com):  The alpha dog in the ecommerce space

***Shopify Apps***:

***[Login with Amazon](https://apps.shopify.com/login-with-amazon)***:  60% of traffic comes from mobile but only 20% of checkouts, why?  Because it's hard to enter your info, this allows people to login with their Amazon account, choose their address, choose their payment method and boom they're checked out.  Great app

***[Make an Offer](https://apps.shopify.com/make-an-offer)***:  Exit-intent pop-up that allows customers to submit an offer for a product they wanted, they give their email, I use Zapier to shoot them a discount code and to add their email to Mailchimp

***[ShopiMap](https://apps.shopify.com/shopimap)***:  It puts a pin on every customer and shows what they ordered.  Great for social proof.  [Here's mine for Woodies](https://woodies.com/pages/who-wears-woodies)

***[CovetPics](https://apps.shopify.com/covet-pics)***:  Cool Instagram plug-in that makes a collage from my Instagram account and integrates the photos on each product page

[***Yotpo***](http://yotpo.com):  I was lucky to get them while they cost $30/month  now it costs like $300 a month to collect reviews.  It's a really great app though, it auto-sends review requests and displays them on product pages.  I wish they picked a better name, Yotpo is kinda lame

***[Spently](https://apps.shopify.com/spently)***:  I use them for sending out sweet order confirmation emails. The default ones from Shopify are pretty boring, these are awesome, shout to Nick!

***[Compass.Co](http://compass.co)***:  The best ecommerce analytics I've seen, they integrate with all my sales channels and pull in more information than I knew I had and organize it neatly

[***Amazon:***](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html)  My number one sales platform, responsible for over 60% of my sales

***Customer Service***:  This is VERY IMPORTANT.  Luckily, I pay my mom a monthly rate to perform this valuable service.  ([*thanks mom!*](https://woodies.com/pages/contact))  Unfortunately, you can't use her!  You CAN use someone else's mom however, the website [HireMyMom](https://www.hiremymom.com/) (queue all the reddit jokes)  We all know mom's are awesome, they're usually consistent, reliable, and friendly.  For VA's, mom's are #1

[***AmazonFBA***](https://services.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon/benefits.htm):  The service that receives, stores, packs, and ships 100% of my products.  Without this service, I wouldn't be able to travel full-time, I'd need to rent a warehouse, hire workers, and the rest

***[Amazon Affiliates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/welcome)***:  I sell on Shopify and Amazon, but I understand there are people out there who just LOVE Amazon Prime, so they go to my site, find a product they like, then want to buy it Amazon, I don't blame them, I would prefer free shipping also.  SO on each of my product pages, I include a link to my product listing on Amazon, I use an affiliate link so that I make like 1% of the order.  It adds up to only like $100/month, but it's better than nothing.  ***See an example: [Woodies Zebrawood Sunglasses](https://woodies.com/collections/bamboo-wood-sunglasses/products/zebra-wood-aviator-wrap-sunglasses)*** *warning: affiliate link on next page*

Amazon Apps:

[***FeedbackGenius***](https://www.feedbackgenius.com/):  Sends automatic feedback requests to hundreds of orders per day, reviews are so valuable on Amazon that this app pays for itself many times over

***[HelloProfit](http://helloprofit.com)***:  I started realizing how many different services I use and I went in a cancelled this one, $79 a month just to make the reports section of Amazon look better, not worth it

Website:  

[***Cloudflare***](https://www.cloudflare.com):  Supposedly makes my website faster, I have no idea honestly how this works, might be wasting $20/month, can anyone chime in here??  

***[Typeform](http://typeform.com)***:  Awesome way to use forms.  I use them to collect information from giveaways.  

***[Zapier](http://zapier.com)***:  Works well with Typeform to transfer data in between services like Gmail - Typeform - GoogleDocs - Mailchimp - Shopify.  Example, customer buys thing, Shopify tells Gmail, Gmail sends Email with Typeform, Shopify tells Mailchimp, Mailchimp adds to segment, Customer fills out Typeform, Typeform tells Mailchimp to send out Gmail, wait what?  It gets complicated

***[GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com)***:  Probably not the best out there, but whatever it works fine, never had a problem

Task Management:

***[Gmail](http://gmail.com)***: I try to only check it twice a day, and my absolute goal is [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero)

*Pro-tip*  [Learn all the Gmail keyboard shortcuts](https://www.shortcutworld.com/en/mac/Gmail.html)  

*Pro-tip 2*  Enable Send+Archive in Gmail Settings and set it up to automatically open your next email

[***Inbox Pause***](http://inboxpause.com/):  Helps me stick to my twice a day 'batching' of emails.  Pauses my email flow after I enable it.  This is to prevent that nasty habit of working on a tough task, then switching to gmail so I can answer 2-3 'easy' emails

***[Trello](http://Trello.com)***:  In my never-ending pursuit of Inbox Zero, I have rules for when I encounter a batch of emails:

* If I can respond within 1-2 minutes, I respond

* If it would take me more than 2 minutes, I create a task on Trello

***Gmail Timer Logs:***  Automatically starts a timer whenever I open a new email

***Chrome Extensions:***

***[LastPASS](http://lastpass.com)***:  Saves all my passwords, auto-login, and form-fills my payment methods. Pro-tip: save info from one CC to use online only and then cut it up, nothing is more frustrating than losing my card at the bar and having to reset 20 different subscriptions

[***Block Site***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en):  The best website blocker I've used.  Simple, works, and enough of a pain to disable that I usually don't bother

[***The Great Suspender***](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en):  When I work, I usually have 15-20 tabs open at a time, this suspends the background tabs so the open ones run faster

***[AMZ Seller Browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amz-seller-browser/klgpelgeohjghmccooegimcfhanlnngc?hl=en)***:  Let's me easily see Price History and Sales Rank on Amazon to help me keep track of competition

***[Alexa Traffic](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alexa-traffic-rank/cknebhggccemgcnbidipinkifmmegdel?hl=en)*** + ***[Similarweb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/similarweb-website-rankin/hoklmmgfnpapgjgcpechhaamimifchmp?hl=en)***:  Helps me quickly assess how much traffic any site gets.  Also a quick way to check page loading speed

***[OpenVid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openvid-screen-mic-and-ca/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb)***:  A quick way to record a screencast so you can show a designer exactly what you want fixed and not have to setup a whole screenshare

Product Development:

***[Alibaba](http://Alibaba.com)***:  Still my first stop when it comes to searching for new products.  Just message suppliers asking them to email you back.  1. This avoids Alibaba's terribly designed messaging system  2.  This filters out suppliers who cannot follow simple instructions

[***Whatsapp***](http://whatsapp.com):  Once you start working with a supplier, get them on whatsapp, Chinese tend to prefer messaging over email and I consider this my most important business relationship, so it's worth it

[***Flexport***](http://flexport.com):  Not sure if they're accepting new members again yet, makes international freight forwarding as easy as ordering pizza

[***Upgraded Images***](http://upgradedimages.com):  Ken at Upgraded Images is my go-to guy for getting great product photography that stands out.  Quick, affordable, and quality stuff

[***SpeedyBarcodes***](https://speedybarcodes.com/):  Where I buy barcodes so I can sell on Amazon

Marketing:

***[Schedugram](http://schedugr.am)***:  Allows me to schedule Instagram posts in advance and have them automatically post (the only tech that does that automatically I believe)

***[Repost](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/repost-for-instagram/id570315854?mt=8)***:  Repost other Instagram photos, usually of people who tag Woodies in a photo

***[Instagram](http://instagram.com)*** and ^^[Snapchat](http://snapchat.com):  Can we all agree that Instagram is king and Snapchat has been demoted to court jester?  Here's my personal Instagram:  [WoodiesCaptain](http://instagram.com/woodiescaptain) and the [Woodies IG](http://instagram.com/woodies), if you're interested

*also good for hitting up your WCW, just sliiiiiide in the DM and see if she'll post a pic*

[***Mailchimp***](http://mailchimp.com):  Been using them for 4 years to send out emails, I send out really simple emails so I could probably downgrade to something else.  I'm also considering [***Klaviyo***](https://www.klaviyo.com/) because it's built specifically for Shopify. 

Apps:

[TripIt](http://tripit.com):  I travel full-time (don't have a home) so this keeps track of all my itineraries

[***F.lux***](https://justgetflux.com/):  Dims my screen at night to give my eyes a break while I work late *highly recommended*

***[Franz](http://meetfranz.com/)***:  Messaging app for Mac that combines Whatsapp, Messenger, Hangouts, Slack, Skype, and WeChat all in one easy to use client

Not a fan:  StitchLabs, Shipwire, AppSumo is suddenly not my favorite app mostly because I can't figure it out, apps should just WORK or GTFO

What apps or SaaS am I missing??

ps.  I don't have an app for this but I'm a HUGE fan of saying NO to people.  No, I don't sell wholesale. No, I don't ship internationally. No creates space for you to think clearly about what you really want.  No opens up time to work on truly important work

I'll stick around to answer any questions, you can also PM me, or email Cory@Woodies.com 

See you at the beach!

470,6fincl,False,,130,How I grew multiple clients' Instagram accounts from 0 to 5k+ Followers Each Organically in 2 Months,Entrepreneur,"Instagram isn’t just an app for kids anymore, it has become one of the biggest social media platforms for businesses to grow their brand, interact with customers, and market to customers. In fact, there are over 500 million active monthly users and users share an average of 95 million photos and videos per day. If you don't have an Instagram page for your business today, you're missing out big time.

I run a Social Media Management Company and have managed to grow multiple clients' Instagram pages to 5k+ followers each without buying any likes or followers. These companies are now making significantly more sales! These are the strategies i've used to grow the accounts, so you guys can utilize the same things!


**Interact with customers in your target market (Like & Comment on Pictures/Follow Users)**

When just starting out, the best way to get people looking at your page is by interacting with theirs. Choose a hashtag, location relevant to your business, or the followers of one of your competitors and go through the pictures/users. While doing this, follow, like and comment on each one. Usually, the owner of the account will notice and click on your profile to see who you are (and hopefully follow you back). If you’re feeling extra ambitious, go to their profile and like the first three pictures, this will increase the likelihood of them checking out your account and returning the favor. Additionally, when you leave a genuine comment on a post, everyone who views that picture will be able to see it for a while until others comment, making your account visible to many more people.

For example, if you're selling skating clothes/accessories, go through popular skaters' followers and interact with everyone who comments on/likes his pictures/follows him.
 

 

**Strategically Use Hashtags**

Hashtags are definitely one of the most useful tools that businesses (and anyone else) can use to get new followers on Instagram. But there are much more to hashtags than the well-known strategies that people use to gain followers such as follow for follow hashtags (#instafollow, #l4l, #tagforlikes, #followback, etc.) and using popular hashtags, hashtags related to their pictures etc..
In order to get the most out of hashtags on any social media site you need to get inside the head of the users in your target market. Think about and research which hashtags your preferred audience are most likely to use. After you’ve gathered a list, start using these hashtags in the descriptions, or in the comments of your pictures. Additionally, you can use the strategies outlined in tip number one with these hashtags to further your engagement with these users.


 

**Abide by the Golden Rule of Social Media**

The golden rule of social media (The 80/20 rule) is as follows; 80% of your content should be either helpful, informative, entertaining or funny, while only 20% of your content should be focused on sales. If you don’t abide by this rule, your potential audience will feel that there is no reason to follow you, as you are just trying to shove sales down their throat. You need to create value for your audience and make them feel as if they’re gaining something from following you.



 

 

**Run a Contest**

This rule also goes along with creating value for your audience. Running an Instagram contest is one of the easiest ways to promote your business and gain exposure on Instagram, which in turn means more followers.
One classic way to run an Instagram contest is to give something away. You can give away anything, although ideally, it should be your service or product (or at least something to do with it). Then, in that same picture, you should ask the followers to both like the picture and tag their friends that would also be interested in the giveaway. Finally, pick one of the users who tagged their friends (make sure they follow you) to give away the item/service to.
Remember the red swimsuit from Sunny Co Clothing that flooded your Instagram feed for a couple days? That is a textbook example of how effective a well-ran Instagram contest can be. They said they would give away a free swimsuit to everyone who reposted their photo, and soon after the picture was on everyone’s social media feeds! They got so much publicity that they couldn’t even keep up with all of the orders, and now are a very recognizable brand.



 

 

**Use Instagram Influencers to promote your Instagram Account**

Instagram Influencers are anyone who influences the people in your audience. For example, Gary Vaynerchuk would be a great influencer for anyone targeting small business owners or entrepreneurs. While cross-promotion with Instagram influencers may not always be free, promoting your content on Influencers’ Instagram accounts is easily one of the fastest ways to earn Instagram followers. Sometimes you can also convince smaller brands to promote your business for free as long as you can promote theirs in return. DMs are your best friend!
Cross promotion isn’t the only way to utilize influencers. Turn on post notifications for your favorite influencers. If you interact with their posts quickly and consistently they will eventually notice you and you will quickly become one of their favorite accounts. This can have a plethora of benefits. You can also interact with influencers in your area’s followers, as they will most likely have the same interests.





 

**Never Forget to Tag Your Location**

Did you know that Instagram uploads with a location tag have a 79% higher engagement rate than those that don’t? Well you do now! I think that is reason enough to always include your location when posting a photo, no matter what it is!



 

 

**Promote Your Instagram on Your Website & Other Social Media**

Have a website or other social media pages? Perfect! make it known, both on your website and other social media pages, that you have an Instagram account and that people should follow you! Make sure to have your social media links in a very visible spot on your website, preferably in the top bar. Also make sure to post your Instagram link on any other social media platforms you’re on.

271,fkascy,False,Best Practices,167,Don't be the 20-year company that goes bankrupt after 2 weeks of bad times.,Entrepreneur,"After just two weeks of bad times (zero revenue), the family-owned company my friend worked for is going out of business.

Founded in 1998, my friend's employer is no longer a going-concern due to lack of liquidity.  Without going further into operations details, the demand for the company's service dried up following the travel bans and there was ZERO money set aside in a ""rainy day"" fund.  

As far as accounting details, the company had high total-liabilities that were just barely covered in normal times; however, the company consistently paid high salaries to the owners, was never late in paying on debt, and always provided a good service for its own customers.  Monthly total-liabilities is around $60K in a company with 9 workers total.  The owners believe that even if demand for the company's service returned to normal within 14 days (~30 days total without revenue), the company would still not be able to resurrect itself.

I've lent my friend some money to tide him over because I have plenty to spare and his family really needs it.  But please let this be a lesson to all future business-owners out there:  **a successful company that cannot withstand a one-month downturn is not a successful company at all.**  

I'd even argue that a company that does not survive a ""normal"" recession is not a successful company at all.

And combined we're doing over $2.5 million per year in revenue.  

And many of you know, I did it in a crazy transparent way right here on Reddit and completely bootstrapped with a couple hundred dollars in seed money.

Today I want to share the **website strategies** I use to improve conversions, but from the angle of a website visitor looking for a simple home cleaning.  

This is the **stuff that works**, regardless of the industry we're in! For some of you it's going to be so simple as to be a waste of time, but hopefully some folks get something out of this!


**How to turn more website visitors into customers!**

(Read time: ~15 minutes).

Grab your favorite puffy slippers and kick back! I’ll get right to it.

----
I love simple, predictable businesses, that require no magic or fancy technology. And those are the type of companies I continue to build.

----
**Backstory: Setting the Stage**  
So I wanted to attack this from the angle of a visitor to your website.  This visitor happens to be someone needing cleaning service (cause I’m sure you guys are tired of wetshaveclub stuff), but I promise you the stories are the same regardless of what you’re selling:   You have someone that is looking to solve a problem, you’re selling something that solves that problem, yet somehow your website gets in the way!  [Click to meet Rosa, and see the problems she's having booking service](http://imgur.com/a/YpXFJ)



**Strategy 1 for More Customers: Use more images**  
Here’s the thing, people rarely read a full paragraph online.  Even the most compelling news story is skimmed, and best believe people are skimming on your website as well. So we keep things as light on text as possible while setting the mood with images:
[Click to see a quick example of images we use](http://imgur.com/a/Y7UwV)

**Strategy 2 for More Customers:** **Use more videos**  
So this one will automatically set your website apart from about 90% of your competition.  Videos are super easy to make, and they completely raise the trust level on your website and engage the customer at a much deeper level than just having traditional text testimonials.  These could be short 30 second snippets like the one Rosa might see, or [longer form ones like we did for wet shave club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE30CfMxnak)

**Strategy 3 for more customers: Borrowing Credibility**
So this one is pretty straightforward but you’ll be surprised how many websites either miss this completely or hide these logos on inner pages that no one ever sees.  For us, if it does not happen on the homepage, it could as well not happen at all! We borrow credibility from other sites that have mentioned us that Rosa would immediately recognize, and this would increase our standing in her eyes right away.  Simple stuff but it works. [Click to see how we borrow credibility from bigger sites](http://i.imgur.com/2c6jWof.png) 

**Strategy 4 for more customers: Answer Objections**  
So far so good, and really we’re only a few seconds in real time as Rosa starts to take in our website.  She’s probably feeling okay at this point but there are still certain high level questions she has in our mind, that we’ll call “Objections!”  These are the same objections that sales people have to overcome in a sales call, except in this case we can overcome them in many cases with very simple markers like these: [Click to see how we use symbols and short text to overcome objections](http://i.imgur.com/XfcYyTP.png) 

**Strategy 5 for more customers: More human faces**  
As Rosa gets further and further down our website page, we’re looking for more ways to make deep connections.  One way we accomplish this is with human faces.  People connect with people. Not with pictures of mops and gloves or lawnmowers or whatever tools you use to deliver your service.  Think about it, when was the last time you felt a personal connection with a wet mop?
So we aim for at least 5 or 6 people that are super happy. [And that’s why we hit Rosa with images like this](http://i.imgur.com/xR73lPQ.png)  

**Strategy 6 for more customers: Start Checkout Above the fold**

Above the fold is just the area of your website that your visitor sees when they first get there and before they start to scroll.
It's usually your main image with text to show what your website is about. IMAGINE YOUR HOMEPAGE IS AN ICEBERG.  The only part of your website you can guarantee people will see is the part that's sticking out of the water.  Assume they're only going to see the top of that iceberg, and make sure you don't waste that opportunity to get them moving along your sales funnel.  For us, [we start the checkout process as soon as Rosa lands on the page.](http://i.imgur.com/4YpY0oP.png)

**Strategy 7 for more customers: Short One-Page Checkout** 
Have a checkout form where you asked the customer 9 questions when it could have just been 5? You just [cut your conversion rate](http://www.marketingexperiments.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/results.jpg) from 13% to 10% and increased your cost to acquire a customer by $2 . *The longer your form, the less money you make!* Keep things simple. 
For us, we do a simple, one-page checkout for every website and [keep things as simple as possible for Rosa](http://i.imgur.com/dQYdyP6.png). 

**Strategy 8 for more customers: Better design and customer experience**   
So the way I see it, building a business is like being in a boat race across the Atlantic. Fortunately, most of your competitors enter the race using a website that is akin to an ugly handmade dingy, with a few half-broken oars, and a ton of leaks that require them to stop every few minutes to scoop out water. Sad to say a lot of these folks won't make it.  We make sure not to create a website and make it just as shoddy as the ugly handmade dingys the competition use. I don't launch until I have a freaking speedboat. A Professionally designed, cohesively branded website, with good copy, and a simple process to convert visitors into buyers.
I want to make that race as unfair as possible.  

So while the competition is running something like this: http://rcmoving.com/  
I launch with this: http://backpackmoves.com/  
They don't have a cohesive brand? I create a solid appealing brand.
They don't have a video? I go get one.
They don't have online chat? I set up online chat. And on and on...

**Strategy 9 for more customers: External Reviews Brought on-Site**
So this is not unique to local services by any means.  Any big ecommerce store that can see data at this level knows of this phenomenon: 1) Customer comes to the site and wants to buy 2) Leaves the site to look for reviews and 3rd party feedback and 3) Comes back to buy (Or Not)!  Our goal here is to remove the need for them to leave for more research by providing the most pertinent 3rd party reviews right on site. [Here's what Rosa sees as she is shopping around the site.](http://i.imgur.com/RapSHh3.png)

**Strategy 10 for more customers: Upsells & Add-ons**
So this one is kind of a no-brainer, but we're looking to increase our average transaction size in any way we can. And one way is to upsell at checkout. Rosa, as she's checking out will have the opportunity to add extras and complementary services. [Click to see extras we offer Rosa at checkout.](http://i.imgur.com/Tzzq16n.png)

**Strategy 11 for more customers: Cart Abandonment and instant discounts in exchange for the sale**

Say someone starts to book service, enters their email or for some reason or not they don't complete the checkout.  Using Carthook we grab their email and automatically send them follow up emails to remind/incentivize them to complete the booking. This not only improves conversion rates but allows us to track the overall performance of our booking form to see how well it is working.  If you start filling out the form, you should finish...and carthook helps with that tracking and management.  [Click to see this in action](http://imgur.com/a/qitHm)

**Strategy 12 for more customers: Exit Monitors**

Emails peeps. Little messages that are the closest thing we have to free ATMs in the internet marketing world.  And these are ATMs that you go back to over and over and over again, insert some nice words with beautifully designed images, hit send...and wait.
If done right, sometimes in mere minutes, money flows out the machine!
-
There is no single better converting medium that a well-nurtured email list.
Nothing beats it.
Not search, not social media, not display ads. Nada.
And it's not even close.  [Click to see how we use exit monitors to grab customer emails just before they leave](http://i.imgur.com/rmyD6Mq.png).

**Strategy 13 for more customers: Refer a Friend**  
Another absolute no-brainer but this works like a charm.  Nothing beats a recommendation from a client so we set up a way for customers to get a credit off future service for each client they refer our way (the new client gets a discount as well).  [Here is the email we send out to get this moving.](http://i.imgur.com/oL21PDS.png) 

**Strategy 14 for more customers: Show other customer transactions**
This is a fairly new strategy we've seen on travelocity and other major ecommerce sites and we figured we would try it out.  And it works like a charm. It's basically a way for customers to see that OTHER customers are also buying stuff, and it gives folks more confidence to get moving.  [Here is what our friend Rosa would see.](http://i.imgur.com/oyAlKmO.png)

**Strategy 15 for more customers: Built in Recurring revenue**
We try to build a recurring component into every business.    Even if you're selling one-off items like cars, try to upsell a monthly service package of some sort to keep that relationship alive.  And one way to structure this is to give different commitment levels with higher discounts based on the lenght of the commitment.

So for example: A 1 year subscription is $19.99 per month, while a 3 months subscription is $24.99 per month.  This works beautifully, helps to increase conversion rates for longer commitments which in turn makes our cash-flow smoother and more predictable.
And of course if you can have your recurring transaction happen seamlessly or with one click, you’re way ahead of the game. [Here’s what Rosa sees when it’s time for her to book another service!](http://i.imgur.com/Dcj96oP.png)

**Wrapup**
So if this is executed properly it ends with a happy Rosa having more time for her friends because we delivered a seamless website experience.  [Everybody wins!](http://i.imgur.com/Zao21B6.png) 

So hopefully you guys see (and sorry if this was simplistic for some of the internet marketing gurus out there), that building a successful online business is far more than just throwing up a website and pulling up the brink trucks to collect the cash.  A great website is just the beginning, a lot of what we do to get over that hump happens with the tools and ideas I laid out here.

Good luck!!!

------END OF CASE STUDY!  
This wraps up the  case study but I wanted to add this section because I think it may be helpful for some of you guys as you are getting out the gate, and what would be one of my case studies without a rant? : -)

**FEAR IS MOSTLY A LIE**

And I say mostly because it's useful in some very specific scenarios. Being chased by lions in the plains of Africa, fear is a super helpful thing. It triggers adrenaline glands to make your body do some amazing things.  

Beyond situations like this though, and especially for new entrepreneurs fear is a lie. It's by and large a cognitive error that exists in our heads that essentially creates a fantastically negative story about all the bad things that happen if your business fails.  

But as someone who has gone through business failures before, here's what really happens: Nothing.  

Like Kevin says, fear of a business failing is like being afraid of the dark. There's nothing there.  

**So what do I do after I try something and it doesn't work?**  
I wrap things up, go catch a movie or something, and by the next day I'm thinking about what's the next thing. Because in reality, in the big scheme of things none of this matters.
The earth will still take a year to revolve around the sun, the tides will still come in and go out, and the next business opportunity will still be there waiting to be attacked.
I can hear some folks say ""well I don't have much money so I'm afraid of trying something and losing the money"". Meh. If you start businesses like we do, you're never in more than a few hundred to a few thousand dollars to start something. We build businesses that heavily weighted towards success being determined by time/effort not some huge wad of cash.

**And so what if you lose a bit of money building something and failed.**
Many of you dropped $50K -$100K on college without blinking an eyelid, and came out not having the first idea how to actually earn a living that is not dependent on having a boss. But somehow the idea of $2K to start your own business with a chance to fully control your lives and the thought of losing that is crippling.  
**Makes zero sense.**  
You probably paid $2k to comcast in the past 6 months anyhow. lol
By the way, the reality of business building for me wasn't launch a business and win! It was more, launch, fail, launch, fail, launch, fail, win, win, win. What happened with all of those failures? I got better, accumulated a host of experience, learned a lot and now wins come a lot easier. So for $2k I end up learning a shit ton more than I learned in 4 years and $50K at college.
And that's the win. 
**Launching a business is the cheapest MBA you'll ever get!**   

So at the end of the day, look to launch, get failures out of the way, learn, and get to winning. The real world is where it's at. With folks like myself and Kevin Pereira and others here that have gone through this so many times, and are open to share, you get to reduce the chances of failure (embrace that), but you have to get closer to the not giving a fuck attitude we have, and enjoy the experience for what it is.

And and yes, I'm wrapping it up with Kanye once again!

122,831ilr,False,Case Study,225,"I started a candle business as a side hustle with $50 that now makes $1000/month. It's early, and slow, but it's building.",Entrepreneur,"I know I don't have much to bring to the table yet as I am still growing this business but I thought this would be a good post for those always asking about home businesses or a side hustles all while still working a full time job. My daughter and I started this business two years ago and it is now bringing in around $1000 a month and still growing. 

A thousand dollars may not compete with some of the ""we made it"" posts that get added here but for most people asking questions about how to get started this might motivate a few to start. 
I also want to point out that my subscribers, followers, sales, that I am about to list are not high by any means. I hope this doesn't discourage anyone as well but help you understand that even with these small numbers we are making what many would consider a nice monthly side income to help out. 

**This turned out really long, I am sorry and I hope this is useful**

**The genesis**
This all started when we stayed at a hotel in Seattle a few years back and my eleven year old daughter and her cousin kept running to the bathroom to use a sugar scrub that was placed on the sinks. 
They must of used it at least a dozens times a day and as we left she asked to buy some. Once she purchased this small 1oz scrub for $7 I started to look at the product itself and the costs that went into it and mentioned ""we could make this at home"". 
She got excited and asked repeatedly over the next couple of weeks to make it, and then asked if it would be something we could sell. I looked sugar scrubs up online, found a couple facebook groups dedicated to this stuff and asked a few questions to get an idea of what I was looking at. Once we had a recipe we wanted to try we ran out and bought supplies, sugar, oils, jars, labels, all totaling about $50.
We spent that night putting them all together, mixing, labeling, wrapping up so that I could take them to work the next day. I work in a building that has a lot of women who love this type of stuff and they're constantly bringing in their own handmade items such as quilts, sewing projects, baked goods, etc for others to look at and purchase.
I grabbed all the jars the next morning and as I left my wife said ""You really think you're going to make money off those?"" 
I sold half the jars I took to work that first day for $97 to which my wife said as I got home ""No shit, you actually made that much from those?!""

**Creating the product**
Once I got home that night I told my daughter that I think we have something here and we should make them nicer next time. I spent the next few nights searching wholesalers, suppliers, amazon, you name it, for cheaper jars, bulk sugar, oils, labels and started ordering. I found a nice plastic jar we could package them in, some labels, cheaper oils and sugars and we got to work on the labels ourselves. 
We spent maybe another $100 on everything and had a sugar scrub that we liked, jar, label, product. 

**Selling the product**
I started selling to family and coworkers first, I think most people start there. I will say that I am lucky with work and some small sales. I work in a building that has a few thousand people and it's easy to show alot of people. Don't get me wrong this is not a gold mine, it brings me around $100-$200 a month from regulars and new. I don't want to discourage anyone reading this thinking that I jumped into a work goldmine.
Once I had products at work I started to walk around our town, which is a little tourist trap in spots, and shopped our sugar scrubs. I also posted in the local facebook town group and asked if anyone would be interested in selling our scrubs in their shops and had one lady say she would love too. About a month later she said that she hadn't sold a single one, even though I had a friend tell me she walked in and bought one from her. She never put them out on her shelves so I told her I would just come pick them up and thanked her for giving us a shot. 
I did this for a month or two, work, facebook, family and then finally started to wander around town for a place to set up a table display. I tried to think of some parks, town squares, anything that would have a lot of people walking through and everything took a city license to set up. Finally I drove past a local Whole Foods style grocery store and said fuck it, I'm asking these guys if I can set up and without hesitation they said yes. 
That first table set up should of been embarrassing but I didn't give a damn, I set up anyway and sold almost every single scrub I had and even the ones from the shop that said she couldn't sell them. I am normally a very quiet person out in public and don't often initiate random conversations with strangers but I hit up every single customer that walked in with a big smile and said ""All natural sugar scrubs today if you'd like to test them"" 
We made a little over $300 that day! 

From there I started to ask them every Saturday if I could set up again and they said ""Absolutely"" I was there every Saturday for about two months straight when one of the managers came to me and said they wanted to carry our products in store. During this time we also started to add some more products to our table. We made some body butters, lip scrubs, pretty much anything my daughter wanted to try out. 
My wife finally said ""If you're going to make things will you make me some candles, I hate spending so much for them."" Over the next couple of weeks we added candles to our table and made about $400. The first day I set them out we sold every single one. 

**Expanding our business**
This is where we are now, we have some of our products narrowed down and are now solid sellers, candles being the top one. For the last year we have been doing anything we can to get our products seen and anything to make sales. I sell them on our website, still at work, random friends on facebook, facebook sale groups, a few new small shops locally, and two in other states. 
I started to send our candles to anyone that had a following on instagram and found a couple of influencers with a decent following, anything to get them seen and grab new followers to the instagram profile. 


**Growing pains and mistakes**
From the top of the article, my first mistake was doing consignment with that shop that didn't sell a single scrub. I said no problem to this agreement in the beginning because we were small and I didn't have leverage to say no. Lesson learned. She actually did sell a couple scrubs, I know this for fact because a personal friend bought one. I gladly took my product and moved on. Consignment can be fine for some but if you do so you will have to keep track with your inventory, their inventory and you will even have to promote your own product for them as they really stand nothing to gain from selling your product like they would if they bought it from you at wholesale. 

Influencers is where I messed up next. I started to send my products to people with influence and didn't have a clear idea of what I was doing and no way to keep up with demand and offers since we were just starting. 
I reached out to a team member of Garyvee's that I followed at the time to see if she would take a look at our product and give us some feedback. She received our package and then asked if we would want to be one of Gary's sponsors for his weekly email he sent out back then. Gary's old email, and some still do, contain a sponsor at the bottom that offers free products or a nice discount for one of their products. I thanked her and another member that sets this up but had to say no because there was just no way I could meet this demand or even cover the cost for shipping 150 of anything for free. Huge miss. 

The next influencer I sent the candles too was a hit but it was a selfish send on my part. I noticed she used a lot of candles and asked her if we could send her some of our candles to try out. She loved them and said thank you but didn't post about them. After watching Garyvee for so long I wasn't disappointed, I knew that I didn't do anything too special to get a nice tag or feature. It wasn't until after I sent them that I realized there was nothing special about what I sent her, just a random product thinking she would use her giant platform for my gain. Very selfish without realizing it. 
A couple days later I finally pulled my head out of my ass and customized the candles for her. I had been following her for a while so I knew her colors, her styles, her likes and made a set of candles with a logo that featured her brand and made my logo very small in the corner of the label, she loved them! 
She promoted them on her profile, talked about them on her live stream and even used one as a giveaway item. I have sent her a few new version now and honestly I have not been sending her enough candles, I need to double down on this one! 
TheSkinnyConfidential has been nice enough to feature us many times now and I could not be more grateful. 

Not buying what I need, when I need it. Once I knew which products were selling well and I was making consistently, I should of bought items to help make this process more efficient. Soap molds instead of pans then cutting bars individually, jars, lids, commercial equipment, anything to help speed up production. 
I have gone months in some instances before I nutted up and bought something that would of saved me countless hours of time and made me money quicker because of cost and fear. 
When you know you have demand for something you know you will use such as a larger mixer, premade labels, more jars, back stock oils, whatever, buy it! 

Facebook ads is another growing pain. I am still learning this one and not gaining much traction but I see results in other ways. I have been playing with them for about a year now and I am starting to see what's working and what's not. I have spent about $500 so far but I have not gained one sale from that $500. I have picked up some subscribers but no sales that I can tie directly to the ads whatsoever. I am also not spending enough per ad to really grab the best clients I imagine. I only spend at most $20-$30 per ad just to test audiences and creative. 

**Learning patience and unknown blessings in going slow**
I always wish I had an extra $10,000 only to be thankful a few months later that I didn't have it. 
What I mean by this is every time I have said to myself ""If I only had X amount I would buy so much of X right now"". I can think of a thousand things I need at this moment to make this go faster but I have to remind myself that I am still in the beginning stages of this still and I am still learning. 
Not having that amount I would spend far less, something like $30 on new packaging that I wanted to order a thousand off, praising the patience Gods later because it turned out to no the right one, right size, right color, etc and only being out that $30 and not thousands. 
I am the type to go full force without thinking or testing properly and I have made several packaging mistakes that thankfully have only added up to very small amounts. I would of wasted thousands if I would of had it at the time. Throwing away $30 in product because I was impatient is easier to swallow than $3000. 

**Successes** 
One of our successes has been starting a youtube channel doing howto's on everything we do. I noticed that when I was learning how to make candles the videos on youtube were pretty bad and didn't include alot of pretty valuable information that a beginner should know. The top video in candle making even says in the video ""I won't show you exactly how I make these because I don't want you cutting into my sale"" 
I told my daughter ""we can make a better video than that!"" So we did! 
We are now at 3000 subscribers and that how to make candles video just hit 100,000 views! We could not be happier about that. 

Last year we missed out on all of the local farmers markets just because we started too late to sign up. This year I jumped fast and I have the licenses needed and I am signed up for all the big ones. This year should be very nice for our business.

183,9spios,False,,192,The slow and boring way that I get FB ads to work well,Entrepreneur,"I 'audit' a lot of FB ads accounts, that means I get to see what is and isn’t working, and also spot patterns in terms of common mistakes made.

&#x200B;

One of the least sexy bits of advertising is testing - but it’s also pretty much the sure-fire road to consistent improvement.

&#x200B;

One of my very first clients initially signed up with me just to ‘freshen up the ads’ - they ran their ads in-house, but fancied getting an expert opinion on how they could step them up a notch.

&#x200B;

In the 1 month I had access to their account - I set up a bunch of tests, and when I came back into the account, this time long-term, I could see the result. 

In one of the campaigns, the single test I made (using Lead forms instead of a conversion ad) had brought in an extra £4200 from a £25 per day ad spend.

That was without long-term optimisation, and just with one test. It's worth doing.

&#x200B;

Here are the 9 most common mistakes I’ve seen businesses make when it comes to testing, and then tips on how I would recommend you should be testing.

***Most common mistakes made:***

* **Not testing - just putting stuff out there and leaving it.**

Clearly, if you never test stuff, you’re never going to improve your results-  this typically comes down to business owners just not having time, but even big clients - such as an influencer brand I worked with who were spending £200+ a day, are guilty of this.

* **Not being systematic - throwing out loads of different stuff and then not knowing how to analyse it or what to do with the info.**

No better than not testing really - a scattergun approach might get a win or two, but if you don’t understand why or how you did it, then you can’t replicate the win - An e-commerce store owner had this problem, he would get great results from one campaign out of every 10, and never know which one it would be.

*  **Sending the traffic somewhere useless anyway - i.e. optimising for lower link clicks, but then sending people to your homepage.**

I’ve seen people optimise their ads endlessly, but continue to send them to a boring, unfocussed landing page - I even audited a charity who’s ads were being run by an agency doing this, they were getting nice low numbers for their reports, and then blaming the lack on conversions on the charity’s follow up team.  


* **Not testing towards the final objective.**

Conversion ads are really powerful, but people often stick with traffic ads, focussing on Click-through-rates rather than opt-ins or sales.  


* **Running tests at the ad level, not the ad set level**

I don’t know why, but gyms seem very culpable to this mistake - they whack a whole bunch of different ad images at the ad level, but the way that FB chooses a winner is flawed, and you end up with one or two images getting all the impressions, and other’s seemingly ignored.  


* **Using a saved audience, and sticking with it.**

I audited an SEO company’s ads - they had a clear picture of their avatar, and created a saved audience of interests that were all business/marketing/SEO related. All their ads went to this same audience, and it meant that they had no idea which of those interests actually worked best.

&#x200B;

* **Not testing a content-first funnel.**

A lot of B2B clients were guilty of this, going straight for a consult call rather than using content at the 'Top Of Funnel’ to build a relationship first.

&#x200B;

* **Short-term thinking - testing is the slow, boring route to guaranteed success**

I had an e-commerce client for a good few months, but every time we starting making any progress in terms of optimisation - he would want to throw a big sale out there, or try a whole new product range - and it killed all progress we were making. Don’t rely on discounts, and don’t expect to have it all ticking over perfectly after 2 weeks.  


*  **Testing stuff, but not turning off the worst performers.**

This is a weirdly common thing, and a driving instructor training business was very guilty of this - they would set up a bunch of different ad sets with different variables in, but then leave them all running for the duration of the camapaign. This defeats the whole purpose.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Tips***

* When you are starting from fresh, I recommend starting with 'best practice’ as much as you can, and running an initial 2v2v2 creative test -This is 8 ad sets, with 2 variations of headline, ad copy, and visual being tested.Set them all up, then start killing off the worst performers one by one after an initial 48 hour period.When you’ve done that, you have a winner, and can continue to test as below.  

   * Headline 1 - Immediate benefit
   * Headline 2 - Deeper benefit
   * Copy 1 - Short - Who, What, Why, CTA
   * Copy 2 - Long  - Add testimonial.
   * Visual 1 - Image of the product/service
   * Visual 2 - Image of your target audience  

      * Adset 1: H1C1V1
      * Adset 2: H1C2V1
      * Adset 3: H2C1V1
      * Adset 4: H2C2V1
      * Adset 5: H1C1V2
      * Adset 6: H1C2V2
      * Adset 7: H2C1V2
      * Adset 8: H2C2V2
   * Choose a winner from those 8, then proceed down the list, one at a time.  

* Test the things that make the biggest impact first
   * The visuals:
      * video VS image VS slideshow VS carousel
      * image type  

   * The headline
      * Question vs feature vs benefit
      * Short vs long
      * Positive vs negative  

   * The Offer  

   * The body copy
      * Long vs short
      * With/without testimonial
      * With/without scarcity
      * With/without CTA  

   * The targeting
      * Different Interests
      * Different custom audiences
      * Different lookalikes  

   * A landing page VS a Lead Form  

   * Different objectives (traffic vs conversion vs engagement)  

* Always test at the ad set level.  

* Know what metrics to focus on
   * Primary objective - i.e. cost per sale/lead/sign up
   * Then look at CTR & CPM, if your lead cost is too high to get good data.  

* Give the ads 48 hours first before making ANY changes (unless you spot an error, or it is massively clear that one variable is utterly shit)  

* If you have a short timeframe - then start with lots of variables at a high budget, and remove them in quick succession. For example, if you have a £400 budget, and only a week to run the ads - then start with 8 ad sets, with each one set to £20 a day.  This sounds stupid, because £20 a day X 8 ad sets X 7 days = £1120. But what you do is wait for an initial 36/48 hours, then aggressively kill off each worst performer, leaving you with just the best one or two pretty early on.

Does that make sense? It's not exciting, but it does work.

28,349uat,False,,296,Elon Musk’s first wife explains what it takes to become a billionaire,Entrepreneur,"I found Justine Musk's comments to be spot on.

""Justine Musk, first wife of billionaire Elon Musk, knows a thing or two about wealth and hard work — her ex-husband is a founder of PayPal, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, and has an estimated net worth of $12.1 billion. 

She recently posted a response to a Quora thread asking the question “Will I become a billionaire if I am determined to be one and put in all the necessary work required?”

Her answer is “no,” though she says that the Quora reader is asking the wrong question altogether. 

“You’re determined. So what? You haven’t been racing naked through shark-infested waters yet,” she writes. “Will you be just as determined when you wash up on some deserted island, disoriented and bloody and ragged and beaten and staring into the horizon with no sign of rescue?”

She then offers some advice: 

“Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs. Ask yourself what you have the potential to offer that is so unique and compelling and helpful that no computer could replace you, no one could outsource you, no one could steal your product and make it better and then club you into oblivion (not literally). Then develop that potential. Choose one thing and become a master of it.  Choose a second thing and become a master of that.  When you become a master of two worlds (say, engineering and business), you can bring them together in a way that will a) introduce hot ideas to each other, so they can have idea sex and make idea babies that no one has seen before and b) create a competitive advantage because you can move between worlds, speak both languages, connect the tribes, mash the elements to spark fresh creative insight until you wake up with the epiphany that changes your life.

The world doesn’t throw a billion dollars at a person because the person wants it or works so hard they feel they deserve it. (The world does not care what you want or deserve.)  The world gives you money in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value: something that transforms an aspect of the culture, reworks a familiar story or introduces a new one, alters the way people think about the category and make use of it in daily life. There is no roadmap, no blueprint for this; a lot of people will give you a lot of advice, and most of it will be bad, and a lot of it will be good and sound but you’ll have to figure out how it doesn’t apply to you because you’re coming from an unexpected angle. And you’ll be doing it alone, until you develop the charisma and credibility to attract the talent you need to come with you.
Have courage. (You will need it.)

And good luck.  (You’ll need that too.)”

998,71ajjb,False,,310,"To the guy posting about the ""Gender Divide"" in entrepreneurship",Entrepreneur,"You deleted your post before I had a chance to reply, but your angry venting could have sparked a pretty good conversation, so that's a shame.  Your attitude could be summed up by saying, in short, ""Why are women rewarded (by their peers) so much more for starting their own businesses, when men are doing it every day?"" 

Imagine, for a second, that you're a woman starting her own business.

Almost all of the ""experts"" that tell you what to do are men. Your lending officer is a man. Your vendors are all men. Your landlord is a man. Most of the contractors you hire are men, most of your big accounts are led by men, and the other business owners in your industry are mostly men.

It's telling that your example of a male-owned business is something like contracting and then you shift to crafts and baking when you talk about women. That's your mental model of female entrepreneurship, but you've narrowed your expectations down so much that you fail to see the tens of thousands of women that actively break from that mold. 

What about the insular circle-jerking that happens on THIS SUB and on /r/startups? That's mostly men doing exactly what you accused all these moms of doing - telling poor business-people that they're doing great and they are working hard / are valued. The same behavior that you criticize in women (and associate with their gender) is happening all around you, but that's just men engaged in the startup grind, right? So it's fine.

There are plenty of women, at least in my circles, that struggle against gender imbalance in industries like sales, software development, and manufacturing and are quite successful. They work just as hard as men, if not harder - because they also have to deal with people like you that assume they took the ""easy road"" because of their gender, despite all the evidence to the contrary.

I wish you hadn't deleted your post.  I think this is the kind of meta-discussion that would be really useful on this sub.  If you look through comments on most posts here, people automatically assume that every single poster is a male despite no evidence either way, and that's pretty telling of the way entrepreneurship is viewed by most people, not just you.

884,35rmsa,False,,185,hit the top post all time on r/freelance - thought I'd share here... I charge 30k-60k for WordPress websites with a simple marketing plan.. How I do it inside (text post),Entrepreneur,"I tend to piss off people in here when I suggest they're under charging in the order of 10x less for their work... but here's the truth you simply selling your services wrong.

(that kind of read like the 'doctors hate him' headline.. haha)

Anyways - happy to share any insights on my process, here it is in a nutshell...

1) I only sell to clients who I know can invest at least 30k in marketing. How do you find them? Yellowpages half to full page ads cost around 5k to 20k depending on the city, their's your target client list.

2) how do I get their attention? I simply send them a letter, hand written, with a little trash can and ask them if they feel like their investment in the Yellowpages ad feels like their throwing cash into a trash can? Then I share my client results and ask them if they'd like to have a discussion about how they could revamp their marketing strategy...

3) most businesses don't have a good online marketing strategy, so I ""sell"" that, I don't sell a website - though that is exactly what I'm delivering.

4) I don't let them decide what should be on the site, I control the whole process and ask them to trust me. (cuts down on revisions quite a bit)

5) I keep the sales process in my control, basically play hard to get and play the chess game clients generally control. It's all about keeping the sales discussion in your court, generally I don't even do phone calls because it's easier to control the conversation via email. Keep it super chill and personable, treat them as an equal not a boss. BTW I'm an introvert, I hate going out and doing sales and all the traditional sales stuff that goes along with it, I keep it super chill and just keep the convo focused on results.

6) I give a discount for paying in full upfront (20%) - this saves time and pressures the client to get me content quickly, if they don't get me content? I'll write it myself - or hire a writer for $10/hr on Odesk.com

7) My Design Process: I usually build everything myself if I have the time (i really enjoy making websites) - the main point is to make the design process focused, again, on results for the customer... Sliders in the header on the home page are cool, but they don't help sales... Contact pages don't generate sales, about pages don't generate sales - I get as much of the sales material on the home page (or a specific service page) as possible, I build the credibility of the client on those pages as well (not the about page where most people try to do this) I don't have contact pages, I have lead capture pages with a ebook/video/mindmap that the customers customer can opt in to get, then my customer can follow up via email (or retargeting) with them.

FAQ-A

I've been in business for 3 years and I've done about 500k in sales and 21m in (revenue) sales for my customers - I'd ballpark around 8m in profits.

I'm 27 years old grew up in ohio, now live in san diego

Most my clients are in the business software space, some are in the information training (info product) space.

I generally don't charge a percentage of sales - though I regret that - I could probably stop doing client work if I would have tired in even a small percentage on all my sales.

Simple things you can do now..

- don't talk tech in the sales process, they don't care.. they just care about results
- try and gauge a demanding client in the first meeting, if they're talking specific colors and 'details' that you know don't actually matter, just run away from that client before they turn into a crapy client
- if you don't have ANY sales yet, partner with an SEO or PPC company, use their results as the base of your selling platform, split the sale with that company and tie their services into yours (if you sell web design services)
- always talk results in sales ""Here's where you could increase sales 20%, by just having a landing page where you capture leads!"" things like that
- again, only sell to companies that can afford the price range you want, but don't go larger or corporate (too much red tape and too many chefs in the kitchen)

most importantly - deliver on your promises, if you don't think you can help a company - don't accept them as a client.

Hope that helps!

edit: smore tips (yum) - and other items from the comments area

--- **How to get clients on Facebook (without being a creep)** ---

If I find a company that I think qualifies I don't always jump right in and send that info, usually I'll add the owner on Facebook - 9/10 I'll get added, I use my Facebook almost entirely for business.
I like to post content that helps business owners grow their business online, lots of times the owners of these businesses (potential clients) will interact with that content... and here's where magic can happen
1 - i'll message them and let them know I added them because I too am a local business owner and always love to connect with people locally who are doing awesome in business
2 - i always talk about their business in that convo, i might mention mine, but I don't play the ""i ask you something so i can talk for an hour about my business' card, I just keep asking questions about them
3- if you message people on FB, Facebook priorities you in THEIR newsfeed, so they will see MORE of your posts.
4- if it's someone i REALLY want as a client i'll set them as a 'close friend' so i can get notifications when they post, and when its appropriate (i.e. not like super personal) I'll leave a chill comment or just drop a like
people associate Facebook with friends, if you become their friend they're going to be wiling to have a business conversation with you. I've never NOT been able to close a deal this way (double negative hah)

http://www.reddit.com/r/freelance/comments/35lpsc/i_charge_30k60k_for_wordpress_websites_with_a/cr61xr8 

ps. stated below but - I only work with customers who's products I would purchase myself - I don't sell in the health, make money online, MLM, fitness, or dating niches... I stick to ""business growth"" products, products that people can use to grow their businesses, just makes the ethics of it all a lot easier to manage.

-- **Do you not use client input? That's kinda cocky!** --

They have input - but the input is what results they'd like to get through marketing online...
I don't start without approval of course - but if they don't trust me, why would I want them as a client? I don't want to be micro managed, and MOST clients have zero clue of what actually works in online marketing...
Sure i'm flexible, they don't love the image I picked for something? Happy to change it..
Generally my response to a revision is, ok - happy to test that, the reason I chose that element was you see XYZ results increased.
Yes - you do need to know what works to increase sales on a website, and yes you should LISTEN intently to your client, make sure they feel understood... but it doesnt make them right. (it's like dating someone haha)

-- **How I Deal with Client Input That I Think Is ... Stupid...** --

I see it this way - I know next to zero about how lawyers do their business, yes I will give them input on things when I need legal advice, but I'm always going to defer to their judgement, because i KNOW they know what's best and my research or guess on what might work is just that, a guess.
I expect the same professional courtesy from my clients, and not one has been pissed off or mad at me because I told them I respect their idea but ""here's why they're wrong in my experience"". I usually end that kind of conversation with 'we can try it, but I'm going to test it because I'm invested in you seeing results from this site', clients love it when you test their ideas...
It actually pisses me off when I read 'clientsfromhell.net' because yes - clients can be stupid - but we let them be stupid, there IS a fine line between confident and cocky, but you're doing a disservice to a client if you don't do what you know is right. It's also why I charge up front - I don't feel like I HAVE to bend to their will to get paid, my incentive is to get an amazing case study of a site that rocks and a client that is super profitable so that I can share it with my next lead.
edit: specific example - a client wanted to change a headline on their site (one that I knew generated leads at around 45%)... they basically demanded i change it to include that 'they had been in business for 25 years' (which i had further down the page) sounds like a good thing to add, but it cut conversions by 20% - because yes, its important information, basically a trust element, BUT it was about the business not about the benefit to the customers... and customers only care about themselves (marketing 101)
i shared the stats with him, he laughed and said ""I guess i should have trusted you!"" and he never quested my judgement again.
how do i know what works? I test too - for 30k i'm giving them a site, and it may just be one page... but I'm also making sure it converts to leads and sales for them

-- **How to Manage Realistic Results and Still Use Result Based Selling** --

It's really important that you don't exaggerate results. You'll find that clear expectations lead to happier long term relationships with clients (just like dating i suppose haha)...
I track my other clients with google analtyics and tools like infusionsoft (or improvly) i usually have a really good gut when it comes to what a new lead can expect, but I generally will just show them what I did for another client and the results they experienced.
I make a proposal usually that breaks down what CAN work and what might not work in their specific business. I'm not terribly vague, but you can't say YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE 50K IN THE NEXT 6 WEEKS! You have to express that - if you see similar results to my past clients, implementing these systems you could see growth of XX sales over the next six months if we hit these key metrics... Saying basically the same thing without getting non FTC compliant (with income claims).
Bottom line - show case studies of past clients, compare to what your new lead could do
Edit: VERY IMPORTANT - do your best to get as much data about your lead as possible, current sales - project sales, how many leads it takes to get a sale on avg, how much a lead is worth - stuff like that... IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU CAN GROW THEIR BUSINESS DONT WORK WITH THEM - that was a huge lesson i learned early on

-- **How to sell to clients that ""just want a brochure website"" aka - they just want a site with their mission statement and about / contact pages (sites that don't do jack for sales)** ---

Your leads that simply want an online presence - you need to go Don Draper on them and ask some hard questions... --- ""Do you REALLY just want an online presence? In my experience (and looking at your competition) an online presence is just going to turn into a grave yard of corporate brochure content. What if we build out a simple site that's goal is to generate MORE leads for your business? Could you use more leads?""
Ok that's a little over the top but you get the idea. Sell Insights Not Solutions - (google the book) - you need to teach the client what they really needs, that's what consulting is anyways. They can buy an off the shelf corporate website off oDesk for $500 these days, don't sell those because you'll just have a portfolio of 'grave-sites' (just made that up i think I'm going to totally use that in my marketing haha)
results model is all about working with clients you know you can grow - because then you can charge more, and more importantly FOCUS more on their results.

side note.. just don't sell to these clients that 'don't get it'

--- **Im introverted, I want to focus on what I like 'building stuff'! How can I use this if I hate sales?**

Small bit of advice - if selling isn't your skill set, don't FORCE yourself to do it, it can take years to get really good at sales.... A quick shortcut, find a friend with a Type-A personality who loves to talk, teach them how to sell the benefits of your services (heck just print out this post and say 'do this') - then have them do the sales part and give him/her a cut (maybe 20%). Point is, you are a business owner not just a freelancer, outsource your weaknesses - leverage those around you and make everyone better. I LOVE design, i'm technically an introverted person (I get warn out doing this honestly hah) but I forced myself to do it... I could have saved a lot of time just getting someone who is naturally a people person to do this. #noregrets heh 

I'll try and keep this post updated with things that work as I learn them

- Built up an FB page to **181k followers**, Instagram to **63k followers**.
- He **quit his job** as an air traffic controller to focus on the business.
- Built an audience first, then built a business around it.

496,5qbm59,False,,92,"Posted here 8 months ago when I hit $1k/month in revenue. Just hit $10k/m, still don't know what I'm doing. Some random thoughts",Entrepreneur,"Background: about 8 months ago I launched codefree.co, an education platform teaching non-technical people how to build MVPs without coding  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4jteq3/built_an_education_platform_to_teach_noncoders/

Flash forward to today, and it's been a wild ride. I always thought if I hit $10k a month I'd have everything figured out, and from a lot of ""what I've learned"" posts I get that feeling that anyone with a 6-figure business must be just way smarter than me. So it's kinda refreshing that there's still a lot I don't know about:

“When I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth.” ― Kurt Vonnegut

- Marketing: change the crayon to a laptop, and this is how I feel. I've probably wasted the most time on marketing, trying to figure things out that have little to no ROI. Most of my traffic today comes from Google. I think the reason I'm ranked so high for searches like ""code a startup"" or ""startup coding"" is because 1) the name of the site is Code-Free Startup and 2) I launched on Product Hunt and Google seems to like them. Through free signups on the site, my email list is probably the thing I spend the most time worrying about. Once you get a few thousand people on a Mailchimp list, there's this weird pressure that comes out of nowhere. ""oh my god it's been 2 weeks and I haven't sent an email to them, they all must hate me."" I've been working on fixing this by creating automated email campaigns with Drip + leadpages. Also, paid advertising scares me, so I dont do that yet. 

- Product: this has been the most fun for me. I have a section on the site where students can submit + upvote what kind of startups they want to build (ex. I want to build a marketplace like Airbnb, dating app like Tinder, etc). Once an idea gets a few hundred upvotes, I go to work trying to build that app and then once it's figured out, record the learning process. In 8 months I've released 7 courses and recorded around 102 videos, each around 15-20 minutes long. That number blows my mind, and I think it's an undervalued benefit of starting a company: writer's block/creative block just disappears once you have paid customers. And it didn't matter whether I had 2 or 200 paying customers, I still felt the need to deliver on the promise of the company. So I guess a takeaway is to get one paid customer, build for them and you'll end up building a lot more. 

- What to do now: it's a weird spot to be in where you're comfortable running a business and the urgency isn't what it was when my bank account was hitting embarrassingly low numbers. There's still that subconscious feeling of ""oh no what happens if this business explodes tomorrow"" but for the most part, things are good. My goal this year is to continue to grow the business at a comfortable pace. I find myself constantly referencing Paul Jarvis' article on growth (https://pjrvs.com/a/growth) to keep myself balanced. Especially living in San Francisco, there's a crazy energy around growth at all costs, even if it means deferring your happiness for 4-6 years until you get acquired by Google. A lot of people pop out on the other side of that trade-off and life isn't exactly as rosy as they expected. There are a lot of unhappy people driving Teslas in Silicon Valley. On the other extreme is the 4HWW crowd. They automate their business, head off to a beach somewhere in South America and expect all their problems to melt away. Then the loneliness and lack of purpose kick in. So instead of either path, I'm just going to keep shuffling along trying to build things that I enjoy building and learning the stuff I don't know yet.

401,bwoot5,False,Lessons Learned,148,How I Spent 5 Days Tracking Down My Company's Stolen Truck,Entrepreneur,"I own a national moving company chain and I find that the farther a location is from you the harder things are to manage and when some goofball takes it upon their self to **take a proverbial dump on your week**. Sometimes there's no choice but to fly in and take care of business.  Justice knows no distance. 

&#x200B;

**Story**

At the end of 2018 I fired an employee for not showing up to work at an out of state location we'll call him ""James"" (mostly because that is his name). A day later James seized an opportunity, an opportunity I would forever remember. He saw another employee cleaning out the back of the truck and decided to hop in the cab and drive off with a company vehicle. 

&#x200B;

I get a call that the truck has been stolen by James. I then call the police to file a stolen vehicle report to which they tell me I cannot file it because James has previously had access to the vehicle so there's nothing they can do over the phone. This seems like complete nonsense to me I've watched two episodes of First 48 before and know time is of the essence. I catch the earliest flight to the location, head to the station, and convince officers for 2 hours to allow me to file this report. 

&#x200B;

**Now the hunt begins...**

&#x200B;

I'm now talking to everyone who has ever come in contact with the perp.. Co-workers, friends, baby mamas mamas, everyone. I find out Jame's likes to hangout at a local laundromat (yes, this is real and no this is not 1965). So I head straight to the laundromat and check out the area. I spend a few hours staking out the place until.. James actually shows up! I hop out of the car and attempt to this misguided fella to which he gets scared and speeds off. I lose him and spend the rest of the day driving around on side streets and looking for potential hiding places. You wouldn't believe how many white box trucks there are once you start looking for them.

&#x200B;

**The next morning I get at call that someone has spotted James!** This person told me he saw James driving the truck, arm out the window, waving at them... and guess where! at the laundromat. This guy just can't get enough of the laundromat. I'm just glad that the truck is still in one piece.

&#x200B;

After talking to a few more locals I have a couple locations where I'm told someone could park a truck to hide it. I drive from place to place and on the last one I spot something. 

&#x200B;

A bottle of pee. 

&#x200B;

But next to the bottle of pee is a box of tape that is clearly from one of my trucks

&#x200B;

This tells me two things:

1. The truck has been here
2. The perp doesn't know about indoor plumping yet

&#x200B;

**From here the trail has gone a bit stale**

I get a hotel for the night, head back out, find and chase James' brother, lose him, call it a night. All in all pretty average Thursday. 5/7 would do it again.

&#x200B;

The next morning I draw a poor artist rendition of James and do some recon work on foot. I go up to anyone who looks like they have secrets and ask if they've seen James. No one has. I tape my drawing to a pole and chalk that one up as a loss.

&#x200B;

I tell everyone I come across that if they give me any information that leads to the recovery of my truck I will give them $100, including the man with eyes on the city, the man everyone knows and loves.. The sign spinner on the corner by the laundromat. 

&#x200B;

The next night I'm staking out the laundromat again when the realization dawns on me that you know I've been goofing on James a lot for hanging out at a laundromat but here I am.. hanging out at a laundromat. I may be dealing with a criminal mastermind here. 

&#x200B;

**I've now been searching for this truck for 4 days and need to head back home**

&#x200B;

I fly home and I get a text that someone has found my truck. He sends me a grainy video of a white box truck. I say send me a picture of the license plate, that could be any truck. He sends a picture of the plate and sure enough this man has found my truck. I say ""Great! send me the location and I'll have someone pick it up then I'll send you the $100"". To which he responds ""nah man, I'm gonna need $500 to tell you where it is"". I say ""no way"". And he stops responding. At this point I'm livid and will do literally anything to find this truck to spite everyone involved. I watch this grainy video of the truck 100 times (see the video for just how terrible this clip is) and realize the truck is right by a bridge overpass. 

&#x200B;

I then go onto Google maps and inch-by-inch scale down every major road in the city and wherever it bridges over another road I go to street view and compare it to the video I was sent. After about 4 hours of searching I find 3 potential options to work with. I send someone to check them out and BOOM my truck was right there. I was absolutely floored that it actually worked.

&#x200B;

**The police were called and the truck was back in my possession.**

**I've never felt such a sense of victory in my life.**

&#x200B;

As for our boy James he unfortunately got away because he wasn't physically caught in my truck and to be honest I didn't want to pursue it any further. I wish you the best, James.

&#x200B;

**You can see all of the above events played out below.**

**To both keep myself entertained and retain my sanity during these 5 days I actually documented this manhunt on Snapchat and because of the hilarious feedback I pieced it together it into a fully fledged video with commentary here:**  [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huF-kCEmW9I**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huF-kCEmW9I)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bwoot5/how_i_spent_5_days_tracking_down_my_companys/,662,This James guy sounds hispanic.

314,5x9rmc,False,,181,How We Turned a $20k Website Into a $9M/year Business Without VC Funding,Entrepreneur,"In today's ever-present startup culture, speed is almost always tantamount to success. How quickly a company can raise money, bring in talent, acquire users, penetrate new markets and raise more money are just a few markers tied directly to its performance. Taking in no VC dollars, outsourcing your website to a developer a country away and relying primarily on customer service and word of mouth may not be the blueprint that most modern startups are looking to follow; however, it's worked out quite well for us at MyClean. 

Launching a cleaning company in late 2009 with no previous technology skills or entrepreneurial experience was quite the undertaking. From hiring a developer, then another and then another until we found the right fit, to having 0 full-time employees when we started (just me and a phone!), the odds were hardly in our favor. But there were three areas where MyClean wasn't lacking – heart, hustle and vision – and that made all the difference.

We started with an ""Uber for Cleaning"" model, but outsourcing our cleaners to attend to our customers' needs quickly proved to be a failure, resulting in a series of one-star reviews on Yelp and a whole bunch of un-scalable business problems. We needed to pivot, and quickly. Operating under one of our core values of ensuring the highest level of customer and employee satisfaction, MyClean made the switch to convert our cleaners from outsourced, 1099 contract workers to W-2, full-time employees. Our cleaners are all now fully trained to deliver on MyClean's 50 Point Checklist and receive an array of afforded benefits, like health insurance, paid sick leave, workers comp and 401(k) options. By treating our employees well, we're ultimately servicing our customers too—even if this means that our prices are 10% - 20% higher than our competitors who contract their cleaners.

Since this shift, we have grown from a company that used to operate out of my tiny apartment to a business that generates $9M annually, has over 200 cleaners and 20 office staff employees, has completed more than 375,000 home and office cleans since launching and averages over 2,000 cleans a week between NYC and Chicago.

After 8 years of ups and downs, seeing various cleaning services (some with tens of millions in funding) come and go and employing unique and often far more extensive processes, MyClean has never been more proud of our past, excited for our future and confident in the phrase—slow and steady wins the race!

Lessons Learned:

Pick a market where you know demand exists. Prior to launching MyClean, there were members on our team who'd had the same cleaning lady stop by once a week for 6 years. While giving a copy of a key, leaving money out on the table and not really being able to communicate due to a language barrier was fine at the time, we knew there had to be a better, more efficient way. 

Remember your core vision but don't be afraid to pivot based on what your clients are telling you. Our initial vision was one of a technology company that was creating an engine that would allow customers to book, pay and communicate online. However, our customers were telling us that while they liked the convenience of being able to book online, the overall service was not up-to-par. We therefore knew we had to pivot and become a cleaning service that hires, trains and manages its cleaners.

Trust your gut when it comes to outside capital and other major business decisions. Starting in 2012 we saw the rise of ""Uber for X"" companies and the home services space became a ""hot sector."" Over the next three years we would see two competitors raise $64M and $110M in VC funding respectively, and a handful of others who raised anywhere from $2M - $10M. At one point we were receiving inquiries from a new venture capital fund nearly every day. They all wanted to ""invest"" and ""scale"" my business ""hockey stick growth."" However, we knew that the ""Uber for X"" model did not work in the cleaning space due to the quality control issues we experienced early on. We also knew that VC's who are looking for a 10x return on their investment in five to seven years had a different vision of what ""scale"" meant than we did. We therefore have never and will likely never take on venture capital.

Put people first. It sounds simple but so many business leaders miss this point in their quest for global domination. Our core focus at MyClean is to: Create and keep happy homes for our clients while building sustainable careers for our team. The only way that is possible is by keeping the best interests of our employees and customers at the heart of every decision.
What's Next? 

Continuing in our company's spirit of startup counter-culture, we recently unveiled our new revamped website, utilizing an ""anti-surge"" pricing model. Our new mobile-friendly site features this new, dynamic pricing engine, which incentivizes our customers with discounts for booking cleaning services during slower days and times, offering value to save more when you are more flexible with your schedule. In doing this, we are staying true to our mission of providing superior value to our customers, while simultaneously creating the best and most sustainable opportunities for our team.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5x9rmc/how_we_turned_a_20k_website_into_a_9myear/,737,"I think that you didn't need to pivot the whole business model to attend your customer feedback, instead improving the business algorithm would have been a much more effective idea and today you really could be the uber for cleaning. Having trained full-time employees makes your business less scalable,  and heavy by having to do so much management. Instead, you could have tweaked the technology and created a more ingineous way of getting good cleaners to the client. I won't tell here what you could have done, because maybe I'll execute that idea myself.
But yeah, you have a 9 million dollar business and that's great! Congrats! ",2017-03-03 11:05:28

153,hrkctu,False,,85,"In the last two years, I read a library of copywriting and content marketing books. Here are my 15 takeaways to write better and faster.",Entrepreneur,"Hey guys,

I'm a seasoned content creator.

I know how painful it is to start writing content, especially in the beginning.

* It takes days to write a blog post.
* In the end, you don't like what you read.
* It ends up like just one of these copycat articles on the internet.

If you want a new approach to writing, this can help you. Because it's not only writing tips.

It's about note-taking, outlining, structuring and editing your text.

And this 10-minute read is the summary of what I've learned in 6 years.

Bon appetite.

\-------

&#x200B;

# #1 Take notes to get more creative.

Researching without taking notes is just consuming. People don't take notes when they’re in the research phase about a given subject.

If you're passionate about your field, I assume you’re reading about it, daily. Then your daily life is a research phase, right?

For example, my expertise is marketing and I read books, articles, tweets or news about my field. Every day. And when I read something valuable, I save it in my second brain.

Here are the tools that I use daily.

* **Evernote:** Best app to take quick notes. Here, you can see how I take notes.
* **Notion:** You can use it when you want to structure your ideas.
* **Instapaper:** Throw any link you want to read later to Instapaper. Then read it on mobile, desktop or tablet. It works with Evernote.
* **eReaders, eBooks:** The same, there are tools that link Evernote and eReaders. So any highlighted sentence goes straight to your notes.

[https://imgur.com/a/MRDdRPb](https://imgur.com/a/MRDdRPb) \- Screenshot from my note-taking system.

Once you form the habit of taking notes, you’ll have tons of material waiting for you in your second brain.

Then all you need to do is rephrase the notes you took and link the ideas together.

# #2 Create a swipe file to write compelling headlines.

The headline is 80 cents of your 1 dollar. If you can’t write a good one, nobody will read your article.

Here, I’ll advise you to create a swipe file.

A swipe file is a folder where you keep all the compelling headlines. Go google “headline swipe file” and you’ll be able to create yourself one in 30 minutes.

Fake it till you make it.

I’ve also done the same. I opened my swipe file and imitated the headlines that could fit my subject.

Do the same. Imitating and rephrasing is one of the best ways to learn writing.

After a while, you’ll not need any templates. Because you’ll understand how to write a headline.

**P.S** I write 10-15 headlines for anything I write and send it to my colleagues, friends or wife. Then I start writing the rest of my article and I choose my headline when the poll finishes.

# #3 Write a killer first sentence that leads to the next sentence.

The first sentence of your blog posts does two things.

One: It gets your readers to read the second sentence.

Two: It gives your readers a taste of your article.

If the first sentence is cliche or boring, people will stop reading.

Now I’ll show you a bad example that I took from one of the big content marketing sites.

***Facebook is an incredibly powerful marketing tool. You’ve no doubt heard this already***

Vague, uninteresting and it gives me the feeling that the article is one of the many copycat articles about Facebook Marketing.

I won’t read it. Will you?

How about something like this

***I don’t know you, but I know a common point between your grandma and you. It’s Facebook ads.***

Or this

**3 months of extensive research went into this article. We might have found a FB strategy that even Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t know.**

Whatever, you get the idea.

For me, there are 2 kinds of openers I use 90% of the time.

**#1 Curiosity gap:**

The curiosity gap is the space between what we know and what we want or even need to know.

Example: *I was not sorry when my brother died.  (From the book, Nervous Conditions – Tsitsi Dangarembga.)*

* What you know: Her brother died and she’s not sorry.
* What writers know: Knows the reason why.
* What you want and need to know: How can a person not feel sorry in this situation?

In short: Give the reader information but not all of it, leave it open-ended.

**2. Short bites**

Keep it short and interesting. Keep it under 4 words then the reader will almost unconsciously take the first bite. Then the third and fourth.

So here the focus is on the first sentence. But the rest is also important, so there should be a rhythm to keep the reader engaged.

Here is one from me:

French fries. You can't stop yourself after you eat the first one. And this is what a great opener should do to your readers.

**3. Tell a story**

Here is an introduction to my blog post.

Have you ever heard the story of the guy, who brought a diamond ring to the first date? No, you haven’t.

Likewise, it’s not the best way to approach a cold prospect with a price quote.

Why use this?

* Analogies make it easier to follow for readers.
* So do stories.

# #4 A short introduction to making your point fast.

If your blog post is over 3K words, you have the right to write a longer intro.

In that case, you need to tell your reader what she’ll learn by investing 15 minutes. But if your blog post is short, write a very short introduction.

# #5 Write in a conversational rhythm and tone.

People on LinkedIn are not wearing serious faces, they're pretty loose and like to read conversational tone.

Understand the harmony between long and short sentences, then write like you're writing a friend.

Write like you're talking.

Here is a legendary example from the author Gary Provost that explains the importance of flow. Love this.

[https://imgur.com/a/0rlQ4n9](https://imgur.com/a/0rlQ4n9)

# #6 Use simple words to increase readability.

Complicated words don't make the writer look smarter and annoy the reader.

Write like you’re writing to 8th graders.

**So, never indicate when you can show**

**Or obtain when you can get**

**Or eliminate when you can get rid of**

You get the idea.

Plus, there will be lots of non-native speakers and readers in your network. So, be simple.

If you want to grade your text you can use[ the Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to calculate the readability score of your blog post. This app transforms the a normal blog post to a great blog post.

# #7 Use the power of whitespace to let your text breath

Long paragraphs are scary. When people see a big chunk of text, the first reaction is to run away from there.

Leave whitespace and let the reader breathe. Whitespace gives your text flow, makes it easier to read, adopt it to keep your reader engaged.

# #8 Write for your reader, edit for SEO

People write 5K articles that could be summed up in 2K words. Only for SEO and to stuff keywords.

Because there is that theory that the longer articles are better for SEO, but what about your reader’s thoughts and time?

Here is my take: If you remove a sentence without losing the meaning, remove it.

You have two choices here:

* Write a longer blog post for SEO. Win the SEO game and lose readers because of gibble-gabble.
* Write shorter for your readers. Give the most with fewer words to create a loyal reader base. Then edit your blog post for SEO.

In the second option, you could get viral, attract more backlinks and shares. And you'll make sure that you're not wasting your reader's time.

# #9 Write for skimming with the help of sub-headings.

Internet reading is not deep reading. People often skim through articles or they scan before they decide to read the full blog post.

How can you create a better skimming experience?

* Use bold to highlight takeaways
* Write descriptive subheadings
* Underline links.

What do I mean by descriptive subheadings?

As you see in this article, my sub-headings are telling the story and giving you a chance to skip if you already know the story.

# #10 Use bullet points to cut long and complicated pieces to snackable bits.

Without bullet points.

Bullet points can make your writing shorter and punchier. They increase readability,  add flow to your writing and resets the attention of the reader by breaking the reading pattern.

Also, you can use bullet points to tear down complicated topics to snackable pieces.

With Bullet points

* Make your writing shorter and punchier
* Increase readability
* Add flow to your writing
* Resets attention by breaking the reading pattern.
* Tear down complicated matters to snackable pieces.

Now a pro tip to increase readability with the same text, from shortest to longest.

* Increase readability
* Add flow to your writing
* Make your writing shorter and punchier
* Cut complicated matters to snackable pieces.
* Resets attention by breaking the reading pattern

## #11 Use cliffhangers to keep your readers engaged.

Every Netflix show closes with a cliffhanger. It almost forces you to watch the next episode.

Your goal is the same as your text. At the end of every chapter or subheading, you can add a cliffhanger to keep the reader's attention alive.

Cliffhangers are not necessary for skimmable articles like this one.

But if you’re writing a piece for deep reading such as long articles, whitepapers and so on, you’ll need them.

If I were to write a cliffhanger for this one, I would write something like this:

If you liked the Netflix analogy here, you’ll love the analogy on number 15.

Or

I kept the most powerful tips for the curious writers, the last four tips will blow your pen out of this world. And so on.

# #12 Add an infographic, graphs or statistics to empower the narrative.

We don’t read in every moment we live, but we see every second. We’re better at seeing, therefore we’re better visual learners.

Showing a related image is ok, but creating a graph or infographic for your specific topic will make you blog post 10x better. And you'll be more likely to convince your audience.

Everybody knows, but nobody does that. So you can still be a pioneer.

# #13 Write your first draft FAST to spot the best ideas.

Hey, I know what you're doing. I was also reading all the articles on the given topic and kind of copy-paste them when I first started blog writing.

Would you like to find your own unique perspective? Yes? Then do this.

* Set a timer for 15-20 minutes.
* Write everything off the top of your head.
* Read your first stream of thoughts and pick the best ideas.

This phase has nothing to do with your original blog post. Use this method to get started and see what kind of ideas you have. This will help you to create your own approach to that specific topic.

Do this before you do your research. Otherwise, you can get affected by other writers' opinions

## #14 Create an outline and calculate an estimate for your blog post.

This makes everything super fast. If you do that right, all you need to do is fill the blanks with your ideas.

For this blog post, it was easy. Because this is a listicle blog post and all I need to do was this.

H1 – How to write a blog post fast

200 words max

H2 – What is the difference between slow and fast creators.

200 words.

H2 – Blahblahblah

300 words.

and so on. Now I know what are my subheadings and how many words I should write.

It looks like a restriction but it's freedom. Once you do this, you'll see it becomes easier to write a blog..

# #15 Edit your blog post to make it shorter and meaty.

Editing and rewriting is a critical part of blog post writing. Actually, for any kind of writing.

This phase will help you trim the fat of your blog post and make it sharper. To me, this is the part that separates an average blog post and a great post.

Here are some writing tips to make this phase more fruitful,

Read your blog post out loud. If it sounds strange, rephrase and find the right tune.

If you have long sentences, make them shorter. If you can't, divide them into two sentences.

If you think a sentence sounds cool but not adding extra value. Kill it, burn it and check the pulse, make sure it's dead. (For example, the latter sentence was cool but instead, I could have just written ""kill it"")

704,giphe3,False,Lessons Learned,113,Cash is king in times like this and I just made my first purchase,Entrepreneur,"A sizable competitor in my market has been hit big time by COVID19. He made the poor mistake of having a highly leveraged business. His work had dried up, and his cash flow restricted. Also when he was in business he was the guy who known to be cheaper than everyone else. 

Not only that much of his loans for his business had a personal guarantee so he was super concerned that if he goes belly up he's going owe a ton of money and have no business at the end.

I found out about it through his wife and I approached him and told him if he was looking to sell some equipment I'd be willing to talk. 

He had 3 fully equipped trucks he needed to offload, plus a work van, plus various other pieces of equipment. The bank was kind enough to forgive some of his debt in return for being paid right away. Its why I like working with small town banks you can actually talk to people. 

I ended up buying all his equipment up with the bank's approval at 55 cents on the dollar. A great bargain for me!

We then talked about his existing service contracts, even with me buying his equipment up at 55 cents on the dollar he still needed additional money to get out of the hole. His 5 largest commercial contracts weren't what I would have bidded at, but they were still money and customers I could eventually bring up to my standard of pricing. We ended up agreeing on 15 cents on the dollar, he gets paid now I get paid when I do the work.

And with that, he's decided to close the shop as he doesn't really have the equipment to work anymore.

We did talk about maybe me hiring him as a manager after this COVID19 but those discussions are ongoing and how that pans out will determine what happens in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/giphe3/cash_is_king_in_times_like_this_and_i_just_made/,483,"cash is king, and if you wanna generate cash, Think and Grow Rich is the book you need to study, trust me, its been endorsed by billionaires and presidents, you can verify this.

126,d4zojx,False,,196,I analyzed 3.25 billion site visits to find out where different industries get their traffic.,Entrepreneur,"I just finished a two-month project analyzing 3.25 billion website visits to find out:

* What are the main traffic sources for the top sites across 12 different industries?
* How much do different industries rely on Google and Facebook?
* Which social media networks send the most traffic to each industry?
* And what are the largest traffic drivers *overall* (on average, regardless of industry)?

Here are the top things I learned, some of which really surprised me:

1. **Facebook delivers 65.36% of all social media traffic:** more visits per month than all other social networks combined.
2. However, **search is the single largest traffic source** for every niche, and in most industries it drives the majority of the web traffic.
3. In fact, **Google drives 8 times more traffic than all social media** networks combined.
4. The niche that is **most** reliant on Google is Health and Medical, with 87.85% of its traffic coming from search.
5. The niche that is **least** reliant on Google is Crypto, with 45.74% of its traffic coming from search.
6. **Instagram drives very little traffic**: **under 1% overall across all niches**. Even fashion and beauty brands that were launched by Instagram influencers (e.g. Kylie Cosmetics) receive less than 5% of their monthly visits from Instagram — while search brings in about 10 times as many.
7. **The niche that is most reliant on Facebook** is Business and Marketing**,** which gets 13.52% of its traffic from the network.
8. Facebook is the most important social network for every niche I studied except two: Design and Development (for which the top network is YouTube) and Crypto (for which it is Twitter).
9. **Reddit** drives over 3 times as much traffic as YouTube, even though it has far fewer users.
10. The average top blog gets 66.47% of its traffic from search.

682,bzecrx,False,Lessons Learned,76,Almost tricked myself (again) into starting an unprofitable business,Entrepreneur,"In looking back at all of my failed business ideas, there's a common theme: I tricked myself into thinking they were potentially profitable businesses. My flawed logic always was some version of this: ""I'll build this app, and then people will use it and like it, and then I'll charge money for it.""

&#x200B;

As obvious as it sounds, when you start a business you need to make money as quickly as possible. Companies that make money stay in business, and then you have the luxury of time to fix things, scale, or hire people to do those things. As Paul Jarvis says: ""If you’re a company of one, you’re not relying on massive influxes of cash from investors, so every minute you spend getting set up and started is a minute when you aren’t making money.""

&#x200B;

If you don't have funding or another source of income, you also don't have time to develop a product that might make money. You need to get customers with the smallest possible upfront investment. 

&#x200B;

I've only done this once successfully (and many more times [unsucessfully](https://launchingmyself.com/?failed)). When I was building Code-Free Startup, I was consulting at the time (additional revenue), but the software project I was working on was ending in two months. So rather than getting another consulting gig, I gave myself two months to get profitable. After recording the first three courses, I built a very shaky platform to host them and launched the product. About 20 days before my project finished, I launched on ProductHunt and the Bubble forum (where I had built up some credibility) and in one week built up to just under $3k MRR, enough to barely cover my living expenses (thanks, SF rent). Now that I didn't have to consult, I focused 100% of my time on it, and in the next two years recorded nine more courses, grew to 15k students and eventually sold the company last December.

&#x200B;

So you think after all this, my next idea I'd stick with what worked and work on 'profitable from day 1' ideas. But nope, I fell into the same trap because apparently I'm incapable of learning this lesson. 

&#x200B;

I'm reminded of the great Feynman quote, ""You must not fool yourself, and you're the easiest person to fool"" - because I just lost a few weeks and almost fooled myself. 

&#x200B;

The problem starts with falling in love with an idea. In my case, a learning app that solved [a problem](https://launchingmyself.com/education-clips) I had and was really excited about solving. I daydreamed of the potential, the growth, and how I'd build and scale it. And in the back of mind, somewhere, was a small rational voice saying ""well what's the business model?"" and I thought back (but didn't say out loud because that would be crazy) ""well I'll build V1, and then get traction and then charge for additional features for pro users"". And that was enough to start building it. 

&#x200B;

The only reason I was able to snap out of it is by holding myself to the rule ""companies I start need to be able to make $1000 in the first three months.""

&#x200B;

It sounds harsh and limiting, and it definitely is both. But a principle like this one, that helps you filter ideas can be your best friend when you're fooling yourself about possible earning potential. 

&#x200B;

It seems like the best types of online businesses to achieve that rule, and quick profitability, fall into three categories, ranked below from easiest to hardest to make successful:

&#x200B;

\- **Productized services:** this can start out being glorified consulting. Also, it's one of the smoothest ways for people working full-time jobs to reach full-time entrepreneurship. Ex. your full-time job is to work in Excel to make X easier for your boss. Productized: you make a landing page offering to make X easier for other people like your boss in different companies. 

\- **Specialized business software:** B2B apps solving a very specific problem tend to need fewer customers and make more money in a shorter period. Instead of charging $6/month and hoping every digital nomad subscribers to your consumer product, solve a business need, and get rewarded $400/month per seat. The reason everyone isn't doing this:  it's hard to find these ideas unless you're drawing on inside industry knowledge. You can interview people and find bottlenecks, but sometimes this is just a result of realizing something like ""hey Salesforce makes it really hard to convert X to fields, maybe I can build on that"" (there are hundreds of highly profitable companies based on that one idea because Salesforce is a monster). 

\- **Consumer app so helpful people will pay for it over the next best free option:** this one is difficult because I'd like you to think of the consumer apps that you pay for. For most people, the list includes Netflix, games on Steam, and that $4.99 app that you thought would teach you French. Consumers get bombarded with high-quality free things, and social media dominance by FB/Twitter has made it quite challenging to build a business that breaks through this noise. As a general rule, a consumer app needs to be 5x more useful to be able to be profitable (ex. weather apps - Dark Sky can charge because their radar/forecasting is at least 5x better than the next best free option. NomadList can charge because it's travel information is at least 5x better than TripAdvisor for travelers in that niche. Plenty of more examples, but a lot of successes in this category are highly niched. 

&#x200B;

So now I've abandoned my unprofitable idea (for now) and am back to the drawing board. I've got a couple of productized service ideas and one B2B idea I'll try out, but they aren't as exciting on paper.

They are toxic, and they infest this space.",Entrepreneur,"This may be pretty controversial to lots of you here who hero worship people like Gary Vee and others, but it is important. The industry that has developed around entrepreneurship is infested with what I call 'Toxic Positivity'. It is dangerous and counterproductive. 

Here are some examples: 

* Telling you its possible that everyone can have businesses making 6 or 7 figures of revenue per month. Yes it happens, but it is not particularly likely or even desirable in many cases. Keep your goals achievable and realistic. Dont be blinded by the unicorns. 
* We are often told you need to get up at 4.30am and never sleep. This is obvious BS. Get up at a time that keeps you productive, get a decent nights sleep and look after yourself. Burnout is real, if you dont stop, your body will force you to stop. 
* Its really difficult. There is no shortcut to success. There is no automatic formula someone can teach you. Experience matters. Dont forget this when you're seeing adverts telling you to buy ebooks in the latest online trend. Stop looking for the next big thing, stop thinking short term, stop wanting there to be a hidden secret to making it work. 
* Dont neglect your friends and family, they are a vital support network that no amount of money can buy back at the end. Its not necessary to avoid all social events or relationships in order to succeed. 
* Contrary to what we are told, not everyone needs to aim to be a millionaire or billionaire to succeed at business. There are millions of people running profitable businesses, living good lives that operate at a smaller scale. 
* Owning a Lamborghini isnt important in life. Remember what real value is. 
* There is no shame in not being an entrepreneur. People in jobs aren't all idiots who are being manipulated by corporations. Working hard at a job and bringing home a reliable paycheck for your family is honourable, will most likely pay more and offer you long term contentment. 
* The best investment you can make is in yourself. Eat healthily. Exercise or play sports. Give yourself mental health days if you need them. Use your support network. Keep learning. It will all pay off throughout your life. 
* It isn't all about content all of the time. At some point you are going to have to actually make tangible sales and stop designing content. 
* Motivation porn is exactly like regular porn, its impossible to live up to and warps your understanding of how this all works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/elyqf5/mental_health_matters_toxic_positivity_is_a_thing/,2911,Gary Vee I assume is much more successful than you are.

213,4kpo2l,False,,534,"UPDATE: I created a cheap flights email list and generated $120,013 in 9 months (5x growth in 3 mos) thanks to your help. AMA!",Entrepreneur,"Dearest r/entrepreneur,

Back with the 3rd update on my cheap flights email subscription service. For the curious, here are updates [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/45ap9i/update_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/).

**Tl;dr:** I run a freemium email list that alerts people when a really good international flight deal pops up. I started it by popular demand from friends after I used my cheap-flight-finding-obsession to get $130 roundtrip flights from NYC to Milan in 2013. (you can check it out [here](https://scottscheapflights.com/) if you're interested, but zero pressure!)

I owe so much to this subreddit's continued support (especially u/exitstrategy1 whose repeated advice has been invaluable) that I wanted not only to keep you guys updated, but also solicit advice on a few vexing issues moving forward.

**General updates:**

* 5 months ago: 652 premium subscribers, 3,178 free subscribers, and $6,188 in revenue. 2 months ago: 1,687 premium subscribers, 7,847 free subscribers, and $24,376 in revenue. Today: 6,230 premium subscribers, 53,547 free subscribers, and $120,013 total revenue. As you can see, it's been an AWESOME past few months for growth.

* MailChimp was great as a beginning email server, but as the number of subscribers multiplied, it became unwieldy. Tons of accidental unsubscribes, for instance. Huge shout out to u/jeremythepope who recommend we check out Active Campaign in the last update. It's been our new email client for the past month and it rocks.

* My business partner Brian overhauled the website. [Old one](https://web.archive.org/web/20150801051240/http://www.flyforfreeguide.com/email-list/) // [new one](https://scottscheapflights.com/). The new site not only looks way spiffier, imho, but is also much more optimized for conversions than the old one.

* We posted an ad on r/forhire and brought on a Redditor as our 3rd employee! This business would seriously be a fraction of what it currently is without Reddit.

* Given that the average savings are $607 per flight, numerous people have advised us to increase subscription prices. They're currently at $9/three months, $15/six months, or $29/year. On June 1, going to be increasing to $15/$25/$39. Thanks for the advice, y'all!

**Major sources of new subscribers:**

* Free flights giveaway. We decided to give away two free flights to Europe, Latin America, Hawaii, or the Caribbean. The way it worked was people got one entry for putting in their email address, and five additional entries for every person who entered the contest through that person's referral link. We had 43,852 people enter (and thus join the free version of Scott's Cheap Flights unless they opted out) all for a cost of about $1,400 in free flights. Since then, premium signup #s have been double what they were before the contest.

* Media appearances. Had a few new hits in places like the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2016/04/26/the-best-tools-for-tracking-travel-deals-based-on-the-kind-of-traveler-you-are/), [Philadelphia Inquirer](http://www.philly.com/philly/business/10_Insider_Secrets_to_Get_a_Free_Flight.html), the [Clark Howard Show](http://www.clarkhoward.com/this-new-travel-site-could-save-you-up-to-600), as well as ongoing appearances in [Conde Nast Traveler](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-09/flight-deal-of-the-day-bangkok-singapore-and-more-for-under-450-round-trip). Each one gives a nice bump in traffic/new subscribers. All have come organically from the reporter reaching out; we haven't made much effort pitching...yet...

* Reddit. Ahh Reddit, you fickle mistress. Though it might seem odd to some people to so publicly lay out the internal workings of this start-up, doing so has also helped publicize the business and introduce to new people. A sizable percentage of the current subscribership (is that a word?) is due to posting on Reddit. I try to regularly give back by periodically donating my time to help people find cheap flights, but I'll never be able to fully repay the favor to you all.

**Advice needed**

* As Scott's Cheap Flights grows, we're also getting more copycats trying to steal our content. Not going to link them, obviously, but would love to hear your thoughts on how to handle the imitators, flattering as they may be.

* We're weighing whether or not to start a referral program. If we do it, the structure would most likely be if someone signs up for a paid subscription via your referral link, you'd each get 1 free month added to your account. Pros: incentivize more shares and thus more customers. Cons: could piss off people who have been referring friends for past few months and got no reward for it. Thoughts?

* Lastly, we're looking to hire another flight searcher to expand into Australia. Ideal candidate doesn't have to live in Australia, but could work a good chunk of Australian work hours. PM if interested :-)

92,8y0tqg,False,,164,"2 years ago we dreamt of creating the IMDb equivalent for podcasts. We finally closed our seed round of funding, quit our jobs, and the whole team is here to share what we’ve learned so far.",Entrepreneur,"We’ll hang out here all day for your questions, ask us anything!

Last year, we posted our original pitch deck asking this community for feedback and fundraising advice. The response was overwhelming, and we are incredibly grateful for the help. We used that advice to pitch hundreds of investors and make a few changes to our deck. Now, we’re back to share our successes and failures after officially closing our seed round of investment.

**Short backstory:** In 2016, we posted on r/podcasts asking if an IMDb equivalent for podcasts existed -- see post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/64tjic/introducing_podchaser_the_imdb_of_podcasts_were_a/). It was clear that such a concept was desired. So, a team of five of us from the US and Australia banded together to create [Podchaser.com](http://www.podchaser.com/). During our bootstrapped beta stage, we grew to nearly 10,000 users, over 50,000 ratings, and 2,000 claimed podcasts. Today, we’re the only platform where you can rate and review individual podcast episodes and share those reviews on social media.

**Fundraising:** It was clear we could not dedicate the time necessary to grow Podchaser with full-time jobs. So, we chose to open our first round of investment! Below are the steps we took to fundraise. DISCLAIMER: These steps worked for us. They won’t work for everyone. Your situation is unique, and we simply want to help you learn from the mistakes we made and where we found success.

Step 1: Prove consumer demand existed for the product we wanted to build.

*So you have an idea, but how do you really know if anyone else wants it? Before you raise money or spend time and resources building your product or service, find* [*1000 true fans*](http://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)*. We borrowed this concept from Kevin Kelly. You don’t need a working beta or proof of concept to find these 1000 believers. We asked Reddit’s* r/podcasts *community if something like this existed and if people wanted it. They did. So, we built a minimally functional closed beta version of Podchaser and asked people to sign up for early access. Thousands registered, so it was time to raise money.*

Step 2: Form an all-star team that is bootstrap-compatible.

*We were a bit founder-heavy (with 5 starting, now 4). But, between us all, we could fundraise, develop, market, finance, etc. This was crucial so we didn’t have much overhead while bootstrapping. Surround yourself with a team of talented and passionate co-founders, but choose wisely. You’re likely to have equity conversations with every co-founder soon, which means you’re in this together for the long haul. Every co-founder is an important contributor to the company culture. Vesting schedules help protect you and your team from someone who ends up being a poor fit.*

Step 3: Determine if the market size is large enough to justify outside investment.

[*This yearly report*](https://www.slideshare.net/webby2001/the-podcast-consumer-2018) *from Edison Research gave us confidence early in the future growth potential of podcasting. Double-digit percentage growth in podcast listenership and ad-spend helped us form solid arguments around the need for a cross-platform ratings and discovery tool, similar to what IMDb built for the film industry.*

Step 4: Write a business plan. Kidding… we never wrote a business plan.

*For our team, a business plan would have been a waste of time. Our entire team agreed on the product we wanted to build and the problems it would solve. Our “business plan” was our* [*pitch deck*](https://imgur.com/SVU6Uyo)*. Your deck is typically your first impression to an investor, so take the time to design it well! Put thought into the design of each slide and how it will fit into your pitch as you tell your story. As long as you are able to speak intelligently about your deck, seasoned investors won’t ask you for a business plan.*

Step 5: Find more help.

*We cold-called industry professionals and snagged some rockstars -* [*John W. Gibbons*](https://medium.com/podchaser/advisor-spotlight-john-w-gibbons-59cd9459ce45) *and Karl von Randow. John was an early employee and former head of revenue at IMDb, and Karl is a co-founder at Letterboxd. Their insight and addition to the team as advisors added confidence to our potential investors and helped improve our product and vision.*

Step 6: Partner with companies bigger than you.

*Many people and companies will surprise you with their willingness to help. Especially when you’re just getting started, we found most people are altruistic and genuinely interested to help if you ask. This happened early with Patreon. During Podcast Movement, the largest podcasting show in the US, we asked if Patreon would team up with us on a contest. They did, and* [*this contest*](https://medium.com/podchaser/the-podchaser-patreon-podcast-movement-contest-aka-3pmc-18f27abcf8af) *did wonders for our credibility as a brand and user traffic.*

Step 7: Tell a compelling story.

*You have to be excited about your story and the problem you’re solving. Investors care, maybe above all else, about ingenuity and passion. Believe in your idea more than anything. It sounds simple. But when you repeat the same, tired pitch to hundreds of potential investors, they will begin to sense even an ounce of doubt or lack of fervor. At this stage, an investor is much more interested in investing in a person they believe can execute.*

Step 8: Fill that funnel.

*We reached out to several of our local business development resources asking for leads for local angel investors. We cold-called our hearts out until someone decided to take a meeting. 90\% of our fundraising came from a single line of networking from one cold email. You never know what will result from a cold outreach, and the risk-to-reward ratio is great. Dominos will start to fall when you snag your first credible investor.*

Step 9: Close the deal.

*We probably had triple of what we actually raised “committed” at one point. Investors tend to like to keep a deal “warm” so they don’t miss out. There is no silver bullet here. It’s a matter of persistence and treating each investor like a sale. If that investor has expressed interest, they owe it to you to give you a decision. So, expect to follow up (call/text/email) quite a bit before getting a yes or no. One thing that helps somewhat is setting a closing date. This issue gets easier and easier as the round fills out, since the FOMO increases as the $ amount in the round decreases.*

Step 10: Keep your investors informed and *utilize* them.

*We do a monthly update with a general idea of metrics, progression, and status of the company. At the end of every email, we always have a concise ask of our investors. Because of these asks, we’ve been fortunate to have wonderful connections in the podcast industry to help grow the company. These simple asks also helped us snag $100,000 in AWS credits to offset one of our largest expenses, server costs.*

**What’s next?:**

We’re using these funds to develop the killer features we have been promising the podcasting community. This includes custom Lists, “Creator” profile pages, integrations with popular podcasting apps, discussion boards, a major facelift to our home page, and relevant podcast recommendations.

We are giving ourselves about a year of runway with this first round of funding to build these essential features and prove our monetization models. Then, we’ll raise another round to scale.

**How you can help:**

We’d love some feedback on our most recent feature release, [custom Lists](http://www.podchaser.com/lists). Make a list of your favorite podcasts, add your own commentary, and tell us your thoughts!

We also need your ratings and reviews for podcast episodes! We’re the only platform with podcast episode ratings, and we need your participation to succeed. You’ll start to see these ratings and reviews in some of your favorite podcasting apps as we make Podchaser ratings ubiquitous across all platforms.

TL;DR - From a helpful Reddit post to closing our seed round, we took what we’ve learned so far about fundraising and condensed it into 10 steps. Help us out by creating a list of podcasts using our new [Lists](http://www.podchaser.com/lists) feature!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8y0tqg/2_years_ago_we_dreamt_of_creating_the_imdb/,1197,[deleted] ,2018-07-11 16:01:57
609,7awr1v,False,Best Practices,52,"7 Deadly Sins of Instagram Marketing - I hope this helps you out, ladies and gents.",Entrepreneur,"Hi r/Entrepreneur, this a collection of ""Don'ts"" that I've come up with after being in the Instagram game for a while. It's about a 7 minute read, I haven't done a TLDR because I think the titles of the points would be a enough for anyone in a hurry :) [The original article is here](https://medium.com/@sahkilic/7-deadly-sins-of-instagram-marketing-ec082f662b91) for anyone who wants to read it there or give me some love. Without further a do...

**7 Deadly Sins of Instagram Marketing**

Some basic wisdom gathered from managing several social media accounts, running countless campaigns and growing a pet blog to to 75k plus followers (don’t judge the stats, I’ve neglected growing it lately OK!). Avoid doing these things and you will get some great traction with your Insta-Endevours.

**1 - Trying to make every post an advert**

Instagram, or any social media platform is not for sticking your product in a person’s face. You know who you become when you do that? You become that one guy that everyone knows, who’s constantly trying to sell you something. You’re the digital version of that. Don’t be that.

Instead, use your profile to congregate people that enjoy your *content* that will likely be interested in your *product*. Your profile should be a home for your customer. If you’re selling beard oil. You shouldn’t be posting your product in the foreground of every photo, not even in the background. You should be finding models with killer beards, videos of barbers doing their styling on a customer, beard maintenance guides. Build social arbitrage. If you’re providing entertainment, information and value to your customer, your product will sell itself. Every now and again, promote your product. And for fuck sake make it personal, don’t talk in corporate-language. We’ll get to that..

**2 - Loading every post with every somewhat relevant hashtag under the sun**

Look it’s fine to load your post with hashtags as long as they’re relevant and thought out. You get 30 hashtags and each one has the ability to lead a potential customer to your content. Is your product related to cats? Cool, #cat and #cats are probably the most mediocre hashtags you could tag your content with. Why? Because they’re not targeted at all, completely broad and off the mark when you’re trying to find enthusiastic cat owners. Instead think of tags as small communities. Say you product is a cat toy — you’re looking for cat owners, who are enthusiastic about cute fluffy things and regularly active with their pets. Try tagging your content with #dailyfluff, #petscorner, #kittenlove. Try finding large blog accounts that have their own hashtags, that they use for selecting content to feature, use them. Don’t just load a post up and wait for magic to happen, find a good mix of small and large hashtags to grow your account. Tagging all your content with hashtags that have 20 million photos attached to them will only drown your content and make it compete with thousands of other photos. 

*Pro Tip #1 — If a significant part of your audience (say 15% or more) is from a different country or has a different first language, it may be worth it to use a few of those 30 hashtags to cater for that segment by using their language.*

**3 - Neglecting the Caption**

Have you seen a post with just hashtags under it, without a caption? If you have, you’ve seen the Instagram equivalent of a pizza without cheese. Is it a pizza? Sure, it’s got the sauce and all…  Am I eating it? Get that abomination out of my face.

The caption is the content, just as much as the picture is… Instagram lets you post a picture and a maximum 2200 character caption. You’re absolutely nuts if you don’t use that to your advantage. How bland is a picture on it own? A picture says a thousand words but 2200 characters is about 400 words extra. That’s almost half a picture and you could probably use it to 10x the value of your post. Why do you think memes are so popular? It’s not because of the picture, it’s the picture and caption combined that’s making that fucker go viral. If you’re selling wine and you post a picture of your co-founder and yourself having wine together, why wouldn’t you caption that and describe what’s happening. If I saw the picture and read “Nothing beats enjoying a lovely Sauvignon blanc and some cheese on a Sunday afternoon by the coast, with your best friend — Have a lovely weekend everyone!” — I’m now instantly craving wine and cheese, and likely to be your customer at some point since you conveniently sell the wine I just saw. As opposed to seeing the picture and not knowing the context at all. Be smart, write a well written caption.

*Common Sense Tip #1 — Don’t neglect your profile Bio either. Describe what you’re about and invoke some interest — and for fuck sake, utilise that 1 link you get. Link them to your latest product, e-mail list, video, god… something… If I see one more blank bio or one less link, I’m going to shoot myself.*

**4 - Spraying, praying and making it rain when approaching influencers to promote you**

Not all influencers are created equal and just because an account has 100k followers, doesn’t mean it’s going to be effective for your purposes. You might be thinking. “Well yeah, we have to check if the followers are legitimate, we have to check the engagement rate and make sure it’s a real account.” You would be correct in thinking that, and if you weren’t thinking that, please do that before committing to a promotion… What I’m actually talking about comes after all the vetting has been done. My problem is with marketing campaigns that set a budget and go nuts with any old account that appears to be somewhat related to your product/service. Even if these accounts have been vetted and confirmed to be real, you need to apply the same principles as we covered with the hashtag situation. 

The influencer accounts have to be relevant to you niche,  highly targeted, have enthusiastic followers that trust the influencer. No matter what your product is, there will be accounts out there that are pumped about that product, so find them. When spending your money, don’t go wide and shallow, go for depth where it counts. 7–8 generic 100k accounts will be less effective than 3–4 high quality accounts, even if they’re less than 20k each.

*Pro Tip #2 — Micro-influencers seem to be the best bang for your buck these days. These are accounts with less than 10k followers who have built deep trust with their followers not unlike that of a friendship. Their followers are highly engaged and will take their recommendation at high regard. They’re also very lovely to work with for the most part  and will go the extra mile if your product fits their audience. Start DM-ing ladies and gentlemen.*

**5 - Not keeping up to date with the rollout of new features that could greatly benefit you**

How many of you have created a serious strategy or routine for Instagram stories and Instagram carousel? Scratch that, how many of you even regularly use those features? Instagram’s story feature has eclipsed Snapchats by 2 fold as of the beginning of this month. That’s 300 million users that are actively engaging with this new feature. A feature that lets you embed locations, links and even polls… polls! People crave expressing their opinions and Instagram Stories lets you give your audience just that! Look if you aren’t getting aroused by that piece of information, then this article is not for you.

You need to keep up with what Instagram is doing and you need to follow the stats that inevitably become available for those new features. This isn’t even a Instagram thing, it’s a marketing thing. Create a strategy around what you’ll share using stories and carousel, how frequently you’ll post them and how best to engage with your followers using them. You can do so many things with Carousels. You can treat them as comic strips if it works for your business. If you need to hire someone to tell your business’ story, then do that. You’ll find thousands of young up-and-coming marketing professionals, that would kill to create Snapchat and Instagram content to tell your story. Just make sure you’re at least experimenting with the new stuff.

**6 - Not engaging with your followers**

If you’re serious about selling and serious about Instagram, you better be replying to comments left right and center. If your post has 4 comments and 2 of those aren’t from you replying to the other 2, you’re doing it wrong (the exception being people tagging each other). If you have a direct message in your inbox that you haven’t replied to or acknowledged, reply! If you are replying, but you’re doing it in corporate lingo resembling that of a PR statement, you’re coming off as disingenuous.

Remember when we talked about the micro-influencers in our second pro tip. They have built trust by befriending their followers. Friends talk and interact with each other, don’t take each other too seriously and are there to help. Be that friend for your follower and they just might become your customer.

*Pro Tip #3 — As much as we want it to, Instagram doesn’t solely revolve around our content. Engaging with our customers means engaging when it’s their content as well. Sounds hard? It could be if you’ve got a fair few followers but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try your best in this department.*


**7 - Being out of touch and not tailoring your content.**

Have you ever seen an Instagram post that is a cropped flyer with the caption that goes something like — “Hello dear followers, we are extremely excited to announce that we are running a new program called x and we are inviting you to join our e-mail list so we can update you on our upcoming blah blah blah” — this isn’t an e-mail, this isn’t a flyer, this isn’t a notice board. This is social media, learn to be social for god sake. 

When you try to become a part of a community, a platform, you need to tailor your content for those eyes. If you go around like you’re at a networking event handing out business cards, you’re just not going to get any business here. You need to appeal to your audience AND optimise for the platform. No matter how much I love burgers, I’m not going to get excited about a burger joint that’s on Instagram posting clear cut stock image bullshit and captions that sound like the human equivalent of a terms and conditions copy. For all the people who haven’t seen this… you haven’t seen this because those profiles never ever grow. They do exist however, they are there and they are infuriating.

Instead of doing that, make sure the photo/image is actually aesthetically pleasing or interesting. This is an image platform after all. Also, make your caption informal. It can still be professional and informal without going full suit and tie. Define the purpose for your Instagram account, research how hashtags work, observe how your followers interact with you on the platform and tailor you content accordingly.

798,e2aivs,False,,124,Started my Tree service business this year. Here is my progress so far.,Entrepreneur,"I started my business back in April of this year. I had been looking into starting a business, but never really commited until I discovered sweaty startup via the entrepreneur sub.

In short, I have struggled this year.

Keep in mind that my side business was started on the side since I still have a full time job that pays me roughly 80k a year while working around 35-38 hours per week.

I generated 29,638 dollars so far from April to November 26th, 2019. I have struggled to get this going.

Out of these 29k, I paid myself roughly 4000 dollars into my personal account and kept 4000 in my business checking.

Keep in mind that I made all this money working Saturday and Sunday with the occasional day taken off during the week in order to finish a project. I only did this with one employee that I paid $20 dollars an hour. The rest of labor expenses were because I would hire contractors to climb a tree for me and train me.

This is actually the hardest thing I have struggled with. I pay 20 dollars an hour, offer no benefits and cant offer full time work.

My business is in Tree Removal/Tree Pruning and cleanup work such as fall/spring cleanups. What are my expenses?

Here we go with me rounding up to the closest dollar.

* · Tates Rents- 1345
* · Pro Rentals- 620
* · Trailer Rental-1200
* · Climbing Course- 550
* · Ticket to travel to climbing course-317
* · Google Domain- 50
* · Insurance - 420
* · Workers Comp -250
* · Jobber – 280
* · Equipment – 1200
* · Dump Expenses- 1200
* · Labor- 8000
* · Bought a dump truck for 2800
* · Victory Greens- 578
* · Far West – 380.83
* · Home Advisor Fees- 701

Total = $17932.00

Lessons I have learned so far:

* · Renting equipment is super expensive but so is buying equipment.
* · Dump fees are super expensive but I have found a place that charges 4 dollars a yard in order to dump tree debris.
* · Finding employees is hard because climbing trees is dangerous and super hard work.
* · Training someone would take lots of time because I am training myself.
* · Home Advisor fees are expensive but I got most of my work from them.
* · Craigslist ads brought in a few leads and by far gave me the best ROI. However, some customers are cheap.
* · Tree Removal is the least profitable. In fact, I have lost money on tree removal jobs but this is definitely because I am learning and I am inexperienced in climbing and bidding.
* · Fall and Spring cleanup are by far the most profitable. I have averaged out cleanups to roughly 185 dollars an hour.
* Im really good with people.
* I have been told that I am the only one that does proposals in a unique way. Basically I take pictures of the work that we are targeting. I put it in a word document and highlgiht and indicate exactly the work that we are going to do for the customer. That way they know exactly what they are getting. Thats something that only I do in my area and I have won jobs just following this approach. Heres an example.[Example of Proposal](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o4dGR6cyizj6Qkaj_v6wXpp8Ikxcar4m?usp=sharing)

I am realizing that this whole business thing is super hard. Its definitely not as glamorous as some people might think, its hard work and I feel that this is going to be a slow process.

Anyways, this is my story. Its kind of a downer, but I figured I would share with the community.

As a side note, here are the books that I have read so far. Not only have I read but I have also tried implementing their advice:

* Never Split the Difference
* Pumpkin Plan
* Profit First
* A Higher Calling
* Home Service Millionaire
* 1 Page Marketing Plan
* How to Win Friends and Influence People
* Getting everything you can out of all you've got by Jay Abraham
* Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion

705,do0pnd,False,,260,I refuse to use Instagram or Facebook on moral grounds.,Entrepreneur,"My business is in real estate, and is doing great. Could I garner more business with IG or Facebook? Who cares, I am making money, and feel good mentally knowing I don't participate in a platform which is doing it's best to divide the world, so that a few can make a lot of money.

I look at all these questions on Reddit, along the lines of, ""How much should I spend on IG influencers, or on Facebook ads?"" and think that they are just giving their money away to fascists. I mean, how much did you make spending on your influencer? Ask yourself if a young girl on IG knows about a damn thing. Everything on IG and Facebook is so artificial and full of shit, that I just assume they are lying when promoting a product these days. Did you really make money from marketing through that platform? I understand it is trendy, but there is no magic pill when it comes to marketing, and it seems as if everyone out there has been fooled into thinking that they need to spend money on Facebook on IG. 

What do I do to market? I do my own SEO, website development, I knock on doors, I network, and get a ton of business from word-of-mouth, I design and edit video and digital media, and am pretty much a one-person show at this point. I even have a commercial drone pilot license, and do that too... My marketing budget is like $400/year, and I gross over $100k. 

Best of all, my mental health is much better. I used to spend a lot of time on Facebook doing self-promotion... It was soul sucking, and never got me the business I wanted. EVERYONE is so full of shit these days and it is the most obvious on Facebook, and IG. 

If you care about your fellow humans, and the Planet you live on, it would be best to nuke your Facebook account today and never look back. I haven't missed a damn thing since I quit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/do0pnd/i_refuse_to_use_instagram_or_facebook_on_moral/,489,How are IG and FB dividing anybody? These platforms are literally designed to *connect* and *unite.* I wish I joined Facebook sooner. I never had a social life or friends until I started using Facebook. It allows me to close the gaps between those I know and care for and myself. No matter how far away I can still see how they are doing and what they are achieving. It's a beautiful thing. I recently started using Instagram this year and have never been happier following my favorite celebrities. My favorite singer even liked one of my comments on a post he made! It blows my mind how someone across the world can put their finger on a screen and acknowledge someone like that. It made me feel loved and important as a huge fan. These platforms allow us to connect and share our lives and even inspire others. ,2019-10-27 23:13:32
712,8bzmp7,False,Startup Help,251,I paid attention to the problem. I created the backpack. I don't know how to sell it.,Entrepreneur,"> I knew that Reddit it's a place where people very willingly help each other. Honestly, I couldn't even hope to get so many smart and useful reviews and tips. You do not just help one person, you create a whole culture in which people want and can create great things. The culture in which everyone wants to help other enthusiasts create new things. From all our team I want to thank each of you for such activity. I have read every comment and now I will try to answer how much I can. Thank you, friends.

I'm a young enthusiast who's trying to create the urban tech backpack which is very comfortable thanks to its incredibly thin design, and, at the same time, the backpack is unbelievably spacious because of its unique expandable system. You can expand the backpack in 4 times in volume (from 6L up to 26,7 liters) in one simple move. There is nothing like this on a market. 

As many enthusiasts who have an idea but don't have money to make it happen, I gathered a team and soon we're going to launch a campaign on Kickstarter.

And now after many months of hard work, we understood, that without well paid advertise Kickstarter campaigns don't become successful. It was naive not to understand this. I know. Still, we're almost there and we will not stop. If we have no money for ads, we should take care that almost everyone who comes to our page will quickly understand how our Pleatpack can make the life better like no backpack before it.

Here is the point. You have much more experience in entrepreneurship that anyone in our team. Therefore, I'd like to ask you to take a look at our ""almost ready"" Kickstarter page and give your feedback on the backpack and all texts on the page, so we could improve it.

Always happy to hear your feedback.

507,czknut,False,Other,90,"Keep going, it’s not a chore, it’s your dream.",Entrepreneur,"Working on your projects shouldn’t feel like a chore.

I love creating stuff, especially software, so much that I don’t care how long it takes, as long as I get to create what I want, it’s worth it. Luckily my job is creating software, but my dream is to one day be creating software for my own company, and doesn’t feel like a job.

&#x200B;

**First attempt**

My entrepreneurial journey started 4 years ago while I was studying at the university. I joined a guy who had already developed the idea of a website for renters and tenants to find each other. My part in the business was to develop the product and then he would be running the company. We worked great together and launched the website, where we got some traction in the beginning. But when the dust settle and business was ready to be run, we failed. Silver lining, I didn’t get a business, but I got a really good friend, whom I’m still in contact with.

&#x200B;

**Second attempt**

After my first failed company, I blamed my partner in the beginning, so I set out and tried to create another company, alone, since in my mind, I was certain that we failed because of everyone else, but me. Which was clearly wrong.

My new idea was a website for people who commute on long distances, and people who personal belongings transferred on these distances. The idea was that the people who commute could make a few extra money, going places they already needed to go, and I would take a small fee of this transaction.

I discussed it with a few friends who thought it was a great idea, and two of them actually wanted to join. At this point I had already developed most of the site. We planned a weekend to discuss the whole thing, and how we should proceed from there. At the end of the weekend, we had discovered a few major issues that we didn’t think we could solve beside our day jobs. So i slowly stopped working on it until I realised it was dead.

A few months past and while I was living my life, working, hanging out with friends, playing video games, I was observing the world around me trying to discover a problem I shared with others, that I could solve.

&#x200B;

**Third attempt**

I lived in a condominium with \~100 people, and one day came to the conclusion that everything was run through paper: messages between tenants, messages between tenants and the landlord, laundry booking, booking of common areas, bulletin boards and messages on doors. I found my problem and talked to the landlord about creating a platform for all this communication online, and he gave me the green light if the other tenants were onboard and if we could roll back to the old system, just in case.

After more than 8 months of developing in my free time, bouncing off ideas with the tenants, the website was ready. We transitioned to website and the end of last year, and they still use it today.

This time everything was better, I had clarified a problem others had, I had users from the beginning and a crystal clear road. After the launch I was very excited and wanted to build a company around the website. So I tried to market the website, and talked to all the condominiums I could find, but everyone was either happy with their own solution or in the development of something themselves.

After a few months of rejection I realised I wasn’t the man to sell this product to the world, so I settled with my loyal 100 users, and still maintain the website today.

&#x200B;

**Fourth attempt**

Which brings me to my fourth and most recent adventure. While trying to bring my last product to market through ads on various social media sites, I discovered how to get more value out of the Facebook Ads Manager, and developed a small interface for personal use, showed it a few digital marketing friends and put a pin in it.

Some time after I gave up on my previous startup, I decided to develop a more consumer friendly version on the Facebook add-on.

Which is the project I’m currently working on in my spare time.

I recently launched and had a goal of 50 beta users in the first month, which I got in first 4 days, so my motivation and spirit is through the roof.

&#x200B;

This is what I love doing, and it excites me that someone else care about it as well.

&#x200B;

Working on these projects and learning from my mistakes is my favourite thing in the world. It keeps me going and disciplined, and gives me a sense of purpose I’m proud of.

My message to you fellow entrepreneurs, is to keep going! Do what you really want and dream about.

My dream is to make a living from something I have created, and to keep me on track I usually ask myself when I’m about to waste a whole weekend: “In 5 years, are you closer to your dreams because of this?”.

&#x200B;

Remember your dreams, make them goals and start achieving them!

Thank you /r/entrepreneur, you are a great community and a great inspiration to me. I love reading your stories so keep them coming!

755,aw1a09,False,,254,Running a very successful rage room?,Entrepreneur,"EDIT: I have received so much interest/attention from aspiring entrepreneurs and existing rage room owners seeking advice, I am releasing my own course on how to start your own rage room. www.rageroomsolutions.com 

About 4 months I opened a ""rage room"" in my city Rochester, NY called Smash Therapy.  A rage room is where people go to break things in a controlled environment for entertainment or stress relief.

I'm only 22 and this all seems pretty crazy to me how much we have been blowing up. We recently had a week with 51 bookings in 4 days. Maybe it's just the initial hype of something new and exciting in the area. Who knows. But, the amount of business we get is actually insane for this sort of thing.

Our website isn't the greatest. We don't even have an overheard sign yet. (In the process of getting one.) Personally, I had basically no experience running a business at all prior to this.

There are some simple reasons I believe why my place seems to do much better than other rage rooms. The facility itself is quite nice. Multiple rage rooms (including a larger room that can accommodate up to 5), TVs, complimentary water and snacks in a family friendly area. Based on my previous research, lots of these kind of places are in warehouses or somewhere that seems unappealing. Usually around 500-800 sq feet with one rage room and a tiny lobby.

Another reason I believe we're doing well is our prices, times and items we give out to break are leagues better than most other ""rage rooms."" I would challenge you to find somewhere that gives a better bang for your buck than we do. 

During my initial research, I found that lower rates drew in more customers which would make up for the shortage in price. My goal was to have each and every customer that booked a room have a blast for an honest price. It worked. You can seriously come here for $20 and have an amazing time. 

Rage rooms have been trending quite a bit in the last few years. One can be found in almost every major city across the US by now. The idea for most entrepreneurs is they get stuff for dirt cheap, and then charge WAY more for huge margins.

This is true, being an owner/operator myself. The margins for us are 90-95%. 

Other expenses include:

-Rent
-utilities 
-insurance 
-marketing 
-waste disposal
-internet/phone/TV
-payroll
-occasional gear/tool replacement

It's not too much as you can see. 

I remember before I even opened, my father said ""All I've seen and heard is stories of rage rooms closing and failing. Where's all the success stories?"" Maybe I'll be one of the first, I thought. 

Things have been going so well. I've been absolutely working my ass off with this business. I can only hope this success continues and we grow even further.

EDIT: Sorry for the confusing statement regarding margins above. The cost of goods for each room was what I was referring to. Not the overall profit after all other expenses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/aw1a09/running_a_very_successful_rage_room/,464,"I have a small suspicion this is spam, barely answered any of the question.

908,9rtx5z,False,Case Study,84,Here are the results from asking 180 YouTubers to do an unboxing video.,Entrepreneur,"I also made this available as a Halloween-themed blog post [here](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/youtube-marketing-horror-story).
&nbsp; &nbsp;

---

&nbsp; &nbsp;

I run a site called [Candy Japan](https://www.candyjapan.com/), which ships boxes of Japanese surprise candy to subscribers around the world, twice a month. I've been trying to find an approach to promote the site effectively through YouTube, as it could be a great way to reach a lot of people looking for new things to try. Earlier I [tried YouTube ads](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/what-i-learned-advertising-on-youtube). When that didn't work, many commented that instead of burning money on ads, I should just send YouTubers free samples instead.

I had [already done this before](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/sales-results-from-getting-3-million-views-on-youtube) with some YouTubers. One unboxing video ended up getting millions of views, but didn't result in any sales. I still believed that if I just tried different approaches, eventually something would work.

## Sending samples to a lot of tiny channels

Here's what my thinking was for the current experiment. Huge channels may occasionally agree to feature Candy Japan, but it will be a bumpy ride with a small number of videos, some not working out at all. Doubling down on the ones that do work (if they exist) would be hard, as there are only so many big yet relevant YouTube channels out there.

On the other hand there are probably thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of channels out there in the 1-10k subscriber range. If each just brought in two customers on average, there are so many of them out there that scaling would be straightforward. I would get a stream of sweet sweet data to analyze, enabling me to improve the approach over time.

## Starting with a small-scale test

### 180 channels contacted

Since I had no idea if this would work, I wanted to start small, but still big enough to learn something. I decided 180 channels to contact would be a decent number. I could at the very least get a pretty good idea of the response rate, maybe even run a split test.

I wanted to pick a category where I could find a lot of channels related to it, and one that might have an audience interested in Japan. I decided to go for cosplayers. I found some websites where cosplayers could upload their costume photos, and many users linked to their YouTube channels from their profiles. I gathered all the channels I could find into a spreadsheet.

Then I manually visited each channel to make sure I knew how to address the YouTuber properly by their name or the name of their team, and to find out how to contact them. This turned out to be quite time-consuming, someone might only link to Tumblr from their channel, then from Tumblr would link to their DeviantArt page, which might then finally have their contact information.

### 50 channels agreed

After I had a large list of people to contact, I wasn't sure what to say in my email, so I wrote a bunch of different versions and tested them many approaches. I learned that to get someone to agree to an unboxing, it is best not to ask for their shipping address up front. First explain the service briefly, then ask if they are interested. If they say yes, then ask for shipping address. 

Asking for the address in the initial mail seemed to be off-putting and resulted in less people agreeing. I [tested other things as well](https://www.candyjapan.com/behind-the-scenes/ab-testing-contacting-youtubers), but that one had the biggest impact.

In the end 50 channels (28%) out of the 180 contacted agreed to make a video and gave me their shipping address. A much higher rate than I had anticipated, with my personal guess being that only 10% would agree.

### 42 samples shipped

For various reasons I ended up not [shipping](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/pile_of_boxes_at_japan_post.jpg) to everyone. Some responded so slowly that I considered the whole experiment over by the time I received their shipping address, for others I may messed up with communication, such as noticing Facebook messages too late.

### 33 boxes reached destination

Well, maybe more, but I found that international package tracking does not actually work 24% of the time, so it is impossible to be sure. Four boxes were returned to me as the recipient was not available or decided not to accept the shipment, and for 5 I am not sure what happened because of the tracking issue.

On average it took 2 weeks for an airmailed package to be delivered, shipping time ranging from 4 to 42 days.

### 17 videos made

After the boxes were delivered, I waited 2 months before tallying up how many people actually made a video. While waiting I also periodically nagged people to ask how their video was coming. 

From getting the box, it took on average 20 days for a YouTuber to make a video. The fastest person made it in 1 day, slowest after 2 months. Since only a fourth of people actually made a video, if I want one video made I need to send 2.5 boxes out. That more than doubles the cost of goods and shipping.

You can [see all the videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXnSK9EMudUeGONOSeQNZMsSsBpb7n-_K).

## Results

Zero sales.

After videos had been out for about two months, each only averaged 166 views, for a grand total of 2826 views. This would have been OK if these small channels had such a devoted subscriber base that each would have resulted in a sale or two, but that did not happen. No noticeable change in traffic from YouTube or an uptick in sales, no-one mentioned buying because of the channels (I ask everyone), and not a single claim of the 10% off coupons I gave to the YouTubers.

## Conclusion

The entire process of finding YouTubers to contact, figuring out how to contact them and actually sending the messages, then having back-and-forth to discover their shipping address and answer any questions they had, preparing and shipping the boxes, nagging people to make the videos, and finally compiling the results was very time-consuming. 

Buying all of the goods and shipping all the packages cost about $1000 in total. Buying the same number of views with YouTube ads would have cost less than $10. On a CPM basis this was ten times more expensive than advertising on prime-time TV.

Considering the results, I am becoming pretty reluctant to send out free samples for unboxing videos. I would love to be proven wrong though, so if you run a decent sized channel that you believe could be a good match, feel free to PM me.

16,ako3dd,False,,299,How I made $10k in one weekend as a college student with no cash,Entrepreneur,"It was about 8 weeks before graduation weekend in my college town in 2012. I was a senior about to graduate. My mother was bugging me to help her find a hotel near campus for graduation weekend. For her, my father, my grandparents and my sister. Three rooms.

I called about 10 hotels around campus. Checked Priceline. There was nothing available at all. AirBNB was the same.

The closest city with availability was about 30 minutes away. They only had 3 rooms left in the entire hotel and they were $350 per night plus fees, each, with a three night minimum. Even they were cashing in on graduation. Thats $3,150 + fees. I refused. I’d rather them stay home and miss graduation.

The closest hotels with normal pricing and availability were over an hour away.

I thought about my friends who were sophomores and juniors renting apartments in the area. Classes ended about 10 days before graduation. They all were gone for the summer working internships or back home. Their apartments were empty. I texted a group of three friends living in a three bedroom apartment. I offered them $500 if they let my parents stay there over the weekend. They quickly agreed. All set with my family and we saved about $3,200.

My college had recently added a feature to the email (Google powered email). If you started typing someone’s name it would autofill and provide you with their email address.

My school had about 4,000 students in each class and the facebook group had about 3,000 each. I joined each group.

I then went through using one screen on the facebook group members page and one screen on the gmail page typing in names and mining email addresses. About 20 hours later I had a list with the email addresses of 3000 juniors and 3000 seniors.

I typed out a nice email to the Juniors:

>Friends,  
>  
>My family and a few of my classmates’ families  are looking for a place to stay on graduation weekend. If you will be gone that weekend and would be interested in renting out your apartment to them let me know.  
>  
>Thanks!

I then typed out this email to my fellow seniors:

>Friends,  
>  
>A few of my undergraduate classmates are offering to rent their rooms to the families of seniors during graduation weekend. If your family needs a place to stay right near campus during that weekend let me know!  
>  
>Thanks!

I sent both emails and then headed out to track practice.

When I got home 4 hours later I had over 400 emails in my inbox.

I ended up tiering the pricing based on location, cleanliness, ability to provide linens and amount of rooms. I paid out about $35 per room per night on average and I did a three night minimum for everyone. Graduation weekend is quite an ordeal so that was pretty standard anyway.

I rented the rooms at about $100 per room per night. This was a big savings over hotels but the guests had to be okay with a dirty apartment and bringing their own linens for the most part. But they got to stay in the heart of the action and save a lot of money.

I set low expectations for the renters. I told them it would be dirty. I told them it would be sweaty. I told them to bring linens and cleaning supplies if they wanted to.

I strictly told all of the underclassmen to clean their apartments very well. I sent them detailed checklists. I did the best I could to make sure it would be presentable.

As soon as I collected payment from the senior I would pay the underclassman and connect them on email telling them to organize the key hiding and check out stuff. I kept a few apartments extra in case of emergency and ended up using one of them so I'm glad I did that.

Overall I brokered about 60 rooms and cleared about $10,000.

558,d9ybp5,False,,188,How I lost over £50k at 21 when my business failed.,Entrepreneur,"*This is the true account of what happened and it made me uncomfortable to write, even after all this time. It stirred up a lot of bad memories, but if it helps one person then it was worth it. I'm sorry if it's a bit wordy!* 

For a long time now, I’ve had a favourite saying; “It’s not a failure as long as you’ve learnt something”. 

Well, I’m now thirty-five, and I’ve already learnt a lot. I’m going to share some of what I’ve learnt with you. I’m not doing this to preach, or even instruct. I’m doing it for myself, and for anyone that might come across this article on the back of a recent setback. I need to give you a bit of background first, so I'm sorry if this goes on a bit!

In 2002, after completing a two-year programming course at college, I took a year out from education and started working in a local art gallery. I’d work all week, mostly in sales, enjoying the feeling of having money in my pocket and being able to go out at the weekends. The twelve months passed quickly, and it was soon time to leave for university. 

I lasted three months.

The course was dull and in no way challenging. I kept thinking about how much I missed my girlfriend, and how much I’d enjoyed my job. Making a big sale gave me such a rush, and here I was, sitting through stuffy old lectures. I jacked it all in and returned home, to my old job. But it wasn’t going to last, I’d woken a powerful desire for finding new challenges. 

Six months after returning home, in May 2002, I decided to start my own business. Having experience working in an art gallery, it seemed like the ideal industry to start in. It was the easiest option.

I found a tatty old shop in a neighbouring town and set about renovating it myself. We covered everything in wallpaper and filler, and it didn’t look too bad when we’d finished. I’d already managed to get a £6,000 loan from the bank which I spent on stock and a few shop fittings. 

I’d opened the doors by the end of May, but I didn’t really know what I was doing. I had no business plan, marketing plan, cash flow forecast or operational budget. I didn’t have any staff and was working seven days a week. 

Despite this, I had a reasonably successful first year’s trading. My best month was about £6500, and our margin was over 50% so this was good for a new business being run by an inexperienced, ill-prepared and over-confident twenty-year-old. But it didn’t last, many of my customers started buying from online galleries. My quiet months starting eating all the money I made in the busy months. I was earning a lot less than minimum wage, and it was impossible to take time off.

It was around this time that I decided I wanted the enterprise to be larger. I wanted to up my game, to start selling art for thousands instead of hundreds. I needed more. I would be able to pay myself more money, take on staff and not have to be hands on all the time.

I started talking to my suppliers about my plans and they thought it was a marvellous idea (of course they did!). I found a space I liked, and despite expert advice that it was in a low footfall area, I signed the lease. Somehow, I managed to convince the bank to lend me another £20,000 (still without a business plan!).

Eighteen months after opening my first gallery, I opened my second. It was four times the size of the first one, with overheads to match. It makes me cringe to think about it now. I had a grand opening with bubbly and nibbles, the week before Christmas. Almost immediately, it became apparent that I should have taken the expert’s advice. I was only a few metres from the high street but it might as well have been miles. I started ordering ridiculously priced full-page ads in glossy magazines and advertising on bus stops trying to raise awareness of my gallery. I dropped 10,000 leaflets to newly built houses and advertised on local radio.

To be fair, I had some awesome weeks. I’d sell thousands of pounds worth of art to just a handful of customers. But then I wouldn’t make another sale for days. It was depressing.

Six months later, I closed my first gallery (just two years after opening), to concentrate on the new one. I'd neglected the first gallery (the one that was breaking even) to spend more time on the new one. 

Things went from bad to worse when I figured out that I hadn’t made enough money to cover my third quarter rent payment, so I went back to the bank, but they turned me down for another loan. To be fair, I was already into them for £31,000 at this point. Seeing the fix I was in, my father offered to lend my £20,000, which I gladly accepted (he didn’t have this money, he took out a loan to cover it).

I know what you’re thinking. Why did you pour more money into the hole? I can’t really answer that, I just felt I had already committed so much that I couldn’t walk away. Also, I was twenty-one and thought I knew better than everyone else.

This is where things get crazy. I didn’t change anything; I just carried on as before, hoping against hope that the situation would resolve itself. 

The money lasted six months; I managed to stay open until Christmas, hoping that a decent festive season would allow me to hang on a bit longer. But I failed to make nearly enough sales and closed my doors for the last time on Christmas Eve (just over a year after opening).

I was 21, with over £50,000 of debt, £20,000 of that was owed to my father. I had four years left on my lease, at a cost of £15,000 a year. I hadn’t made any plans for this outcome and I didn’t have any idea about what to do.

My landlord took pity on me, and let me walk out of the lease, but the repayments on my loans were close to £900 a month. The day after I closed my business, I rang an employment agency and landed a shift job in a local factory. Within a week, I’d gone from art gallery entrepreneur to working on a production line in a factory. I started doing a lot of overtime, often doing six twelve-hours in a row, have one off, and then do another six days. It was mind numbing work, but I was overpaying my loans and keeping my head above water.

My confidence had taken a serious hit and my credit rating was in the toilet. I did two years in the factory, always doing overtime and odd jobs on the side. It was a pretty grim part of my life. I drank too much and was smoking twenty cigarettes a day. Nearly everything I earned was used to repay my debts, and I was constantly exhausted. I blamed everyone but myself for my situation. It was pitiful.

The pain of my failure gradually started to recede, and my confidence gradually began to return. I felt that old desire for a challenge. I thought about starting several different ventures, but I was still a shadow of my former self, and still had a fair bit of debt. I was quite lost for a while until one day I walked into an Armed Forces Careers Office.

The recruiting staff can spot lost souls a mile off, they’re trained for it and they gobbled me up. I’d already decided I wasn’t a good fit for the Army, and I didn’t fancy long spells at sea, so the RAF seemed like the natural choice. I breezed through the application process, and at twenty-four, I left for basic training.

Basic training and technical training were a challenge, both mentally and physically. After completing nearly 18 months of training, The RAF had given me my confidence back, and made me fit and healthy in the process. I was ready for my first posting.

It didn’t go to plan. After all the training, I was given a job answering a phone and watching a screen for three years. I stuck it out, paying off the last of my debts and starting to experiment with entrepreneurial ideas. A lot of ideas came and went, most of them nothing more than dreams. The point is, I had come full circle back to the idea of making my own way in the world.

I eventually got out of the RAF and got back into running my own business. Ive been running the business for six years and it’s still going strong. Our turnover is growing, and we have a variety of projects in the pipeline to grow our business further. We’ve diversified and added complimentary income streams. We’ve built up some equity and improved the freehold building a lot over the time we’ve owned it. We’ve made it work. But that doesn’t mean there haven’t been more lessons to learn.

Over the years I’ve also tried subscription boxes, being an Amazon seller, self-publishing a novel, three separate e-commerce stores and a host of other weird and wonderful ideas, including farming oyster mushrooms (what was I thinking??). 

So, what did I learn from my failed art gallery business? Remember it cost me over £50,000 so it taught me a lot!

1. Don’t take the easy option. I didn’t open an art gallery because I saw a gap in the market; I did it because it was the easiest way to start a business. 

2. Make a plan. I came unstuck because I’d spent no time thinking about my business plan. I just did it and hoped for the best. Remember,  ""build it and they will come"" is not a business plan.

3. Start small and test the water. I did this to a certain extent, but one of my biggest mistakes was trying to be something greater than I was. I should have experimented more. I could have traded from a market stall or tried to share a space with a complimentary business.

4. Listen to the experts. Someone with experience told me that my gallery was too far from the high street and had too little footfall. I didn’t listen, and it cost me my business. I should have taken a smaller space in a busier location.

5. It’s NEVER too late to walk away. If I’d admitted to making a mistake earlier, I could have saved myself a lot of money. If you try something and it’s not working, then either change what you’re doing or drop it. Don’t just keep pouring money and time into something that you know is never really going to work.

6. Limit your liability. Make sure that if everything goes wrong, you don’t end up saddled with debt. I should have been trading as a limited company and I should have insisted on a 1 year break clause in my lease. I should have tried to get as much of my stock on consignment.

So what’s the point of all of this?

I wanted to let you know that I’ve taken some pretty big knocks on my entrepreneurial journey. But they’ve all taught me something, and I try to apply those lessons to my next venture. So if your first, or tenth, business isn't successful, don't give up. Learn what you can from the experience and move on.

I won’t stop testing out new business ideas, and I don’t think I could even if I wanted to. I’m certain at least some of these ideas will turn into more “lessons” but that’s how we grow.

511,gqanwf,False,Case Study,94,0-20k email subscribers in a year. How I promote content online.,Entrepreneur,"May 2019. I wrote my first marketing article. A year later my email list hit **20,000**.

No ads. No connections. No existing audience.

The site grew because I learnt how to push my content round the internet.

**Here's the process**

First, you found all the different places where your audience hangs out. For me, it's marketers: *Facebook Groups, Slack Groups, Subreddits, LinkedIn, Growth Hackers, Indie Hackers, Twitter ...*

Then, I asked myself, “how can I add value **directly** to these platforms?”

Adding value isn't dumping links. People are busy. You wow them on the platform they're **already** using. Or you get ignored.

There's no “one-size-fits-all” formula. Twitter is not Facebook. You tailor your content to fit each platform.

**The specifics**

Twitter, Reddit and Indie Hackers are places where **long-form sharing** works.

My strategy is simple. I share my whole article. Then, I politely ask if the reader would like to join my email list.

Facebook and Slack groups are a different ball game. Attention spans are shorter. Self-promoters get lynched. I break my articles into visual tips. Subtly branding each one. Upfront value. No hard sell.

Then, there's a bunch of sites where I share direct links: Hacker News, Designer News, Growth Hackers, Zest.is. Same principle applies. *Tailor content to fit the platform.* For example: 

Hacker News → *How Nike sold its first shoes*  
Growth Hackers → *5 marketing lessons from how Nike sold its first 50000 shoes*

The whole process takes me 8 hours. 4 hours posting. 4 hours replying.

**The snowball effect**

How *other people* share your content is just as important as how *you* share it.

You don't want people sharing *different things* on *different platforms*. You want everyone sharing the *same thing* on the *same platform*.

Isolated sharing gets ignored. Concentrated sharing compounds.

So at the end of each article and newsletter I'll write something like, “If you enjoyed this, and you're feeling generous perhaps like or retweet [the thread](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1263831025240719362) on Twitter”. 50 retweets turns into 500.

**Putting it all together**  ([Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/paul5.png))

1. Create value on other platforms.
2. Transfer *this value* to your own platform.
3. Store value with your email list.

Email subscribers are gold bars in the bank.

New media rise and fall. Email isn’t going anywhere. It’s been around longer. It will survive longer. *Medium* can't paywall it. It's the best place to build an audience online.

**Newsletter subscribers by source**

* Twitter - 5.8k
* Product Hunt - 2k
* Reddit - 1.8k
* Indie Hackers - 1.6k
* Facebook - 700
* LinkedIn - 500
* Slack Groups - 250
* Hacker News - 800
* Other link sharing sites - 450

That comes to **13,900**. And then the rest are organic traffic and word of mouth.

It's not rocket science: The platforms where I add the most value **upfront** are the platforms that generate the most new subscribers.

*People are busy. Don't redirect them. Wow them.*

**One last thing ...**

The best self-promoters aren't self-promoters. They take the time to become a *genuine* member of each community.

Share others' content. Write detailed comments. Make friends.

Give more than you take. It's a positive-sum game.

879,5ec820,False,,310,"UPDATE: I created a cheap flights email list (Scott’s Cheap Flights) with ~250,000 subscribers in 12 months. AMA!",Entrepreneur,"Dearest r/entrepreneur,

Here with the 4th update on my cheap flights email subscription service. For the curious, here are updates [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/45ap9i/update_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/), and [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4kpo2l/update_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/).

**Tl;dr:** I run a freemium email list that alerts people when a really good international flight deal pops up. I started it by popular demand from friends after I used my cheap-flight-finding-obsession to get $130 roundtrip flights from NYC to Milan in 2013. (you can check it out [here](https://scottscheapflights.com/) if you're interested, but zero pressure!)

**General updates:**

* By popular demand, we expanded to [Australia](https://scottscheapflights.com/en-au/) and [New Zealand](https://scottscheapflights.com/en-nz/) a few months ago and already have been featured on [Australian TV](https://www.facebook.com/9Finance/videos/671086633042446). Adding country-specific landing pages has also streamlined user experience and (hopefully) increased conversions by using relevant copy and correct currencies.

* We also just expanded to [Europe](https://scottscheapflights.com/europe-launch/) last week! We're using a refer-a-friend program to encourage signups. So far 1/3 of our Europe subscribers are coming from referrals.

* When I last checked in 6 months ago, we had 6,230 premium subscribers and 53,547 free subscribers. Today, we’re at 22,649 premium subscribers (364% increase) and 223,528 free subscribers (417% increase).

* We’re now up to 5 team members on Scott’s Cheap Flights! Anyone who knows me knows I’m not a businessman and never really had entrepreneurial aspirations, so it feels super weird to be the “boss.” *shudders just saying the word out loud*

* Churn is increasing, though still only at ~1%. I guess it’s inevitable when any business grows to this size, but I remember a time less than 12 months ago when basically nobody unsubscribed. I just want to give people cheap flights, is that so wrong? :-(

* I was quite reluctant initially to offer Paypal as a payment method, preferring to keep things simple and just process everything through Stripe. But, the number of people requesting it kept increasing so a few months ago we finally acquiesced. Turns out I was wrong. Now, 32.33% of premium subscribers pay via Paypal.

**Major sources of new subscribers:**

* Word of mouth. It sounds hokey, but I can’t stress enough how many people have come to SCF from a friend or family member’s recommendation. Part of this is providing people value with a good product (I hope!) and a *huge* part is our rock-star customer service specialist who gets back to anyone who emails within a matter of hours. I like to think this gives a personal, non-corporate touch.

* Brian, my partner who specializes in business development, was crunching some numbers and found something interesting: people who had been on the free list for more than two months almost never upgraded to the paid list. With this in mind, he came up with a simple but brilliant idea: offer a free month-long premium trial to those longtime free subscribers. The results are [pretty remarkable](http://imgur.com/a/MlKpu).

* Media appearances always provide a nice little boost ([Conde Nast Traveler](http://www.cntraveler.com/story/flight-deal-spend-valentines-day-in-italy-from-360-round-trip), [Time](http://time.com/money/4527174/the-best-travel-deal-sites-according-to-a-consumer-advocate/), [Virgin](https://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/running-business-people-youve-never-met), various radio shows and podcasts), but unless they go viral, the impact of any one hit is pretty marginal.

* We did another giveaway of two free flights. Not quite as successful, at least by percentages, as last time. Still, it added 30,000 new free subscribers.

* Reddit. An AMA I did with some other travel experts a couple months ago ended up bringing in 70,000 new free subscribers.

**Moving forward/Advice needed**

* Should we raise prices? I’m firmly committed to keeping everyone grandfathered at current rates, so no worries if you’re already subscribed! But curious if you guys have any advice about how to evaluate whether or not to raise prices. (Current subscription rates are $15 for 3 months, $25 for 6 months, and $39 for 12 months, and we last raised them on June 1, 2016.)

* Imitators. I know I know, the most sincere form of flattery. Still, frustrating. Anyone have experience with how to handle copycats? Should I just ignore?

* Sneak peek: in the next few weeks we’re gonna roll out a new feature: allowing premium subscribers to choose specific cities/airports they want alerts from, rather than having to get them from entire regions. Hoping it increases customer satisfaction!

&#x200B;

This is going to be a weird post, but I don't know where to begin. Please bear with me.

I am a 28 year old recovering drug addict who has been fired from 15 different jobs between ages 18-25. I've been clean for 5 years. I have never finished high school because I had to drop out in Grade 10 to work.

4 and a half years ago, I got tired of being fired from assorted bartending/restaurant jobs because I had a tendency to fly too close to the sun and always want to advance/move into management before I was ready. So one day, I decided that screw it, I am going to start my own business.

I'm part of a sub-culture that has a fairly niche market however one with deep pockets. Being a part of this sub-culture, I wanted to realize my dreams of opening my own clothing line. So in 2016, I opened my doors and began selling t-shirts. They sat on a shelf in my small living room shared with other roommates. I was ecstatic packing up 10 orders or so a week. Hand-written notes, thank you cards, it was amazing. Not nearly enough to live on, but it was something. I was bartending in the meantime.

Fast forward to the end of 2018 - I finally was busy enough to quit bartending, and pursue this full-time. It was awesome, though very bare bones for quite some time. We expanded into more clothes, designs, our socials were growing. It was amazing.

Fast forward to now... I just had a month with $90,000 USD in sales. I'm packing 40-60 orders a day. For the year so far, I've done $294,000 USD in sales. Given how things are going, it is very likely we'll hit $1 million this year in sales.

**Here's the thing; I have absolutely no idea how to proceed. I know this might sound arrogant/tone-deaf to some, but I am clueless as to what running a business is actually like. Do I know the basics? Sure. But as far as the details go of running a business, I am clueless. And I think I need to figure this out before it gets any bigger.**

\-

When I say I am far behind, I'll list examples of what I mean:

1. **I am the sole employee.** Everything done for the business is run through my hands. Website maintenance, packing orders, inventory management, you name it. I work 80+ hour weeks regularly.
2. **I do not understand how I'm supposed to pay myself.** For 4 and a half years now, it has always been ""Alright, well I'll transfer money from my business account to my personal one when I need to pay bills or buy something."" It has always been a case of ""As long as I've got money, that's fine."" No management whatsoever.
3. **I do not have an accountant, and didn't pay taxes for 3 years.** My taxes are sorted NOW.. But I have never paid GST before. I don't understand how taxes work. I'm in talks with one right now and hopefully I can solve that going forward.
4. **I have not paid for advertising, ever.** AdSpresso? HootSuite? All those programs people are supposed to use for advertising? Never. Facebook advertising? No clue. I think utilizing these programs could be beneficial, but hell if I know how to use them. I have a strong word of mouth and social media following, but that's from working on the ground. **I also don't know what the hell Google Analytics does but I've heard that my rate of people searching directly for us is, quote, 'the envy of any online retailer'.**
5. **I still work out of my home.** I now rent my own house by myself. But the stock levels I have are INSANE. I cannot fit any more in here, it has taken over my house. I have 2.5 tonnes of merchandise coming in, mid-July. I actually don't know where they'll be going.
6. **I have never taken out a loan.** Hell, I don't know how to.
7. **I have zero idea what my costs are, versus my profit, or my margins, or any of that stuff.** Like I said earlier in the payment part, as long as more money was coming in than was going out, I never paid any attention to it.
8. **I have zero frame of reference for how I'm performing, or what others in similar positions to me are doing.** I have zero entrepreneurial friends. I don't know if I'm doing good, or horrible. I have no one to bounce ideas off of, or people to get suggestions from. I have no one to talk shop with. I've basically been doing this all from my house, by myself, for years now.

\-

Those are just.. SOME, of the many examples I can provide about how clueless I am with where to go or how to start fine-tuning. If I had to sum it up plainly...

I've been doing this for so long by myself that I feel stuck and trapped about how to move forward. I have no clue what missed opportunities I have because of my cluelessness and am not sure how to proceed. Do I find a business partner? Are there people who help people in my situation? How do I know if I'm doing okay?

The weight of these constant frustrations is starting to stress me to the point of almost being unable to function. I know this might sound tone deaf - How can things be bad, if sales are so good? - but the amount of stress it is causing me is insane.

Just.. What resources are there? How can I get on the right track? Are there people to talk to who can help you? (Paid or otherwise). I guess all in all, my question boils down to.. How do I start the conversations with people about this situation, and how to move forward? Who knows what's up? Who can talk shop? Because going solo for this long has done a number on my mental health.

&#x200B;

EDIT: It's worth noting, since I have seen many others citing it, that I have NOT been impacted by Covid-19 - Sales are growing faster than ever before.

&#x200B;

EDIT EDIT: I guess also, the biggest question is; how does one GET a mentor?

497,g0fwh1,False,Feedback Please,146,Interest in these topics is skyrocketing 🚀(COVID opportunities),Entrepreneur,"The impact of COVID-19 extends to how people are searching online. I thought to measure what the impact caused by the global economic downturn is by tracking online searches.

I analyzed what people in the US searched online in the past month and how their interest shifted week by week.

If people are searching for these things, it means there's demand and a market opportunity you might want to pursue.

# What people are searching

People went from searching for keywords related to protection (*sanitizers*, *anti-viral masks*, *immunity boosters*, etc) to searching keywords related to essentials (yes, *toilet paper* was searched a lot =).

Then, they begin searching for DIY ways to make them (for example, keywords like *DIY masks*, *how to make shampoo at home* are still trending).

Later on, with the quarantine, people started to be at home. We found that they were searching for ways to work better (everything related to *remote working*, or *smart working*) and ways to entertain themselves and their kids (for example, *board games, at-home workouts*, etc).

Now, they are also searching for ways to stay in touch with their families (for example, keywords like *Zoom* or *Skype* are trending).

They are now also searching for medical devices that are portable and that they can use at home to monitor their health situation (for example, o*xymeters*).

# Non-obvious trends

Aside, from the analysis above, here are some more non-obvious trends that are emerging:  


1. **Loungewear 👕**

Because of COVID-19, people are self-isolating at home and they are looking forward to donning their finest loungewear for another Netflix binge-watch session on the sofa.

Loungewear had an increment of over 90% in search interest in the last days and it's steadily growing.

2. **Prepping 🛅**

Prepping often refers to the act of preparing yourself for life during and after an apocalyptic event. Basically, it means that you are ready to live unplugged from the system.

It has always been part of the *survival* niche, but now it's getting more and more attention even from non-believers because of the coronavirus emergency.

3. **Composting for beginners** ♻️

People are all about composting now. Why?

More and more cities are shutting down drop-off services because of the urgent steps required to bend the curve on coronavirus transmissions, like social distancing.

These drop-off services include food scrap drop-off, household hazardous waste drop-off, compost giveback, electronics recycling, and textile donations and recycling.

4. **Gardening** 🌷

There's a growing interest in gardening, which is also obviously related to composting. Check out keywords like *gardening*, *gardening for beginners*, *garden beds, raised garden beds.*

5. **Barbell weight set 🏋🏻‍♂️**

With more and more people at home, gym equipment is getting a ton of interest. Barbell weight set registered a +22% increment this month!

Also look keywords like *weight plates*, *resistance bands*, *dumbells,* *home gym*, *no equipment workout*, *p90x*, *peloton*.

Aside from this, solitary fitness activities are also trending upward. For example, look at *hiking*.

6. **Online will 📝**

Keywords like ""*how to make a will online*"" are getting demand, as *online will* in general. With COVID-19, people are eager to put their things in order, just in case.

7. **Calming care 🐶**

Not related to corona, but in the pet category, I would get in the game of selling everything anxiety related. For example, the demand for *dog calming care* has been growing steadily over the last 5 years. It could be related to two types of anxiety: from separation, but also from fireworks.

8. **iRacing Setups, Adult coloring books, Puzzles, Board games 🏎**

People are at home, and they want to play. All of the above are great activities for leisure.

9. **CVC Words, Directed drawing 👶🏻**

Schools are closed, kids are at home. That means that parents are probably home-schooling them now. Interest in everything related to home-schooling is getting traction.

10. **Dalgona Coffee ☕️**

*Dalgona coffee* is the trend in coffee right now. I don't personally know what the hype is about, but it's a whipped drink made with coffee, sugar and chilled milk.

11. **Canned wine 🍷**

Ok, last one - in the food & nutrition space: *canned wine*. Being an Italian, I'd never sell such a thing, but hey, demand has been growing a lot.

12. **Virtual pranks 🤪**

With more people working from home remotely, virtual pranks are also trending right now. Check out keywords like *zoom pranks*, *zoom bombing*.

13. **Milk baths** 🛁

Not a corona trend, a *milk bath* is a bath taken in milk instead of water. Often other scents such as honey, rose, daisies and essential oils are added. Milk baths use lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, to dissolve the proteins which hold together dead skin cells. It has been steadily growing in the past 5 years.

You heard about these trends here first! =)

So update. Last week, Literally eight days ago, I posted in here thanking this subreddit for being awesome and giving me a source of inspiration to quit my job. Well, I did. I put in my two week notice, two weeks ago. My last day at my 9-5 is Friday. 

Well, my CEO found out that I started my own company, a digital marketing firm, and he's fucking pissed. I mean, literally pissed. I'm his top talent on all of his companies biggest accounts, and now he's losing me. Not just that, he thinks I'll be competitor. 

The digital marketing firm I currently work at really has a unique client base and has a STRONG focus on big data, insights, and social listening. My new company is all about strategy, content marketing, SEO, and digital growth strategies. Plus, I would never go after my current companies clients. I am a man of integrity. 

Anyways, my CEO called a meeting with me at 3pm MST. He's a lunatic, and has a real bad history at freaking out on employees when they leave.

Well, my reddit friends - I think I'm getting fired two days early, and I'm sure he will threaten a bullshit non-compete. 

You guys kick ass. Fuck corporate. 




UPDATE NUMBER ONE: 

Meeting only lasted 30 minutes. My CEO is old school corperate. Like the type of guy that still uses the terms ""ABC"" (Always be closing) and ""Blood Build"" (1980's sales term). 

He was red in the face. He said I was attacking his company and that he might ""want to get revenge"". I'm assuming he means via a non-compete. 

He also told me what I was committing a ""felony"". When I asked him what felony I was committing he said well, ""not a legal felony, a business felony"". 

Long story short- He's fucking pissed, as projected. I kept my cool. I was professional. I didn't try and reason with a madman either. He didn't fire me (I know how disappointing), but he was very demeaning and disrespectful. I still didn't get a solution as to ""what he will end up doing"", but I'm sure there will be something. Just how big or how small, who the hell knows. This guy runs a 40 million dollar a year company and thinks he's fucking Steve Jobs and his products and services are like ""Apple"" . He's very disillusion.

504,gdtfz3,False,Case Study,316,How I made $103K passive income in 2 years with Adsense,Entrepreneur,"In the last 2 years, I made $103K+ on Google Adsense. One of the main factors for this earnings is the large number of pageviews and the account RPM (Revenue per 1000 pageviews) of $9+. With a total pageviews of 11.4 million, completely driven by Google organic search traffic.

The purpose of this post is to encourage more people to take up digital marketing / blogging as a viable source of income and to assure struggling bloggers that they too can achieve success by working consistently and by continuous learning and optimization.

**How I made $103K in last 2 years?**

The strategy is rather simple. I started to create directory websites and websites for cities. By launching one new website every 2 months, I created a small network of websites catering to several cities. The websites provide all kind of information about the city – transport, entertainment, guides, how-tos, directory (yellow pages), news etc. With a total of 20+ websites and each of them bringing in $100-$300 every month, the total income in any month is always above $5000. One of my website is for Dubai City – [YourDubaiGuide.com](https://yourdubaiguide.com) and it averages 30-50K pageviews in a month and brings in around $250-$400 monthly. Similarly, I have created and maintain websites for several other cities using the same strategy.

These kind of websites start slow, the traffic starts picking up in 3-6 months and starts providing decent income from a year, provided the website is regularly updated (daily) with relevant content. It is not difficult to come up with original content if one takes time to do some research. For example, my recent article about [“10 things to do at home during lockdown”](https://yourdubaiguide.com/10-things-to-do-at-home-during-lockdown/) took about 2 hours to research, come up with my own ideas and to write the article.

**Focus on Content Strategy**

I have never done any sort of link building activity. All my backlinks were acquired organically over a period of time. As Google says, content indeed is king and if we focus on providing curated content to users, Google is happy to send organic search traffic to our websites. By keeping an eye on the news websites and other competitor websites, it is rather easy to arrive at what kind of content needs to be covered in the website.

**Measure and Optimize**

Keep an eye on Google Analytics reports every day and observe the patterns, which content works well on which days. Patterns can be observed over days, weeks, months or even years. For example, my Dubai website always gets more traffic during the peak travel season in Dubai (Nov-Apr). By observing trends and creating content anticipating the upward trends, one can always ensure that there is always fresh content being published and monetized.

For starters, I would strongly recommend that they start with a single website and focus only on it and it will have the potential to bring in a few thousand dollars a month. And the key here is to create websites targeting cities in developed economies, which provides a higher CPC/RPM.

**Mistakes to Avoid**

Being from India and living in Chennai, I started websites focusing on Indian cities and academic institutions initially in 2011. Though those websites brought in good volume of traffic, the RPM of Indian market was around $1-$3, which did not amount to much, all things considered. When I stopped focusing on Indian market and started to target United Kingdom, the returns were 3X ($9-$12) RPM for the same effort. Since then I gradually shutdown all my Indian websites and started to focus exclusively on websites targeting developed economies.

One would normally assume that it would be difficult to have a website for a city that we have never seen. But that is not really the case. Do try out, and you will find it actually easy.

Edit: 

1. With the number of comments about using the word ""passive"", I am sorry about that. I used the term passive because I get most of my content written by writers who work for me and it is passive for me. 

2. And I should clarify further that this only a part-time venture and I have a different day job.

3. Writers are paid a total of $300 per month. Server costs are about $200 per month. On average, the operational costs are about 10% of the revenue.

4. Some people were asking for step by step guidance to get started with blogging. I made small 7-page PDF document last year for this. Feel free to download a copy here:

If you're not familiar with the rat race, read the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. There, you will have a better understanding of this term. 

I will describe it as: Having to wake up and “go to work” everyday, or **trading your “time” for “money”** 

I would consider myself extremely wealthy. Not in terms of finances however, in terms of overall morale. I make my own schedule, I pick up checks on a weekly basis, and I have amazing employees that help make all of this possible. 

My background is in sales, restaurant management, and banking. I’m 25, and at this point I could do what I’m doing for the rest of my life and be completely satisfied. (although I wouldn’t, I’m always looking to improve) 

I own a residential painting company, and as of now, we are operating with two crews, and are projected to gross about $750,000 annually with this model. Of that, there will be a 25-28% net profit margin after salaries. 

**The freedom that comes along with not having to physically be present while your business is operating is something truly amazing.** It’s truly what entrepreneurship is all about, and my dream is that anyone with enough willpower, belief, and fortitude to make it happen has the chance to experience it. 

For me, I did it through house painting. It was something **I could learn how to do**, something that was **in high demand**, and something that **provided value to the marketplace**. I call those the big 3. 

For you, you could do it with anything that lines up with those three! But you and I both know you know that... the **hardest part of it all is taking action.**

So, what did I do to take action? I had a logo made and made business cards. For me, this helped **bring my vision to life**! I felt excited about it. 

Next, I made a website. Nowadays, making a website is ridiculously easy. I had fun putting together my site! **(I did all of this while sitting at my bank job desk (**in between clients, and always during downtime) 

After that, **I committed myself**. I set a time on when I was going to take the leap, and set a budget on how much I needed to save to do so. 

I **learned** everything I could about the painting industry, I **read** books on entrepreneurship, and **joined** forums and communities. 

Three years ago, I was making about $45,000 at a bank, working 9-5, sometimes 11-8, wishing I had enough confidence to take the leap. Now, I sit here, typing on my office computer, on a Monday at around 3:00PM, after just going for a jog around the block. Life’s really good. And it can be for you to!

724,ddx1lg,False,,43,How can you design or invent a new product ? An approach used by many of the big companies on the SP 500 list.,Entrepreneur,"In 1980s a Japanese professor named Noriaki Kano developed a model for product design to meet a high level of customer satisfaction. 

The model, ***in short***, goes like this : 

Every product should have a 3 levels of attributes or features. and these 3 levels of attributes are : 

**1- The First Level (this is what the customers expect to be there and it MUST be there) :** the product in this level should have all the basic attributes or features that a customer expect to receive. An example would be - hotels are expected to have clean sheets and hot water . you never see a hotel advertising that they also have a hot water right? .. cause it is a basic feature that the customer expect to see. 

**2-  The Second Level (this is what the customer expect to be there but it is not necessary to have it) :** an example would be a swimming pool or full equipped gym room. if the Hotel has a big gym room, that would be great, but if they have small gym, the customers are still satisfied with the hotel. These are the features that the hotel would advertise about normally. 

**3- The Third Level (this is where you have a feature that the customer doesn't know or except to be there ) :** this feature works as a surprise and it will take increase your costumer satisfaction up to the roof. This is where the luxury level is located. imagine you booked a room at the hotel to be surprised with an exclusive ticket to your favorite show or something else that you did not expect at all. this is the level where you create a very loyal customers and make yourself unique compared to your competition. 

There is a problem in the first level though. this problem is that the cost of investment is very high but the reward is very low. Meaning, for example, you need to invest tons of money on the heating system so the customer in the 10th floor room of the hotel get hot water instantly once they open the faucet. if they got the hot water very quickly, no one goes around thanking you your efforts and the tons of money your spent to make that possible. BUT if they did not get the hot water instantly, you will receipt a lot of bad reviews. 

imagine if the toilet was not working. the customers will rain you with bad reviews but if it works properly. no one will mention it. that is why you need to be careful on Level 1. the Cost of the investment is high but the reward unfortunately is too low. 

 BUT Sometimes, even if you screw up on the first level you still can get satisfied customers. that happened with the **Iphone** when it was launched first time. When Apple launched the Iphone first time they used AT&T as a carrier. the service was so bad that sometimes you can not even make a phone call in most of the country. imagine that you buy a phone but you cant use to make phone calls which the most basic feature that the customer expect. 

what saved the Iphone ass is the fact they had the third level features. Compared with the other phones in the market at that time, the iphone provided features that the customer did not expect such as many apps , iTunes, Touch screen and beautiful futuristic design. Even though most customers had problem with making phone calls, they still loved the product.

324,dro8lg,False,,99,How Volvo won the Super Bowl (without running an ad),Entrepreneur,"On the 1st February 2015, car companies Toyota, Lexus, Nissan, Kia and Fiat each spent **$4.5M** on a 30 second Super Bowl commercial. Yet, somehow, it was Volvo, with no Super Bowl ad, and 1/15th of the budget, who stole the limelight.

Their idea was both simple and genius:

Whenever you saw **any other car commercial** during the Super Bowl you could win a Volvo XC 60 for a loved one. All you had to do was was tweet why they deserved the car using the hashtag #VolvoContest during the commercial.

Volvo’s “interception” was the ultimate troll. It shifted eyeballs **from rival commercials to Twitter** where the conversation was all about Volvo. And it worked:

* More than **55,000** people used the hashtag #VolvoContest
* Volvo was the only automobile company to trend globally
* More than **100** different stories were written about the stunt

The result was a **70%** increase in Volvo XC 60 sales the following month.

# WHY DID IT WORK?

Well, firstly, Volvo made sure to **build awareness**. Two days before the game they donated an XC 60 to “Jimmy Kimmel Live”. He gave it away on his show and in return spread the word about their contest.

Secondly, they decided to run the giveaway **exclusively on Twitter**. This allowed momentum to build (unlike sending people directly to a competition website).

And finally, targeting rival commercial slots was quite the masterstroke. It resulted in **30 second** windows of hyperactivity on Twitter. This led to the [\#VolvoContest](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23volvocontest)%20until%3A2015-02-02%20since%3A2015-02-01&src=recent_search_click) hashtag trending on 3 separate occasions. A slower, consistent stream of tweets would never hit the velocity required to trend.

**Edit**: Some people in the comments are obsessing over ""impressions"". **Impressions ≠ Engagement**. Of course, more people saw the ads of the companies who paid $4.5M for a Super Bowl slot. But Volvo's **engagement** was considerably better. And that's far more relevant.

Anyways, thank you for reading.

202,c9ex6s,False,,249,PSA: Avoid GoDaddy for registering domains and web hosting.,Entrepreneur,"I had the unpleasant experience of using GoDaddy recently for a web design client and it made me appreciate that I was told to avoid the company 6 years ago when I began digital entrepreneurship. Why?

&#x200B;

* Overpriced: Much cheaper alternatives for all their digital services offered elsewhere.
* Poor performance: Terrible offerings in comparison to cheaper alternatives.
* Terrible User Experience: Their UI is awful! so complicated and convoluted.
* Terrible Support: I had a minor issue that required direct contact with GoDaddy to resolve. I had to wait on hold for 50 minutes before I could speak to tech support and they didn't fix the issue. Even after assuring me they would fix the problem I had to call them again and listen to their awful hold music for another 30 minutes to resolve the issue.

&#x200B;

Please do some research before committing to a hosting and domain provider. Don't make the mistake of thinking GoDaddy is the best option because it is the biggest company.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

**Since some of you have been asking what my suggestions would be, I will try to offer up my knowledge on the topic and give you my suggested choices. If you know a good provider let everyone know in the comments.**

&#x200B;

You generally want to avoid using one provider for domains, hosting, and email. Sometimes this may work out cheaper and there are exceptions to when this is a good idea. In most cases, it is best to keep it all separate, as there is no explicit benefit to having domains, hosting and email all handled by one provider.

&#x200B;

**For domains:**

&#x200B;

Namecheap: .**com from $8.88 (sometimes you can get .com for $1 the first year with KINGCOM promo code**

My personal choice and that of many professionals in the industry. You can't go wrong with Namecheap. Speak to anyone who has used them and you will know they offer solid support with all the functionality you could ever need for your site. Their pricing is fair and honest, you won't see any surprise charges appearing on your account at the end of the year.

&#x200B;

Google Domains: **.com from $12**

I have heard good things about Google domains and they may be a serious contender if your company is using gsuite already. Although the process isn't difficult to point your MX records to Google, Namecheap even does it automatically with one click.

&#x200B;

Ultimately a domain is a domain and you want to purchase it for a fair price, point it to your servers and mail provider and forget it exists. I think Namecheap ticks all the boxes, but others will disagree. One thing to remember is that many providers (GoDaddy) will make it extremely difficult to get out of once you have purchased the domain through them. This may be fine while it works but as soon as you have a problem, your screwed. Just read the comments on this post and you'll see what I'm talking about.

&#x200B;

**For Hosting**

&#x200B;

This is a much more complex topic and one of much discussion and debate in the web development world. It will entirely depend on your technical ability, requirements, stack etc. I'll try and give my examples with some information into what use case it would be beneficial for and my own personal experiences. Just for the love of God, under no circumstances should you use GoDaddy.

&#x200B;

Cloudways (My choice for Wordpress hosting): **From $8p/m with black Friday code BLACK20 (still works)**

Cloudways have a range of managed hosting options available to users. I use them for all the Wordpress sites I host because the service is so great (for my needs) I have never felt unhappy with them. While there are better, cheaper options available for experienced webmasters, I personally find Cloudways does everything I need with great performance, speed, and price point. If you're looking for a one-click install of WordPress with all the features under one roof, cloudways makes it easy as hell. They simplify the whole process making it much quicker to get set-up and when I'm working with clients time is money.

&#x200B;

I used their basic $8 a month managed digital ocean droplet for years with no complaints from my clients. 

&#x200B;

* Unlimited Websites with one click WordPress installation
* Free SSL certificates for all websites
* Integrated CDN
* Good speeds
* Caching
* Support that actually care and go the extra mile (fixed things that they didn't have to on my WordPress site for free) 

&#x200B;

WPEngine: **Starts at $35 a month - you can find discount codes sometimes if you dig deep.**

 

A more beefy service for those of you who want better performance or have heavy traffic.

&#x200B;

I have used WPEngine on a clients site and have nothing but good things to say

&#x200B;

* All the benefits of Cloudways
* Great UI
* Simple set-up
* Great speeds

&#x200B;

One negative with WPengine is the price, for people starting out or with only a couple of sites, it probably not worth it.

&#x200B;

**For static HTML sites**

&#x200B;

Firebase: **FREE**

Github Pages: **FREE**

&#x200B;

Similar service offered by both these providers. Firebase is operated by Google and I use them for all my static websites. Unbelievably fast speeds. One of my sites on firebase loads in under a second with lots of JS - this is great for SEO now and I found this site ranks much better since I moved it off Wordpress.

&#x200B;

**For mail**

&#x200B;

GSUITE: My personal choice

644,ec8ror,False,Case Study,163,The story of my friends uncle and how he made millions sell gravel he didn't own,Entrepreneur,"The purpose of me recounting this is to inspire us to take advantage of the opportunities presented to us in life, my friends uncle (who we will call Mehmet) saw an opportunity, took advantage of it, and exploited it to its fullest extent over the course of 2 1/2 years.

Mehmet came from a somewhat poor turkish family and his family owned a little shop selling handmade stuff. Mehmet became the guy that would travel to Iraq to buy the stuff to sell. This was all pre-2003 and over the course of many years he got to develop a bit of a network in Iraq. Nothing noteworthy in his eyes, and he never grew so large as to gain any attention.

Then in March of 2003 America invaded Iraq. At first Mehmet thought his business was fucked, several of his suppliers had died, suppliers were down for the count. However Mehmet ended up getting on a US Military base in the early days of the invasion selling trinkets to soldiers. Think carpets, pipes, hand made stuff.

After some time he ran across a senior US Military officer who had a problem, they were building bases, and needed to build roads, but were having issues with getting enough gravel. Mehmet over the years have met some people and figured if they needed gravel he knew the right people to call.

So Mehmet told the officer he could them all the gravel they needed. Meetings where setup, agreements were reached. Mehmet was to get $2,000 per truck load of gravel. Mehmet called his contacts and made deals where he would pay roughly $200 per truck for every delivered truck of gravel.

And that was Mehmets new business, the US Military would ask Mehmet for X amount of gravel, Mehmet would make phone calls, arrange for the delivery, the US Military would pay him $2,000 a truck, he would turn around and pay the whoever delivered it to him $200 a truck  pocketing the $1,800.

Life was good

His customer the military got what they wanted

The Iraqi companies got paid what they considered a premium

Mehmet made a lot of money

This went on for a few months, after awhile Mehmet returned to Turkey seeing as he could manage his business from Turkey. He would occasionally travel to Iraq but said he was always scared he'd end up dead so he limited his travel to Iraq as much as possible.

He sold the US military thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands, of trucks of gravel. Each time pocketing $1,800 a truck.

At no point in any of this did Mehmet own a single truck, hire a single employee (outside of an accountant in Turkey), he never technically owned the gravel he sold, nor the place it came from. Mehmet was in truist sense of the word...a middleman. 

The only service he offered the US military was his ability to call the right people, to have the gravel delivered. Very quickly he had developed a number of sources for gravel.

Unfortunately for Mehmet after about 2 1/2 very lucrative years of pocketing $1,800 a truck the Iraqis and the US Military figured out that they could cut Mehmet out and both save and make more money. After Mehmet found himself cut off from his once lucrative business he decided to cash out, grab a plane to Jamaica and buy himself a nice beach side property and enjoy the finer things in life and retirement...in his 40s a very wealthy man.

I've met Mehmet, and the lessons he taught and the reason for me sharing this story is

* Take advantage of the opportunities presented to you
* Don't be afraid to pivot, he went from selling carpets and pipes to sell gravel
* When the going stops being so good, be prepared to move on and take your profits
* Take what you can get **Biggest Lesson Here**

**The price meeting**

When Mehmet went into the meeting with the US Military he didn't know much about gravel, but he did know this. Iraqis were desperate for work, and gravel was never that expensive. He had a price in his head of around $500 a truck. Knowing that'd he'd still make a very healthy profit. However one thing his dad taught him was to never speak first in a negotiation. So when the US military asked how much for a truck of gravel, he flipped it and had them name their price. When they said $2,000 he quickly agreed and promised a trouble free delivery.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/ec8ror/the_story_of_my_friends_uncle_and_how_he_made/,518,[removed] ,2019-12-18 06:16:21
70,gqufhl,False,,146,"I've been creating content on LinkedIn for 1.5 years, I came to share my learnings.",Entrepreneur,"Hey Guys,

I'm going to make it short and succinct.

I invested a lot of time in LinkedIn content marketing and it is generating results so far.

If you have a B2B product on a tight budget this miniguide can give you some ideas.

**Pros:** Requires zero $, can bring customers and puts you in always-on networking mode.

**Cons:** Requires consistency and time-investment.

I'll start with the LinkedIn algorithm first then get to the posting tips. You need to know few things before you post.

**Note:** Some people thought the post is about the ""articles"" on LinkedIn. But I'm talking about the regular posts only.

# LinkedIn Algorithm

Like every content platform, LinkedIn tries to show related quality content to the users. Also, they want to make sure to keep them on the platform as long as possible.

There are 3 things you should know:

From my observations, I noticed 3 things here:

**#1: The first 30-60 minutes of your content**

**Stage 1:** Every time you post, the LinkedIn feed algorithm scores it. Determines whether it’s low or high-quality post.

**Stage 2:** If it’s marked as high-quality content, it appears in the feed for a short time. Meanwhile, bots observe how your audience engages with your content.

**Stage 3:** If people in your network liked, commented or shared your post, LinkedIn, decides to take your post to the next level. Here the more engagement brings better results.

**Stage 4:** At this point, real people will review your content. They’ll check why your post is performing so well, whether there is anything spammy.

If not, they’ll keep showing your post in related channels and it’ll keep getting engagements. It continues like that for 48 hours (this is our observation) and it drops down very quickly.

(You can use LinkedIn pods or engagement communities to increase your engagement)

**#2: Posting at the right time**

As you see, more engagement=virality. It’s a good idea to post when people on your list are active.

According to [Hootsuite](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-the-linkedin-algorithm-works-hacks/):

* The best time to post on LinkedIn is 7:45 a.m., 10:45 a.m., 12:45 p.m., and 5:45 p.m. EST.
* The best day for B2B brands to post on LinkedIn is Wednesday (followed by Tuesday).
* The best days for B2C brands to post on LinkedIn are Monday and Wednesday.

Yes, these numbers are backed by data but every audience is different. If it’s not working for you, then stop and start testing with your guts.

**#3: Don’t include a link in your post**

What happens when you include a link to your post? People click and drift away from LinkedIn.

LinkedIn doesn’t want that and penalizes your post by showing it to fewer people. But there is a way to add links and avoid the penalty. Put your link in the first comment and voila. That’s it.

# Onwards to the content tips!

**#1: Write in a conversational rhythm and tone.**

People on LinkedIn are not wearing serious faces, they're pretty loose and like to read conversational tone.

Understand the harmony between long and short sentences, then write like you're writing a friend.

Write like you're talking.

Here is a legendary example from the author Gary Provost that explains the importance of flow. Love this.

[https://imgur.com/a/MiX7Fbr](https://imgur.com/a/MiX7Fbr)

**#2: Use simple words**

Big words don't make the writer look smarter and annoy the reader.

So be simple. Our brain always wants to preserve more energy. As a result, it chooses the easier option.

So, never **indicate** when you can **show**

Or **obtain** when you can **get**

Or **eliminate** when you can **get rid of**

You get the idea.

Plus, there will be lots of non-native speakers and readers in your network. So, be simple and get more engagement.

If you want to grade your text you can use[ Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to calculate your readability score.

**#3: Use the power of whitespace**

Long posts are scary. When you see a huge paragraph the first reaction is to run away from there.

Let’s make a comparison between short and long paragraphs. The content of two posts you’re going to see is identical.

Without whitespace: [https://imgur.com/a/cKboGX9](https://imgur.com/a/cKboGX9)

It is painful and hard to read, right?

But you can transform the same piece to snackable bits by using whitespace.Also, you’ll get the power of rhythm and flow together.

With whitespace: [https://imgur.com/a/aHloBlS](https://imgur.com/a/aHloBlS)

You see, that one is easy on your brain. It hooks you with that wavy rhythm and keeps you reading until the end.

**#4: Start your post with an attention grabber.**

On LinkedIn, your first sentence is your headline. When people saw your post on LinkedIn, they’ll see the first two lines and the rest will stay under the fold.

So, your opening sentence will determine whether they continue to read or scroll down.

Your first line should trigger the reader and make them click for more. Here are some ideas.

* Make them curious: [https://imgur.com/a/juKwk4v](https://imgur.com/a/juKwk4v)
* Get specific and narrow down your audience: [https://imgur.com/a/HU4cdxI](https://imgur.com/a/HU4cdxI)
* Talk about their pain points: [https://imgur.com/a/GMjncdz](https://imgur.com/a/GMjncdz)
* Introduce news: [https://imgur.com/a/Ot9BKcv](https://imgur.com/a/Ot9BKcv)
* Make a bold statement: [https://imgur.com/a/Y0bhqWi](https://imgur.com/a/Y0bhqWi)
* Spark interest: [https://imgur.com/a/fmY7j1Q](https://imgur.com/a/fmY7j1Q)

**#5: Use emojis for a more fluid reading experience**

I experimented with emojis a lot. They make your text easier to follow and get more engagement.

You can add some characteristics to your content by using them as storytelling elements or pointers.

Example:[https://imgur.com/a/IjGVDje](https://imgur.com/a/IjGVDje)

**#6: Add related hashtags and tag people to increase engagement**

Elementary but effective. When you use hashtags, you tell LinkedIn that the content you shared is relevant to that topic.

Then if your post got enough engagement, Linkedin starts to send a notification to the people who are interested in that hashtag.

**#7: Trade valuable content with comments.**

We generated over 5k leads and made hundreds of new connections with this simple strategy.

Here how it goes,

You’ll create a lead magnet (eBook, cheat-sheet, blog post etc.) that solves your audience’s problems.

And you’ll launch it on LinkedIn. Then follow these four steps:

* Create a post with your eBook (video works better)
* Make people comment to get the lead magnet.
* Scrape their comments by using dataminer.
* Send automated messages to commentators an ask for an email to send the ebook.

If you want to know-how in detail, you can [check this article.](https://www.grow-force.com/linkedin-lead-generation/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Entrepr&utm_campaign=Howtopostonlinkedin%20to%20700)

**#8 Get personal**

LinkedIn is a business platform where you talk about your product, accomplishments, promotions and milestones. And people on LinkedIn like that talk.

But they love personalities they can relate to. Therefore, being one of them and telling about your stories, daily challenges, breakdowns or personal milestones influences people.

**#9: Plant your seeds**

What if you can reach the audience of a guru in your industry? Or a person who can influence your target audience?

This is the ultimate goal of the seed strategy.

We called it “seed” because it’s a long term plan. It can take months, even years. It’s simple. You’ll make a list of influencers. They can be:

* Business geniuses that you follow.
* Influencers that your audience love.
* The people that you want to become in the future.

Make a list of 10-20. Actually, there are no limits, but over 20 is not practical because it’ll take a lot of time.

You’ll start to follow the people on your list. You’ll comment on their LinkedIn posts. You’ll criticize their latest blog post and reply to their tweets.

If they have an online course, buy it. A book? Buy it and read it.

The goal here is to share more common interests and to be able to talk over them like genuine friends. This is not your job; it’s a friendship.

In the long term, anything can happen. A podcast, interview or speaking invitation in a summit. Or mention in a post that can bring you hundreds of leads.

Plant your seeds today and make real friends in your market.

**#10: Learn how to tell a story**

You wrote an awesome article in your blog and you want people to read it.

**And you write the following;**

*The new blog post is out!*

*It’s called six neuromarketing strategies that will work forever.*

*Follow the link to read it and transform your prospects into your customers.*

You see, it’s boring and sloppy. You wrote your new article for nothing. You’re lazy at writing and you hope that your post will generate you leads.

Well, wrong.

**How is that as a starter?**

*If your audience is conscious of your sales effort, you can sell subconsciously.*

*Want to know how to sell subconsciously? Follow this.*

Better right? Now you already give them a promise and value. Plus, it’s all about them.

Then you can briefly explain that six neuromarketing tricks and finally direct them to your blog post.

**The difference?**

Here you already gave some value and put in an effort. Plus, you earned their trust and interest. Now it’s easy for them to click your blog post.

We got used to the “We wrote this go and read” approach and it’s not working anymore.

Here is a storytelling approach that is used by screenwriters. It’s called Hero’s Journey and it can help you to structure your writing.

Normally it’s a 12 stage journey but here we’ll tweak it and end up with five stages for LinkedIn writing.

## 5 phases of Hero’s Journey

**The first phase, Trial:**

Here, you face a challenge about your business or personal life.

**The second phase, Problem:**

What problems has that challenge brought to you? How it affected your life and business?

**The third phase, Guidance:**

How did you try to solve that problem? How did you realize or who helped you? It could be a person, book or bird. Where did you get your inspiration?

**The fourth phase, Solution:**

The problem is solved. How does it feel right now and what are the echoes of the solution? How did it affect your business?

**The fifth phase, Transformation:**

You’re changed. Now you’re stronger and capable. Tell other people about your experiences and how they can solve their problems.

Try to stick to that structure. Remove or add one more step, tweak it for your needs and writing style.

595,3y7nve,False,,102,Use Gmail to Send Email from Custom Domains for Free,Entrepreneur,"Gmail is great. It is powerful, sleek and easy to use.

Sending emails from an @gmail address works for personal situations. Sending emails from @mydomain.com is necessary in professional and business settings. If you are on a shoestring, and I mean shoestring budget you may not want to shell out the $5 or $10 a month for Google apps to configure your custom domain email address. Fortunately, there is a relatively straightforward way to get around this.

There are only three steps involved, and you don’t need to be technically savvy to set this up.

* Enable email forwarding
* Setup SMTP server
* Create a Gmail alias

**Email forwarding**

We want to use an email forwarding and simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) service. Here are a list of email forwarding and SMTP services that have “free” pricing tiers that you can use.

* mailgun
* Mandrill
* Zoho
* SendGrid

SendGrid allows free users to send 12,000 emails a month. That is the most of the four companies listed above. For the example below I am going to be using mailgun. If you want to use Zoho check out this [comprehensive tutorial](https://medium.com/@gobudgie/how-to-set-up-a-free-custom-domain-email-address-with-gmail-inbox-7e8cb8574c3e).

**SMTP server**

Go to mailgun and signup for an account with your @gmail email address. Make sure you use your @gmail address – you will need to do this to verify your account.

After you confirm your account log in. Click on the Domain tab in the main navigation. Click Add New Domain and add your domain name.

Follow the domain name server (DNS) instructions and add the DNS records with the service that manages your DNS.

I manage my DNS with DigitalOcean.com, adding new records there is really easy.

If you registered your domain name with GoDaddy or Namecheap and are not sure how to set up DNS records simply google “how to set up DNS records with XXXX”. There are plenty of tutorials out there.

Click back on Domains, and then click on your domain name. Click on Manage SMTP credentials. Enter your email, and password.

This is the most “technical” aspect of setting up your custom domain with Gmail.

**Mailgun routes**

Remember email forwarding that I mentioned above? Now we are going to set that up with Mailgun routing.

Click on the Routes tab and then click on Create New Route. Enter the following information:

Be sure to replace the email addresses in the quotation marks with your desired email addresses.

**Gmail alias**

Next, go to Accounts and Import settings page in Gmail. Click on Add another email address you own under the Send mail as section.

Enter the email address that you just set up in mailgun and press next.

* Server: smtp.mailgun.org
* Port: 587
* Username: the full email address, e.g. “zach@shefska.com”
* Password: the password you set in mailgun SMTP Credentials

Click Add Account and you are done! You can easily set your new email address to be your default on the Accounts and Import settings page.

There you go, **10,000 free emails** per month from your custom domain name!

If you got stuck check out the tutorial on my [blog with images](http://shefska.com/custom-gmail/) - maybe those will help. Or, if you are still stuck as a question here and I will help.

15,gl7k4j,False,,303,I left my bank job to start a painting business 3 Years ago. We just hit $2.5m in sales. Here’s what I wish someone would’ve told me,Entrepreneur,"There’s a lot of you on here who reach out for guidance about leaving your full time job to start your own business. I want to outline a few things that I wish I had known prior to leaving my job that would’ve saved me a ton of headache.

***If you don’t know how to cook, the chef owns the restaurant***

For the record, I had no clue how to paint aside from working in the summer with my father when I was 12. At that time, all I did was light prep work. Like taping, prepping, and cleaning up trash and brushes at the end of the day.

I bought into the insane idea that I would be able to run my painting business without any real painting knowledge or having to do any painting whatsoever.

It didn’t take long for me to get knocked off my high horse of “collecting checks” when the sub I hired to perform the work decided not to show half way through one of the jobs… This left me in a very vulnerable position. One that no business owner should ever allow themselves to be in.

My advice is to NEVER get into business without knowing how to produce the end result yourself. I spent the next 6 months working along side my workers and building a team. I learned the ins and outs of painting and can now handle any task that would be required of us on any job myself.

***If you don’t get the foundation right early, you probably never will***

“I’ll set up payroll once we get things running…”

“I’ll set up workers’ comp after we get a few jobs under our belt…”

“I’ll get accountant at some point, just not yet…”

With this mentality, you’re setting yourself up for failure. Not taking care of these things early on will make it way more difficult to implement in the future. The reason many small businesses struggle with this is because at some point they get comfortable. They are making money, they are producing results, and to retract back to these foundational responsibilities scares them.

If you’re starting a business, don’t wait for growth to take place to validate your responsibility to take action on these requirements.

In other words, don’t build your skyscraper on a foundation made of sand.

***Delegate & Duplicate, Don’t get attached***

The reasons why small business owners are always over-worked is because they have a serious attachment issue. They can’t see themselves letting go of what they’re “good at” in fear that it won’t be done to standard of which it would be done if they were doing it or producing it themselves. This especially holds true in the trades.

Your time is your most valuable asset. You have to learn to let go of all of the day to day responsibilities. You have to learn how to delegate tasks to other people and be OK if they make a mistake or mess up. The sooner you let go of controlling every aspect of your business, the sooner you give it permission to grow. It’s kind of like a dating relationship. If you suffocate it by trying to control every aspect of the other person, that obviously won’t end up well.

The end goal is to duplicate yourself. When you start small, you’re obviously doing a ton of different tasks, but the goal is to delegate and train others to do those tasks the way you do them, this is called duplication and is very important for the success of your business

***Hiring and dating are a lot alike***

Hiring is by far the most important aspect of any business. I credit a majority of my company’s success due to a strong hiring process that is designed to filter out applicants and funnel in the best possible candidate for our job openings.

The issue for me was, I didn’t start developing a strong process for hiring until about a year in. I kind of did one of those “Hey, do you know anyone that would want to work with us?” Or, did a general post somewhere with no real end goal.

You get out what you put in. If you put out a crappy post with no strong requirements, you’ll get people that have low standards, just like your post.

If you put out a strong post that has strong requirements for the position you are looking for with a detailed plan for entry, a phone interview, an in person interview, a working interview and a background check…well, you’re probably going to get someone that has high standards.

You don’t have to be a major producer to implement this sort of hiring policy, you simply just have to be able to implement it and follow through with it.

Many small businesses especially when starting out hire out of desperation, another relationship analogy, if you date out of desperation, that’s never a good thing.

***If you don’t actively convey your vision to your team for your company, they’ll create their own for themselves***

Don’t assume that just because you’re paying someone they will be loyal to you. By nature, humans like progress.

What I’ve found in my business is that the more I convey my vision for the company to my team, the greater the morale.

This is not only a collective vision, but individual vision as well for the members of the team. I am always asking them what their life goals are such as purchasing a house, getting a car, etc. and trying my best to help them achieve it.

If I stay engaged with their goals, and encourage them to use the success of the business to help them achieve it, it’s a win win for everyone.

The company posted first year (2014) revenue of $293,278.78 and EBITDA of $26,589.82. I invested no personal money (to start), had no credit history, no industry experience, and no clue if it would work out. [You can read the full first year story here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/32gwjj/april_2014_i_started_a_trucking_company_while/).


Personal background update: I am now 24 years old. I graduated from a US university with a BBA in Finance and Real Estate in 2012; in 2013 I graduated with an MBA in the same fields. In 2014 I started full time in M&A and still hold that position. My role with the firm is primarily to draft the documents that are required to sell a business (OM, CIM); for business owners and new entrepreneurs, these documents are extremely similar to pitch books that would be required to solicit investors. As of today, I have worked with 61 entrepreneurs with a combined market value on all personal deals of approximately $420,000,000. If you have questions regarding writing or drafting these documents, please feel free to post them as well. 


The previous post ended with my company in a tough position. We entered Winter of 2014 very boldly, purchasing equipment that would end up being a heavy burden to bear during our slow season and a very expensive lesson to learn. At the close of the post, we were just starting to see an increase in demand and business was *finally* starting to look worthwhile.
 

**Q1, January 2015 to March 2015**

Q1 had total revenues of $122,515.86. At the time, I was operating 5 pieces of equipment (owned) and 1 lease trucks (I/O’s). As discussed in my original post, an I/O is someone who owns their own equipment and runs routes I provide them. In exchange, the I/O pays me a commission on total gross income. Excluding these trucks and looking only at my equipment, I had gross income of $113,458.17 for an average of $7,563.88 per truck, per month; this works out to a pitiful average of $1,745.51 gross per truck, per week. Needless to say, our situation was quickly becoming dismal and it was entirely out of my control. It wouldn’t be until weather conditions improved that I would be able to land the contracts needed to keep equipment on the road.
 

However, there is more than one positive that comes from what was nothing short of a traumatizing experience. First, I learned the importance of cash and conservatism. I work with business owners on a daily basis. The most successful businesses almost invariably have overly large cash positions to provide the flexibility required to adjust to demand. Many entrepreneurs, including myself, fall into a trap where they start to believe they’ve hit a home run with no end to the possibilities. *“Look at how much I’m making now.. but can you imagine how much I’d be making if I bought this extra equipment?”* Second to that, but equally important, I found myself cornered and in a position where *something* had to happen. I had to get away from the seasonality of the industry I was in. *”How can I take the equipment that I have and put it to use?” One of my favorite quotes, “Necessity is the mother of invention”, fits perfectly into this story. At the beginning of Q2 I began talking to my dad about what we could do to keep the trucks running. Almost in passing, he mentioned a family friend of ours used to work in the industry as a truck dispatcher/broker and that it may be worth calling him. The lead panned out and for the next 4.5 months I built the financial model required to submit bids and eventually land work (to be discussed later). 


**Q2, April 2015 to June 2015**

At the beginning of Q2 I had an extremely strained cash position and I was in over $30,000 in credit card debt to my father. However, work was picking up rapidly and at this point everyone was too balls deep into the success of the operation that there was zero opportunity to pull out. In Q2 we posted total revenue of $149,645.34, a modest improvement over Q1. However, prior to June of 2015 we had an average monthly revenue of $41,545.05; we posted $64,435.93 in June, a 55.1% increase. There were no adjustments to the business and I did nothing to merit the increase, other than persevere. My equipment works in highway construction. As the rains slowed in May the ground dried up; when the weather is dry construction in Texas hits full swing. Without weather delays, we we’re running full steam ahead and had more work for our equipment than we could reasonably handle. 


**Q3, July 2015 to September 2015**

At this point in the year we were in a strong cash position, but still carried heavy amounts of debt. In Q3 we posted revenues of $254,416.35, setting a record for both sales and profitability. For comparison, in Q1 we averaged $1,342.20 in profit per week; Q2 we averaged $222.76 in profit per week (registration, insurance down payment, and huge repair); Q3 we averaged $3,419.34 in profit per week. 


The key differences for Q3 were a combination of management decisions and being in peak demand season. Prior to Q3, I owned 5 trucks but operated only 4 and used the 5th as a spare. Started in Q3, I decided that this business model wasn’t working and that all equipment needed to be on the road, regardless of reliability. Our 5th truck was a 1990 Peterbilt 379 and is literally older than I am. It is a safe truck and is compliant with all safety standards, but it is old. It had high repair costs as a percentage of sales and putting it on the road was extremely risky. At any point, if the truck were to blow the motor or drop the transmission, I’m looking at $8,000 to $15,000 in repair costs that I simply can’t afford. Unfortunately, I also couldn’t afford to have it sitting and being that only one of the options was certain to lose money I decided to put the truck on the road. In addition, I added another I/O to increase “free” cash flow by taking a risk free 6% commission. Finally, and most importantly, the relationship that I pursued in Q1 paid off in the form of another customer. 


In Q3 my business relationship with the family friend went from theory to reality. For months he had been working an angle on a long-term relationship that he had. The Company in question ran Van freight to regional hubs and was extremely frustrated with the service that they were being provided by another carrier. Most notably, the carrier in question would deliver loads late, use the customers trailer to book additional runs, and would complain if their dispatch wasn’t the optimal lane profit wise. Knowing this, I prepared a pitch that I knew would absolutely blow them out of the water. I knew what lanes were offered, so I told the customer exactly what I would need and exactly what I could give them. I let them know the minimum gross that I needed the truck to earn for me to come over, but that if we could hit those figures I would bring them a brand new truck, on-time delivery, and as much customer service as they could handle. 


They agreed in August of 2015 and I sent them my best truck on a trial run with them. For four weeks we achieved sub-par results. While I was assured I would have over $3,000 in gross per week, I was actually averaging just $1,300. Sometime around September 1st I let the customer know that I would be unable to continue hauling for them unless my workload increase. They response was that they didn’t want to lose me and would be booking me more freight. As a sign of good faith, I went and secured a rental contract on a 2015 Kenworth T680. I showed up with it the second week of September and by week 3 I was up to $2,700 in revenue. I averaged $3,054.65 from that point to the end of the year (my slowest revenue period, historically).


**Q4, October 2015 to December 2015**

As of Q4 we were sitting on a very strong cash position (still with significant debt), but we were certain that as a worst case we would be able to park the equipment, survive the winter, and start back in Q2 2016 where demand was strong again. We posted Q4 revenue of $207,296.79 and had a record month in October, with $96,110.47 in revenue. 


In 2014 the weather turned in December, so for 2015 we were expecting the same. However, this year the weather turned even earlier. In November 2015 we posted our 3rd lowest revenue of the year ($38,622.32). Unlike 2014, we were not struggling. We had prepared all year for the eventuality and hoarded cash. We were flirting with the idea of parking before the weather randomly cleared in December, allowing us to post $72,564 in revenue (our 4th highest of 2015). This was possible mostly because of my new customer relationship, whose busy season is around the holidays. During this time, they pulled 2 trucks from me for a total of $19,800 in revenue for December. Not only was the revenue useful, but when they pulled the additional truck I was able to reduce my supply to my original customer, allowing be to meet their requirements without overfilling them. This adjustment means that I was better able to keep the equipment I had working. 


**2015 Summary**

2015 was not a sexy year, it was recovery. My decisions placed us in a precarious position in 2014 that I did not want to repeat. I spent the entire year working towards revenue diversification and improving my cash balance. While I knew that 2015 would likely be a “waste”, at least in the context of growing my asset base, I also knew that a financially sound 2015 would mean a higher probability that I could maximize 2016.
 

**Bonus: Q1, January 2016 to March 2016**

In Q1 2016 I had returned the extremely expensive rental truck and was facilitating my Van customer with my equipment. This placed strain on the relationship, because right when my equipment was added everything started breaking. However, this was mitigated by the fact that I made it very clear that I was willing to do whatever it takes to ensure his loads were delivered. When I had a truck go down, I immediately had another one going to pick up the load and ensure it was delivered. What would normally be a horrible situation actually improved my standing with the customer. While it was very frustrating for him that my truck went down, his confidence in us as a carrier skyrocketed (from my perspective) when he saw the lengths that I would go to to ensure a load was delivered. The result was that he cut the other carrier *entirely* and let us know that we would be the primary outside carrier along with one other company. We finished Q1 performing a total of $59,466.27 in revenue with this customer and were well on our way to establishing the diversification I was seeking. 


We earned Q1 revenues of $149,345.84 from our core business. With essentially the same equipment, we went from $122,515.86 in Q1 2015 revenue to $211,719.00 in Q1 2016 revenue, a **72.8% increase**! 


**2016: Key Business Changes, Current Strategy, and Overall Projections**

*Key Business Changes*

In Fall 2015 I was pursued by a local mechanic who was looking to further establish his independent mechanic operation. I was extremely hesitant to bring in an outside mechanic to perform the work that my father and I had previously been responsible for; but, I was quickly finding myself reaching burnout and could tell that holding onto that responsibility was actually hurting the up-time of the equipment. The mechanic in question was relatively young (30’s), extremely knowledgeable and, above all else, he was hungry. I loved that he had the same mentality I did, that he was clearly willing to do whatever it took to succeed, and that he understood that uptime is everything in our industry. In a somewhat difficult decision, I decided to partner with him, agreeing to send him 100% of my non-critical repair work and allowing him to pick up my tire account. At the time, he was working by himself. He worked hard to impress me and we immediately saw results.
 

My gut instinct was that our costs would skyrocket in a time of low demand, but the opposite was true. While our repair expenses did increase nominally, they actually stayed even as a percentage of sales because of how quickly he was able to get the equipment back on the road. Previously, if a truck went down I would have to send it to my fathers place for the day for a night repair. If it needed a part, it would have to sit another day while we waited for the part. Then, if it was a major repair, we would need to sit it another day so we had time to finish the repair in the evenings. The result was 3-4 days downtime on major repairs and 1-2 days downtime on anything minor. After partnering with the mechanic, we found that minor repairs would cost us only 2-3 hours of run time (allowing the truck to keep working that day) and that major repairs would usually take 1-2 days. Putting dollars to the example, if each truck grosses $850 a day we net about $460 after paying the driver and fuel. Each day the truck sits we were missing out on $460 in money to pay bills. We were saving around $1,000 per repair on all repairs, major and minor alike, because of the uptime increase. More than that, I didn’t have to keep doing mechanic work!


Following the same theme, it’s in Q1 that I started doing hard analysis on our uptime. I always had a gut feeling that it was horrible, but I didn’t necessarily have the data needed to know *why* it was horrible. I didn’t even live in the same city to be able to take a close look, I still had a full time job. Was it weather? Driver issues? Repairs? No matter what it was, I knew that it could be improved. As it turns out, I found out that we were earning a pitiful $500 per week, per truck, in revenue… Excluding weather days! If I assumed that 20% of work days were a wash due to weather, we were earning just above half of what I thought we should be earning. But, how do I fix a problem that I am not there to see?


After extensive debate, I came to the conclusion that I can’t fix what I can’t see. Almost everyone in my life has been pushing me to quit my current job and run the trucks full time; but, that has never been logical to me. I do very well at my current job, so as long as I can hire someone to do just as good of job for me, and be able to hire them for less than my salary, then it only makes sense for me to hire them and keep my job. I began building a model and was able to show that if I simply improved our performance to the minimum standard that should be met then we’d increase revenue from $124,000 per truck to almost $150,000 per truck. This increase would come with a steep increase to margins due to the increased efficiency, easily justifying paying for a GM. Not only that, but we are currently pursuing no outside sales. We are in a strong cash position, able to purchase equipment to meet demand, have many I/O’s interested in running for us, but I have no way to make the calls/visits required to land additional contracts. 


At the end of Q1 I put in an offer to the family friend that founded the growing Van freight division. I offered him a base salary plus a hefty commission on outside work. In addition, while previously my drivers were all 1099 contract labor, I decided to make the transition and convert everyone to W2 employees. The changes mean that I will be able to put someone on site to track when trucks are starting work, what drivers are meeting their quotas, what drivers aren’t (and why), and I’d gain someone who would be able to dedicate time to finding additional routes for my equipment. 


I made the offer and he put in a contingent acceptance. He has a family, a steady job, and said that he wanted to see evidence that when he comes over he has the ability to earn enough to survive. Thinking that was more than fair, we set a date that I would need to show him results by. On top of that, we went to our Van customer and asked them for permission to buy our own trailer, let them use it for their loads, but at the same time for them to let us haul freight back. I guess our previous efforts to build customer trust helped, because they not only allowed us to do it, but almost forcefully encouraged us to do so. The concept was simple, I would buy a $5,500 trailer, they’d pay me the same rate that they’ve been paying me, but on top of that I would book loads from the destination back to the origin. I wouldn’t need one every day, and on the days where I didn’t have one I’d still use the customers trailers, but at $450 apiece (with the only extra cost being driver pay) I would only need to book 3 or so a month to break even. We are in the second week of operation for that and have booked 4 loads with backhauls and have established a key relationship in our destination city for consistent backhaul freight. 


Finally, the amount of paperwork required to operate was becoming overwhelming. My mother has worked incredibly hard her whole life to provide for us and since the beginning of starting this I’ve wanted to hire her, but couldn’t afford her and didn’t have a role for her. I’ve since hired her to manage all incoming mail, all invoicing, all hiring documents, filing, and general admin tasks. It’s very part time for her, but it’s extremely helpful to me and worth every penny that I am happy to be able to pay her. 


*Current Strategy*

As of this month the GM I put an offer on left his job and is preparing to start with me full time. He’s spent this month working to convert everyone to an employee (so that I can legally hire a supervisor) and building relationships on backhaul freight. My goal is to further diversify my revenue so that I am not attached to any single industry. By the end of this year, I’m hoping that the Van freight division can post revenue in excess of $300,000. 


For the core business, I’ve added several pieces of equipment. As I said, 2015 was a prepping year that would allow us to blow 2016 out of the water. In March 2016 I purchased two additional trucks, following up with a third purchase in May, and added the rental truck (this time a brand new Volvo) in order to increase reliability for our Van backhaul plants. In addition, I increased the number of I/O’s to 3. The additions bring us to 8 owned trucks (1 spare), 1 rental truck, and 3 I/O’s for a total of 12 trucks… a significant increase on 2015. 


I’ve discussed my plans with the team that I now have. I converted the 1990 into a spare truck, which is affordable now that we have more equipment, and told the mechanic that our goal is to *never* have a trailer sitting. We have an extra truck, so while a truck may go down, there should be no reason that a trailer is sitting other than driver issues or trailer repairs. This simple change should further reduce our downtime on repairs from 1-2 days (on average) to just a few hours. When a truck goes down, the driver can slide into the seat of the other truck and make sure the trailer stays rolling. More than that, I spoke with the GM about what I need from him to justify keeping him around. I’m expecting a minimum of 20% efficiency increases just by having him on property watching what everyone is doing. Previously, if I had a problem driver it could take months before I would be able to recognize a pattern that warranted releasing them. With a GM, these issues should be identifiable on the spot, increasing uptime on equipment. 


*2016 Projections*

I’m expecting big things in 2016. I have been preparing everyone for the changes, knowing that year 3 needs to be the year that we go from something I call a “side business” to something that is a key carrier in the region I service.
 

I started 2016 with the goal of $1,000,000 in revenue, but that projection has since changed. I’m setting our conservative goal at $1,250,000 in revenue and our expected goal at $1,500,000. I’m expecting to earn $21,000 in EBIT and $114,000 in EBITDA on the expected figure with no GM efficiency improvements. With my expected GM improvements, we should earn around $150,000 in EBIT and $250,000 in EBITDA. 


**Conclusion**

As I said in my original post, if you want to start a business, just do it. There will never be a perfect time to do something, you will always have bills and responsibilities, but you won’t always have the opportunity to build a dream. That’s not to say it’ll be easy, be prepared to live with your ‘nuts in a sling’ (as my peers have affectionately described me). Most importantly, be prepared to bust your ass with no reward. While I’ve pulled a few thousand from the business here and there (<$10k), I have taken ZERO salary for the two years worth of work that I’ve done, opting to leave everything in the business so that I could continue to grow. 


There are too many people in this world that say you *have* to be the guy/girl that quits their job, jumps ship, and goes into crippling debt to start a business. That’s the only model that seems to be propagated and those are the stories that hit media outlets. Even one of my favorite shows, Shark Tank, does this. You’ll see entrepreneurs with careers get butchered because the sharks ‘don’t know whether you time is spent on your own project or on the business I invested in’. You don’t have to have a billion dollar idea to build something and you don’t have to risk your home or feeding your family to start a successful business. If a 24 year old in crippling student debt, with a 2.8 GPA, can work in M&A, start a trucking business (with no trucking experience), and be in the process of starting another business then I’m convinced anyone with the right opportunity and right work ethic can do the same.

**Proof**

779,73zvs8,False,,50,"How to effectively ""Fake it till you make it""",Entrepreneur,"Every new sales rep has first time jitters. Anyone who has to make a presentation feels like they've got a lot on the line. One of the most popular lines of advice offered to budding entrepreneurs is to ""Fake it till you make it."" 

Here's a longer version that shows examples and details of effectively using the ""Fake it till you make it"" strategy from the popular 90s sales comedy, Tommy Boy. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uJTVDCg37o&feature=youtu.be

So what does that phrase really mean? ""Fake it till you make it"" has been regurgitated by lazy sales managers and business coaches trying to rally folks to drum up confidence out of nowhere. The ultimate goal is to get them up and out selling, networking and acting the part they wish to be. But faking a stereotype of success creates disingenuous persona. You end up with folks pretending to know more than they really do, making promises they can't really keep.

Since newbies don't have a ton of experience in presentations or their products, they usually end up doing one of two things:

* Create a ridiculous sales persona based on an ideal they saw in a movie.
* Focus too intently on the presentation, limiting their effectiveness.

So how does one effectively fake it till you make it? It starts with what you're faking. Most people can picture what they consider to be a successful, charismatic businessperson. Far too many people conjure up the image of a fast talking, slick haired, faceless 3-piece suit who knows exactly what to say and when to flash a charming smile. But faking that is next to impossible if it's not your style or you have limited experience. 

To actually fake it till you make it, you must examine the structure of an ideal, not just its components. Someone who can make a charismatic presentation can usually do so because they have a strong understanding of their product, they've heard the same objection over and over, or they have a well rehearsed rebuttal. Someone who commands authority has likely proven themselves during difficult times and earned their leadership position. It's very easy to spot those who haven't but are pretending to.

The term is really just a means to help you drum up confidence while mustering the courage to perform its underlying intent: Practice makes perfect. But you can spend time rehearsing canned one liners and faking charisma without ever improving your presentation skills. Because presentations and selling come from an ability to develop connections. And it's virtually impossible to fake that ability. That comes with practice. 

Here are some guidelines to following the ""Fake it till you Make it"" strategy:

•	Learn the difference between framework and delivery. Follow the framework but develop your own delivery.
•	Confidence does not come from thin air. Start with the confidence in your ability to grow and learn. Trust in the vision of your company’s leaders. But you won’t be able to do any that without trying in the first place.
•	Look deeper into successful sales tactics. What works for others may not work for you. It’s important to examine why something works in order to make it your own.

Fake it till you make it is simply a means to help you drum up the courage required to get out there and gain some experience. It's not a license to prance around pretending to be someone you're not. To apply this strategy effectively, you must examine the underlying construct of the ideal you seek to emulate. Take notes on what makes something effective and why it was helpful, not just how it was used in a specific situation. Keep trying and always review your progress. By the time you actually make it, you won't ever realize when you've stopped faking it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/73zvs8/how_to_effectively_fake_it_till_you_make_it/,455,"It comes from exp.

I run a live stream production agency. Earlier this year, I decided to make a quick landing page targeted specifically at people wanting to produce Facebook live streams. Our site is built on WordPress, so it took less than an hour to design a passable page.

The page is pretty simple - quick description of services, some visual examples, and a call to action.

This week, we booked a gig to produce a Facebook live stream. Curious, I took a look at our Google Analytics and determined that our new client:

* Performed a Google search,
* Found our landing page,
* Spent 92 seconds on that page, then
* Gave us a call.

I find it interesting that rather than clicking on our CTA, the client opted to call us directly. It makes me realize how important to offer multiple options for contacting - someone who is ready to buy may want to speak on the phone rather than send an email.

With this experiment's success, I plan to build a lot more highly-targeted landing pages. It will take some time to see results (I built the page back in January), but that's fine.

Just finished reading this article and as I reflect on my entrepreneurial journey so far, I recall being 30 years old and getting ready to make one of the most important decisions of my life.  Leaving my job of 10 years to pursue something I had zero experience in and no real plan (this is not the recommended format to venturing into an entrepreneurial experience).

I became a career changer at age 30 and I was right on schedule! You are too whatever age you are.

EDIT: I’d love to hear from you guys & gals at what age you started in your industry and whether you felt like you were early or late to the let and what’s been your experience so far.

Summary of article: This isn’t my summary instead it was a summary I came across on kitces.com.  I did read the article in it’s entirety and found it engaging. 


[Modern society is arguably obsessed with early achievement, from celebrating high SAT scores and A’s in AP classes, to getting accepted into a prestigious college or first job, or making it onto 40-under-40, 30-under-30, or now even “Most Influential Teen” lists. Yet the reality is that not only is “precocious achievement” the exception and not the norm, but more generally the truth is that we continue to mature throughout our lives and that we all do so at different rates; in other words, being an early bloomer is not a requirement for lifelong success. In fact, the prefrontal cortex – responsible for complex functions such as planning and organizing, problem-solving, memory, attention, and inhibition, is still forming in the “post-adolescence” stage from ages 18 to 25 (known by psychologists as a “neurological maturity of executive function”). Accordingly, some psychology researchers are now suggesting that we should better view the phase from age 18 to 30 as “emerging adulthood”… and that those who aren’t wildly successful in this stage may not be “behind” in life, but simply following the normal development curve. Moreover, our “crystallized intelligence” (ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience in practice), doesn’t even peak until we’re in our 40s and 50s (which is particularly notable for financial advisors, where such fluid intelligence capabilities are critical factors for career success). In fact, he average age of those filing for U.S. patent applications is 47, and the average age of scientists doing work for which they eventually win a Nobel Prize is 39; in other words, even our “creative yield” increases with age, too. Even in the context of financial services, entrepreneurs like Ken Fisher didn’t develop their key methodologies for success until their 30s, while quarterback Tom Brady was only the 199th player selected in the 2000 NFL draft, singer Andrea Bocelli didn’t even start singing opera until he was 34, Martha Stewart started her catering business at 35 (and didn’t publish her first book until 42), and J.K. Rowling started Harry Potter at 35. The key point, though, is simply that all of us know someone who seems stuck in life… but recognizing how common it actually is to be a late bloomer – especially with human life spans getting longer – it’s crucial not to give up on ourselves or others. We can all bloom and re-bloom throughout our lives.]",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/c0z8ax/its_never_too_late_to_start_a_brilliant_career/,554,[deleted] ,2019-06-15 16:37:00
795,bh2mnm,False,,93,"Another update from ""The Window Cleaning Guy"" - 26 months into the business and loving it!",Entrepreneur," 

Hi everyone! It’s been a while since my last update. I’m just here watching season 2 of Cobra Kai and thought that I would check in.

For those just now tuning in you can see my original post in the sub here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5q7xsq/just\_found\_out\_that\_i\_am\_losing\_my\_job\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5q7xsq/just_found_out_that_i_am_losing_my_job_with/) 

The very short story is that 26 months ago I lost my corporate job and started a window cleaning company on a whim. A few months later I added power washing to the business and we haven’t looked back since. In 24 months we generated half a million dollars in revenue spraying water on peoples homes with a 20% net. To pre empt the “you only brought home $100,000 in two years” questions….A company’s net is the total profit AFTER all expenses including payroll. I pay myself for the work that I do.

Our goal for year three is $717,000. We are behind pace for the year but I am optimistic that we will exceed our goal for the year.

Currently we are still running two trucks and only have three technicians. We had four but recently had to let one go. We are in the process of recruiting for his replacement. We are also in the process of recruiting for our first sales rep. Currently I am running all sales myself while my son/business partner is a crew leader in the field. We got an office space in December of 2018 and hired an admin. I have been working very hard in creating systems and delegating low income producing responsibilities to my team and I’m getting some good traction with that.

We recently brought on a partner (two investors that work together) in the business. I’m not going to share what the deal with them was BUT I am very excited to have them on board.  Combined they have built service companies doing over 20 million in annual revenue and now invest in smaller companies like mine. I am still the majority owner of the company and now have two strategic partners to help me achieve my goals sooner. I spent four months thinking about the partnership before we pulled the trigger. We decided on doing the deal as we feel that we will surpass our goals and do so sooner than we could have without them. Although there was a financial buy in by them the real advantage will be their experience and guidance. I will be less transparent with the partnership details for the simple fact that they did not ‘sign up’ for my social experiment of sharing my journey online and here on reddit. Feel free to ask away though. Just don’t be disappointed if I dont answer all questions regarding this particular topic.

My personal main focus is on generating revenue and investing in our employees. I’ve spoken a lot in the past about our marketing and sales tactics so I would like to talk more about our culture.  My philosophy is that if I invest in my employees they will invest in a great customer experience. It’s really starting to pay off. My small team is very loyal and they go above and beyond to impress our customers. I invest in my team by trying to do the little things that many companies neglect. Probably the biggest thing that we do is to help them identify their dreams. We have created a dream board for each employee and it’s displayed in our office. We encourage them to share their dreams/goals even if they include leaving our company. We stress the fact that we want to help them get to where they want to be in life and we know that it isn’t working for a pressure washing company forever. Currently we have the ‘dream thing’ up and running and I am now working on a system to help them create goals and then plans to achieve them. We are going to help them set some small incremental defined goals. We will reward them for doing this. Then we are going to set up accountability for them in achieving these goals with a defined plan. The company will reward them for executing the plan and achieving the goal too. All of this is a work in progress but my son and I have identified this as a significant part to our success so we are dedicated to making it happen. We were inspired to do this by reading the book “The Dream Manager” by Matthew Kelly (amazing book).

We have also implemented a ‘point system’ with our team to gamify things. We just implemented this about two weeks ago but the response has been amazing. We removed the standard commission for things like upsells and google reviews and put it into our gamification system. They absolutely love it and it’s causing them to produce in areas that we were not producing in the past. To be honest I am completely shocked at how well this has worked in a very short time.

Another tactic that I’m about to implement to help improve productivity and help everyone be focused on our key goals is a visual dashboard in the office. I’m working on this now and it should be in place within a week. It will be a simple TV display with our KPI’s up 24/7. I’ve read and listened to a lot of stuff about doing this and expect to see some significant improvements just by doing this simple thing. People tend to perform better when they see their goals and progress in achieving them on a daily basis.

When we started this journey I created a vlog to document the journey. It’s been one of the most rewarding things that I’ve ever done because I can now go back and watch my progress as I figure this thing out.

872,cmsz9q,False,,121,$10k/mo selling pickle juice.,Entrepreneur,"Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

Today's interview is with Harris Derner of [Brine Brothers](https://www.brinebrothers.com), a brand that sells premium pickle brine.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Premium pickle brine.
* Revenue/mo: $10,000
* Started: March 2017
* Location: New York City
* Founders: 2
* Employees: 0

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

Hello, my name is Harris Derner and I am the co-founder of [Brine Brothers](https://brinebrothers.com/), an All-Natural Premium Brine company.  I started Brine Brothers in 2016 with my friend of 25+ years, Michael Belicose.  Our current products are all-natural, drinkable pickle brines; ‘Darn Good Dill’ - the classic for pickle lovers and ‘Chili Cherry Fire’ - for those who like it hot.  Pickle ‘brine’ (also referred to as pickle ‘juice’) is the liquid solution that transforms cucumbers into pickles.

What makes us unique and distinguishes us from thousands of pickle companies is that we do NOT sell pickles…..just the Brine.  Our product is the only all-natural pickle juice on the market.  We designed our 750ml bottles to fit specifically with a shot pour making it very easy and clean to serve.  Most people think they can drink the leftover juice in pickle jars, but what they don't know is that brine is not meant for drinking.  It contains a lot of preservatives and chemicals to keep the pickles fresh and can be dangerous to consume.

Our customers at home as well as bars and restaurants use our brines for Pickle Back shots, Martini Mixers, Bloody Marys, Cramp Relief, Hangover Cure, and creating their own fun pickled food creations (pickle back chicken wings).

Our company was recently featured on Barstool Sports Big Brain entrepreneur contest and won an investment from Barstool and Jon Taffer.  We are currently generating over $10,000/month and are determined to make Brine Brothers a million-dollar beverage company.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

In 2015, when I figured out Pickle Juice was curing my hangovers, I looked everywhere to find a drinkable pickle brine, but it did not exist.  

It took me a couple months to realize that pickle juice was the main reason I was not getting a hangover.  When I went out and took over 3 pickle back shots, the next morning I felt great.  

This led me to drinking the leftover juice in pickle jars before I went to sleep after a long night out. After chugging countless pickle jars, throwing out pickles, and straining all the seeds, I searched for a drinkable pickle juice and to my amazement I couldn't find anything.  

I talked to Mike (who had just got his MBA from [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) at Cal Berkeley) about the possible endeavor and then we were on a mission to take every pickle back shot in NYC.  

Fortunately, we didn’t have to go to 10,000 bars to realize they had the same problem as us.  Every single bar we went to used the same unsanitary pickle juice in a plastic quart that they would usually grab off the floor.  We knew we had something with our idea.

Brine Brothers started as a passion project but we always knew it was bound to catch fire.

### Take us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product.

Bringing our concept to reality was much harder than we anticipated.  Neither of us had a background in the food/beverage industry but it was very helpful that we had a clear idea of the result we wanted to achieve.

After researching our market, educating ourselves on the industry, and putting together a strong business plan, we were able to face our challenges.

**The Juice**

We started with small batches in a commercial kitchen to test flavors with family and friends, then ultimately found the flavor profiles we wanted.  

We needed the ability to scale the business, so we started looking for co-packers around the tri-state area.  There was a lot of helpful resources online but like anything else on the internet it was harder than it looked.  95% of the co-packers we contacted stopped the conversation at ‘pickle juice.’  

They justified cutting the phone calls short by claiming they didn’t want pickle flavor affecting their bottling machines.  We finally vetted a list of co-packers that agreed to run pickle juice through their bottling lines.  

Our next obstacle was learning how we can legally produce a consumable beverage. We worked with Cornell University and NC State.  It took 4-months processing time to test our samples and obtain approval letters for our co-packer.

We sourced our logo from [99designs](https://99designs.com/).  It was a really fun process where a community of artists compete for the project by submitting creative ideas.  We selected a winning designer and worked with them to create the branding we have today.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/154/original/open-uri20190726-4-f2m4r9?1564179509)

Mike and I have witnessed so many bars spill pickle juice everywhere, so we always knew we wanted a glass 750ml bottle to make it easy to serve with a shot pour.  

Plus, we have never seen pickle juice in a wine bottle and thought it was another way to distance ourselves from just your regular pickle guys.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/155/original/open-uri20190726-4-1xoj62d?1564179510)

Our startup costs were relatively low; business insurance, state filing fees, 99designs, trademarks, UPC Codes, food testing, and inventory.  We invested a total of $11,000 in 2016 and had a business valuation of $200,000 3 years later.

### Describe the process of launching the business.

After we ran our first 3,000 units, we went bar to bar in NYC handing out samples to bartenders.  I worked part-time in a bar throughout college summers and knew if we could create something that was easier, cleaner, and faster for bartenders, they would love it.  They never saw anything like it and were ecstatic.

We were able to land several accounts before we started selling online straight to consumers. Mike’s brother-in-law, Jamie Haas, had a lot of experience building e-commerce stores so we were able to leverage his knowledge and employed him to build the site and run our IT.  Mike and I know if we aren’t experts in a certain field then we will find someone who has the technical expertise.

At this point in our operation we had 2 sales channels; e-commerce and NYC self-distribution to bars and restaurants. It was somewhat odd how the stars aligned when we launched in 2017, the year of the pickle trend.  At the same time we were going live; pickle soda was trending, pickle flavored popcorn was in 7/11, and pickle slushee rumors were circulating out of Sonic drive-ins.  There couldn’t have been a better opportunity for us to have the only all-natural premium branded pickle juice on the market.  

We caught the attention of Delish.com and 400k views on Facebook.

#### Landing an athlete sponsor

Shortly after we launched, we saw NHL-NJ Devils forward Blake Coleman drinking a pickle jar in the penalty box.  Pickle juice is a growing trend among athletes for cramp relief; faster than water and sugary sports drinks.  

[https://twitter.com/njdevils/status/917129331939446785?lang=en](https://twitter.com/njdevils/status/917129331939446785?lang=en)

Mike and I are huge devils fans so we did everything we could to connect with him.  We were finally able to reach him via Instagram DM, dropped off samples, and have been business partners with him since.  

We currently white label Blake’s sport version of pickle juice ‘P20.’  This past season we joined Blake in his charity ‘Pickles Pals’ which supports the boys and girls club of Ironbound-Newark, NJ.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

The first two years we were building Brine Brothers organically through grass roots growth.  We attended pickle festivals on the east coast, pitched bar to bar in NYC, and were very active on social media.  We had the longest lines at festivals, and nothing makes us happier than creating something people love and enjoy.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/157/original/open-uri20190726-4-dz3sbe?1564179511)

We currently run % discounts and promotions for holiday sales, MailChimp for email marketing, and have tapped one of our childhood friends, [Kurtis Alward](http://kurtisalward.com/), for SEM and online marketing strategy.  

Kurt has an extensive background in this field, we are under his guidance for SEO, ad spending, and social media marketing.

These metrics are from 1.5 weeks after the Big Brain release.  We monitor our activity daily and are cautiously distributing our online marketing budget.  We are finding out which platforms are working best for us and at the right customer acquisition costs. 

Articles and mentions from companies like Barstool, $20 chef, Delish, NHL.com, trendhunter.com, CBS news, USA Today, and NJ Bergen Record have fueled our growth and online search results.

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/159/original/open-uri20190726-4-1w4y4o?1564179512)

Check out our Barstool video here.

Our biggest e-commerce challenge is shipping costs.  Customers are deterred when they see shipping is $12.80 but the bottles are only $8.  The new norm is Amazon free 2-day shipping and as an avid amazon user I understand their hesitation.  

However, we priced our online bottles at a lower price to make up for the high shipping prices.  3 bottles fit into one package, so we try to tell our customers the most cost-effective is the 3-pack for a total of $34.

Our bottles retail at stores for over $11 ea, so they are paying the same price buying a 3-pack online.  We engaged in talks with Amazon but they are crushing small businesses under their model and it would leave us near breakeven.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

The future is very exciting for Brine Brothers.  Our passion project has escalated into a premium beverage brand that we hope continues to grow.

Our focus after the Barstool Big Brain contest is on distribution.  We have had so many people reach out to us, the support and requests for our product has been amazing.  We are in talks with regional and national distributors to scale our company and get to more customers.

Brine Brothers - All-Natural Premium **Brine**  Company.  We have always wanted to keep our options open for future products.  After our recent success of pickle brine we will be expanding to premium olive brines.  Everyone has seen bartenders strain unsanitary olive jars while making martinis. This will be another big market for us and this time we already have the infrastructure in place.

We are also working on merchandise.  We have orders in for branded tote bags for our festivals and Barstool Sports co-branded apparel.  Barstool has been a great partner for us with a lot of resources we plan on leveraging. Look out for our t-shirts soon:

[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/002/160/original/open-uri20190726-4-1moeor3?1564179513)

Barstools investment has allowed us to scale our inventory and increase our profit margin from 60% to 80%.  This will allow us to grow even faster than our YoY growth of 200%.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

We have really valued surrounding ourselves with industry experts.

Jamie and Kurt have been a great addition to our team.  Another example is my father, Jules, who has been an executive in the packaging industry for over 25 years.  We have been able to bounce ideas off him and looked to him for guidance on issues such as packaging, supplies, freight, and fulfillment.  Another childhood friend of ours, Jason Sansone, is a professional videographer who has also helped us out with content:

We look back and are still amazed that we were able to partner with Blake and the Devils.  It has been an extremely fun and rewarding partnership.  Not only do we want to expand our business, but we are also trying to make an impact and strengthen communities.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

We originally used WooCommerce but have recently switched to Shopify.  We made the jump after realizing how much better shopify works for us.  They offered better reporting and analytics we can use for customer engagement and acquisition.

**Social Media**

- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en)

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) 

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)

**Tools**

- Google Analytics

- Facebook Marketing

- MailChimp

- 99Designs

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I have always wanted to start my own company.  Even if it takes working 80 hours/week instead of 40, I rather create something for myself and my family than work a job that is unfulfilling.

We always try to surround ourselves with people that inspire us.  Our families and friends have all played a major role in propelling us to where we are today.

Podcasts I am listening to right now:

- [Bloomberg’s; Masters in Business](https://www.bloomberg.com/podcasts/masters_in_business)

- [Side Hustle School](https://sidehustleschool.com/)

- [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money)

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Nothing is easy, be creative, and prepare to make sacrifices.

It took us 2 years from concept to production and we faced more challenges than ever anticipated.  Stay focused and goal oriented.

We found a need for a product that didn’t exist.  So we created it.  

Its been 3 years, Mike and I still have never taken a distribution from the company, not even our original investment.  All of our profits go back into the business to grow and scale.  We have sacrificed countless hours and efforts into growing our company.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

We currently do not have any positions open but are always seeking help with the following:

- Social content creators (we can always use more freelance content)

- Help at our pickle festivals (shoot us a DM if we are in a city near you!)

687,96l5pf,False,Young Entrepreneur,173,"Installing automated driveway gate openers, make $2,500 to $10,000 per day.",Entrepreneur,"I'm in the business of building custom driveway gates for clients all across the US.

When I was just starting out on my own building and selling the driveway gates I also sold the automated opener systems (usually at cost) and installed them in order to try to ensure that I got the gate sale. I was waaaay underbidding at this point but it did allow me to get a start and lots of experience. I've since installed driveway gates in dozens of states. Eventually I worked my way up to where I would charge $2,500 labor to perform a 1 day installation.

Over the years I got so busy building gates that I had to find other companies to handle the installation of the gate and openers; I would just ship the gates to my clients or to their installer. Finding several installers in my client's location, I would talk to the installers and first see if they were comfortable installing the gates I build, then try to get a feel for how competent they were, then make recommendations to the client based on what impression I got from the installers.

A high end gate opener system typically runs anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 for the openers and accessories, depending on brand and how many accessories.

It's typically a 1-2 day installation for 2 guys who understand what's going on. A 1 day, 1 man job if the guy has the right equipment and knowledge. Most gate techs make around $20-30 an hour.

In the past two weeks I've had two different clients located in the Midwest (different states) who reported that they got quotes of $10,000 and $8,500 in **labor alone** to perform these installations. But here's the thing...both quotes weren't even for full installations. Basically everything was already in place, these companies were only performing the actual wiring and programming which wouldn't even take me 4 hours to complete.

I don't know if it's just that the economy is so hot that everyone is pricing like crazy right now or what...it's definitely a tight market, seemingly everywhere, with all the homebuilding going on it is hard to even get anyone in the service industry to call you back right now...but these quotes are still nearly double what I'm used to seeing from other people who install for me!!

Anyone else out there in this field? Or interested in getting in this field? There is definitely plenty of room for growth! I would love to hear back from others...let me know any questions you have about this field and I'll be glad to answer them for you!

Don't you need to have a contractor's license in your state or the other states you work in?

I wouldn't know the first thing about what to do to build a fence. I'd imagine it is all custom built, because you never know how wide the opening is, how the client wants it decor-wise, etc.

I couldn't imagine doing this, I'd fuck everything up, probably knock down the brick posts the gates are supposed to be attached to, or using the welder, start a fire on the wood posts the gate is supposed to attach to.

All states have to require a license for this. You don't want some idiot like me to decide to start in the gate business and fuck someone's shit up.

# What I Learned Burning $13,867 on YouTube Ads

YouTube allows you to pay to show an ad before a video plays. 

Since Candy Japan is a service aimed at people with some interest in Japan, and there is an endless supply of videos aimed at the same audience, it seemed that it was worth a shot to try to advertise there. After all even a small chance at finding a new major source of conversions makes it worth a try.

Here's what I learned along the way from creating the video all the way to tweaking the ad campaign and finally looking at the results.

## Creating an ad for YouTube

With AdWords you just need three lines of text, but to advertise on YouTube you need a video to show. It doesn't need to be long though. Even 30 seconds will do. But when it comes to creating video, that's actually a pretty long time.

The major types of videos are screencasts, live action or an animation. Screencasts might work well if you were trying to sell an app or a game, but wasn't really applicable for a candy subscription service. I considered a live video showing the candy boxes being delivered, or an animated explainer video. Since the people viewing my ad had a high likelihood of also liking anime, I figured an ad in a similar style might be a good match.

### Process & cost of creating an animated ad

I found some examples indicating that an animation would cost about $100 - $150 per second to make. Given that a typical YouTube ad is 30 seconds, you can see this gets expensive fast.

I found two options: either hire an animation studio, or work with a freelancer. Since I had already worked with an artist to create [the manga illustration for the site](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/mangaexplainer.png), I asked him if he might be able to create an animation too.

Me and my wife came up with a [quick storyboard, just using stick figures](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/candyjapan-stickfigure.png). I compiled them into a slideshow, wrote the voiceover dialog and mumbled it out while flipping the slides to create the timings.

Based on our stick figure slides, [the artist drew up keyframes](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/candyjapan-box-flying.png). That moved things forward, as we could now discuss particular changes we wanted.

Based on my mumblings I ordered a voiceover with a professional actress reading out the lines properly. The voiceover cost was about $100, which seemed relatively cheap now, as I was already paying about $3000 for the animation.

With rough sketches and a voice track timed to them, work could start to turn them into final animation assets.

The whole process from finding someone able to do this to actually having an uploadable video took 4 months. I imagine that going with a studio might have been a better choice, as the cost would have been similar but the turnaround time would likely have been much faster.

Here's the [end result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0aY1GxvRMk). If the video tingles your weeaboo senses, that's intentional, as I want clearly uninterested people to skip the video as fast as possible. I'll explain why next. 

## You've got to spend money to spend money

Now after spending a lot of money to create an ad, you can finally get started spending even more money showing the ad to people.

YouTube itself is used to upload the video. You can make it unlisted if you want. Then to get the ad to appear before videos (*""In-stream ad""*), you use AdWords to create a campaign. The [YouTube video ID is used to link the AdWords ad with the video](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/adwords-youtube-ad.png).

### How YouTube ads are priced

Just like AdWords, the cost of an ad view is based on an auction between advertisers. However the auction is not based on clicks, but on views. To enter this auction the minimum bid is $0.01 per view, which might sound low, but isn't really.

Internet advertising is usually priced in terms of 1000 views, called the CPM rate. The low end starts at much less than a dollar, for example [advertising on Explain XKCD costs about $0.20 per 1000 views](https://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id=70571&type=3®ions=1,0,2,9,&sumdata=1). Mid range would be single digits, say [$3 for showing an ad on Cult of Mac](https://www.buysellads.com/buy/detail/19392). The upper range is low double digits, for instance [a banner on bitcoin.com costs $30 per 1000 views](https://www.buysellads.com/buy/detail/282603). 

Translating the YouTube ads ""per view"" thinking into CPM: $0.01 per view would be $10 CPM. And this is just the **minimum bid** that it is possible to pay. Bidding this low probably wouldn't get you many views, and I found myself bidding much higher (equivalent to [actual TV ad prices](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/tv-advertising/)) to get just enough views to determine whether my campaigns were working at all.

Now the good news: you don't have to pay if someone quickly skips your video! So if you manage to come up with an ad that is completely uninteresting to people outside of your target audience such that they skip it immediately, you don't have to pay for those views.

I found that 30% of people would actually watch our ad (70% skip). When you take into account that only 30% of people will watch the ad, a more accurate comparison with banner ads would be an interstitial ad with a $3 CPM minimum (1000 impressions * 30% view ad * $0.01). 

Now you might understand why I want to get people not in my target audience to skip – it's cheaper because you don't pay when people skip your ad!

## Targeting options

Compared to TV advertising, YouTube really shines with all the options you have for showing your ad to only your desired audience. The main targeting options are topics, placements and audiences. Topics and placements control which videos your ad is shown against, while audiences allow you to show ads based on who is viewing the ad.

### Topics

It would be a huge pain to have to individually select thousands of videos to show your ad against. That's where topics come in, as they are pre-made groups of videos relating to a certain subject.

For example if you are trying to market a strategy game, you are in luck, because [there is a topic just for that](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/adwords-youtube-topics.png).

### Placements

With placements you can show your ad before a certain video, or before all the videos of your chosen YouTube channels ([example screenshot](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/adwords-placements.png)). For instance if you were selling an app for creating bingo cards, you could find all the ""how to make bingo cards""-type videos and show your ad before those.

Sadly in practice I found that it was difficult to get views this way, at least for any price I was willing to test. Even when listing thousands of videos, I wasn't able to get any meaningful amount of views for my ad. It could be that a lot of the videos I tried were either unpopular, had monetization disabled or my bids were just way too low.

### Audiences

With audience matching Google tries to figure out what type of a person is viewing a video, and if that matches your selection then your ad can be shown.

There are a lot of options here. You can target investors, cooking enthusiasts, people into DIY, pet lovers, gamers and more ([example screenshot](https://www.candyjapan.com/static/adwords-audiences.png)).

Audience matching finally gave me enough clicks to find out whether anyone ever buys anything through YouTube ads. 

### Keywords

In the beginning I said there are topics, placements and audiences, but actually there is another targeting method. One where I still have no idea how it is supposed to work: keywords.

I assumed to trigger a keyword match, the video title or description would have to match it. This turned out not to be the case.

For example when I tried the keyword ""anime"", my ad got shown before these videos: [some Lithuanian song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jf66b9VQ8c), [a tutorial on how to make gnomes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBqEFwhdoo8) and [some german rap video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f3332Kp2w). Not exactly anime.

*""Keywords can trigger your ad to show when people view related content on YouTube, websites or apps"".*

Apparently this ""related content"" is defined more broadly than I had assumed. 

## I know what video you saw last summer

Oh yeah, I wanted to mention a cool tracking thing YouTube provides. As you might assume, you can easily track when a click on the ad results in a sale. But the cool part is that you can also track when someone views your ad, and then a bit later types in your web address to make the purchase without ever clicking the link.

In other words you can track both people who click through an ad directly, or who see your ad and then visit your site a bit later (this is known as a ""*view-through conversion*""). It's magic. Magical enough that you'll have to take Google's word on it that these customers actually did view the ad, since you won't be able to detect it yourself.

Besides purely trusting the reports given to me, I also added a field to my order form where I asked people ""where did you hear about Candy Japan?"". This confirmed that YouTube really was sending these new customers.

## Tweaking the campaign: exclude!

AdWords gives you a lot of interesting data about which of your targeting options converted and which did not. Looking carefully at the data AdWords gave me, I did find a few simple ways for lowering the cost of a sale. 

The key realization here is that advertising is as much about showing your ad to people, as it is about NOT showing it to those less likely to buy. An easy start is to just stop all topics or audiences that don't seem to be working.

If that still doesn't make your campaign profitable, there are broader exclusions and bid adjustments you can make based on age, gender, device, location, parental status and household income. For instance you might find that people in certain locations or age groups are less likely to buy than others.

With these adjustments I was able to significantly lower the cost per conversion for the campaign. 

## In conclusion, did you break even?

Nope. I lost money.

Many viewers did place an order after seeing the ad, but not enough to justify continuing the campaign. This was true even taking into account the full lifetime value of a customer. While I was not able to make the campaign break even, by tweaking the targeting options I was able to get pretty close.

For now I have stopped the campaign and will reflect a bit on what went wrong before possibly trying again.

As advice for someone else who wants to try advertising on YouTube, I'd say your product or service should make at least tens of dollars in profit to at least have a shot at making the numbers work. Advertising an app with a flat cost of only a few dollars would be unlikely to work even at the lowest bid levels. 

If you do have a suitable product, be prepared to spend thousands while you tweak your campaign towards profitability! Good luck.

Founded in 2007, **Rocket Internet** responds to entrepreneurial originality with near\-instantaneous mimicry: Show them a viable American business model and in due time, a boiler room full of coders will reverse engineer a knock\-off. It’s a process that has spawned more than a hundred companies around the world.

DID YOU KNOW: Before Hello Fresh became a global food\-delivery service, it started off as Rocket's copy of Blue Apron. Hello Fresh is among 100\+ companies that Rocket has spawned since 2007.

Known as the ""clone kings,"" brothers Marc, Alexander and Oliver Samwer have made billions with companies like Alando, an eBay lookalike launched in 1999 that, two months later, was acquired by eBay for $40 million. And in what became a lucrative tactic of knocking off—then being acquired by—the originators, they sold their own eDarling to a dating site you might have heard of, eHarmony. The Samwers have aped hundreds of companies—as Bloomberg put it, ""churning out copy cat start\-ups""—as they've sold off an empire of clones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8feuhx/this_company_makes_billions_from_building/,558,"So with something like a dating site, where do they get users?

319,5q05lf,False,,256,I wrote an email to Entrepreneur.com. This kind of behavior shouldn't be allowed in our industry.,Entrepreneur,"I just wrote an email to the team at Entrepreneur.com after reading an article on their site about a 26 year old entrepreneur who apparently built a 10 Million dollar consulting business inside of 4 years. As a 26 year old entrepreneur myself, I was immediately intrigued by this story and thus began to do some research on how I too could be like him, sitting here myself at a measly 1 Million dollars. Don’t be fooled by people like Sam Ovens. Please. I’ll just paste my email to Entrepreneur.com below so you too can be informed.

Hey entrepreneur.com team! I just stumbled across this article from you all in my Flipboard, https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281150, and was shocked at what I read. As a 26 year old entrepreneur I suddenly felt very low on the totem pole as I read about someone the same age as me, making $10 million in his consulting business. Obviously I should stop what I’m doing and start doing what he is! Well I did a little digging and was stunned by the first Google autocomplete result when I typed in his name. Scam. Now I run a website dedicated to crowdsourcing scams (Kickscammed.com) which has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and Wired Magazine. I know a thing or two about scam artists.

Simply a few Google searches away were multiple review websites stating how Sam Ovens stole their money, refused to refund purchases, sells repackaged and non original content, and overall is a complete con artist. There’s even a Facebook group CALLED Sam Ovens organization is Fraud. Sam’s own product is endorsed by a multi-level marketing (pyramid scheme) guru named Richard Matharoo, who’s own website states his product doesn’t guarantee you any income or success.

Now I myself am a consultant, and we’ve had a pretty good year over here at SoFriendly, up around the $1 million range when you add up everything we’ve done. Now that’s impressive but that’s also revenue not profit. Regardless, even Sam’s own Facebook seems to show where his $10 million figure comes from.
“In the past 12 months I have created 9 Millionaire Consultants with this training.”

Ok so if he made $1 Million, and his customers each made $1 Million, that means he built a $10 Million consulting business? I don’t think that’s how that math works. My last startup went public and is sitting at $19 million right now, does that mean my consulting business is a $20 million business? If so, you should definitely write an article about me!

I only write this email to say, we in the “biz” look up to you all. We read your articles. This makes me not want to any more though. It seems scammy, spammy, improperly researched and overall gives us ACTUAL consultants a bad name. The guy has zero customers with any reputable businesses, the endorsements he DOES have scream of pyramid schemes, just look at these reviews here: https://app.samovens.com/consulting-webinar-acc-universal/
If you look these people up, they all do the EXACT same thing he does! It’s all an endless cycle of online webinar schemes.

Just look here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/4mrd94/anyone_have_any_reviews_of_andrew_argues_training/

I’d urge you to write a follow up article and possibly even remove the original article. We don’t need more people losing their money to people like this. It’s a sleazy, shitty way of doing business and we need actual, passionate, entrepreneurs out there in the world making amazing products; not an endless cycle webinars trying to sell you more shit. Someone once told me what makes us entrepreneurs is that we see the world the way it ought to be, and we make it happen. These people aren’t doing that. They aren’t entrepreneurs. They are selling snake oil. Don’t mix us in with them. It’s insulting to all the blood sweat and tears we as entrepreneurs are putting into our products and our clients day in and day out. Write an article about a REAL entrepreneur.

It's not an accomplishment of success; it's an accomplishment of risk. After years of feeling the entrepreneurial itch and dreaming about one day owning a successful business, I finally convinced myself to really try to make it happen. I'm sick of waiting for a time when things will be easier for me financially, when I will be 'less busy' (like that will ever happen with kids...), or when I will have less to lose if I fail. I've been so cautious - trying to bootstrap myself up through a failed kickstarter, not willing to risk my own capital - but I'm done waiting for someone else to make this happen. So this week I spent nearly $10,000 on products from a Chinese supplier I have been working with, hiring a graphic designer for my packaging, buying a UPC, and etc. It's terrifying. And exhilarating. I really hope I find the demand I think is there for my product, and that this is a small first step towards a more exciting and fulfilling life. Wish me luck! You guys are awesome!

309,e5yj9v,False,,221,"PSA: Please be very wary of any “business personality” who is selling a “method” to be a rich or a millionaire, especially under 5 years",Entrepreneur,"Okay so I recently decided I wanted to set up my own business (hence why I am on this sub). So I did the thing any person under 50 would do and searched how to set up a business, run ads etc on YouTube, google and in this sub. Well slap me in the face and call me Shirely, I was sent down a massive black hole of “business gurus” who for the knock off price of $1997 (normally 5k) could make me a millionaire. My YouTube is still getting panned by fake guru ads as we speak. 

I was so taken back by these figures that I have been a two day rabbit hole researching if all this was legit in anyway. 

Interestingly, if you look into this and go back all the way to the 70’s/80’s Don Lapre is seemingly the godfather of dropshipping. He was doing it even before the Internet by placing small ads in a newspaper (the equivalent of FB ads). If this ad got a certain amount of sales, he would then apparently scale this ad to thousands of other newspapers (sounds familiar, right?).  When that was failing, he moved on to release vitamin products which seems to be an MLM business where when you sign up to 20 people to buy the vitamin products you got a bonus, and some money if the people you signed up also sold. 

So yes dropshipping gurus making outlandish claims are nothing new and have been around for decades. Anyway Don Lapre was eventually arrested for nearly 70 counts of fraud and killed himself in his jail cell before he was sentenced. 

By this point I’m starting to realise these people aren’t selling you a product but a dream. Have you noticed how none of them talk about what skills you will gain, it’s more about lifestyle and FREEDOM you gain. I seriously doubt anyone has got rich in a year from drop shipping or affiliate marketing unless you already had a following you could leverage.  

Here’s some more interesting videos I came across on my journey. I’m not affiliated with any of these guys, their videos were just super interesting:

The video is titled “The Cult of Dan Lok- brainwashed student lost $26,000”. 

It’s a testimonial from a student giving the real results he got and the inner workings of Dan Loks courses and membership scheme

[Link 1](https://youtu.be/4VDiM_PMmZA)

Here’s another video by the same guy but this time on Sam Ovens

The video is titled: “Sam Ovens is a fake guru!? (100% REAL TESTIMONIAL) 

He shows a testimonial that Sam Ovens uses on his promotional videos. Weirdly the same guy giving this testimonial has given testimonials for a lot of other gurus, and some of the things he says about himself doesn’t add up with his LinkedIn profile. 

[Link 2](https://youtu.be/ez8yKklc1lE)

The video is titled: “The Contrepreneur Forumla Exposed”

This guy explains the science behind the formula used by these Entrepreneurs selling you courses:

[Link 3](https://youtu.be/vC5cmW8O3L8)

The video is titled “I got an Amazon best seller with a blank book”

To prove how bullshit the Amazon Best Seller tag is, the same guy also got an Amazon Best Seller by publishing a book with no text in. It got an Amazon best seller status within 48 hours...

[Link 4](https://youtu.be/WxZvEK9k4s0)

So yeah make of all of this what you will. But be careful for pursuing any business venture that promised to make you rich with 2 years or offers you “FREEDOM”.

We laugh at these gurus and some of their outlandish claims. People’s lives do get ruined for the sake of fake business gurus buying an extra boat. There are examples of guys who are in tens of thousands of debt but are then encouraged to take out PayPal loans to sign up to the course to make their money back... no joke.

395,8hz9ys,False,,79,How To Actually Develop The Growth Mindset (6 Techniques),Entrepreneur,"*Your subconscious beliefs are a huge part of the reason you aren't where you want to be. Find out why this is the case + 6 powerful techniques that will change your beliefs in to guide you towards reaching your potential.*

#The Science

A scientific experiment was conducted where a group of children was set a fairly easy maths puzzle. Once the kids had completed the puzzle, half the kids were told ""Well done! You're so smart!"" The other half were told ""Well done! You tried really hard!""

Then they were given a second, more difficult, puzzle to solve.

When confronted with the more difficult task, the kids who'd been congratulated for being smart would give up sooner and score much lower on the test. The kids who'd been praised for working hard would persevere when the questions were difficult and, as a result, earned higher scores.

Arguably even more fascinating, forty percent of the kids who were praised for intelligence *lied* about their scores when given the opportunity. By congratulating kids on raw talent, a **fear of failure** was created.

Carol Dweck was the creator of this experiment. The results led Dweck to become a professor at Stanford, a world expert on personality and development, and a bestselling author. 

Dweck now spends her days trying to answer this question: ""what makes people successful?"" Once she answers that she finds what part of that answer is within our control. 

Luckily for us, she found one mindset trait that every successful person had in common. Even more luckily for us, she found that is was entirely within our control to get this mindset trait.

Her findings presented themselves in Mindset: The New Psychology of Success. The book reveals how our conscious and unconscious thoughts dictate our lives and how something as simple as wording can have a surprisingly powerful impact on our ability to overcome hurdles and achieve our goals.

#The Two Mindsets

[Image.](https://andrewkirby.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Two-Mindsets-Featured-Infographic.jpg)

The way you view yourself almost entirely determines where you will end up in life. If you believe that your qualities are unchangeable you will want to prove yourself over and over, rather than learning from your mistakes.

This is the fixed mindset.

In Mindset, Dweck writes
> 
> ""If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character— well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.
> 
> […]
> 
> I’ve seen so many people with this one consuming goal of proving themselves— in the classroom, in their careers, and in their relationships. Every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality, or character. Every situation is evaluated: Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?""
> 

If this sounds like you then it's not entirely your fault. Our culture values intelligence, personality and character. It's normal to want these things. But...

In Mindset, Dweck writes
> 
> ""There’s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and others that you have a royal flush when you’re secretly worried it’s a pair of tens. In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.""
> 

By congratulating some kids on talent and others on hard work, the experiment forced them in to the two different mindsets. The kids who were praised on being smart ended up doing worse on the harder experiment: this is the fixed mindset. The kids that praised on working hard ended up doing much better.

This is the goal. If you can adopt the growth mindset then your life will completely change.

Dweck found that the type of mindset that people have is the biggest factor in determining how successful they are.

*""Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.""*

#Developing A Growth Mindset

As interesting as this is, it would be so much less valuable if there was nothing we can do about it. But our final brain is plastic - it can be moulded into the way we want it to be.

**We can change our brain so that we do and believe that which gets us closer to our goals.**

This is how we can do it.

##1. Create A New Compelling Belief

The most important belief that you must adopt is that any skill can be honed through deliberate practice.

Now, what's deliberate practice? There are two parts to it: actively practicing to improve and receiving constant and immediate feedback.

The truth of this statement is shocking - 99% of skills can be practiced just like playing the piano.

Just take a look at how someone's drawing ability can improve after just a week of training.

[Image](https://andrewkirby.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Portraits-before-and-after-the-drawing-course.jpg).

To create new beliefs you must focus on the evidence that supports the new belief and ignore the evidence that contradicts the new belief.

##2. Change The Way You View Failure

[Watch This Will Smith Video
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBUSsP9rDsw)

##3. Become Self Aware

Become completely aware of your strengths. Have a full understanding on where you have a natural advantage.

But also be completely and brutally aware of your weaknesses.

The best way to do this is hallucinogenic drugs. I mean, it actually is, but I'm not recommending it. The way I'd do it is by asking those people closest to me. Make a safe environment where they know that what they say will not offend you, then ask them what they think are your strengths and weaknesses.

##4. Become a curious learner

Recognise that life is beautiful. Recognise that you can learn something from everyone you meet. Let your inner child out.

I have seen many interviews where celebrities are asked what it was like when they met Elon Musk. Many of them reply in a similar way:

*It was incredible. He somehow tricked my into answering ten of his questions and I didn't even get to ask him once.*

Even Elon Musk is humble enough to recognize that everyone he meets he can learn from.

##5. Use Fear As A Compass

You should use fear as a guiding light because being scared of something shows that it's out of your comfort zone. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

This is done by constantly doing things you are afraid of.

##6. Develop GRIT

Recognise that there's a huge difference between your potential and what you do with it. The thing that will separate you from others is your ability to keep going when the time gets tough.

You can do this by turning it into one of the things you pride yourself on. Whenever you are bored recognize that this is the most important part of any task you do because it's at this point that most people stop and give up. But not you.

#Edit

I've had seven or eight direct messages asking who I am / where you can find me. I guess this is blatant self-promotion but I'd rather not reply the same thing to everyone that messages me.

Today's interview is with Kyle Bergman of [Swoveralls/The Great Fantastic](https://www.swoveralls.com), a brand that sells comfortable sweatpants overalls.

**I also wanted to time this so that you guys can watch Kyle on Shark Tank which airs tonight - I'm wishing him luck on making a deal with the sharks.**

**Some stats:**

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

Hey there! My name is Kyle Bergman, and I am the Founder and Chief Swoverall Officer of The Great Fantastic.  My brand’s mission is to create the world’s comfiest apparel products made from sustainable materials, and ethical manufacturing practices.

Our hero product, Swoveralls, is the combination of sweatpants and overalls into one glorious masterpiece.  I sold my first pair about 18 months ago, and have done over $300k to date all while not only having a variety of full and part-time jobs, but also going to business school, and playing lacrosse for the Israeli Men’s National Team.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

At first, I was really just trying to solve a personal problem - Sweatpant overalls didn’t exist, and I wanted a pair. I’ve always loved overalls for reasons I can’t really explain.  Perhaps it’s the fact they’re a little unique to wear...yet functional and practical.  

Anyways, a friend actually sent me a [BuzzFeed article about a novelty pair of sweatpant overalls](https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/these-sweatpants-overalls-are-making-me-have-so-many-feeling) they looked like denim overalls but were made of a sweatpant material. I said to myself, “Man, I would never wear those...but regular sweatpant overalls I would 100% rock!”.

Alas, “normal sweatpant overalls” did not exist online after a quick google search, nor in any stores that I visited. So I made them. But let’s back up for a second...

When my friend showed me the article it was early 2016, and I was a merchandise planner at Bloomingdale’s.  Right out of college I went into the Bloomingdale’s executive training program and was there for 4 years learning the ropes of being a retail merchant.  For those that aren’t exactly sure what that is - a merchant or buyer is someone who manages vendor relationships and decides what products a store will sell.  Every item you’ve ever looked at in a department store like Macy’s or Bloomingdale’s, or even non-traditional retail stores like Equinox or Cabela’s has a buying team behind it that is making decisions on what products should shown.

I was an assistant buyer in luggage, a senior assistant in women’s fragrances, and then an associate merchandise planner in jewelry. Planners work with buyers to analyze the inventory risks and opportunities of the products and brands they purchase. The skills I acquired from these roles would play a critical role in my brand’s launch and growth.

In May 2016, I left Bloomingdale’s to pursue an amazing opportunity as the Men’s Grooming Buyer at Birchbox. Birchbox is a disruptive tech/e-commerce company that pioneered what is now a massive and very competitive subscription box environment.  A little after I joined Birchbox, I began my MBA journey via the part-time program at NYU’s Stern school of business.  

Around Winter ‘16/Spring ‘17 is when a few interesting things happen.  I learned through school about Alibaba’s B2B platform, where a potential buyer no matter how big could procure goods from a seller.  Additionally, I learned about Google’s Keyword Search Planner tool, where you could see what the search demand was for a given keyword, during a certain timeframe.  Lastly, I began to learn more about Amazon’s fulfillment service.  These 3 concepts would be instrumental to my company ever even getting off the ground.

**Alibaba**

While I didn’t find exactly what I was looking for when I googled “sweatpant overalls”, I did notice a search result for what looked like a rendering of sweatpant overalls on a mannequin.  This result was on Alibaba’s website, and the item was indeed called “sweatpant overalls”.

Problem was, the minimum order quantity was 300 units.  In other words, the supplier would only make sweatpant overalls for anyone who wanted 300 pairs or more. At the time, I had no intention of obtaining more than 1 (for myself!). However, I knew based on my buying experience at Bloomies that if I bluffed and looked like a serious buyer, I could get a sample for next to nothing...which at the time would solve my problem of simply just wanting a pair for myself.  

I did in fact negotiate a price for 1 sample (think it was about $80 US), and actually received my pair - problem solved!

But then a couple new “good” problems arose:

1.) the french terry cotton they were made out of was really soft and amazing

2.) as a result, friends & family wanted a pair too!

**Google’s Keyword Search Planner**

Once I realized other people might want sweatpant overalls too, I used Google's keyword search planner to see roughly how many people were looking for this term online.  In the month of March 2017, this tool showed that between 100-1,000 people were also looking for sweatpant overalls.  

[*Keyword search results in March 2017*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/408/original/open-uri20190412-4-1sro4s6?1555031169)

A part of me was shocked, but after I thought about it...it made sense - probably a little awareness created from the BuzzFeed article, but more importantly, people just like me were looking for an awesome, comfy combo.

**Amazon’s FBA service**

Once I realized I had a supplier, and there was some sort of demand for this unique apparel item that didn’t exist, I knew the only way I would have any chance of selling sweatpant overalls was through Amazon’s fulfillment service.  

Living in a shoebox apartment in NYC, I didn’t have any room for inventory, nor did I want to spend my time picking and packing orders….or finding a warehouse that would do the same.  Additionally, I didn’t have any experience or budget to do a meaningful marketing campaign, but I knew Amazon would help me overcome these obstacles by

1.) holding my inventory in their warehouses

2.) listing my product on their site

What I didn’t realize is that you needed a legitimate business to start an Amazon seller’s account, and so I incorporated The Great Fantastic, LLC.  in March 2017.  

Why The Great Fantastic? Well, I knew I didn’t want to pigeonhole myself right out of the gate with a company name like “Sweatpant Overalls, Inc.”...so I chose a funky term that I thought could one day could become an amazing brand.  Taking a trip into the great fantastic is something my Mom would say when referring to risk-taking and adventuring into the unknown.  

It always stuck with me, and I thought it was such a cool term that could comprise the vibe and message I was trying to communicate..which was something like, “We don’t take ourselves too seriously, but we don’t mess around when it comes to comfort.”

**Funding the business**

But how did I initially fund it?  Well, in order to pay for business school, I had to take out a bunch of student loan money.  For better or worse, I took out too much money for my first term and received a disbursement to my bank account for the funds that were not used for tuition, which was about $10,000.  

Normally, a rationally-minded individual would send that money back to the lender as it’ll lower your student loan debt.  I decided to use this money to kickstart my sweatpant overalls project, and used most of it to pay for my first order from overseas.

### Take us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product.

Because of the Alibaba supplier, I was able to leapfrog some initial design and manufacturing steps that would come back later to bite me in the ass.

Every entrepreneur gets incredibly lucky at one point or another.  Could be simple timing, or could be a blissful ignorance of the enormous risks that are not recognized, and therefore unknowingly avoided by chance.  

I guess you could say I had both kinds of luck.  Timing for me - my friend sending me the article, the item not existing, business school starting, etc.  Blissful Ignorance - I sent $10,000 to a supplier in China I had never met in person, and only spoke to through the Alibaba messaging platform. Crazy.

I went back and forth via email with the initial supplier on design tweaks: we widened the straps, we added the jogger cuff, and we adjusted the fit and sizes for men & women accordingly, but at the end of the day, the “overalls” pattern was such a ubiquitous design that we were simply changing a well-known recipe slightly by adding a new ingredient...sweatpants :)

Throughout this process I never received a “tech-pack” for the swoveralls which is analogous to a blueprint for a house - it is the schematic of your apparel item that can then be used by any knowledgeable manufacturer to reproduce your product.

I also didn’t realize how lucky I was getting with the order minimums (also known as MOQs aka minimum order quantity).  This supplier would allow me to do 250 pairs per color, so for my first order, I ordered 500 pairs: 250 in grey, and 250 in navy.  

I didn’t create any patents because I knew (from my Bloomingdale’s and Birchbox days) that patenting apparel designs is like the wild west - the biggest brands in the world are constantly copying (and sueing) and each other, and there was nothing proprietary about my design, just a unique combo of design and fabric.  I did however trademark the term “Swoveralls”.

[*Picture of first sample ever I’m wearing in Birchbox Office!*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/409/original/open-uri20190412-4-19nxvov?1555031169)

### Describe the process of launching the business.

Initially, I had no intention of launching my own website, let alone fulfilling product through it. I thought this whole project would be a nice form of passive income solely through Amazon’s platform.  

Shortly after launching on Amazon though, I realized that for all the positive benefits FBA possessed, it was extremely difficult to build an audience as Amazon does not share customer data, and makes it very difficult to communicate with customers.  

Additionally, I understood there were better margin opportunities shipping directly to consumers, and so I initially created a Squarespace shop, but then migrated over to Shopify as I found it a much more intuitive and effective e-commerce platform.

The initial “funding” was from the student loan disbursement I mentioned earlier, and I was able to reinvest the profits from subsequent sales back into the business in the form of more orders to my supplier.  In the first year, we did a little over $65k in sales between Amazon and my own site.  

About 7 months after launching, I decided to do a Kickstarter + Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to create “Swoveralls 2.0”, which had more color options, more functionality, and higher quality, sustainably made fabric.  When a Kickstarter campaign is successfully funded, IndieGogo allows you to “roll over” the campaign on to their platform so you can keep accepting preorders, and acquiring more customers/awareness.  I raised about $75k on Kickstarter, and another $33k on Indiegogo for about $108k in total crowdfunding sales.

Prior to these campaigns I moved production from overseas to Los Angeles to also capitalize on the “Made in the USA” aspect, as well as cut production lead times down, and, in theory, have a better line of communication with my supplier (who spoke English as their native language are were only a 3 hour time zone difference away).  

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

I’ve had a couple big events/milestones that have worked to attract customers, but the large majority of my website traffic and customers has been organic either through earned media ([here’s the first article anyone ever wrote about us](https://www.fatherly.com/gear/swoveralls-sweatpant-overalls/) & [here’s another one I received mainly due to my Birchbox job at the time](https://www.businessinsider.com/day-in-the-life-of-tech-startup-employee-with-hot-side-gig-2018-2)), social (people see our posts and visit), or search (people googling sweatpant overalls and finding us).  

This last channel is the main reason I started this whole project in the first place. I knew at least at the beginning I would not have to do a ton of heavy lifting to attract customers because no one was selling a product there was clearly demand for.

Crowdfunding was a perfect blend of customer acquisition and retention.  I was fortunate to beat my goal within the first 24 hours of launching which created a little PR buzz.  Additionally, one of my FB videos went viral during the campaign (9M+ views) which led to a huge influx in traffic/sales.  

Important to note this viral moment was orchestrated and not organic.  I worked with a company called [Margle Media](https://www.marglemedia.com/) based out of Milwaukee to create a fun, engaging video based on existing video assets I had, and with their FB network relationships, they (for a fee) dropped the video on a page called “22 words” that had millions of followers.  

The video spread like wildfire, and was a huge moment for my brand.  

[*The Facebook Viral Video*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/410/original/open-uri20190412-4-4epyhx?1555031169)

I think crowdfunding also comprises retention characteristics as well because this is a special and loyal type of consumer.  They’ve been with me since the beginning of Swoveralls 2.0, and were incredibly patient and understanding during the development delays.  More importantly, the product came out awesome, and so at the end of the day, I think these people took a chance on me and my brand, and were rewarded with a high-quality product that they now love.  For the risk they took on me, I’ll love these customers for life.

Retention in other aspects has been lacking for me.  I’m very weird about email. As a brand, I know it’s arguably the best way to stay in touch with your customers, but as an individual, I can’t stand getting most brand emails.  The two exceptions are Chubbies and Allbirds, and for different reasons, but both emails I open up almost every time.  Chubbies voice and style is hysterical.  Allbirds has beautiful imagery and stories.  It’s also important to note both brands make really great products.  

Chubbies and Allbirds are two brands I truly aspire to be like. I think they get it, and are a constant source of motivation and inspiration for me. In fact, I guess you could say I want The Great Fantastic to be the passionate love child of these two companies.  

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

Today is a very exciting time for my brand.  On April 21st at 10pm EST my company will be featured on Shark Tank.  

I was incredibly fortunate enough to have been introduced to one of the casting producers through a mutual friend, and was flown out and filmed my episode this past September.  I can’t share what happened, but the awareness/exposure this moment will bring my company is hopefully going to be life-changing in the best way possible.

In prepping for my air date, I’ve spoken to a bunch of brands who have been on, and based on their feedback and experience, I’m trying to stay focused on the long-term as this will be an amazing moment, but will not define my brand or product in the long road.  It’s definitely a marathon.

Speaking of the long road, I’m working on an 18-24 month plan right now, which is about as far out as I’m willing to plan.  It doesn’t make sense to spend too much time thinking about year 3 or 4.  It’s nice to have overarching goals (ie Hit $20MM in sales in 5 years!), but from a tactical standpoint so much can change that I’m trying to keep a more fluid/agile approach.  

That said, my main priorities for the next 6 months are to relaunch my Amazon channel (which has been dormant due to lack of inventory), create Swoveralls Shorts, and also develop a limited edition collection where we come out with awesome colors and patterns that are designed/chosen by my customers in an interactive crowdsourcing experience.  

In the short term, I’m not focused on creating new products other than Swoveralls because I’ve become the “authority” in the onesie comfy space, and I believe aside from shorts and limited colors/patterns, Swoveralls has some legs within other customer segments such as: youth/infant, plus-size/maternity, and the collegiate/pro market (licensing/logos, etc).  

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

One thing I’ve heard a few entrepreneurs say recently is how “stupid” they were at the beginning based on the assumptions or risks they made.

It’s a funny statement to me because 1.) I can relate 100% (see: $10k → supplier) but 2.) It’s paradoxical in the sense that these seemingly less intelligent decisions were also instrumental to the success experienced later on.  

Very very few people can maintain the same risk aversion as their company grows, and it’s probably not the right thing to do regardless. I don’t think I’m one of these people, but I think Elon Musk is. On Day 2 of your company’s existence, “risking it all” is a completely different conversation than on Year 2.  I guess I’ve learned how the luck I’ve had is something I need to be mindful of when assessing future opportunities.

The bell curve of most products and companies is inevitable because at some point the change engine runs out of fuel.  This is something I think about often, and how I can continue being “stupid” in a smart way :)

Another thing I think about a lot is hedging my bets.  A lot of the mistakes and tough times my brand has had so far is because I wasn’t hedging appropriately.  There’s a great Ted Talk by a dude name Alex Wissner-Gross where he talks about this equation he created for intelligence.  My high level takeaway from the video is that intelligence = creating the most opportunities for yourself.  

I think I was being intelligent when I bootstrapped my company while still working full-time and getting my MBA at NYU.  This provided me with a stable income + a network of business people I could potentially leverage (and I did, bigtime).  I wasn’t being intelligent when I agreed to partner with one manufacturing company, and did not have any other discussions or existing suppliers in the works.  

When I found out the products being produced were going to cost me 40% over my budget, and end up being months late...I was trapped.  It’s probably impossible or inefficient to hedge at every step along the way, but one of the ways I’m able to protect myself is constantly meet new people, constantly “initiating dialogues”, constantly “staying in touch”, so that my safety web expands exponentially as your company grows.  

In that vein of thinking, I think it’s advantageous for entrepreneurs to keep putting themselves out there from a networking/resource standpoint.  Keep meeting people, keep reading blogs, keep taking classes.  It never stops.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

- Ecommerce: Shopify and Amazon FBA

- Data capture: Company called Privy. I was using a company called Wheelio, but switched to Privy due to integration preferences

- Email: Was MailChimp, but since their recent/upcoming breakup with Shopify, I’ve moved to a company called retention science

- Google Analytics: I don’t look at this stuff nearly enough but it’s a treasure trove of data

- DTC fulfillment: EasyPost. amazing fulfillment provider for my shopify related orders

- Social Media: Instagram is my #1 social handle, but everything I post on IG is auto-fed to FB and Twitter

- Finance: Quickbooks. Just started using this, everything was excel based before….and my company is now getting a little too big/complex for that type of manual tracking.  Quickbooks is a pain in the ass to set up initially, but it can save you so much time down the road. 

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

- Get Backed

- Traction

- All Marketers are Liars

- Tribes

I look at these more like tools than books in the sense that they’re all things you can go back and reference vs. a one-and-done novel.  

Get Backed is a must read for anyone looking to raise money, but even if you’re not looking for investors today, the act of creating an investor deck is the new business model, and can help an entrepreneur really understand what they’re doing, where they’re trying to go, and how they need to get there.  

Traction is another book that is very objective with specific channels you should be considering when it comes to growth.  It’s different for every company at every stage, and the channel that might’ve been futile 3 months ago could be a game changer today.  

All Marketers and Tribes are two awesome reads by Seth Godin - he’s a great writer and does an awesome job of explaining why storytelling and your customers are so important in a really engaging way.

Recent podcast episodes that have excited me: Andy Dunn, Blake Mykoskie, Sarah Blakely all on [How I Built This](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this).  Nick Kokonas on Tim Ferris. Matthew Walker on Joe Rogan.  

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

It’s so cliche but fail early and fail often. I didn’t get into Business school the first time I applied.  My first Kickstarter campaign didn’t reach its goal.  My second crowdfunding campaign was late being delivered to customers by 3 months.  

Entrepreneurship is not a linear path, and the more comfortable you get with a 3D rollercoaster of emotions filled with ups and downs, the more battle-tested you’ll be as the stakes and risks get bigger.

It’s similar to scar tissue - at first a cut hurts like hell, and while the wound heals and you’ll soon forget the pain...the best part is that you’re stronger now than you were before that experience.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

I’m passively looking for someone to help me from a product development position as this is a big blind spot for me.  Not only do I not really like the whole process, but it’s not something I have a ton of experience in.  

To use the blueprint/house analogy again - I want to be the real estate agent who tells the story about the house and works directly with the customers. I need someone who is really passionate and knowledgeable about materials and prototyping apparel items.  In other words, I need an architect to help me build a kick-ass place that people want to come live at :)

305,356lfx,False,,178,18 month side business (ebay/website).. Making and average of $1000 a month.. Started with $200,Entrepreneur,"I am going to tell some of my story with how i got started in hopes that i can motivate some of you that are wanting to start a small business but dont have alot of funds up front.

In Jan 2014 i started to think about starting some kind of small business that i could do at nights.  When i was in high school i used to sell flags that i would buy on line and flip them on ebay, i also used to sell Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts that i would buy from their web site and sell them on ebay for 200% returns... after looking into similar things i realized that was not going to work.  But i knew that ebay was a good testing ground for all kinds of products so that was going to be my first marketplace.  I decided on batteries as it is something disposable and yet fairly small.  I knew a guy that could get me them at wholesale price so that was a little bit of an advantage.  I bought $200 worth of batteries of different sizes.  There were places on line later that i found but i did alot of searching... deep in the interwebs.
* Note.... items that are consumables like batteries, makeup and such are good items to see because lots of people use them.. but lot of people sell them which makes it a little hard to get going.

I already had 20+ positive reviews on ebay so i knew that people would most likely trust me.  If you open a brand new account i would recommend buying some things first and getting positive feedback before you start buying... otherwise you will have a very hard time getting going.

I listed all my batteries and sold them in about 3 months.  After all fees/bills i made 40% returns.  That wasnt bad for my first test run.. I bought more batteries but this time i trimmed down on the different kinds i was buying.... lets say i was only buying AA and AAA now.....

I noticed when i had my listings up that sales would come in faster when i had sold more of the same battery... I would have 40 sets of batteries listed and when i would sell 20 the next 20 would sell much faster than the first 20... My reasoning was that people see that other people have bought it and so they are more willing to trust that listing.  So anytime my listing would get low i would buy more batteries and change my listing so my ""quantities"" would be not run out.

Now that i had figured out how to increase my sales i wanted to see how i could increase my profits.... I started looking at how to market my batteries... My listing at the time was say something like this ""24 AA Duracell Batteries""... This was doing alright but i was wanting to try something different..... I created other listings that had titles like ""Replacement Battery for Cosco LED Light""... something like that... i noticed that i could get 60% returns on my money because people would not look at the batteries that they had and look at the device that was using them........ So if you are thinking of something to sell look at other ways that you can call something that might sell better.

I had a little slump in the summer but from may to december this was what my sales were.(i am rounding here )  May :$20  June $40  July: $60 Aug:$160 Sept: $380 Oct: $620  Nov: $900  Dec: $1050....... I was adding to my ebay store new listings up until about Oct... at that point i couldnt think of anything any more and actually was sending out just enough packages that i could actually keep up with... i was sending them all out manually and typing in all the addresses... I now have stamps.com and it makes it much easier... i am thinking of getting a thermal printer so i can just peal and stick the label on.  (those numbers are only from ebay)

In this time i will say that i also branched out and started selling decals as well.  ... i think this was around the Sept time frame.....The decals i sell are very specialized so the markup on them is very high... i can make a 4x6 decal for about $0.15 and sell it for $7.  I created a website and started selling decals on the website and ebay.  I am not very good at building websites so the site could definitely use some work... that i know.  But i was able to use pinterest to get my decals out there and i am making about $100 a month or so from the site.

I have no debt in the business.. Every penny right now that i make right now i put back into inventory or equipment.  I was able to buy 2 vinyl cutters.  ( started with a cameo 12 inch and now i have a 24 inch cutter).  I was able to start up my website with my ebay profits.  ... about $300 for 3 years... i think that is correct.  and i have a good supply of batteries and vinyl for my listings and website.

THINKS I HAVE LEARNED:
-search search search for inventory and shipping supplies... you want to cut your costs as much as you can i would look for hours to find the same quality items that i use for cheaper prices. i may find boxes for a good price today from one place and do a little more searching and find boxes cheaper the next time.  Never continue to just buy from the same place if you know you can get it cheaper(and same quality) else where....... i didnt use stamps.com at the beginning because i could not justify the $15.99 a month for what i was doing.....once i started shipping out 100 + items a month, then it started to become more of a tool i needed.

-Run your numbers and know exactly how much you will make on every item.  I have spreadsheets that tell me how much i will make for an item on ebay and how much that same item will make me on my website.  Knowing your bottom line will help you to make more informed decisions.

- Know your market, search around and see what other people are doing... but dont just copy them... you have to make your listings stand out.. you have to make your listings POP... i do this with pictures that will show exactly what it will look like.

I can tell you i have made $18678.53 to date on ebay from starting 18 months ago... My website i would say i have made $5-6 hundred.

I hope this motivates some of you to try something with a little bit of money.  If nothing else get your feet wet.. if it doesnt work you dont have all that much invested.

I'm a bit of a startup marketing veteran having helped grow a number of companies from 0 to 40k mrr or taking a song to number 1 on Spotify as well as working with over 100 other companies in some capacity or another. I've been thinking recently about how much money people waste on hiring marketing agencies or ""growth hackers"" or whatever else when the reality is that at the early stage they should be doing things themselves. People somehow get convinced that what they need is PPC or SEO or Facebook or whatever else, and they chase these expensive strategies without any ideas if they work and forking over tons of money to highly paid consultants without getting really anything back. Not that these consultants suck or anything they're just used inappropriately at the wrong stages by these entrepreneurs. As I've been exploring this however I noticed there's a lack of basic understanding of practical marketing tasks. The whole thing seems to be $2000 ebooks that don't provide nearly that kind of value.

**Obligatory Proof:** https://i.gyazo.com/dd374c572ca7ed2233afea432a74f856.png

Even though I frequently work with 1m-15m/year E-commerce sites, I really enjoy the startup phase. 

There's something really exciting about **starting a new Ecommerce store so that's what I'm going to focus on today.**

Here are some of examples of the Ecommerce ranking technique I'm going to share. Sometimes doubling (even tripling) in Google traffic.

**Brand new Ecommerce Startup Proof Example #1**
https://i.gyazo.com/79d789e8310710d7683b62728abe386b.jpg

https://i.gyazo.com/d13b6264536b17a3428e5b0088e711cb.png
Another example of an ecommerce store dramatically increasing their traffic.

These techniques are unique to Ecommerce stores (so those pesky bloggers can’t use these) and provide long lasting results.

So how do you get Google to notice your store and send you massive amounts of visitors?

Let's start with the most common one (my least favorite but I want to include it because it works... heck many Reddit 'success stories' have followed this exact strategy. I believe most people should at least TRY this one first and then more on the others if it doesn't span out.)

**The Grand Slam Technique**

The Grand Slam technique involves doing something BIG to get a lot attention. It’s the explosive, “plan it for three weeks and hope it works out” approach.

Essentially, this is how you want to do it if you want to follow Google recommendation of “Create great content and people will come” and have a chance of succeeding.

The “go big” method often involves a marketing stunt with the aim of going viral or a large piece of content. You invest several weeks and create something that you believe will capture the world’s attention using your product.

**For example:**

Your Ecommerce store sells tape. To demonstrate the strength of your tape, you decide to [shoot a video in which you lift a car with your product.](https://i.gyazo.com/8b5e88831bec1a0b5eb503a6850652de.png)

You spend weeks putting it together, coordinating a crane to lift the car, a camera crew and a boatload of tape.

Does the video go viral? ? Well, maybe! But then again, maybe not.

Statistically… it doesn’t. *Most* things don’t go viral. There are just too many other cool things happening in the world.

However, you only need one hit to make it. (DollarShaveClub anyone?) 

That’s why I prefer the:

**Perfect Perk Technique**

This technique works SO WELL that Google has recently decided that you probably shouldn’t do it because it will give you an unfair advantage over the competition.

There is a weakness in their algorithm and, as you’ll soon see… it’s practically impossible for them to stop it.

It isn’t as sexy as directing your own mini-commercial but it does deliver massive amounts of Google traffic. Plus, if you want to be a director, you can do that with the profits from this approach.

Even if you know nothing about search engine optimization and you’re in a competitive industry, this is for you.

Instead of relying on what other people think of our blog post or video, we’re going to give Google exactly what it wants… and in turn, it will give us exactly what we want: traffic.

The first step is convincing Google that you have the best store in your industry. So when someone asks Google, “Where do I get this widget?”

https://i.gyazo.com/681f0983a02f861278406f866d807b93.png

Google answers, “Right here, at your store!”

**So what are the main things that Google looks for?**

*Good product listings.
*A ton of people talking about your products.

*Convince Google that you have these two elements and you’re golden.*

However before I get to the sexy stuff (getting people to talk about your product using the Perfect Perk technique), I feel I’d be doing you a disservice if I didn’t at LEAST mention what makes a good product listing. Without this, everything else you do is useless.

**So what makes a good product listing?**

I want to tell you a little secret that will make a lot of ecommerce gurus cringe:

You don’t need to do that much for product listings in order to rank on Google.
In fact, as long as you convey the right signals, you’ll rank just fine.

Why?

Because, all you need is a slightly better product listing than your competition.
And the truth is, most ecommerce stores have no idea what they are doing!

They use the same stock photography that their supplier sent them, they copy paste the 75 word description from the wholesale catalog and then call it a day!

In the restaurant industry, that’s the equivalent of reheating frozen food in the microwave! It just won’t cut it.

**So what DOES Google want?**

At a bare minimum, it wants an original picture of your product and an original description.

This can be as quick as taking a snapshot of the image with your IPhone and writing the basics about the item you’re trying to sell.

* Main feature
* Specifications?
* What is it made of?
* How do you use it?
* What kind of warranty does it have?

Preemptively answering the questions that your customer might have about your product will help you rank higher on Google and help you sell more.

If you want to get fancy, have 5-6 pictures of your product taken by a professional photographer.

**Here are 3 examples of great product listing:**

I annotated the product listing examples to highlight the elements that contribute to great rankings for each website.

**Great Product Listing Example #1:**
https://i.gyazo.com/8b2b34fe57f97309cd8782668acd8db0.jpg
Boom By Cindy Joseph

They combines all the proper SEO elements with all the best conversion elements. There is a massive amount of social proof on the page which increases conversions.

*Here are the highlights:*

* Multiple original images taken by a professional photographer.
* Multiple original videos (they also count as unique content)
* Original description in the form of benefits
* Huge amount of reviews. Reviews count as content!

**Great Product Listing Example #2:**
Safety Tape By Creative Safety Supply
https://i.gyazo.com/b689d7900fb7e043a088a32c7abcb321.jpg

They produce extremely useful product pages, including many visual elements and additional resources that are useful to the user.

*Some of the highlights:*

*Massive amount of original, professional images
*Breadcrumb navigation (This helps the click-through-rate of your Google search result listing by adding categories in the results)
* Extensive original description
* Multiple reviews (not shown in the picture)
* Related resources and guides

**Great Product Listing Example #3:**
Levi Jeans by Amazon
https://i.gyazo.com/530b820e0b17ce9ea6983663486e011c.jpg

Why does Amazon rank for nearly everything? Three reasons: Content, content and more content. (And 2.5B backlinks doesn’t hurt either)

*Some of the highlights:*

* Multiple original images
* Extensive related amount of products, images and information
* Reviews. Over 5000 reviews creates a massive amount of original content that cannot be found anywhere else.

To Google, pictures count as content.

If you take 2 pages and everything else is equal… and one with more content wins every time.

*If you want other people to complete your content, then allow reviews to be posted on the site and let your customers ask & answer questions. This will count towards your original content! This is one of the main reasons Amazon does so well in the search results.*

And now… the fun part.

**How To Get Links To An Ecommerce Store**

How does an Ecommerce store get backlinks when:

* The competition refuses to link to you
* Related industry sites are too busy writing about the manufacturers instead of linking to the store selling the product!
* No one really knows you.

You could take the first approach which is to build something and hope it goes viral… however I prefer to exploit the weaknesses in Google’s algorithm by manufacturing real, high quality links on related industry sites.

This method produces BETTER results anyway.

However, before I share this method with you, it’s important that you understand one important element about traffic.

**The Misconception That Holds Most People Back**

The biggest misconception that people have about organic Google traffic is that it’s “free” and therefore all link-building efforts must also be free.

Instead, you will need a small investment. As soon as you adopt the mentality that you’ll invest X into link building with the objective of making Y, you’ll be on your way to success.

If you invest $100 into link building and you make $200 profit, you win.

If you invest $500 and make $5000 profit? You win even more.

One mistake many new Ecommerce owners make is competing for #1 rankings with a budget of $0 while their competitors are spending $500.

*My last SEO test project cost $4361 and has generated (at the time of writing) over $47941.30 in profits.*

**It’s all about getting a positive return on investment.**

When you adopt the mentality that Time = Money and that Money = Traffic, you can make much better decisions with your investments.

This will change your focus from the “cheapest” option (which won’t work) to the “best value” option… which will provide you with the highest return on investment.

The first, and often most cost efficient way of acquiring new links when launching a new Ecommerce store is… drum roll the good'old fashioned PRESS RELEASE.

Before you jump off the page thinking: “Oh I’ve heard this one before, I tried a press release and it didn’t do anything“, remember our new mentality:

We don’t want cheap, we want good value.

**Here’s what you should avoid:**
https://i.gyazo.com/fa3cf3ec0350e948f157746453cf876f.png

Instead of getting a $60 press release that promises to get you good rankings and “into 10000 news agencies” and “into Google news”, spring for a professional press release that will get you in front of real journalists that will write articles about you.

And quite frankly, those cost more..

Do you think journalists are reading all the crap-o-la that comes from the $60 press release services?

Journalists are looking for real stories… about real businesses. Those stories tend to be mentioned on larger news sites such as PRNewswire, MarketWired and BusinessWire.

So, submit your high-quality releases to these sites.

**When you submit your first press release about your Ecommerce store, you want to go in with a purpose:**

How does your store differentiate itself? Why do you exist? Why are you better than the competition?!

*If you want your press release to succeed two things must happen. You must write a good headline and get it in front of the right journalists. Use a premium press release services to get your headline it in front of the right journalists.*

If you’re ever going to have a sale or a promo, now is the time. I don’t have time to cover the do’s and don’ts of a successful press release (that’s for another article) but if you’re ever in a pickle, you can hire a marketing expert to find an interesting angle for you.

Just remember, when you write the press release, you aren’t writing it for customers, but for journalists.

One single press release CAN land you thousands of high quality links that can power your site for years to come which makes it the best investment a new Ecommerce store can make.

Traffic from a well crafted press release:
https://i.gyazo.com/06458c77123617faefb05ada03ea45d6.png

A good press release got into the hands of a few journalists, sending thousands of visitors to my client’s ecommerce store and generating dozens of DA30+ links on industry related sites.

*Don’t use a keyword for your anchor text when creating a press release. Use your brand name or a generic URL. This improves the chances of your press release being taken seriously by journalists and prevent potential over-optimization penalties.*

The truth is, Google doesn’t want you to exploit this weakness in their algorithm. 
[(They tried)](http://searchengineland.com/google-links-in-a-press-release-should-be-nofollowed-like-advertisements-168339)

Good press releases will provide massive SEO benefits and there is little they can do about it.

**Hypothetical situation:**
- $495 press release
- 5 hours of work x $20 = $100

$595 for potentially thousands of journalist seeing (and writing) about your store.

**Worst case scenario:** You get featured on the standard boilerplate sites which will give you some backlink juice and get Google traffic flowing.

**Best-case scenario:** A journalist picks up your story, writes a real article about you on a major site which immediately drives traffic, sales and skyrockets your Google rankings in one shot.

Some multi-million dollar businesses, such as the http://www.headblade.com, have been made on the back of a SINGLE news article. https://i.gyazo.com/faa1a0120b1030550c279d7f63f3dd8e.png

When that happens, many smaller websites “borrow” the story and rewrite it as their own, further accumulating natural links for your website.

**An unlimited source of recommendations about your product and store**

Every industry has two main categories of websites:

1. The sellers. (This is the Ecommerce stores, the suppliers and manufacturers.)
    
2. The reviewers/enthusiasts/news (the influencers). These are the large blogs and large authority sites that write on a daily basis about the industry. They typically carry a lot of weight.

It’s your job, as a seller, to get all the influencers to recommend you.

When Google detects that many influencers are linking to you, your store climbs up the Google ranks and generate massive amounts of traffic (and sales).

Here’s why this is a weakness in Google’s algorithm:

Google doesn’t know if the influencers are linking to you because you’re a friend, because they think you have a good product or because you met them at a conference and promised them a perk.

In other words, as long as the influencers aren’t advertising: “Give me stuff and I’ll link to you!“, no one knows why an influencer links to anything!

… and getting influencers to write about us is EXACTLY what we’re going to exploit.

However, here’s where most people get it wrong.

Most sellers approach influencers with the “ME ME ME” mentality. In other words, they are only thinking of what they want instead of what the influencer wants.

The typical email that will get you nowhere as a seller is:

*“Hey, I just launched this store, we have amazing products and I thought you’d want to let your audience know about us.”*

NO, NO, AND NO

Remember when I said that you have to think of Google traffic as an investment and that the focus is getting the best return on investment?

Well, that translates to figuring out what the influencer wants.

For instance, most influencers will gladly accept money.

Even though the official Google rule is to add “nofollow” to the links, this is rarely enforced by the bloggers.

*The sites you want to avoid are sites that are dedicated to ONLY posting sponsored posts. Those sites typically serve low quality content. The best sites are the ones with an active community and visitors. An easy tell is to check to see if there are any comments on the articles. Good sites tend to have comments on each article.*

Influencers make their living from this kind of stuff so they are always on the lookout for good opportunities.

Focus on the influencer’s needs and start the conversation with: “Hey, I just launched this store and was wondering how much it would cost to have you mention my store in your next article” will get you a much higher success rate.

From there, I recommend looking up the site metrics & traffic (how powerful it is) and then you can easily calculate the cost to see if it’s worth it:

* 1 mention from influencer #1 with a DA58 website (2300 daily visitors) = $200
* 1 mention from influencer #2 with a DA34 website (750 daily visitors) = $250
* 1 mention from influencer #3 with a DA64 website (3300 daily visitors) =$750

Ummm, influencer #3 seems overpriced and influencer #1 is providing some good value for the money!

Quick, simple, repeatable.

And if it’s not worth it, negotiate!

*You can typically negotiate at least 50% off whatever price they initially throw at you. The best negotiation tactic is to present quotes from competitive influencers. This will help you get the absolute best price for your post.*

**Here is an actual conversation I had with an influencer:**
https://i.gyazo.com/227b2234165b340414342d06eb39ebfb.png

Once you have more experience, you’ll be able to guesstimate the amount of traffic / ranking boost that such a website can provide over the course of a year.

**The Math:**

That $200 link from a DA58 website might result in an extra 14000 visitors over the course of a year. At a 2% conversion, that’s 280 extra sales. And at an average of $34 profit on each sale, that’s $9520 in profit. Not bad for a $200 link.

You might be looking at this thinking: “Damn, how do I know what kind of profit I’ll generate from a link?!”

Well, the truth is, you don’t. However as you gain experience in your industry and you’ll be able estimate the traffic a bit better. In my experience, even bad estimates are better than no estimates at all.

This is how you start building a solid foundation of influencers linking to your Ecommerce store.

However… I saved the best for last.

Remember that example where the influencer requested $750?

Well, imagine you could get the same result for a fraction of the price?

Typically, sponsored posts and advertorials tend to be pricey. They might still be worth it but there’s a way to get influencers to respond for much cheaper. (Providing you with a higher ROI).

** Nearly every influencer in your industry will be interested in your products . **

The best part is that YOU pay wholesale for your products but the perceived value is much higher.

Influencers love products (that’s why they got into their industry in the first place) and they need products to review.

In fact, nearly every influencer has a section dedicated to reviews on their website.

So while a high-profile influencer might charge an exorbitant amount of money for a sponsored story about your Ecommerce store, he or she will gladly accept to review your product if you just send it over to them. This works so well that Google is freaking out, trying to figure out how to reduce the amount of influencers receiving free products and not disclosing it.

The weakness that we’re exploiting is the following: Unless the influencer states that the product was sent to them or they openly advertise that they’ll give you a link if you send them a product, Google doesn’t know how the product got to the influencer. The only way for Google to stop this is to manually check sites openly admitting they are receive sponsored products in exchange for coverage.

**The Perfect Perk**

For instance, I ran into a fashion blogger who wanted $750 for a sponsored post. But but after a bit of talking, we concluded that she would write a post about the Ecommerce store in exchange for a leather handbag valued at $350.

We’re a store! We don’t pay full price for our items… we only SELL our products at full price.

That handbag had a wholesale price of $120.

Which means…

We get to be featured on a giant industry site for $120 instead of the standard $750.

Now we’re talking!

**Here's how it went down:**

- Wholesale handbag cost = $120
- Shipping = $15
- Time 1 hour = $15

Total cost: $150 for a DA64 link on a related industry site.

It gets EVEN better.

The review is all about our product. That means that if out of the thousands of readers who read it, a single person buys because of the recommendation, we’ve already made our money back.

Essentially… the link costs us absolutely nothing and we get to benefit from increase in Google traffic for years to come.

**Here's what happened:**

- Profit made from sales from the article = $300 (We sold 2 at $150 profit each)
- Yearly increase in traffic (0.5%) = Approximately 1000 extra visitors
- Additional sales from extra traffic (2% conversion) = 20 sales
- Average profit from each sale ($56) = $1120

$1120 long term profit + $300 immediate profit – $150 investment = $1270

Which means that we’ve made $1270 in profit from our $150 handbag investment.

And that’s how you grow your traffic on a brand new Ecommerce store… making money as you move forward.

The best part?

When major influencers start featuring your store and products, OTHER influencers will follow. Soon you’ll have influencers contacting YOU, requesting samples, practically begging to write about you.

From there, just rinse and repeat as long as you want and watch your traffic (and sales) grow. 

Cheers Reddit!

522,4ivuhb,False,,165,The Top 12 Wantrepreneur Bullshit Excuses and How to Finally Get Past Them (Plus the Last Startup Book You'll Ever Need!),Entrepreneur,"So some of you guys know me from around here from my big case studies like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/2h1mlt/the_inner_workings_of_a_subscription_box_company/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3r8hzo/so_were_now_over_2_million_per_year_in_combined/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/3r8fk9/so_were_now_over_2_million_per_year_with_local/) (and they are more) where I peel back the layers on how we start and grow businesses.

Since my case studies I get a lot of folks from reddit contacting me for advise and such.  Cool beans I help out where I can. Almost daily.  But from those messages I've kinda figured out a few things about the folks that reach out to me. Here goes:

----
This is my message to the aspiring entrepreneur in you. 

You’ve been wanting to become an entrepreneur for the longest. You’re fascinated with the startup world, and you’ve read all you can about scalability, minimal viable product, customer acquisition...blah blah blah, you know all the buzzwords I’m talking about. This is the life you want, and you’re going after it. 

I mean look:

* You’re in a gazillion Facebook business groups.  
* You’ve bought damn near every Udemy course known to man.  
* You’ve read every high profile startup book ever released...TWICE  
* You read Techcrunch, r/entrepreneur, Hacker News , r/startups  
* You’re on Neil Patel’s email list, and SumoMe, and ___  
* You watch Mixergy religiously for business ideas (I enjoy this too)  
* Your Facebook timeline is a stream of shared Gary V videos…  
* Your calendar has more webinars on it than real-life meetings with people  

You’re in the mix baby!

Yet with all of this content consumption, you haven't figured out how to launch a thing...and my guess, is that this is partially BECAUSE of all of this content consumption. 

None of this matters until you actually get out there and put something up for sale! 

**BUT QUITE A FEW OF YOU PLAY THESE MENTAL GAMES**

1.“I WANT TO START BUT I HAVE A FEW MORE THINGS TO SOLVE”

What many of you have done to date is research everything before you start, get overwhelmed and never start. How do you handle credit cards? What if your workers break something? How to handle lost products? All questions that are important in running a business but you have to work in a systematic way or you’ll get overwhelmed. How we build businesses? We take action. Day one, solve a problem. Day two, solve a problem. By Day 30 we should have gotten our first paying customer. If you try to pre-solve everything you'll never get started

**2.“BUT I HAVE NOTHING TO SELL”**

Check your bank account for something you’ve spent money on in the last 12 months.  AND GO SELL THAT!  Bonus points if it’s a recurring service of some sort (Your customer lifetime value is instantly boosted, and you can thrive even with a high customer acquisition cost). Either way, you know it’s something that people already spend money on. This simple rule eliminates fantasy ideas: “If I get enough members I’ll figure out how to monetize it later.” Later never comes, so ideas like these don’t get a minute of my time. 

**3.“I’M TRYING TO RAISE CAPITAL!”**

Look man, there are a gazillion businesses you can start with LESS than a month’s salary. There’s no reason to delay life waiting for some savior to drop a million dollars in your lap. Right now, to start a business, you need a well designed website (wordpress themes are solid) and something to sell. If you’re selling a product, you’ll then have to find someone that will let you re-sell his or her product. If it’s a service, you simply have to find someone that already provides that service and set up an arrangement with them. There is no magic involved and no reason to sit on the sidelines forever.

**4.“BUT WHAT ABOUT SCALABILITY?”**

This, along with the need to raise capital, is the two stories that startup types like to tell the most. I’m running a multi-million dollar company in one tiny city and have zero intentions to scale. Scalability isn’t the end-all be-all to any of this. Go out and get good at selling things, and leave the startup buzzword stuff for investors that have to worry about that stuff. This is about taking action and building something!

**5.“I DON’T HAVE THE TIME RIGHT THIS SECOND, BUT…”**

If I had a penny for every message I got from people telling me about the wonderful business they plan to launch ""next summer"" or ""when classes are over"" or ""when I move to "", or ""when my wife blah blah blah..."" or insert a gazillion other reasons, I'd have a duffel bag of pennies! I've learned that the fastest way for me to wrap up conversations like that is to say ""Hit me up when you start!"" I don't think I've heard from a single one of those people again. As far as I'm concerned if it ain't now, it ain't happening. And now, you have time. There is always time, you just have to give up some of the dumb shit you waste your time on right now.

**6.“BUT I NEED TO VALIDATE!”**

Validation in my opinion is for fantasy ideas. If you stay away from having to come up with an awesome idea, you won’t need validation in the first place. There are plenty of things you can do that other companies have already validated for you. And when you find that thing, stop worrying about competition. Competition IS the validation.

**7.“The MARKET IS SATURATED”**

This is meaningless, yet this single phrase has stopped more potential entrepreneurs in their tracks than…well I honestly can’t think of anything that beats this. Start looking at the quality of the competition instead, and you’ll often find that the market is saturated with a LOT of bad players, and they’re making a LOT of money despite being so bad. This is the perfect situation.  My take: The market is NEVER saturated!

**8.“OKAY COOL LET ME GET STARTED ON MY BUSINESS PLAN”**

This often ends up being a way to push action further down the road. If It’s longer than one page you’re wasting your time. [Download something like this](http://100startup.com/resources/business-plan.pdf), fill that bad boy out, and get to work.

**9.“LLC/CORP/WHAT STATE TO FILE IN”**

Unless the company can make enough money to pay for it, for me it’s not happening. So this only happens AFTER the company is making money. Don't take this as advice though, take it as how I do it. I go from zero to first revenue in 30 days. By day 30 if there is no revenue, there is no business, and I move on.  None of that ""I've been working on this project for 3 years with no revenue"" b.s I see. By day 30 if there is revenue I then have a business and I can spend the $350 on LLC/INC on smallbiz. Just take it as how I do it. One more excuse and stalling tactic...GONE!

**10.“OKAY BUT I NEED TO RESEARCH”**

Demographic data, market analysis, the economic outlook... blah blah blah. More ways to kick the can down the road and to feel that you’re doing something when you’re really not. I just get to work. If a lot of people are making money doing this thing, the startup cost is low, and there is no sorcery involved, it can be done!

**11.“BUT SHOULDN’T I FIND SOMETHING TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT?”**

Nah son. Find something that is viable. I’m passionate about table tennis, but I’m not looking to turn that passion into a business. When it comes to business, I’m far more passionate about providing a good product/service that has good margins, than about being able to marry that business to any hobby or other exciting pursuit I may have in my regular life. This way, I’m free to work on the best opportunity that arises without limitation. And honestly, quite often the least sexy industries are where the big money is being made. So while most of the brainpower is busy chasing sexy mobile apps and such, you can make bank by selling ugly widgets or providing basic services. It’s tough to pay bills with app downloads.

**12.“I DO PLAN TO LAUNCH BUT I WANT TO GET THE TECH RIGHT”**

Resist the urge to complicate things. For technical folks, it seems like the inclination to complicate things is overwhelming. So a problem like “find people that need lawn service and connect them with people that provide lawn service” becomes, “well how about we use Zillow’s APi to pull a picture of the lawn, and the customer confirms it by drawing an outline of the area to be serviced and we tie that into Google maps and feed everything into a pricing algorithm”.... and on and on. Unfortunately, many of these guys do not make it. More often than not simplicity wins. Get out of the customer’s way.  I was doing $60K per month on google calendar and spreadsheets.

**13.“OKAY SO WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?”**

Stop soaking up content for content sake. It gives you the illusion that you’re actually doing something when you’re not. Trust me, I’ve been there. Instead look at business content like you would a cooking recipe. **If you want to cook a steak, do you spend 5 days reading all you can about Gordon Ramsey’s life story? 
**
No. 

You look up “how to cook a perfect steak” on youtube (Gordon Ramsey has an awesome video tutorial btw), bring your laptop to the kitchen and get to work (medium please). 

And that’s the takeaway from all of this. 

Not that reading is bad, or that gathering information is bad. But that if your end result is a thriving business, at some point you have to kill the webinars, blogs, courses, etc. and look for actionable content WHILE you are cooking up that steak. While you’re actually building your business!

Cool beans. Seriously, put this shit down, and everything else, and get to work!

568,dbaxsw,False,Best Practices,107,STUDY: Precise numbers make you more money,Entrepreneur,"""Sticker shock"" is real.

You, me, and everyone who has ever bought something expensive will experience it at some point[.](https://imgur.com/a/ntEzrW6)

It's that moment of pause when the price is higher than you expected...

And it makes pitching high-ticket offers very tricky.

I'm a huge fan of high-ticket offers. More often than not [you should be raising your prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/d936xz/dear_entrepreneurs_you_need_to_charge_more_money/), not dropping them.

But one of the big problems it creates is sticker shock.

Because of that, you should do EVERYTHING in your power to reduce that feeling.

There are plenty of ways to overcome sticker shock. One interesting tactic (backed by science) is to lower the *perceived* price of your offer...

You can do this by using precise numbers when quoting clients.

Researchers at Cornell University [studied](http://webspace.pugetsound.edu/facultypages/gmilam/courses/econ291/readings/ssrn-id1011232.pdf) more than 27,000 real estate transactions across two markets.

They found that buyers pay more on average when a listing has a precise number ($397,425) compared to a round number ($395,000).

Many [other studies](http://web.missouri.edu/~segerti/capstone/anchorprecision.pdf) have confirmed this effect.

A lot of people assume this works because a precise number appears carefully chosen. And carefully chosen prices indicate the seller is less willing to negotiate, resulting in the buyer paying a high price.

But this is not the case. The Cornell researchers ruled out that in further experiments.

What they discovered was that a precise number increases the ""willingness to buy"" because people *perceived the price to be lower*.

Think about it...

When do you use precise numbers? When the numbers are small (e.g. $4, $7, $8).

And when do you use round numbers? When the numbers are large (e.g. $400, $7,000, $80,000).

So when your brain sees a large but precise number there is an inbuilt bias to perceive it as smaller than it actually is.

Since we perceive precise numbers to be lower than round numbers pitching something as $5,124 instead of $5,000 hacks the brain.

The price seems lower (but in fact it's actually a bit higher out of the two) thus making it easier to sell.

And you're earning an extra $124 on top as a bonus!

**Key Takeaway:** Use precise numbers in your high-ticket offers instead of round numbers. Clients perceive the price to be lower, it increases the willingness to buy, and can earn you more money. All at the same time.

302,edel3v,False,,90,"Two years ago, I solo-founded a company that's made a total 8,000 € in revenue. This year, I co-founded another that passed 100,000 € in a single month of business. Next year, I'm building a company to pass 10,000,000 € ! Just wanted to share :)",Entrepreneur,"Hello !

This year's wrapping up and I feel thrilled yet soothed.

In September last year, after getting a few sales from my website in late 2017 and up till then, I quit my consultant job to go full time.

I worked a lot from September to December. The company sells gift vouchers for restaurants in Paris. Traction was very low, I had a few sales but waaaay not enough to live on. Total sales for December 2017 were 750 €, and 1620 € for the whole year 2018.

I had trouble getting traffic on my site. SEO wasn't good, ads cost too much money, I was bad at press. My margin was low, so I was making much less than what I was spending on marketing and administrative fees.

After that difficult period, I took a good hard look at my project. I saw that one page I had built for SEO had brought some traffic. I reworked my site for SEO a little bit, and published an article that I *really* optimized for SEO. This had little to no effect.

On top of the difficulties, I was realizing that I wanted to use my professional ability to do something good for society, not just something that worked economically. I started looking for other ventures using my tech background to position myself as a CTO, something that's in high demand.

I met a guy that wanted to build a non-profit company to make gift cards that would be dedicated to the social economy and green economy. Think second hand, upcycling, companies that hire handicapped or desocialized people, etc... I had the perfect skillset for what he wanted, and we co-founded the company together with the big names of the social and green economy in our country.

We launched our B2B offering in September, and B2C offering in November, right in time for Christmas. We've had great reception, a lot of press, and the traffic has been flowing in continuously. Today we passed 100,000 € in sales !

It's been a wild ride for me as a CTO who's not formally trained as a developer, but everything has held up very well, and performance is good ! Our 4-man company is doing great.

Now however, my CTO role is less useful. I've completed most of the key features, and there's only going to be a few extra things to do before next christmas.

In the meantime... my SEO efforts for the first company slowly improved it's ranking in key search queries. To my surprise, my site started making more than 1 sale per day while approaching christmas. I've reached over 6,000 € in sales, already 5 times what we made last year. I say ""we""... because I found a younger entrepreneur willing to take over the company, and have been working with her to help her take charge.

And now I want to tackle a new, bigger problem : e-commerce waste. The cardboard and plastics you get sent as a bonus with any package you buy. I've been working for the past 3 months with my future parner and we're setting up our company in january next year. Multiple B2B clients are begging for a solution, this is going to be fun.

So, here we go again !

Here are my takeaways :

* You can build a company on your own, but it might affect your motivation, and most importantly your ability to execute a lot in a short amount of time. I don't think I'll start a company solo again, unless it's a really small saas product or something.

* Having real skills allows you to make money on the side, freelancing to fund your entrepreneurial ventures, and it also makes you much more desirable to potential partners. I feel much more confident in my worth as a partner now that I know I can deliver on decently sized e-commerce sites, and I also feel much more confident that if a company I'm working on fails, I'll be able to easily get some freelance developer work for quick cash.

* ""Will my idea work"" is not a very useful question. A good question is ""are there people proactively looking for my product now who can't find it and will be happy to pay for it once I put it up there ?"". Seriously, building a company where there's no organic demand is tough if you don't have a massive marketing budget, and even then. Another good question is ""Am I actually willing to work on this idea every day for the next 3 years"".

664,bl00hq,False,,178,The real cost of running payroll and why you need to be aware that what you think you're paying your employees might not be accurate at all,Entrepreneur,"How much does it cost to pay a wage to an employee?

It depends on the industry but I’ll give you an idea based on my own experience in the moving and storage business.

We pay our laborers $15 per hour in most cases. We’re in a 33% workers compensation bracket in one of our states. We pay 7.75% FICA. 2% disability and 2% unemployment (after a few claims per year).

**That is an extra 44.75% on top of the hourly wage** for a total of $6.71 extra per hour per employee. That turns the $15 wage into a $21.71 liability. And whats more the employee’s $15 per hour turns into only $13.84 after FICA and about $10.50 after taxes are withheld.

**So on a $15 per hour wage our cost is $21.71 per hour and the employee only sees $10.50 in his bank account.** This doesn't take into account any of the software and admin costs to file and handle all of the necessary reporting. Or the background check. Or the drug test. Or the 10 hours of paid training.

For an employee that works for us 4 weeks and then quits (common for a laborer) our costs come out near $30 per hour per employee. 2X the offering wage and nearly 3X the take home pay.

Make sure you are aware and you budget and price your jobs accordingly.

It’s tempting to pay your employees cash or treat them as independent contractors and just send them a 1099. This isn’t the right way to do business. We have no control over this so there is no sense in complaining. Look at it as the cost of doing business and operating in such a stable political and economic environment. **Price it into your services and follow the rules so you can grow a healthy scalable company.**

But WHAT REALLY GETS ME is when my competitor down the street is paying his laborers under the table. Skirting these rules makes it tough on everyone and isn't punished harshly enough. DON'T DO IT.

皮肤被治具强迫褪去
The jig forces the skin to peel

顺手镀上一层铝合金
And while it's at it, plates on a layer of aluminum alloy

有人还在坚持着，有人含病离去
Some still endure, while others are taken by illness

我在他们中间打盹，留守青春的
I am dozing between them, guarding

最后一块墓地
The last graveyard of our youth.

862,5myn1k,False,,49,How to quickly tell if you're targeting the right Facebook audience,Entrepreneur,"#The $10 Audience Test

You don't need to spend a fortune to see whether you have a successful Facebook audience. 

In fact, it's possible to make an educated guess after spending around $10. In this post we outline how to run that test. 

#Create your ad

The first thing you're going to do is, of course, setup your campaign. 

At this point you'll need to define what success looks like for your business. We tend to stick with conversions of some sort. 

An example of how this works: let's say you're selling an ebook for $20. You need to make a profit of $10. Therefore you can afford to spend $10 per conversion. Any audience that gets you a cost per conversion under $10 would be successful. This is a very simple example, but you get the point.

For this test to work, you should use one ad creative in your ad set. If you include more than that, then you need to raise the budget.

One note: I recommend using automatic bidding at this stage. With bigger budgets, and once you have a sense of your cost per conversion, manual bidding may help you control costs. 

And of course — set your campaign budget to $10.

#Results you need

There are a few data points you're aiming to get out of this test. 

**Audience Size Between 50,00-250,000**

This is narrow enough to be distinct, broad enough to get delivery and ideally not very expensive to reach.

**1,000 Impressions**

You need at least 1,000 impressions to get enough data. If your cost to get 1,000 impressions (CPM) is above $10, then your audience is probably too expensive (unless you have a high customer lifetime value / high conversion rate). By getting 1,000 impressions, you’ll have a good sense of click through rate and cost per conversion.

**An Important Caveat**

We’ve found leaving ads up to 2-3 days can improve performance and findings. We recommend this if your results are okay, but not outstanding. Sometimes they improve with more time.

If you get no results, then you know it’s time to stop it.

#Analzying your results

To understand if you’re reaching the right audience, you need to analyze your campaign data.

The following section analyzes each data point that indicates whether a campaign is performing well or poorly.

**Cost Per Conversion**

This is the key action people take on your website. It could be link clicks, email sign-ups, purchases. You take the total cost divided by the total number of conversions.

This is a no brainer. Low conversion costs mean this audience is working!

**Click-Through Rate (CTR)**

Click through rate is the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions, expressed as a percentage. This tells you if people are clicking through to your landing page.

For example, if your ad got 10 link clicks, and reached 1,000 people, your CTR would be 1% .

If your CTR is under .5% it means your audience isn’t interested. Anything above 1.5% usually means your audience is interested.

**Cost Per Click (CPC)**

This is the total campaign cost divided by the number of link clicks. This tells you the average cost per website visitor.

High cost per link click is a leading indicator. It indicates future problems for a campaign. Let’s assume your landing page converts 10% of your audience. If it costs you $2 to send someone to you site, only the 10th person will convert. That means each conversion will be $20.

**Relevancy Score**

Relevancy score is a calculation by Facebook about the relevancy of your ad to that audience. It’s built by taking signals from ad performance (clicks, cost, engagements), and is turned into a score.

A relevance score under 6 means people aren’t interested in your ad.

In fact, it’s worse than that. Facebook penalizes ads with low relevancy score, driving up your advertising costs. A higher relevance score means lower advertising costs because the audience likes your ads.

**Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM)**

This is a standard unit of measure for advertisements. It measures the cost of serving 1,000 ad impressions to that audience.

High CPM is sometimes an indicator that you’re targeting the wrong audience. It could be a competitive audience, high placement costs… The list goes on. If CPM is high, and people aren’t purchasing your product, you’ve got a problem and should change your audience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5myn1k/how_to_quickly_tell_if_youre_targeting_the_right/,428,[deleted] ,2017-01-09 16:33:47
962,6q9l51,False,How to Grow,68,How A Game Taught Me To Correctly Price a Product,Entrepreneur,"A couple months ago, I released an iPhone app called [Cone](https://coneapp.io). Having no experience with paid applications, I got very confused with how to put a price tag on it. 

It's been 3 months since I released the app and here's a small write-up on what I learned about pricing and how a game pointed me in the right direction: https://medium.com/@kush.ag/how-a-game-taught-me-to-correctly-price-a-product-8590b5929da1

Would love to hear your thoughts.

----
Edit: included the original post here

------

There’s no golden formula when it comes to calculating the perfect price for
your new product. A lot of times I have seen people pricing their products based
on what they think is right, rather than finding out how their users value that
product.

When I was in school, one of my friends introduced me to a tycoon game called
*Lemonade Tycoon* and I spent hours playing it, everyday. I enjoyed it so much
that I started looking for more tycoon games. Tycoon games were fun and they
taught me how the real world works. How a business works. And how it’s not
always a sweet ride.

Soon I came across *Roller Coaster Tycoon*, a game by Atari. Most of you must’ve
already heard about it or played it. If not, it’s a game where you’re given a
piece of land and your goal is to convert it into an amusement park earning as
much profit as possible.

[Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*b1F58F0KUdObxoMELzTDRw.jpeg): A screenshot from Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. I still fire it up occasionally.

I wouldn’t dive much into the details of the game, but if you haven’t played it,
then you need to know that a park can offer two kinds of pricing:

1.  **Pay per ride**: The entry to the park is free but guests need to pay for each
ride.
1.  **Pay per entry**: You charge an entry fee but the guests can go to any number
of rides for free.

I preferred to play with the former model. It was more fun to experiment with
the pricing of individual rides and observe the guests’ reactions.

After spending hours on this game, I observed that no matter how experienced I
got, I just couldn’t guess the right price for a ride. I always ended up
increasing or reducing the price to allow me to have a balanced profit + guests
influx.

### What does this have to do with the real world?

A couple months back, I made an app, “[Cone](https://coneapp.io/)”, which lets
you pick colors from around you using your iPhone’s camera. Cone, being my first
native iOS app, took me about two month to finish. The initial version had a
good balance of usability, functionality and delight (some people ignore delight
in their MVPs but I believe it’s as important as the other two).

Now, I hadn’t made any paid products in the past so I didn’t have any idea on
how to price Cone. There were a number of ways—make it free with ads, make it
free with in-app purchases, or make it paid with a flat price.

I don’t really like when apps show me ads pasted all over their interface, so
this option was instantly crossed out. I briefly considered the second option,
add in-app purchases, but having recently finished with the development I didn’t
want to learn yet another complex thing so I ignored this as well.

Finally, I decided to price it at **$0.99 **without much thought and hit submit.
Before submitting it to the App Store, I hadn’t asked anyone about how much
they’d pay for it. As a result, I didn’t have any idea if I’d priced it too low
or if people would actually pay for it.

### Lessons I learned and the impact of RCT on pricing

Cone got hunted on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cone-2) a
day after I had launched it. It was purchased about 200 times and I couldn’t
contain my excitement. I was so happy to see that people were actually finding
it useful and paying for it.

Then, a couple weeks later, I decided to submit it to [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14254357) and the response I got was
overwhelming. Again, I received great feedback and about 500 sales from it. But
this time, I noticed a pattern which reminded me of Roller Coaster Tycoon.
People found Cone extremely useful and I saw comments like “*This is really good
value!*”, “*It’s really cheap for what it does*”, “*I would’ve easily paid 3x–5x
of what you’re charging*”.

There are 3 guests’ reactions you normally see in RCT for a ride w.r.t. pricing.

#### 1. [Ride] is really good value

[Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nQJawTjGU05ppqOxBs7OKA.jpeg): Reactions when I set the entry of the ride to **$2.00**

This is where you know that the price you’ve set is too low. You can increase
the price and the guests will still keep paying for it.

#### 2. [Ride] was great

[Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lbHZY6OZqDXhawAbi0Lf4A.jpeg):
Reactions when I set the entry of the ride to **$8.00**

This is a sweet spot (value = money). You can still experiment with the fee and
increase it a bit to see if any guests are running away or not.

#### 3. I’m not paying that much to go on [ride]

[Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9vEXNxZ0fmJLoLoLvAlKmg.jpeg): Reactions when I set the entry of the ride to **$15.00**

This means you’ve overpriced the ride and the guests don’t see value for money.
You start reducing the price here and try to reach the sweet spot. I started
seeing satisfactory results at $12.

Now, you see, it works the same in the real world. Well, in most of the cases.
Once I started hearing from people that Cone is really good value, and that
people are ready to pay more, I started experimenting with the pricing. I
silently increased the price to **$1.99** and kept promoting it like normally.
To my surprise, people still believed it’s good value (!!!). Here’s the graph
showing number of downloads and the price of the app.

[Screenshot](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*quP41eGsP8ge8c9BBmvfeg.jpeg): That PetaPixel spike was probably the happiest day of my life

As you can see, the price change didn’t really affect the downloads. In turn,
people were still finding it great value for money. Which means that I was still
at stage 1 of reactions according to RCT, and there’s still some scope for
increasing the price further to get to the sweet spot.

A couple days back (27th July, 2017 to be exact), I increased the price by a
dollar, making it **$2.99**. And guess what? People still found it good value
for money. For now, I am going to sit at this pricing and observe more reactions
before experimenting further. There’s a long way to go before reaching that
second stage.

### Conclusion

Roller Coaster Tycoon taught me that it’s difficult to put a correct price tag
on a product. You have to keep experimenting to get the price right. Start with
a low price and work your way up to the point you stop acquiring new customers.
Then take one step back. That’s the correct price tag for your product.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6q9l51/how_a_game_taught_me_to_correctly_price_a_product/,396,"This is a sound idea based on business, wrapped in the ELI5 candy coating the internet finds palatable. As with most sound business ideas, the internet will still have none of it. Where you lose is the phobic fear of being branded a capitalist or tycoon. 

Price testing isn't compatible with comfort zone business. If it doesn't bliss you out of your socks, it must be wrong. Artifacts of an evil capitalist past (except the houses, cars, lifestyle, prestige) are of the devil. 

The internet arrives at price pretty much as your first example did. Others, so repulsed by the thought of commerce will just give their stuff away. Of course, they'll come up with some absolutely transparent excuse that doing this ""will gain traction faster."" They gain so much traction they then drown in monetization quicksand. 

Good ideas do not get much traction. Bad ideas proliferate like plague.  ",2017-07-29 06:47:41

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

I am just an average 13-year-old kid with a small business poised to eclipse half a million in sales in 2019.

My name is Tripp Phillips and I go to Dalton middle school. I play football and golf on the DMS team and still manage to do my homework and run a business. I give speeches about once a week to schools, colleges,  local chambers of commerce, Rotary clubs, Kiwanis clubs along with podcasts, television and print publication interviews. I love to tell my story and try to inspire people I touch to believe they can achieve whatever goal they set for themselves.  I am also one of the youngest patent holders in US history!  

My product is Le-Glue, the world's 1st water releasable adhesive created for building bricks like Legos.  We sell to brick builders, young and young at heart, all over the world. We are the answer to that evil KRAGGLE!

Since our appearance on Shark Tank, we have averaged over $35,000 per month in sales. And once Mr. Wonderful kicks in his help, we hope to quadruple those sells this year.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Here is exactly how it started...

My 3rd-grade teacher, Mrs. Martha Thomason, challenged me to write a paper or come up with an invention, so I got motivated to show some creativity. As I told the Sharks, “I did what any logical 9-year-old boy would do, I chose to avoid the writing”.

I came home and said Dad, “I need to make an invention. How in the world do I make one”? Dad told me what now has become our core belief: “ **Tripp, you have to Identify a problem and then come up with a solution to fix it.** ”

I went to my room to consider what problem I could solve. After 30 minutes, I ran to my dad’s room and shouted “I GOT IT! I was playing with my Lego Delta airplane and the wing kept popping off. I need a way to glue the pieces together but not forever!”  Dad looked up and thoughtfully said, “Buddy that is a pretty good idea.  Let me look into it.”

Dad and I began searching the [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/) (patent office) to see if anything existed in that area of adhesives. I searched and searched and found nothing, which was good news.  The next day Dad called a very good friend of his that owned an adhesive manufacturing business. The man, Benny Woods, thought for a few minutes and said, “I think we can make this happen.”  

Mr. Benny provided us with a couple of options. So I built and broke and built and broke to make sure which formula fit what I had envisioned. I settled on my choice. As a laboratory director, my dad had the means to set up real tests to prove that the adhesive actually worked.

We proved it to hold the bricks together over 10 times stronger than the frictional bond of the brick itself. Just as I directed to “not be forever”, we found our formula was easily dissolved in water, **strong but not permanent**.

Le-Glue was born! Mrs. Thomson entered my invention into the International Torrance Legacy event, and I won 1st place, with competitors from 1st grade through 12th grade. I even beat the high-schoolers!



**A small investment**

Since the idea appeared to have merit, Dad decided to invest $1000 to see if we could make some units and try to sell them.

We filed for a trademark online to protect our name that we came up with. Both of our names are “Leon” so we chose LE-glue. As an added feature, it also might remind users of why we made it, Glue for LEgos.

Before I was born, my dad had two great inventions stolen, so to avoid that from occurring again, he filed for a provisional patent. This would give us time to develop and prove the product. At the same time, we had met an awesome young man, “Uncle Fred”, that needed some assistance with an invention he had.

Dad knew how to build what he needed, so we traded services (Dad calls this bootstrapping and feels it is vital to all new entrepreneurs) as Fred is a world-class photographer, editor, and graphics creator.

Fred and Natasha Ruckel (RUCKSACK NY) have been our #1 asset in creating the designs, logos, and themes to our business. They are the best in the world!!



**Making the product**

We went ahead and purchased little tubs with tops, made five gallons of Le-Glue and printed some labels.

We scooped glue into the tubs with my sister Allee’s baby spoon. We applied the labels, screwed on the lids and then started a listing on Amazon.  It was somewhat time-consuming to fill each tub by hand, carefully placing the label and UPC code.

Allee was the fastest and neatest worker, so she became the “packaging manager”. We could do about 30 or so units per hour. To our surprise, Le-Glue started selling. Two, three,four, five units each day.

Before we looked up, we had sold almost $50,000 worth of Le-Glue. Our Hometown, Dalton Georgia is a manufacturing town so we leaned on some larger businesses and friends to help us start thinking about how to get bigger, how to grow professionally and how to just turn my idea into an actual business.

**Our first pitch event**

With that came our next adventure. Our banker Bill Davies and a carpet titan Bryan Macon both contacted my dad about a local entrepreneur event called Pitch Dalton Innovation Accelerator. They both knew of my invention and said I should enter Le-Glue.

They told me we could win valuable services. My dad responded, “we really don’t need anything.” Bill said there is a $5000 cash prize. Well, that changed my attitude so Dad and I followed their advice and we filled out the paperwork.

There were over 60 entries in the event, all adults except for me. We made it through the 1st couple of rounds, then we got placed with some mentors to advise us. It was similar to The Voice when they bring in advisors to make the contestant better. In our first meeting, I was was a little nervous but I felt like I still did a pretty good of explaining our business.

Rob Bradham, president of the Chamber of Commerce was impressed. Jodi Wren of Shaw Industries and Kristie Blalock of Inventure IT were the other advisors, and they were so helpful and supportive. In our second meeting, Mr. Rob made a bold prediction. He said, point blank, “Tripp, I have already told the other teams they are playing for second because you will WIN.”  

So  Allee and I gave a 15-minute **live**  presentation in front of hundreds in the audience, along with the four expert judges’ panel. Le-Glue won the Pitch DIA. I got to hold the giant check, like winning golfers get on TV. I got to shake hands with the mayor and a billionaire (not the same guy), plus we won that list of services that my dad and I had thought were “un-needed” from local enterprises. Little did we know that The Minor Law firm would be needed to apply the shares of the business into a trust to protect our business from those nasty Sharks, nor that

John Minor would have to spend hours on our behalf looking into the complex contracts a business Shark would lay out, nor did we know that there would be thousands of hits to our website in the first two minutes of the show airing that would have shut our site down without the prize of IT services provided by the experts at Inventure IT.

Those “un-needed” services were of utmost importance and helped to move our business forward in an unbelievable way.



**Shark Tank**

On Thursday the week before the PITCH finals, my dad’s client and friend Eric Ruppert of 3M came into the office and asked, “Did you know Shark Tank is holding an open call this Saturday?”

Dad did not know but texted me to see if I wanted to go. I was stoked and I really wanted to do it. We got up around 4 AM and drove to Suntrust Park. It was really cold and we had to sit outside in a long line hoping to get in the door. We met lots of entrepreneurs with some good and some bad ideas. It was a  great learning experience for me. We shared our story and we listened to theirs. It provided a good sense of comradery as the Shark Tank event is not a contest between entries but a potential success for all if you are good enough. I still stay in contact with friends we met in line that day.  

When the “crew” finally came out to hand out the bracelets that guaranteed our entrance, we waited with anticipation watching and hoping they did not run out before they got to us. The anticipation was killing me as we watched each person ahead of us, one by one, receive their golden bracelet.

Then they came to us, the young lady stopped and looked me in the eyes and she said, “I know you! You are the Le-Glue Kid. We’ve been watching you!” I was stunned, and yes we got the bracelet (It still sits inside the Pitch DIA Trophy on my shelf).  We grabbed a pizza and started practicing the pitch. When our time slot came up we went inside to the debriefing.

The young lady was not just anybody, she was the casting director! “Miss Mindy” was the boss, and she knew who I was!! Dad said, “Little Buddy, it’s a BIG Deal that she knew you.”



When my number was called, I went up in front of the producer table and gave my pitch like a little Billy Mays from Oxi-clean.

It was my pitch so my dad decided not to utter a single word until the producers started asking him questions directed to him after my speech. The producers said Shark Tank would call within two weeks **if**  they wanted us to move forward.  

On Wednesday of the next week, I was playing Xbox at about 9:30 PM when I got a call on my cell phone. I heard dad walking up the stairs towards my room. We have a 9 o’clock PM cell phone curfew, so I was thinking I am about to get in trouble. Dad opened the door, and I had my phone sitting on my chest, leaning back, while playing Xbox.

Dad gave me “the look” and I casually whisper, “Shark Tank.”  He starts jumping around and pointing like I should hand him the phone so I told him “I got this.“ And I did because we had made it all the way to those famous swinging doors of the “Super Bowl of business. Plus I made the deal with my all-time favorite Shark, Mr. Wonderful.



### Take us through the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing your first product.

We no longer have to scoop Le-glue with a baby spoon, because of an idea that I had one morning.

I was eating applesauce, Motts to be exact and I looked over at the old man and said, “It sure would be good if we could get Le-Glue into a squeeze pouch like this.” He stood up and said, “That idea is better than the glue itself”.

We searched the world over and found a large flexible packager in our backyard down in Atlanta. Because my dad knows businesses in the polymer and film industry, he was able to contact friends and get pointed towards companies that could help us with packaging.

I went to meet with Printpack Inc. this giant boardroom.  I felt like a mini-executive. We were able to secure packaging and use our artwork to get a “ready for retail”2.0-ounce flex spout pouch. We bought ourselves filling machine that let us put Le-Glue into a huge funnel and the air piston pumps the glue into the pouch. We manufacture the adhesive in-house and we package and ship in house. We are Made in the USA!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_qDwaa-IKw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_qDwaa-IKw) 

Our production went from 30 an hour to 500 per hour. That is with me and my 10-year-old sister running the machine. Our cost dropped 91 cents per unit. In turn, it gives us one of the best gross margins ever mentioned on Shark Tank. At 96%.

Mr. Cuban fell out of his chair when I told them the percentage. So it follows right back to what I said our motto has become. **Identify a problem and find a solution!**



### Describe the process of launching the business.

We did a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/le-glue/le-glue-the-water-soluble-adhesive-for-lego-blocks) that Rucksack NY helped us get set up. We ran it fairly quickly from the point we knew we had a product that could be sold, December of 2015. We met our goal of $3500 raising $4,000. This helped us hire our patent attorney and fund the actual patent.

Kickstarter is a good way to measure if people like, appreciate and understand your concept or product. I would recommend it to other entrepreneurs.

My dad is a self-proclaimed financial wizard and he hates, and I mean hates, debt. Kickstarter helped us from having to raise outside capital. Dad’s requirement was that we pay for everything as we go and not borrow any money, other than the original $1000 he put in. As a side note, he has been repaid completely and with the current value of his shares has made about 3000% on his investment.



After the Kickstarter campaign, sales begin to increase on our website and Amazon. We try to stay relevant and use Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other web advertising to keep our “drag” going as Mr. Fred would call it.

The biggest lesson I learned was pretty early. We had sold around $300 worth of Le-Glue to a small store  and the next day I asked my Dad, “Where is my money that we made?” Dad said, “I can give you a couple of bucks but the rest of the money has to be used to buy more ingredients to make more Le-Glue.”

I was not happy. But the lesson I learned is you have to use the money you just received to buy more ingredients, market and sell the product, invoice, wait to get paid, then use that money to buy more ingredients to make more Le-Glue, market and sell, invoice…..

You get the point. Because if you don’t, you will not remain in business long. Just because you made it doesn't mean it is going in your pocket.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

If you want to bring in customers, you have to do Amazon ads for sure.

I am speaking completely about selling a product, so selling services may not be the same path.  You also need to determine the target market for your product. We think we made a small mistake in our initial television commercial as we tailored it to children.

We discovered children do not buy our product, it is the grandmother, the grandfather, the mom and the dad that see and understand the issue we solve. Kids love to use it but the majority of calls, responses, and interactions we receive are from the adults. So that is who we target the most. If you can get it running correctly, Amazon is the absolute best channel to sell on.

Most of our advertising dollars are spent through Amazon because of the success we have been able to see with the cost of each sale (ACOS). We run at around 3% currently which is very good. Rucksack NY manages our system for us and they pick the keywords and ad types that show the highest rate of success.  

While Amazon is something a person can do themselves, we decided that we are better at manufacturing and allow true experts to do what they do best. The value is much greater than the costs so I highly recommend looking into it. I also suggest talking directly to the clients of whomever you interview for managing to advertise.

Everybody says they can deliver but do not just take their word for it. If they are good, they will not mind letting you talk to their clients.

We use several selling channels but none of them compare to the volume of Amazon. You still need a good running website that is the basis to find real information about the products you offer but it will not sell as much as Amazon.

Connect with your audience on social media. Make them laugh, make them cry, but make them remember you. We made up a little Mascot that I built myself, LEGLUE MAN. He is fun cute and has become famous as he has traveled from New York to LA to  South Florida. Find a way to get your customers wanting to see what you have to show them today. Make them like or if you can, love your story.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

We are still early in our business and have had some major advantages with Shark Tank and Pitch Dalton.

However, a lot of the success was driven by very good gross margins. It helps with our cash flow and allows us to reap some of the rewards more quickly than those operating on lower margins.

It seems simple but it is not. You have to identify processes and procedures to be able to manufacture efficiently, effectively and not input too much money up front. I was asked to judge a business enterprise-class business start-up competition at our local college a few weeks ago (kind of funny, me at 12 telling college students what to do).  I recognized something during the presentations. Each group made wonderful presentations with spreadsheets, predictions, values but all of them were spending money like it was water to get their business started.

I told my dad as we walked to the car, “Two things got me tonight. The first was that the student based everything on a perfect set of circumstances. Nothing goes exactly right in business so where are the contingency plans? Two, why do they want to go in so much debt and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to start a business.  

They could have just opened an Amazon store selling rugs made right here in Dalton.” My dad said, “Tripp you learned more in there tonight than those college students did.”

I say that because I think the trouble comes with too much pressure. We have been profitable since our 1st quarter. We could have spent way more money on ads, bought huge machines, built a new building.

But we didn't, because my dad knew how to do it. That’s my opinion but I am sticking to it.  Our future is bright because we have a good foundation plus I am only 13 so that makes it even brighter.



### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

The internet can make you or break you. Good press is great, but bad press can kill you. Make sure you keep your customers satisfied. If they have an issue, go out of your way to help them work it out. I don’t think the customer is always right but I do care about our customer and want to make their experience right. That is what they are paying for.

I have learned locality and “who you know” can make a business much more successful than if given other circumstances. Dalton Georgia, our hometown, is an awesome place to manufacture. We are able to buy chemicals locally and find good used equipment that fits our needs. We have workers available that are experienced in manufacturing.

Because of the billion dollar companies located here, we have so many wonderful tools available to us. We owe Dalton because I am quite sure we would not have been as profitable somewhere else.

### 

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

We built our original site, we meaning Rucksack NY built it, on Shopify. The low cost and ease of use were paramount in our picking that platform. We have moved to ShipStation for our shipping platform as it compiles all channels into one funnel so we can print with much less navigation.

It has saved us a lot of time so it is worth the monthly fee. Plus you get a decent discount off shipping costs with ShipStation. Dad uses [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) for accounting and since they are a sponsor of Shark Tank, I am hoping to get to be in a commercial for them. Hopefully, they will read this.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I am in the 7th grade so I really do not have time to read for fun. I do like to read about the Generals in WWII. I draw inspiration from theirs and others heroism.

We do listen to talks by [Jack Bonneau](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robynshulman/2018/02/23/how-12-year-old-jack-bonneau-from-shark-tank-is-leading-the-way-for-kid-entrepreneurs/) (fellow young Shark Tanker) and [Tameka Montgomery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsmontgomery) on raising entrepreneurs.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

I am probably not really qualified to offer a lot of advice but I will tell you this. My dad says “you cannot meet a goal if you never set one.” And I say “You cannot have a dream come true if you never dream.”

If you are not a dreamer and a goal setter, you probably are not best suited to be an entrepreneur. You must be self-motivated.  If you don’t like competition, pressure, hurt feelings, roller coasters of emotions, failures, and successes, just go work hard for someone else. It takes a special person to be an entrepreneur.



### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

We are looking for a commissions sales rep that can assist us in getting into the educational world. Our product was made by a kid for other kids so we know it is very useful in the school environment. If you know how to break into that area directly or through magazines, feel free to contact us.

78,bjdlyy,False,,583,"I made a million dollars at 25, now I'm lost and depressed.",Entrepreneur,"I first started my journey in entrepreneurship reselling video game licenses. I was pretty good at it. I made about 60k after 15 months. That's a lot money in my country and for a college age guy. Then the gig kind of died because of policy changes.


Fast forward another year, the ecommerce business was booming, I got in at the right time. I was around 23, I guess I had a talent for this kind of work. It all came very natural to me. I started making money right away. I started hiring and delegating work. Being one who always try to be different, I kept coming up with new ideas, make it into a formula and then have my employees do all the heavy work, at one point I was making over 30k a month without putting in any real work. 


Eventually, I stopped coming to the office, my formula was working and money was pouring in. I don't remember what I was doing at the time, probably because I was smoking weed and drinking everyday. I kinda lost touch and became indifferent to money after a while, I wasn't happy I was making money, it became just numbers. I remember how happy I was when I made the first $50 online, but I don't remember feeling anything during those months, even I was making a lot of money.


I liked the challenge at first, but ultimately I was in it to make money, growing up all I wanted was to make money, I had it in my head that I wanted to have one million dollars before 30. 


Then, at 25, I had one million dollars, I remember that morning when I opened up my spread sheet and put in the numbers, my networth, it showed, was one million dollars. I finally did it, I got what I had always wanted. 


I didn't feel anything, anything at all, it was just a number, I became so used to making a lot of money and not having to worry about money that the goal in my mind had become meaningless without me realizing it. I remember feeling a little bit confused as to why I didn't feel anything at the time, but being one who always ignore feelings, I brushed it off, rolled and joint and turned on Netflix.


Then came the bitcoin boom, I was still making good money in ecommerce at the time. I became aware and interested in bitcoin when it was still $40, but I didn't have any money back then. So when I learned about it again, I felt compelled to put in the money. I put about $250k in bitcoin at various prices, starting at 3k. I bought a bunch of shitcoins as well and obviously took some loss on them. I didn't know a thing about trading, or the market, or cryptocurrency. But I kept putting money in anyway. It didn't matter that I didn't know a thing because bitcoin kept going up, some of my shitcoins did as well, and it gave me a false sense of security. I was so indifferent that at one point my portfolio was worth $1.5m and I remember looking at it, not feeling a thing.


Of course it didn't last, the crypto craze began to die down and my portfolio started tanking, the number kept going down, it went from $1.5m to 900k in one night, then 600, 400, 300... I didn't sell, mainly because I didn't care enough. Eventually, it's now worth around 100k. I'm still holding, can't sell it now.


Back to the ecommerce business, my formula eventually became ineffective, coupling with changes in the market. Suddenly, I wasn't making money anymore. I was still indifferent though, I was worth over a million dollars at this point, bitcoin was still doing well. I felt burnt out. My motivation was money, I wasn't in it for some kind of mission nor had I any big meaningful vision. It was just for money. When I became indifferent to money, I became demotivated.

Eventually I shut down the business and do whatever I thought would make me happy. I went traveling, that's when I realized traveling is no cure for the mind. I was still smoking weed heavily, to the point that I developed such a tolerance that I don't even feel high anymore. It was depressing, I was in my room for days doing nothing but smoke and drink. I had no idea what I wanted to do or to become. 


It took me one year before I got out of that downward spiral. I still don't know what I want to do. But I'm taking actions to find out. There are still fears and doubts and I'm fighting them everyday. But I'm in a better mindset now. I hope I find out what I want to do with my life, I've seen people with money and no vocation or passion and I don't want to be like them. In a way, making so much money so early in life is not necessarily a good thing, it holds you back and it's harder to take risks because you're afraid to lose what you have. I miss having nothing but a burning desire to take chances and work hard. I've become lazy and complacent.


I don't know what this post is for, I guess I just wanted to share, I don't know who to talk to about this. 

Edit: 

Thanks to everyone who offered advice and encouragement. There are so many I could not reply to everyone. However I will make sure that I spend time reading everything carefully. I'm glad I made this post and I've gained new perspectives. I hope that this helps others as well.

Thanks to those who reached out and shared their story. It is reassuring to know that I am not alone and there are people who are struggling with the same thing. I know that to some people it is incomprehensible why some people who seemingly have it all can be depressed and unhappy, but we all have our own battle and it's even harder for us to find people who can understand. Just look at all the people who are ""successful"" yet committed suicide, most recently and noticeably, Anthony Bourdain. 

To the people who asked for advice and help. I'm sorry I don't have all the answers. I'm just a normal human being. You're gonna have to put in the work and figure it out yourself. Don't wait for anyone to help, don't wait for someone to give you a hand. If you want the reward you have to take the risk and accept the tradeoff. Yes, there is luck involved in being successful, but the people who seem to be blessed with opportunities look for them, take them and craft their own luck. Stop feeling pity for yourself and play the hand you're dealt.

Small advice on how to get an advice, it worked for me. Lay it all out in your first message and let the person choose to respond or not. Do NOT ask vaguely ""can I have some advice/help"" and then making them having to reply then wait for you to reply with your problem. LAY-IT-ALL-OUT.

910,af6sen,False,How Do I ?,110,Has Impostor syndrome ever cause you to feel like you are unworthy of your success? I'm facing that right now.,Entrepreneur,"**Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a ""fraud"".Those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved.**

[More about Imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)

I took over a shitty business with no margin to now making combine sales of about 500k per year and I finally get to draw pay after 4 years+ of slogging. I've helped a cafe reduced $100k worth of debt in less than a year that I've helped them, yet I still feel that I'm worthless, I can do better and yet I don't deserve it at all because it was others who helped me all in the same time.

I'm constantly afraid that I am just lucky, and when luck runs out, everything will go downhill and I'll be back to the loser I am, just worse than before

The absolute worst is when I make big mistakes. For example, I just made a huge mistake yesterday and kind of fucked up friendship with my Accountant because I listen to the wrong advice from others and made the wrong decision.

My current mood is all kinds of fucked up and I feel that all my achievements I did was purely out of luck and I don't deserve it. I feel like I can't run a business at all, let alone being successful and achieving my dreams. I am currently wondering what the fuck I am doing.

Cried myself to sleep last night and as I type this, I'm tearing up again. Doesn't help that I have mild depression and OCD (at least that's what the doctors say).

So, do any of you face this and if you do, how do you get yourself out of this vicious cycle?  


EDITED: Oh wow. I didn't expect this to blow up. Appreciate every single one of your comment. Just to go in-depth in some details...

1. I have been on Fluxil for the past 12 years, seems to help me clear my thoughts. 
2. I don't always feel like THIS BAD. When I made this post I was super depressed due to my mistake that may have caused a rift in friendship with my accountant.  I cried over the phone call with him because I feel like I fucked it up big time. I cried to sleep that night because that friendship is VERY important to me.
3. I dislike conflicts and unhappiness, I would personally earn lesser just to be happy. In short, friendship is more important to me compared to extra money.
4. I was bullied during my child and teenhood, constantly made fun of because of my personality (I'm more sensitive than most guys) and how I looked (Yeah I looked like a dork), this is what causes me to have low self-esteem, though the funny thing is, most of my old friends say that I'm so confident nowadays that they are at awe how much I've changed.
5. I do constantly feel the fear that I may go downhill, but usually, I take it as a fact that I can't slack off, because I have mouths to feed. In turn, I do feel stressed out. 
6. The cafe that I helped with? I only gave them monthly advice. I barter trade with them to let me use their wifi, 30% discounts on food, always have a place to sit in their cafe in exchange for advice. I'm not a business coach. I'm in the distribution/wholesale industry and a Brand principal for S.E.A region.
7. I write daily journals (or as daily as I can) so I can read back and track my success and mistakes. But this time when I read it, the more I feel like a fraud. That has not happened before. 
8. I also have a dream card+ list of achievements in a card form that I put in my wallet to affirm my goals and achievements. Worked most of the time after I had a shitty meeting, but this time, did nothing.
9. Now to think of it, I may have been too stressed out as I am stepping into other ventures with other friends. I would agree that I am not mentally strong enough.

But I found one store who charges $10 thats it. Went by to introduce myself, say hi and then I asked him ""Why are you so much cheaper then everyone else""

His response?

And basically, he's almost eliminated his advertising budget, ensured he's listed on every major gun auction website and he has about 70% market share in the community on transfers. How does he make his money? Accessories, gun holsters, ammo, sights, he's also a gun smith and does work on guns.

Also he says he saves money by not having as much money tied up in inventory, his gun selection is pretty basic. he says thats for the walk in traffic which is not his bread and butter.

Why did he do this? 2 yrs ago his lease came up for renewal. His business was struggling he couldn't afford a better location, so he thought about bringing in foot traffic by being the cheapest on transfers. He does 5-6 transfers PER day.

I am sure there are SEC restrictions - but aren't these completely ridiculous/stupid given my logic above?

Which is it... can you gamble or not? - and if so, why is anyone prevented from investing/gambling on early stage startups?

I know there are crowdfunding options - but I am not sure if the term sheets etc... a $1000 investor gets is good or not - if you have any experience with this, I'd love to hear.

My point is - by removing any restrictions and allowing ANYONE to directly invest in early stage startups, we are encouraging even more entrepreneurs to take risks & give them additional access to capital. 

Couldn't we legally create a special purpose vehicle (SPV via an LLC etc) and let anyone put in as little as $1k?

I joined Hotjar three months ago.

So far, it's been a blast.

But we had to take a tough decision early on...

We decided NOT to produce any shallow content and to focus ONLY on writing stuff that we would like to read ourselves, even if it meant publishing only one article every month.

So my colleague Fio and I spent the last two months researching and writing a massive but helpful guide for SaaS founders (but it seems to be helpful for startups in general, which is why I'm posting it to this sub).

We also chose to take a big risk by asking for people's feedback BEFORE the guide was even ready.

This could have backfired as we were almost ashamed of the first version.

We were blown away by the results: more than 200 people (!!!) gave us feedback on Google Docs and on a draft version of the guide.

We used this feedback to improve it and make it what we hope is the best answer on the Internet for early-stage SaaS founders looking for help.

We're so happy we chose to take this path and learned a lot.

Don't be afraid to ask for feedback on an early version of your product or article - this is the only way you can improve it. Put your ego aside and learn, learn, learn.

Anyway, here's the guide in all its glory (free access, no email required):

136,9blez4,False,Case Study,325,"Here's my REAL attempt at starting a web business - 4 months in. Includes idea creation, start up cost, marketing, profits etc.",Entrepreneur,"**IDEA**

So I figure with all the bs posts in this sub lately, I'll add some actual real life content. I'm 25 years old, work an 8-5 IT desk job, and am a pilot. I have desperately tried to think of a good business idea for like 7 years, and came up with nothing. As a plane-less pilot, I love browsing the web for airplanes I'll never be able to afford to buy, but currently the only sites out there for used airplanes for sale are absolutely horrid to use *cough* www.barnstormers.com *cough*. And the ones that are good to use, cost HUNDREDS of dollars for listings and are aimed at the super rich 1%, not your every day pilot like me. But they get so much traffic. So I thought there might be an opportunity to create an easy to use, mobile friendly marketplace for pilots. Since I know what pilots want to see in a listing, I made sure those things were first and foremost visible. 


**FUNDING**


Almost two years ago I started slinging home made aviation t shirts to my instagram followers, to save up money. Then about a year ago I discovered Merch by Amazon. If you aren't aware, merch by amazon is a Print on Demand business model. You design the shirt, amazon lists it, and when someone buys it, they make it, you collect somewhere between $3 and $6 commission on sales, and they ship it. Luckily I am fairly good at photoshop, and I put about 5 months of work into this merch idea, which sort of paid off. In 1 year I had earned about $10k profit from Merch by Amazon, designing and listing t shirts, and selling them to organic customers looking for aviation shirts on amazon. I didn't spend any of this money because I wanted to use it to fund an actual business, but I didn't know what yet. [Here's a very small sample of one group of designs](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=w_bl_sl_s_ap_web_7141123011?ie=UTF8&node=7141123011&field-brandtextbin=General+Aviation+Apparel). All done by hand myself in photoshop


So 5 months ago, I thought of this website idea, I found a developer on upwork, and paid him to make my website. I did ALL the design work in photoshop, making the site exactly how I wanted it, and gave the designs over to him to make. The dev was also an aviation lover and wanted to help with the project, so he gave me a little break on his hourly rate. All up it cost around $5500 to get the website live and about a month of tweaking so it worked well on computers and mobile devices. There is a free listing, a $15 listing, and a $20 listing. So now I had a website, www.wingswap.com, but needed to get the word out. I'm still working on that, but here's what I've done so far! 

**MARKETING**

To start off I let my personal instagram pilot friends know about it, and launched a new instagram page. This was the t shirt instagram page I marketed from earlier, pivoted to be the wingswap instagram (https://www.instagram.com/wingswapofficial/), since it's the same demographic, I retained most of the followers during the pivot. During my t-shirt slinging days, I joined several aviation forums to tell them about my shirts, which they all got behind. I let them know about my new business, and they all immediately supported the idea, which was huge in getting people to use the site right away. 

After one month this happened!

https://imgur.com/a/K56LPoJ

The equivalent of posting your first dollar on the wall haha

I also paid up and coming pilot youtube celebrity and friend Trent Palmer to shout out my website at the end of his video. This cost me several hundred dollars, not quite $1k:

https://youtu.be/D5Z2VNTFp-Q?t=963

But if you look at the traffic it gave me in the first day, it worked out to about $0.002 per person visited. and even less now. So definitely worth it. I've done this three times now.

I also paid FLYING magazine to do an online article on me, which cost $2100, you can see that article here:

https://www.flyingmag.com/california-pilot-makes-simple-aviation-marketplace-wingswap

This was by far the worse investment I've done, as it only got me about 2.8k vistors. Oh well. Live and learn. 

All of this is continually being funded by merch by amazon profits, which are around $300-$600/mo

https://imgur.com/a/lR5LolW

Now after all this spending, I've made in profit, a total of $515. Not much you might say, but $360 of that was just this month. Also look at that traffic grow!
https://imgur.com/a/ohoCuy7
I'll start advertising on my site once I hit 50k or 100k users a month, or whenever I cant afford it on my own anymore haha.

I've been contacted by one who wants a 10% partnership for $10,000, which places my business value at $100,000. haha seems crazy, but market value right? 

The main thing I'm doing to get people to list on my site is to reach out to people with planes for sale on other websites, and let them know about my site, who I am, what I'm doing, and why they should use it. Takes about an hour a day to keep the new listings coming in. I'm waiting to hit critical mass of users so I don't have to do this anymore. 

So thats it! Hit 20,000 visitors this month, which to me is crazy for just 4 months after launch. I'm very happy with how it is going. I'm conitnually investing in different marketing ideas, and seeing what sticks. 

The best part is, since this is all funded by my Merch by amazon profits, and I have my 8-5 job to rely on in the mean time. Will answer any questions you have!

839,sblc6,False,,463,"From an idea to replacing my full-time salary in 4 months.  How I did it, and what's next!",Entrepreneur,"I'm a long time redditor, but wanted to keep my reddit life and my company life seperate, hence the throwaway.

I'll get right to it:

In October last year I was reading an article about a guy that started a cleaning company in his city and is now doing $150,000 per year. 

I work full-time, but figured, shoot, if he can pull that off, why can't I? 

I got to working in this order:

1) I drew up a quick marketing plan-literally one page in bullet form  
2) Had a website built that featured some of the ideas that I thought was most appealing about his site.  
3) Asked my home cleaner if she would take the jobs if I got any and she basically said ""hells yeah""  (I now have a total of 8 cleaners)  
4) I brushed up on my adwords (I had already owned an Adwords guide and had dabbled in adwords before for another local company)  
5) Started Twitter and Facebook page.  

All of this took like 3 weeks.

I launched the site on November 3rd and had the first job on the first day.  

By the end of November I made my first $1,000 profit, and now the site is doing $1,000 profit per week ($4,000 per month), which exceeds the take home pay from my full time job.

This post is two-fold.  To say,

1) This is not brain surgery and 
2) Don't overthink shit, sometimes just doing it is the only answer.

I'm just getting started with this and feel I could hit $10,000 per month profit in the next 4 or 5 months if things keep going like this. 

ASK ME ANYTHING!

Also, I feel like I can duplicate this success in another venture: Lawncare.  I plan to start a lawncare company (and by plan, I literally mean I'm going to get that bad boy jumping in the next two weeks) and I try to duplicate my success.

If you guys want to tag along for the ride I plan to document everything here and you can follow along.  I'll make everything super transparent, including money I make the entire thing.  

**Tl/dr I started a cleaning company that replaced my take home salary from my full time job in 4 months.  Now I'm going to try again with a lawn care company and I'll make the entire process super transparent if you guys are interested.**

Edit: Here is where the lawn site follow along will take place: http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/ (Thanks to tabasquito for setting this up).  

Edit: It's amazing seeing folks come to the site from as far away as China, that's awesome!

Edit: Thanks to the redditor that emailed me through the site to verify that it was me! :-)

Edit: Folks, please don't book on the site (I mean, if you're in the DC area, that's all well and good and I'd appreciate it), but we're only in the DC Metro area! :-)  I'm seeing bookings from as far away as California and I have to email each and every one of you to say it's a no go! LOL  Thanks though.

**Final Edit: ** Thanks to all of you that asked such great questions.  I tried to answer as many of them as I could, I think I got well over 95% of them.  I ended up doing this to share my experience but got such great stuff out of this myself:
Thanks to the kind Redditor who runs an awesome company with 200 employees that offered to meet me for lunch next weekend to give me some ideas and just to shoot the breeze.
Thanks to the kind UK redditor that gave me tips about the site by email.
Thanks to the nice Chinese redditor that pm'd me.

Everyone, thanks this was fun: Follow along at **http://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/** where I'll try to do this again over 90 days with a lawn company.  I have nothing to sell, no affiliate links, no products to push, no nothing.  It would just be a chance to see me try to do this again real time in detail.  Hopefully it will help some folks to get going to try something.  Life is short!  Thanks :-)

But so many entrepreneurs get told that they're supposed to ALWAYS have projections, and they're supposed to use them for budgeting and forecasting.

The reality is that those kinds of full-financial-statement projections are just too cumbersome and time-intensive for most business owners to keep up with, and honestly their ROI is not worth the effort it takes to keep them up. 

Stagger charts are super-simplified spreadsheets used to make goals and track your progress towards them. Here’s what they look like:

http://imgur.com/XTVkETO

On the top row, you list the months you’re making the projections *for*. In the left column are the months that you’ll be making the projections *in*. Each month, you’ll sit down and fill out one row. Projected numbers are in gray, actual numbers are in black.

In the above example, we started in January assuming that our hypothetical company would make an extra $100 every month for the rest of the year. Simple enough.

When February rolled around, it turned out we actually beat our $200 projection and made $220! Score! The rest of the row reveals our optimism.

March hits and we had a bit of a downturn, so we updated the following projections accordingly.

And so on and so forth. It’s that easy.

WHY these stagger charts are so much better than your standard financial projections:

#1. Projections are too detailed
When most people think “financial projections,” they think of the standard, comprehensive, dozens-of-excel-columns approach. You predict numbers for each of your financial accounts, from revenues down to office supplies.

The reality is that these kinds of projects are INCREDIBLY inefficient. The amount of work it takes to build them isn’t worth the benefits that forecasting brings.

**Most people only need projections for “important” numbers.** Revenue is a big one. Maybe advertising or payroll expenses are yours.

These are the numbers you really need to be projecting and paying attention to. Stagger charts allow you to make individual goals for the numbers that matter, and ignore the ones that don’t.

#2. Projections aren’t flexible
You would think with aaalll those numbers floating around in those behemoth projection sheets, you’d be able to make projections for just about anything you would need.

You’d be wrong, though.

**Some businesses need to set goals for numbers that aren’t actually money.** Maybe it’s the amount of new clients they want to sign on. Or a quota for new projects.

Whatever they are, if they aren’t dollar signs, they aren’t on traditional financial projections. Stagger charts can be adapted to just about anything you can quantify, and this means you can focus on any metric that will ultimately make you more money.

#3. Projections don’t keep you accountable
This is by and far my biggest issue with projections, and an easy kill shot for stagger charts.

*Once you update projections, your early goals are gone forever.*

Every time I update financial projections, I lose my previous ones. This is a big problem! Part of becoming a good goal-setter is being able to learn from your mistakes. **If you erase your mistakes each time you update, you’re losing valuable data on your build-measure-learn feedback loop.**

Stagger charts document each round of updates throughout the projection period, which shows you how much better you’re getting at projections, reveals patterns in both projections and results, and ultimately keeps you accountable to the goals that you set way back when.

Like pretty much anything in entrepreneurship, being serious about projections takes commitment. The ROI, though, is huge, and stagger charts are a much faster way to reap the benefits.

**What is a virtual restaurant (aka virtual kitchen)?**

Virtual restaurants take orders through online apps (like Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Skip the Dishes) and prepare food exclusively for pick-up, take-out and delivery customers. Virtual restaurant concepts only exist in apps, and use ‘ghost kitchens’ (aka ‘virtual kitchens’ or ‘dark kitchens’) to serve a virtual menu to virtual customers.

Savvy restaurateurs have developed the virtual restaurant concept alongside the exploding third party delivery app market to capture incremental revenue increases. The sales increase comes from successfully optimizing food production lines to serve in-house and virtual customers, without adding additional operational costs.

> Virtual restaurant concepts only exist in apps, and use ‘ghost kitchens’ to serve a virtual menu to virtual customers.

Before getting into the two main virtual restaurant strategies, you might be wondering: Why bother opening a virtual restaurant in the first place?

**Why bother opening a virtual restaurant?**

Labor is one of the largest (and growing) cost challenges faced by restaurateurs today. According to NRCP industry analyst Dean Haskell, restauranteurs could be on track for a ""$250M negative impact on the industry due to higher labor costs in the FY17”. What’s worse, while restaurateurs may be aware that their labor costs are spiralling, many are not sure what their actual weekly labor costs are, or how to get them under control.

Between minimum wage increases, growing labor compliance regulations, and a largely seasonal or part-time workforce, you already have very demanding labor scheduling responsibilities. When managers cannot effectively manage the scheduling availability needs of their staff, they spend too much on labor and eat their own margins or not enough, and sacrifice the customer experience. When this happens week over week, little mistakes add up fast.

Because we feel your pain, we built this free [staff availability template for restaurant managers](https://www.7shifts.com/staff-availability-template) to simplify and streamline scheduling.


Undaunted by the threat of death by a thousand buddy punches, enter: the virtual restaurateur.

There are two main types of restaurateur trailblazing the virtual restaurant space: the incubators and the entrepreneurs.

If you’re an incubator, a virtual restaurant concept can let you serve new virtual customers with the same kitchen, line cooks and inventory you already have, without the additional staff. And if you want to start a virtual restaurant from scratch, you don’t need to hire (or schedule) any wait staff at all.

Each type of virtual restaurateur varies in its resources and risk tolerance, but both have the same goal: to maximize incremental revenue.

**The incubator’s approach to virtual restaurants**

Some scrappy restaurateurs are using existing staff and kitchen facilities to launch virtual restaurants within existing restaurants to capture the growing digital demand from hungry diners, without increasing their labor.

Dauntless and always looking for ways to optimize, the incubators approach is to come up with a unique restaurant concept, a new name and logo, and a new menu, and then sign up to one (or several) of the third party delivery apps (more on them in a minute) in their area to promote their virtual restaurants on their platform.

No additional storefront to manage, no additional rent, no additional staff required.

There have been some glowing success stories of restaurants breaking into the virtual restaurant space by using their existing facilities to incubate a brand new virtual restaurant:

Simon Mikhail opened his virtual restaurant concept Si’s Chicken Kitchen in 2016 out of his pizzeria. By 2017, Mikhail averaged about $1,000 per week selling fried chicken, chicken tenders and chicken pizza, surpassing the weekly sales of his original pizza concept.

Jack Chaiyarat, owner of the sushi restaurant Rice Café launched his Poke Café virtual concept on Uber Eats, and according to Restaurant Hospitality now “does about 100 orders per week, which [Chaiyarat] said is more than $2,000 in sales.”.

Joel Farmer, co-owner of Gerizim Cafe & Ice Cream launched his virtual restaurant Brooklyn Burger Factory on Aug 1, 2018, and is “now selling as many as 75 burgers a day, with revenue 28 times that,” Bloomberg reports.

**The entrepreneur’s approach to virtual restaurants**

On the flip-side, some entrepreneurs like Peter Schatzberg’s (Green Summit) and George Kottas’ (Dekotas Group) are going all in on the virtual restaurant concept. These restaurateurs rent and operate dedicated virtual kitchens solely focused on digital delivery orders.

What Schatzberg, Kottas, and other virtual restaurant entrepreneurs are able to do, is pack multiple virtual restaurant concepts within a single dedicated commissary kitchen, industrial kitchen or hub kitchen facility and exclusively service third party delivery app customers. If one concept isn’t panning out, they can shutter it on a moment’s notice, adjust their inventory and production lines, and try out a new one with very little effort.

Even well-established chains like Red Robin are embracing the entrepreneurial spirit and experimenting with delivery only virtual restaurant concepts to outpace their competition.

Red Robin recently opened an Express concept in downtown Chicago offering food solely for delivery to customers within a 10-minute delivery radius (to assure quality of the meal). The Express location is partnered with several third party delivery services (including DoorDash and Grubhub) and even employs three additional people every shift to handle delivery orders by foot from the apps and the website.

In an interview with Restaurant Business Jason Rusk, Red Robin’s VP of business innovation says the Red Robin Express experiment is looking to tackle the biggest challenge in making virtual restaurants work: volume. “As a delivery-only operation, 100% of the Express’ sales will [help maximize] the quantities of deliveries per dollar spent,” this will help significantly offset costs, says Rusk.

The entrepreneur’s approach makes testing out new concepts, menus and markets easier and faster thanks to the drastically reduced overhead. A ghost kitchen requires less space to rent and less staff to operate than restaurants with a storefront and dining room.

Whether you’re an incubator or more of an entrepreneur, if you’re going to tangle with starting a virtual restaurant, you’re going to need to contend with one cold, hard fact: third party delivery apps will be critical to your operation’s success. Now let's examine one delivery only app that is helping virtual restaurants do it right: Uber Eats.

**There’s no food delivery app like Uber Eats**

Despite being a latecomer to the scene, Uber Eats has quickly emerged ahead much of the competition and is poised to do 6 billion in revenue in 2018, making it the most profitable arm of the company.

There is no other food delivery app like Uber. Uber Eats starts by analyzing its riders search data and analyzes it for insights, uncovering unmet or under-served consumer demand. They then will approach restaurant owner in the area, and if the food being searched for fits with restaurants existing concept, they provide a free tablet to interface with the app, send a photographer to photograph featured dishes, and offer some guidance on menu items.

According to Jason Droege, VP of Uber Everything, although Uber Eats is still in early days, this approach is working. Uber Eats already has hundreds of virtual restaurant brands in physical restaurants, that exist solely to serve users on the Uber Eats app and platform. Those virtual restaurants are serving a user base of more than 8 million active users (in the US alone).

The New York Time reports, “The number of trips taken by Uber Eats drivers grew by more than 24 times between March 2016 and March 2017,” That is one large, captive, hungry audience.

**The rise of delivery-only restaurant concepts**

If this all sounds too good to be true, don’t worry it’s not. The virtual restaurant concept is still taking shape, and no one has got it figured out. Although there is a lot of promise and early success, there are also reports of restaurateurs who have tried the model and thrown in the towel.

It is early days for the virtual restaurant concept, and restaurants–as well as their third party delivery app partners–still have a lot to learn. But for virtual restaurateurs who see the upsides and are motivated by the challenges, the reward is well worth the risk.

The idea of using delivery and take-out to grow your restaurant business might seem ridiculous at first glance. But recent reports from restaurants across North America are seeing online food delivery revenue increase by 9.35% year over year. This growth is bolstered by a 7.26% increase in customers choosing to dine through online food delivery services. Even the Wall Street Journal reports that delivery is forecast to account for $75.9 billion in gross merchandise volume by 2022.

Jonothan Maze, Executive Editor of Restaurant Business Magazine and self-proclaimed former delivery skeptic, goes deep into the evolving delivery trend and the opportunity it opens up for virtual restaurants. Listen to the full podcast here:

That is one big and growing slice of the market to risk ignoring.

But why? Why now? One word: millennials.

Millennials allocate the highest share of their food budgets to prepared food (7.5%) compared to other generations (6.6-6.9%). The preference for prepared food is all about convenience. And this preference is gaining priority as millenials grow up, build wealth, and become a powerful segment driving restaurant business.

According to a 2015 Mintel study, ""This prioritizing of convenience above all else is a positive for restaurants generally (given the ease of eating out vs preparing at home), and it is especially advantageous for those offering delivery and to-go.""

The only thing more convenient than eating prepared food in a restaurant, is eating it at home. Restaurant Business Magazine reports 86% of consumers are using off-premise services at least monthly, and one-third use them more than they did a year ago.

In fact, a study by Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2022 digital food delivery may engulf 11% of the total market, compared to the 6% it’s at today. The same study found that 43% of consumers who ordered food for delivery say it replaced a dine-in meal at a restaurant.

So let's say there is more than a snowball’s chance in BOH that services like Uber Eats, GrubHub and Postmates are onto something.

Maybe launching a virtual restaurant seems like a good idea to you. If it does, it pays to be informed, and to weigh the potential benefits against the potential challenges. Here’s a short list of the pros and cons of trying to create a virtual restaurant or virtual kitchen to get you started:

**The pros: Why create a virtual kitchen?**

1. Low overhead cost: no wait staff, dining room rent, tables, tableware, parking space, etc.
1. Steady incremental sales growth for the same labor spend
1. Increased digital brand awareness and ability to serve growing millennial segment
1. Real-time insight into local diner behaviour, demands, and demographics
1. Expanded reach and profits via digital apps without much marketing spend
1. Total real-time control over menus give you a powerful digital marketing asset
1. Agility to easily experiment with different concepts to find and grow the most successful

**The cons: Why create a virtual kitchen?**

1. Limited access to joining certain service provider platforms (ie. Caviar, Uber Eats)
1. Managing the impact on staff morale of working online orders without getting tips
1. Balancing kitchen capacity between in-house guests and delivery app orders
1. Potential bad reviews from online customers and managing your online reputation
1. Extended wait times for in-house guests if the kitchen is servicing delivery orders
1. Loss of control over customer service via third or fourth party delivery driver actions
1. How to find the right delivery app for your virtual restaurant
1. When it comes to finding ‘the best’ third-party delivery service to get your virtual restaurant off the ground there is no standard, and anyone who tells you different is selling something.


Recode built this useful tool to help you spot with third party delivery app services are popular and available in your area, you can try it out here (just scroll down).

Overall, the third party delivery app market is still pretty fragmented, there are a few big leaders, like Uber Eats, GrubHub and Postmates, and many scrappy up and comers looking to either take a piece of their market share–or get acquired through a merger. CrunchBase reports that GrubHub has already acquired 12 of its competitors, the most recent being Tapingo on Sep 25, 2018, for $150 million USD.

We’ve compiled a short (though not exhaustive) list of some of the most popular apps you can use to start your virtual restaurant at the time of writing below. The links included lead to the restaurant partner sign up or application form (which is not always so easy to find on Google!).

* Uber Eats
* GrubHub
* DoorDash
* Postmates
* Deliveroo
* Foodora
* SkipTheDishes
* Bite Squad
* Olo
* Caviar (now owned by Square POS)

If you do decide to go with more than one third party delivery app, you may want to consider Chowly. Chowly integrates multiple third party ordering systems into a single tablet that interfaces with your POS, letting your virtual restaurant serve virtual customers in your area, regardless of the app they use.



Since there are many new and growing companies tackling digital delivery and digital takeout, there is still a lot of variation in exactly how each company works.

All third party delivery apps connect hungry people on their smartphones with delicious food to order and eat in the comfort of their own home. Some outsource the actual delivery to fourth party couriers, others supply their own fleet of delivery drivers, others let customers pick up orders themselves.

Here are some questions to guide your research when trying to identify which third party delivery service(s) you want to work with:

* How many delivery service apps do you want to use to capture online customers?
* Are you comfortable giving up control of customer service to a third party?
* Are you willing to train your staff on how to use a new app?
* Do you want to be able to easily edit your online menus?
* Can your margins cover the marketing, service, or delivery fees (typically 20% to 35%)?
* How do you want tips and tipping on digital delivery and digital takeout handled?
* Can your kitchen handle spikes in order volume?
* What is your overall businesses strategy for delivery?
* Will servicing delivery drivers impact your existing dine-in guests’ experience?
* Will you be able to maintain food standards with delivery (is your packaging effective)?
* Is your production line ready for the added demand or do you need to reconfigure it?
* What are the logistics of how delivery pick ups will be handled in your establishment?
* Who will manage receiving and packaging orders?
* Will the additional work impact the performance of your staff’s primary responsibilities?

There are a lot of options out there for restauranteurs looking for a food delivery app to partner with, be sure to check out Fast Casual’s excellent breakdown comparing top 4 competitors in the space. According to an extensive delivery app driver survey, Fast Casual found three main issues drivers have with all apps:

1. A gradual pruning of useful features with each new update
1. Glitches and bugs
1. A general lack of effective support

As you do your research, try to keep in mind that treating your first virtual restaurant concept like an experiment, and tempering your expectations will go along way. Give yourself a set period of time that you are comfortable testing out a service, and do your best to manage it for that set period of time no matter what. Once it’s done, look at your books closely to determine success or failure.

**The bottom line on virtual restaurants**

Sometimes it doesn’t matter how hard you try to increase foot traffic to your restaurant, factors you have zero control over will limit your ability to get your kitchen’s delicious food to the hungry mouths searching for a meal.

If you are in a position to experiment, then starting a virtual restaurant incubator in your kitchen can be an easy way to increase your incremental sales revenue without adding more labor costs. If you are an entrepreneur looking for a hot new business idea, starting your own virtual restaurant in an industrial kitchen and testing a few different concepts might give you the challenge and success you’re looking for.

In either case, be sure to weigh the pros and cons carefully, use the Virtual Restaurant Research Questions to guide your due diligence and good luck on your virtual restaurant adventure.

*edit*: someone asked: ""If I owned or managed a restaurant, where would I start to build my own virtual restaurant concept?"" Here's my response:

Well, it would depend on my kitchen equipment, my inventory levels, my on hand ingredients, what season it it was... But first I'd start by taking a look at what food options were available nearby. Then I would see if there were any missing, then I'd aim to fill the gap.

Maybe I know how to make a killer fish taco and some deadly beer-battered fish and chips. And maybe my burger joint has been dead Mon-Thurs for months, and I have a line cook or two taking more smoke breaks than orders. Maybe my kitchen has all the friers and oil I'd need to fry some fish, and maybe spring is just around the corner and it's starting to get warm out, and I have a hunch that people will craving summery comfort food to indulge in, in the sunny park across the street.

So maybe I start up Franks Fish Fry, I create a logo for $50, then I call up my old mom, who taught me how to make the fish taco's when I was eight. We catch up a bit, she yells at me a bit, then I tell her my idea, and we figure out small menu together using a few high-quality, in season, ingredients, in a few creative ways...

From there, I would check out what third party delivery apps are big in my area, and I'd start signing up for them and see which accepted me.

That's one way to start.

513,hr0wza,False,,121,Why YOU'RE the competition,Entrepreneur,"Pre-covid I've dabbled in projects here and there or shyed away from going all in because I felt markets were too saturated with competition. It wasn't until being laid off in April where I said SCREW it. I'm going all-in on my ideas. Especially while I'm able to collect unemployment. So with this mindset, I was able to accomplish the following:

**Timeline**

April 2020: got laid off.

May 2020: launched my growth marketing agency.

June 2020: closed 3 clients

July 2020: grew to 162 email subscribers, have 3 additional leads (with budgets more than my yearly salary when I was employed) ready to sign and I partnered with an impact fund to help invest in underrepresented founders.

\-----

This is what I mean when I say, ""you're the competition"".

Is my business idea anything new? Absolutely not. Is it competitive? Absolutely. But guess what, just like other agencies are my competition, I'm their competition. The more I realized this, the less I worried about the competition (note, I didn't say ignore) and the more I focused on building out my vision. That simple mindset has allowed me to stop comparing my Chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 26.

The Internet has billions of people and it's growing daily. Competiton means a market has been proven and there are people willing to buy/do business with you. If you're letting a little competition ruin your slice of the pie, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Focus on your vision, build it out, pay attention to the competition but don't let them be your end all to be all.

765,7zalvo,False,Case Study,100,$17k/mo selling tiny cinder blocks,Entrepreneur,"Hi /r/Entrepreneur, it's Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) again, where I do interviews with successful e-commerce entrepreneurs.

Here is my interview with Mat Hofma, founder of Mini Materials, an e-commerce company that sells miniature construction materials. This is one of my favorite interviews so far, and [it reached the front page of Hacker News today](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16429467) which is super exciting.

**TLDR:**

- Averaging **$17k revenue/month**.
- Mat discovered the idea from a **post on Reddit!**
- He **taught himself 3D printing** to get started.
- He has harnessed the **power of Instagram** to grow sales.
- He **10x'd his email conversion rate** by using a Shopify app.

### Background

My name is Mat Hofma, and I created [Mini Materials](https://www.minimaterials.com/). We sell miniature masonry and woodworking supplies like cinder blocks, red bricks, pallets, lumber, and even molds to pour your own cinder blocks.

Our best seller is by far the pallet of miniature cinder blocks. From Day 1 - when I posted my development story to Reddit - the general consensus has always seemed to be ""I didn't think I'd ever want to buy a pallet of mini cinder blocks, but now that I see it, I really need it.""

Since then we've expanded to different styles of mini masonry and even kits to build models.

[What our product looks like](https://images.contentful.com/t0pm5m7uku03/5qWFVnYDy8oa00i2gCYsAA/335a2e209d3a4eba9c75eda996cd9183/mini-materials-main-2.jpg)

### How I came up with the idea.

I was a graphic designer by trade and really wanted to start up my own e-commerce shop. I wanted to learn web design and at least get some business experience under my belt. I had never even thought of starting my own business.

I couldn't think of what to sell until I saw a guy making mini cinder blocks for fun on Reddit. I wanted to buy some, but they weren't for sale. I figured it couldn't be that hard, so I taught myself 3D design in [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) and made molds from 3D prints.

I figured throughout the process that I could at least sell enough to break even - since startup costs were under $500 total. The worst that could happen was that I got an education on 3D design, web design, and prototyping.

It ended up working out a little better than that.

### Creating the original product

I realized that not many people do this, so I decided to make my own product. I also wanted to incorporate a wood pallet for when I ship the bricks. It would also double as a coaster!

I had never done 3D design before, so I practiced playing around on sketchup and designed 3D bricks so that I could make a mold. I used [www.3Dhubs.com](https://www.3Dhubs.com) to find a local 3D printer to make one for me:

[Here's a photo of the original mold.](https://images.contentful.com/t0pm5m7uku03/7223tbFYyWqwIcgSmE0eyW/07de54cdb65a3f60ceba69a42f35c6af/Bgqc1RW.jpg) 

[I glued the 3D Print to some wood and made a silicon mold.](https://images.contentful.com/t0pm5m7uku03/4qLmgIJL44wEsS8m6cAgOS/5b0f0b9aaceb150806341039748d25d0/1F92rX7.jpg)

I played around with a ton of different filler materials for the cinder blocks, but pure cement just broke so easily. I finally settled on a secret formula using cement and a few other materials that look and feels identical to real cement.

[Here's my first batch of blocks that need sanding:](https://images.contentful.com/t0pm5m7uku03/1B81Sob75Oq8Ks2KiSoCgi/8a2abb9ef9943e02ae18de24a9400717/QHuLn0w.jpg) 

I then decided to make some real wood pallets to go with the bricks, and the idea was done! They're really fun just to play around with.

[Final product](https://images.contentful.com/t0pm5m7uku03/EU1EPn86PYGQ0SC6Og8iI/ff7a8556bfe6eac693692bde2b72dbd7/DtVIOqT.jpg) 

On the business side of things, I got an LLC through [Sunbiz](http://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/) since I live in Florida, and made social media accounts. All for a pretty low startup cost.

Then, something kind of bad happened... months later I realized that my cement concoction wasn't good enough and all of my cinder blocks fell apart months after producing them.

I sent out an email to our first set of customers that had the low-quality cinder blocks, asking to replace them. I ended up having to completely revamp my process, and learn how cement creation really works.

Since then I've created my own cement mix where a cinder block that is 1.33"" x .66"" .66"" can be stood on by a 260lb man and not break.

### Attracting new customers and growing.

The fact that it's such a novel thing meant that I got a lot of free marketing. We got featured on [Uncrate](https://uncrate.com/mini-materials-ultimate-kit/), [the Awesomer](https://theawesomer.com/mini-cinder-blocks-and-mortar/358829/), and [Laughing Squid](https://laughingsquid.com/mini-materials-a-line-of-miniature-construction-materials-made-from-real-wood-cement-and-brick/) right off the bat.

From Day 1, I have been super active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/minimaterials). Through posting every day, interaction with fans, and paying for a few shoutouts, we've grown to 45k followers in 2 years. Here's a typical week on Instagram:

- Monday: I post something interesting I built with Mini Materials.
- Tuesday: I usually post a customer's build.
- Wednesday: Creative content.
- Thurs: #Throwbackthursday - I post an old video we have done.
- Friday, Saturday & Sunday: More creative content, especially videos.

What really works for the creative content? I've found that making miniatures out of our products in the style of ""tasty"" videos with fast cuts while keeping them under a minute to be the most engaging to our audience. We would also do giveaways.

In the beginning, Instagram and Facebook videos were my main source of growth. A lot of videos went semi-viral and brought in new fans and customers. Usually, once something goes viral you get picked up on some gadget sites or something like that and things kind of blow up.

If you're using Shopify, I also recommend collecting emails with [the Spin-a-Sale app](https://apps.shopify.com/spin-a-sale). I collect 50 emails a day compared to 3-4 before.

Growing the business meant bringing in a partner. This wasn't some kind of drop shipping thing where I could control everything from my computer. I was physically creating everything that went out the door.

I ended up bringing on one of my best friends who embodied a lot of talents that were the opposite of mine. I'm a creator and designer, while he's a numbers guy and great at getting shit done.

I cannot stress how much bringing in a partner has boosted this business. Not only are you able to get shit off your chest to your partner, but you can spend more time on your strengths.

Only recently have I delved into using Google Ads and remarketing. 

### If I could go back would I do anything differently?

I 100% would have tried harder to capture more emails and send more email newsletters. It was forever before I even had an email popup. Sometimes I'd go weeks without sending anything out.

I also would have started paying for advertising sooner. I paid for a lot of advertising last Black Friday, and it paid off wonderfully. I bought an editorial ad on [Uncrate](https://uncrate.com/) right before Thanksgiving that doubled returns three days after posting. I'm still seeing residual sales to this day from it.

### Some things I've learned.

1. __Capture emails.__ Email newsletters are my largest revenue generator so the more emails I have the better. I use a wheel spin app on my homepage that works great.

2. __Interact with your customers.__ Whether it's through social media, email, or phone - they're excited about your product so you need to act excited even if it you've just spent all night designing new product pages and never want to look at another miniature cinder block again.

3. __Set up remarketing.__ It's pretty easy to do yourself through google adwords and worst case scenario you'll make your money back.

4. __Don't be afraid to spend money.__ I think the main reason I didn't pay for advertising sooner was that I was afraid that I'd spend a lot of money and not see a return. Do your due diligence and you'll be fine. It'll pay off more often than not.

5. __Create awesome content.__ This one's the hardest. Bob Ross didn't make any money with his TV show. He got people excited about painting so that he could sell painting supplies. Think about that when you create any content to sell your product.

### Plans for the future.

__Short-term goals:__ 

I'm in the process of culling our products from roughly 50 to 20 to get our warehouse processes more efficient. We bought a pad printer and are going to invest heavily in creating custom construction promotional gear. This is an untapped market, and since it's mainly a bulk purchase for a lot of businesses - there's a lot of revenue to be had.

__Long-term goals:__

We'd like to create 1-2 products per year on par with the quality and popularity of our pallet of miniature cinder blocks. This will be tough and will require us to go through a development process unlike anything we've done before. We've got a few surprises in the pipeline.

### Tools I use.

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story): Easy to use. Pretty to look at. No real issues so far.

[Shippo](https://goshippo.com/): Shipping app that connects to Shopify. Can't complain - honestly haven't looked at others very much.

Etsy: Since our products are handmade, we sell on Etsy. It actually has cheaper processing fees than Shopify! This adds about 1-3 sales per day extra for us. Hopefully it'll one day integrate with Shopify so we don't have to manually put the orders in.

Amazon: We ship a few products to Amazon for them to fulfill. Especially killer around the holidays. I feel like if you have a product for sale on Amazon that is Prime, you're going to sell at least 1000 of it in November and December.

MailChimp: Easy to use and looks pretty. Also integrates very well with Shopify.

[Product Upsell App](https://apps.shopify.com/product-upsell): Use this to throw $10 add-ons when people hit the add to cart button. It works surprisingly well. I need to take advantage of this more.

[Spin-a-sale Interactive Pop Up](https://apps.shopify.com/spin-a-sale): This is the most killer Shopify app I've ever used. We almost 10x'd our daily email captures with this compared to a standard pop-up.

[Taxjar](https://www.taxjar.com/shopify-sales-tax/): Nice Shopify app for auto-filing tax stuff.

### Books, podcasts, and online resources I recommend.

I know people talk shit about it a lot, but [r/entrepreneur](https://reddit.com/r/entrepreneur) has been a pretty big help. Granted, I browsed and contributed a lot more when I was first starting out three years ago. 

Along with that, the [Gimlet podcast ""Startup""](https://www.gimletmedia.com/startup/) was somewhat helpful.

I loved being on the [Product Startup Podcast with Filip Valica](https://theproductstartup.com/). It was the first podcast we were on and it was great to actually sitt down and talk about everything for an hour. It brought some really cool ideas out of the woodwork. It was a great experience.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs out there.

Nothing happens overnight. It's coming up on year three of Mini Materials and I'm only now feeling like things are going really well.

If you're going to do something, you have to be in it for the long haul. Long-term commitment to a solid idea will usually yield results.

Make sure to have a good work/life balance. Don't neglect family or friends because you don't know how to work efficiently.

873,9afnth,False,Young Entrepreneur,138,From a naive 19 YO: Here's how I stopped wanting and started doing.,Entrepreneur,"Hi everyone a quick backstory to give a little context:
I've been a lurker on this sub for a long time, mainly because I thought it would give me the answers to how to start my own project or venture. (Un)Fortunately, it didn't. However, after a long time I finally realised a common theme. Almost every person posting here about their successful or unsuccessful businesses, projects, ventures, etc. didn't start with an over ambitious vision to start the next Facebook, Uber or Xero, which is what I was wasting an enormous time every. single. day. dreaming about. So I wanted to write this post for the people like myself, to try and give something back in the form of motivation to the community that was a significant motivating factor for me. Disclaimer: rambling ahead.

So let's cut back to the beginning of June. Where I was standing in a beach carpark after a surf, complaining to my best mate about the insane cost of surfing equipment. Fast forward a couple days, and he calls me and asks me what I think about starting a business that aims at undercutting the exorbitant prices of major surf brands. Given that we are both relatively well informed about the niche, culture and fashion surrounding surf equipment and apparel, we thought that this was our best chance at starting a venture in a field where we have a passion as well as a void that we believe can be filled.


Following the phone call, we sat on the concept for a while. What should we name it? Can we compete with other local brands? How do we differentiate it? Who's our target market? Where and how do we source our products? You get it, all the basic considerations. Now bear with me when I say this (I know the point of this post is to explain the **doing**), but we spent close to the next month just brainstorming and consolidating ideas about the basic business plan and model.

Cut again to the beginning of July and we have mapped out enough of a business plan to understand how to mobilise our vision. The key details included the name, logo, business 'aesthetic', our product line at launch and plan for future releases and our strategy for gaining a following. It is important to note that being two, average 19 year olds means that we had a very small amount of capital to kickstart and so we looked to save costs in every area possible. 

Over the next month, we spent countless hours hustling with suppliers to purchase our 'launch' product line at the best price possible, established a Shopify store and website hosting, prepared our social network accounts, registered the partnership and business name legally, gathered every social connection we could to promote our brand either for free or for a small gift and took as much advice from any information source available to us. We made a major brand decision to incorporate an environmentally sustainable aspect into our brand image and marketing plan; which was to donate 10% of our profits to a nominated whale conservation strategy. Once we finalised all of these decisions, we set a launch date. August 24 2018.

Now obviously there is a million and one decisions and lessons I could talk about between that already lengthy explanation of why I'm here. But the truth is, we launched our business 2 days ago; we've learned something, but it's only a fraction of what any long term business owner or entrepreneur would have in terms of knowledge - so I'm not here to act the oracle of wisdom on entrepreneurial experience or knowledge because quite frankly, I know nothing. 

The purpose of that outline was to show any wantrepreneur like myself that the process of starting isn't quick; even to start a project that is as small and simple in scale as ours is.

Unless you are an incredibly unlikely outlier, you won't wake up in the morning with a revolutionary idea. And that's fine. Imagine the pressure of actually waking up with a revolutionary idea; I've not got the life skills or hard skills to act on it and so it would remain just that. A revolutionary **idea**.

But if you lurk this sub and wish you could start your own real side project; then do it. Figure out what frustrates you or other people. What's disproportionately expensive in your life? What simple appliance drives you up the wall because of its poor design? What small thing makes your life so much easier that other people have never heard of?

If you can work that out, congratulations; that's the arguably the hardest part done. But you still only have an idea, and that's where I got stuck hundreds of times over before I launched this project. 

Write it down and then gradually expand it out. While you should be 'doing', you shouldn't be rushing. Brainstorm names, logos, concepts for products then save them all and ask for feedback from anyone who can give relevant ideas to you and continue to develop them. What I realised is that those processes **are the doing**, the selling products, the flashy website, the posting on instagram and facebook; that's **the outcome**. 

And there's no rush to the doing, as long as you are doing something. If all you do is write down two potential business names and draw out a logo in one day, great. I'm sure that most people would consider that as unproductive or even a failure, but if you're working either alone or as a partnership, it will add up. I'm sure we could have launched our business in 3 or 4 weeks if we had have committed every waking moment to doing so; but the fact is that as inexperienced, impatient newbies, doing so would have been overwhelming and killed motivation. Instead, the aggregate of doing the small tasks spread out across a wide time-span, eventually produced an outcome that we were happy with.

As we compiled more and more of the small operational functions together, the bigger picture of the outcomes became more clear - and as a result, we slowly began to work more and more to make the outcomes a reality. Think of it as a cycle or equation whereby your motivation is actually directly proportional to the product or sum of the small tasks you perform.

And has that approach been successful for our business?

Well given that we launched two days ago, who knows. 

Have we met the sales, reach and timeline goals that we established ourselves for our launch? Then yes, we exceeded them.

Have we succeeded in our original vision to compete in the surfing industry and compete with multinational brands? Absolutely not even close.

Will the business survive and flourish? Well we'll do everything in our power to make that happen, but if it turns out to fail; we'll take the things we learned that I've tried to share here and apply them to the next thing.

Anyway, that's enough rambling from me for a post that may not ever even get read by more than 5 people, but I hope that someone in the same headspace as I was can find some useful thought in all of that.

&nbsp;

TL;DR: Just act on something. Even the smallest of progress steps will eventually amount to an outcome that will make you want to keep pushing and working.

And like I said, we are only 10% less naive than we were 3 months ago (if that), so we really know nothing about anything; only how we got to this stage. So any feedback or questions regarding anything to do with our brand is warmly welcomed and appreciated.

255,6vqxrn,False,,80,"Here's a list of 14 free keyword research tools you can use for SEO, market research, content topic ideas, etc.",Entrepreneur,"Hey guys!

One of my clients put together a blog post about free keyword research tools a while back.

I keep chickening out of sharing it here, but I feel like this community really would find a lot of value in it. It's been quite helpful for me, personally. 

I suggested a couple of the tools that made it onto the list, including the SEOBook keyword tool and KeywordShitter. I also compiled a research document for him detailing what kind of content was already out there on this topic, for ""skyscraper technique"" purposes.

#[Here's a link to the blog post, but don't worry, you'll find a TL;DR and full list of the tools below.](http://www.finetunedigital.com/ultimate-list-of-free-keyword-research-tools/)

The tools are divided into three broad categories:

- Keyword research tools that give data about things like search volume. (E.g. the SEOBook Keyword Research Tool.)

- Longtail keyword tools that don't give said data, and which generally draw from Google Suggest. (E.g. KeywordShitter)

- Tools that are a little different and unique, but still relevant for this list. (E.g. Answer the Public.)

Some of these are 100% free. Others are paid but affordable, and/or have a free trial you can use.

In the blog post, he's also compared the search volume and other data from these free tools with info for the same keywords generated by SEMRush, which his agency uses. For the most part, there weren't any substantial discrepancies.

#Here's the full list of tools.

**Tools that give detailed info (search volume, etc.)**

- [**SEOBook.**](http://tools.seobook.com/keyword-tools/seobook/). I stumbled across this guy's blog one day, and it's a fascinating read. He's quite critical of Google, and not exactly optimistic about the future of SEO. I recommend checking it out. I binge read all his content one evening, and that's pretty rare for me. The keyword tool is free, with a free account.

- **[Serps.com Keyword Tool.](https://serps.com/tools/keyword-research/)** This is another good one. It's a free trial for a paid tool, but iirc, it's quite affordable if you decide on a paid subscription.

- **[KW Finder.](https://kwfinder.com/)** This is another affordable paid tool with a free subscription. Charlie actually uses this one regularly at Finetune Digital. I do too, and I'd recommend it.

- **[SEMRush Free Trial.](https://www.semrush.com/partner/follow.html)** This link takes you to a free 14 day trial of SEMRush. (This is another tool Charlie uses regularly.) It's only a 2-week trial, but worth considering if you're laying the groundwork for a new site, and you can get what you need within that time frame.

- **[Moz Keyword Explorer Free Trial.](https://moz.com/products/pro/keyword-explorer)** To be quite frank, I haven't heard much that's positive about Moz from SEO pros. It's not really considered the best SaaS in its class, but you can do up to three searches a day (iirc) using their Keyword Explorer. (Side note: Moz is the very portrait of content marketing done right. If you're implementing content marketing strategies yourself, take a look ""between the lines"" at what they're doing.)

**Tools that generate longtail keywords, usually by way of Google Suggest.**

- **[KeywordShitter.](http://keywordshitter.com/)** This was created by a Redditor, and I love its simplicity. Don't let the minimalistic interface fool you -- it's actually quite a useful tool. I've used it in the past to come up with blog post ideas for clients in industries where, once you've covered the basics, it's surprisingly challenging to come up with content topics. (Notably a moving company.)

- **[Keyword.io.](http://www.keyword.io/)** This works similarly to KeywordShitter. I've also found it useful for finding fresh content ideas based on longtail searches.

- **[UberSuggest](https://ubersuggest.io/).** Recently acquired by Neil Patel, this one generates a nifty word cloud, in addition to a beefy list of longtail keywords.

- **[KeywordTool.io.](http://www.keywordtool.io/)** Similar to both of the above, also useful.

- **[WordstreamKeyword Tool.](http://www.wordstream.com/keywords)** You can search for free, but it fuzzes out the search volume and other data unless you've got a paid subscription.

- **[Longtail Pro 7 Day Trial \($1\)](https://longtailpro.com/)**. It's not free per se, but at $1, it may as well be. I've never used it myself, but I've heard good things about it.

**Tools that do something a little bit different.**

These tools are great for market research. I use Answer the People on a regular basis.

- **[Answer the Public.](http://www.answerthepublic.com/)** This is actually a pretty badass tool for finding common questions your target audience is asking. It focuses on two types of searches: those in question form (who, what, why, etc.), and those beginning with prepositions (on, around, without, etc.). It generates a cool visual chart, as well as a big list of common searches.

- **[Bulk Keyword Generator.](http://www.imforsmb.com/tools/bulk-keyword-generator/)** This one is unique in that it focuses specifically on keyword research for local service businesses. (Think plumbers, landscapers, etc.)

- **[FAQ Fox.](https://www.webpagefx.com/seo-tools/faqfox/)** This one scrapes Reddit and Quora for questions and discussions.

So, that's the list. Again, I figured I'd share it here because it seems like the kind of thing people here would be into. My apologies to the mods and the community if this is considered self-promotion, as I know the guy that wrote this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6vqxrn/heres_a_list_of_14_free_keyword_research_tools/,793,[deleted] ,2017-08-24 13:44:57
2,eytom3,False,Case Study,461,The marketing genius of Lil Nas X,Entrepreneur,"**TLDR -** Lil Nas X was a college dropout sleeping on his sister’s couch with a negative balance in his Wells Fargo account.  5 months later he'd broke Mariah Carey’s record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1.   This post tells the story:

**Part 1**

Most musicians think like failed startups. Too much time creating. Not enough time promoting.

When Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue music he didn’t create much. Instead, he lived on Twitter, made online friends and got popular posting memes. His account quickly grew to 30,000 followers.

The plan was to use his following to promote his music. But it wasn’t that simple. In Nas’s words:

*I’d post a funny meme and get 2,000 retweets. Then I’d post a song and get 10.*

So Nas got creative. He stopped tweeting SoundCloud links and started writing a song he could promote through memes. In his words:

*It had to be short. It had to be catchy. It had to be funny.*

*Old Town Road* was the result. And on the 3rd December 2018 Nas paired it with a video of a dancing cowboy and shared it with his followers ([see tweet](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1224708341064224773)).

The video went viral. So Nas stuck to this formula: Short viral videos. To the tune of Old Town Road. With the full song linked underneath.

As an unknown artist, it was the only way he could get the word out. And the views started piling up:

**Part 2**

Inspired by *Old Town Road's* success on Twitter it spread to TikTok, and then onto Billboard’s country music charts. Yes, the **country music charts**. Nas listed it as a country song aware that the charts were less competitive.

One week later Billboard removed it for “not being a country song”. Ironically, this was the best thing that could have possibly happened. Billboard's decision turned *Old Town Road* into a national talking point and two weeks later it was No. 1.

Nas wasn't stopping. He began lining up remixes with some of music's biggest stars.

Billboard has a loophole whereby remix plays count towards the original song's chart placement. With every remix millions more streams poured in, and *Old Town Road* became impossible to budge.

17 weeks later he'd broke Mariah Carey’s record for the most consecutive weeks at No. 1.

It’s easy to forget quite what an extraordinary achievement this is. Five months earlier, Nas was a college dropout sleeping on his sister’s couch with a negative balance in his Wells Fargo account.

**Part 3**

On my first day researching Old Town Road I read a quote from Nas:

*A lot of people like to say “a kid accidentally got lucky”. No. This was no accident.*

The more I learned about Nas the more I believed him.

A key moment in *Old Town Road's* rise was a video of a man standing on a galloping horse going viral on Twitter. The audio was set to *Old Town Road*. Different versions of the video were viewed millions of times.

I wanted to know how the video spread, so I did some digging and found it first posted on the 24th December: ([see tweet](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1224708356679577601))

I asked the Twitter user why he made the video. He told me that Nas sent it to him. But it doesn't end there.

Aware that people watching the video would search for the full song, Nas changed the song title on YouTube and SoundCloud to include the lyric from the viral video — “I got the horses in the back”.

He also posted on the [NameThatSong](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/acakf0/i_got_the_horses_in_the_back/) subreddit which ranked on Google. Now, anyone searching from the video had an easy route to the song.

Things didn’t happen *to Nas*. Things happened *because of Nas*

Virality is not mystical. The story of *Old Town Road* is not magical.

Look behind the curtain: Nas is sitting in his underpants, on his sister's couch, iPhone in hand, making the whole thing happen.

No one knew him. No one wanted to check out his song. No one promoted anything for him.

He made friends, made them laugh, and built an audience. Then he packaged his song in a way that fit into their life. The rest is history.

A final quote from Nas to end:

*u can literally scroll down my account and see my promoting this fuckin song for months. each accomplishment it gets just makes all this shit feel so worth it. i can’t stop taking about it.*

718,4eg4c1,False,,59,The best marketers apply the scientific method to prioritize & test different marketing strategies. Here's an in-depth (7000 words) guide with many real-life examples on how you can do the same thing.,Entrepreneur,"Every week, there are many high-quality marketing guides published on the internet and in this subreddit. This is a good thing.

However, I see many beginner entrepreneurs blindly implement these ""marketing tactics"" and guides without a *systematic* or *scientific approach*.

Beginners who:

* Blindly change their website button to red because some article said so.

* Blindly try marketing with Snapchat because it’s the latest craze.

* Blindly start guest posting because every marketing blog says so.

**Basically, beginners who are blindly implementing marketing tactics and hoping it’ll work.**

[\[IMGUR Link: Blind marketing\]](http://imgur.com/nTJzHks)

And that needs to stop. Stop relying on luck and praying something will work.

Instead, you need to have a marketing framework so you can predict which marketing tactics will work for your specific business and circumstances.

I’m not saying not to read marketing guides anymore. In fact, you should - it’s a great way to stay up-to-date on the latest marketing techniques. But the point is this:

**You need to have a systematic and scientific approach for your own marketing strategy.**

[\[IMGUR Link: Marketing scientists\]](http://imgur.com/9THaCDd)

This isn't just me talking. There's a reason why many of the top companies (e.g. Hubspot, Uber, Dropbox, SumoMe, Facebook, AirBnb, etc...) all approach marketing with a scientific marketing framework.

The best thing? You don't need to have a science/engineering background, it's a relatively simple framework you can learn with enough practice.

So what is the **scientific method?** 

It’s a way to solve a question or problem by making observations and doing experiments. The whole concept is to be able to *predict* and *repeat* your experiments. 

By applying a scientific/systematic approach to marketing, you can predict which marketing tactics will be the most effective by running small tests to gather data. 

With that information, you can make tweaks to scale and improve your marketing experiments.

Here’s a summary of how it works and how you can begin approaching marketing with a different mindset:

[\[IMGUR Link: Scientific Process\]](http://imgur.com/I5li0HV)

**Step 1:** Start compiling all the great marketing guides you read into an “ideas backlog” spreadsheet (you can download it at the end)

[\[IMGUR Link: Ideas Backlog Spreadsheet\]](http://imgur.com/pmR4uSg)

**Step 2:** Create and define your goal (based on the AARRR funnel) by working backwards from your end vision. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, assignable, realistic, and time related.

[\[IMGUR Link: SMART Goal\]](http://imgur.com/RHyJPgS)

**Step 3:** Prioritize your marketing tactics based on how it fits in with the goal, and score them based on the: probability of success, resources required, and impact. 

[\[IMGUR Link: Priority Matrix\]](http://imgur.com/STDttV1)

**Step 4:** Validate the assumptions you used to prioritize the marketing tactics by running small 80/20 marketing experiments. Do this by breaking down your goal into week-to-week growth targets so you can measure your progress.

**Step 5:** Create an experimental plan by documenting how you will be executing the marketing strategy.

[\[IMGUR Link: Weekly Growth\]](http://imgur.com/wKs4mk7)

**Step 6:** Execute your marketing plan and keep detailed notes as you progress through the experiment.

[\[IMGUR Link: Execution Strategy\]](http://imgur.com/ZkKt2sH)

**Step 7:** Analyze your results by asking “why” the experiment was a success or failure. Do research to find out “why” so you can make tweaks. If the experiment was a failure and it’s too difficult to fix, kill the experiment and move on.

**Step 8:** If the experiment was a success, apply your lessons learned and scale your experiment in iterative steps. Leverage technology or your playbook to 10x your results. Continue to focus on the marketing channel until it’s no longer effective.

[\[IMGUR Link: iterative steps\]](http://i.imgur.com/funFflW.jpg)

**Step 9:** Rinse and repeat!

And that's how you approach marketing with a scientific framework.

**Stop copy/pasting marketing guides you’ve read about without any sort of framework (including this one!).** 

If you're interested in this topic and want a deeper understanding: 
[**I wrote a 7000 word guide that expands on this subject.**](http://sumome.com/stories/marketing-strategy?src=reddit-sumome.com/stories/marketing-strategy) 

In it, I provide examples based on my own marketing experiments and also based on the professionals like Mint.com and Dropbox. I also include all the tools/spreadsheets so you can begin to do the same thing.

Remember, all the great marketing guides you read should be used as inspiration, and not as a copy/paste playbook for your business. Each business is different, so it’s up to you to take the learnings from those guides, and customize it to fit your own business by using a systematic/scientific approach.

Here is my interview with Travis Peterson, the founder of Joker Greeting, a prank greeting card inspired by a joke with his brother.

Travis has an awesome story. He is grossing $30k/month and running the business mostly by himself:

### Background.

I am Travis Peterson and started [Joker Greeting](https://www.jokergreeting.com/). We make original prank gifts and prank non-gifts for friends, family, and offices. It all started with a non-stop musical greeting card that looped for 3-6 hours.

For 2.5 years, I have been working on making musical greeting cards interesting again. To be clear, I never intended on making a greeting card or joke company, but we launched on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jokergreeting/the-best-prank-birthday-card-ever) and raised $92,073 in 30 days with no marketing, so I decided to give it a shot.

464,7hepb3,False,,125,*Depressed? Unhappy? Not Getting anywhere with your startup? GTFIH*,Entrepreneur,"**MOST OF YOU ARE UNHAPPY**

Many of you here on this sub-reddit are depressed, angry, and bummed out. 
You watched ""The Social Network"" and got all excited to be your own boss but you're broke AF and instead of cruising in that brand new Maserati, you're cruising in your parents' basement. Your bank account has cobwebs growing and the last person who checked out your E-commerce page was your red-headed stepsister who had the hots or you.

&nbsp;

*But, But Euclides...*I signed up for that Forbes Conference, I bought the latest Tai Lopez program, and I'm following all those #inspired IG motivational quote pages, and am even part of a dozen ""brainstorming entrepreneurship groups! I've even put up a ""CEO"" on my LinkedIn. 

&nbsp;

**1. STOP MASTURBATING**  

Here's my advice to you. **Stop masturbating and be honest to yourself. You don't want to start a business, you want to dream about starting one.** Entrepreneurship is HARD and is a LOT OF WORK. But it's not impossible. The reason most people aren't successful is not because they have ""bad luck"" but it's because they don't do anything. Going to conferences, scrolling memes, and making visions boards all day is NOT work. These things might be supplemental to the work you do, but it's NOT ACTUAL WORK. Too many people I see spend almost ALL THEIR TIME doing supplemental masturbation, than actually doing ANYTHING to advance their business. 

&nbsp;

**2. IDEAS ARE CHEAP, EXECUTION IS KING**

So now that you've understood that, here's the kicker. Want to know in one sentence what successful founders do? **They are active and EXECUTE.** They don't passively consume information and wait for life to ""happen to them."" They don't give a shit about the flashing of their iPhones or for that little (1) symbol on another tab of their Chrome browser. Nor do they give a shit about making it to every meet-up event or downloading every startup podcast, or doing $100 webinars with another YouTube ad star promising how they'll teach them how to make it big selling things on Amazon.

&nbsp;

What those obsessed with peak-productivity do focus on is execution. And they focus on it more than most people think humanly possible. Chris Sacca wrote a great medium post about the Founder of UBER, Travis Kalanick’s work ethic. In it he says:

**""He doesn’t sleep. He doesn’t lose focus. He will even forget to eat. He executes again and again, inspiring those around him to have the same passion for the end game as he does.""**

&nbsp;

This unrelenting desire to be biased towards execution means that time is spent on getting out there and getting sh*t done rather sitting in the confines of your home in front of your smartphone scrolling at success memes or re-reading success guides all day.  

Stop just reading them. **Apply them.**  
*That sales call you have been putting off?* **Do it now.**  
*That conversation you wanted to have with your boss about a raise?* **Stop putting it off, call him now.**  
*That blog you were going to start?* **Do it now.**  
*That podcast you were going to start?* **Start it now.**

**You should be so obsessed with action that you cannot think about anything else. Get so consumed with action that you forget to check your phone.** 

&nbsp;

**3. FAIL QUICKLY, SUCCEED QUICKER**

Take it from me, you'll learn more from screwing up in real life than you'll learn from hypothetical situations that someone posted on Reddit. That's how it goes. The quicker you fail, the quicker you can change to succeed, and the quicker you will succeed. This is how you get better. If you never execute, how will you know if your idea is good or not? 

*This the way of man.* Leave the endless planning and thinking to the dreamers. 5-Year plans might be the status quo in Soviet Russia, but we all know how well that actually ended up working out for them. 

**You must fall to rise. You must break to recreate. A sword must be forged in fire. Be the sword.**

Now, if you're still serious about starting a business, get off this Reddit, zip your pants back up, and stop texting that chick who is going to ghost your broke ass anyways, and f*cking execute. Your wallet will thank you for it, trust me.

&nbsp;

>  
>We won't be going forward with those mobile views. Wonder if you changed the designer on your side, who has a different aesthetic? Projects that we'll send in the future will mostly be focused around the web.

I know that kind of message too well.Kind of polite, but often carries long-term consequences under the hood.I thought that most probably, our collaboration will be slowly fading until we stop receiving new projects from them. That's harsh.

**Some backstory**

I run a web product design and development company.We had been working on these mobile apps with other product managers on the client's side.The feedback was always great. The PMs accepted every deliverable. All deliverables met all requirements, and everybody was happy.

And no, we didn't change the designer, it was the same person who made all the highly praised work before.

What happened, then?

I had given myself two days to analyze what went wrong before I replied.

Let's quickly unpack this message, I

a) expressed gratitude for the feedback

b) described the root of the issue

c) took full accountability for the situation

d) proposed what we can do better

e) offered non-billable iteration

The last point is crucial. If I provided a refund instead, that would put us in a position of questioning our expertise. Also, refunds are associated with conflicts or situations that break collaboration. Showing that we were willing to take the extra mile to make up for the setback is a whole different story.

Now, the surprising results.

I never got a reply.

But four days later I receive a spec for a new project! The following week, new tasks again. The workload almost doubled. Finally, we have been asked to design their new mobile(!) from scratch.

**Lessons**

a) Even though you may feel confused that the client accepted, then expressed disappointment, even though you did exactly what they asked for - take a step back, cold analyze, be empathetic.

b) Take accountability, be kind and transparent, understand their motivations

c) Propose a way to move forward

d) Don't judge results by whether someone replies to you. You can measure your impact based on the actions the other person takes.

97,fnihhi,False,Lessons Learned,231,I run a pavement maintenance company (Sealcoating) that I grew from a truck and myself to a 2.8 million in Revenue in 4~ years,Entrepreneur,"Things are slowing down a bit cause of the virus and I'm getting bored so I thought why not tell you guys about my business and any questions.

What do I do?

I sealcoat pavement, you sealcoat pavement to make it last longer, seal coating your pavement can save you tens of thousands of dollars in wear and tear, plus I think it makes your pavement look pretty and neat and presents a more professional look.

My story

I was a stupid kid, got involved in drugs. I ended up shooting someone over a stupid drug debt when I was 18 and spent 15 years in prison for it. The guy lived thankfully! Ironically about 2 years ago I sealcoated his driveway. I got out of prison when I was 33. I had no high school education or professional skills. I did however a really amazing family (I actually come from a good family and thank god for that) who helped me.

I got a job at a car dealership as they were the only people willing to hire a convicted felon. I worked that job for 2 years before starting my first construction business in 2006!

In 2008 I went bankrupt in the economic crash.

In 2009 I became a sales rep for a B2B services company and over the next 6 years I rose through the ranks to Regional Manager. Still hadn't even finished high school.

In 2015 my 4 year old son passed away, it broke me as a man. I quit my job and lived off my savings for about a year. During that time my wonderful wife got pregnant and I was going be raising another child and I wanted to have something to hand down one day so I did some googling and discovered sealcoating business.

In 2016 I opend up shop with a business partner who was experienced in the industry, he spent 6\~ weeks or so teaching me EVERYTHING there is to know about my business. He then promptly proceeded to stab me in the back and run off with my investment, truck, and equipment. I went to my dad and talked about just giving up.

My dad promptly told me he didn't raise no quitter, and he was going give me his truck and $10,000 and I was going get my ass back to work and create my company. I bought a bunch of used equipment and started knocking on doors.

My first year I worked 6 days a week from 7 till 6. I'd get up in the morning, get my truck and stuff ready and I'd drive around looking for driveways and knock on folks doors and try and get them to hire me. Having a sales background was everything.

As I gained a bit of money and paid my dad back I started advertising, and really creating a company.

6 months into the business I had so much work I officially formed my company, and made my first hire. This meant alot to me as I officially named my business after my son, its my way of bringing him back into my life.

I now have a receptionist/social media/jack of trades lady that works out of my house, a full time sales rep and crews doing jobs all across my state. But I still find time to knock on doors, and work right next to my guys.

I have converted to being focused more on commercial then residential (bigger sq footage, more money) but money talks and I'll do both.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/fnihhi/i_run_a_pavement_maintenance_company_sealcoating/,1172,Cool story 'bro' ,2020-03-23 11:34:47

I'll try to answer as many questions as I can.

Alright. Let's go. 

I just finished filing my taxes. I've officially made $204,598.67 in 2016. Of that, I had roughly $4,000 in expenses (hosting, some web development, a bit of writing, and a few hundred bucks on FB advertising to boost posts). 


Traffic Stats for 2016 (via Google Analytics):
3.4M Sessions
2.6M Users
6.5M Pageviews 


About My Site:
I started my site around 6-7 years ago based on something I was passionate about (which is key). It also helps that my audience is also passionate about the subject, and it's an area that people spend a decent amount of money.   

I'd consider my site to be a mix between a blog and a ""how to"" site that gives people helpful information. I do some product reviews and buyer's guides — but that's a very small portion of the site. Most everything is simply helpful content that answers people's questions on the subject.

However, I was thinking about doing more in-depth buyer's guides like the Wirecutter but my niche only had a few actual products that people spend a lot of time researching. And now that Amazon has cut its commissions I don't know how much my ROI would be.  

I try to provide actual value with everything I post and I try to put myself in my audience's shoes when I write. I also try to stay relatable so I keep everything casual. 

I'd consider my site to be an ""authority"" on my subject but there are a handful of multimillion dollar mega-authority sites/companies in my niche that I can never compete with. That's why I try to focus on giving advice from a ""real"" person. That's why my face and my ""story"" is always prominently displayed on the site. 

I don't post a very often. I average around 2 posts a month. Sometimes I do more... it depends on how busy I am. Luckily, most of my content is evergreen so something I wrote two years ago is still 90% accurate — this is super helpful because I've been able to build this site little by little over time without needing to post daily. I am currently going back through everything to update outdated information... hopefully this will help boost my rankings/traffic. 

I don't do much with SEO; just the basics. I don't do any real keyword research but I title my pages with phrases that I think my readers would search to find my article. I think a lot of people get so focused on SEO but I've always though ""what would I type into Google if I was looking for this article"" and then used that as my targeted keyword. Seems to work well enough so far.  

I had a lot of success with Pinterest in the past but I let that get away so my traffic is down a lot there. I should spend a lot more time in this area. 
FB gets me some traffic but my articles aren't really ""viral"" material and I don't want to spend much promoting my articles. Twitter is pretty much dead. 


Income:
Most of my income came from Amazon Associates. I made about $140k in 2016.
 
As many of you know, Amazon slashed their affiliate rates this March so I'm going to take a huge hit here. I'm guessing that I'm going to take a hit of $70k-$90k this year because of the commission change. Ohh well. Not much I can do about that.

Even with this rate change, I don't think I have a better option than Amazon (based on my niche). That's why I'm going to suck it up and stick with Amazon for the foreseeable future. 

Other smaller affiliate programs added up to a total of $50k. 

I made around $10K from Google Adsense. I haven't tried any other ad networks or tried selling directly to sellers. 

That's about it. I didn't sell any links, do any sponsored posts, or sell any ebooks/products. 

Questions?:

**Some Background...**

My name is Brock, and I run a style blog for shorter men called [The Modest Man](http://www.themodestman.com).

After over 3 years of running this blog, I finally passed the $10k/month milestone in September, and I wanted to share my progress with you.

Enjoy and feel free to ask questions!

**It took me 3+ years to hit $10k/month**

I started TMM in mid-2012, but my focus on it waxed and waned for the first couple of years. I really started to focus on it seriously about a year and a half ago.

My point is, I don't think it takes 3+ years to build a $10k/month blog. In fact, I'm working on a [new site](http://www.manshway.com/) now that I imagine will grow much more quickly (it's already at ~15k visits per month).

That said, building and monetizing a blog is a ton of work. It's not a get rich quick scenario - it's a long term play, especially if you don't have a budget to buy traffic or content at the beginning.

Okay, on to the numbers!

&nbsp;

Quarter | Revenue
---|---
2015 Q1 | $5,832
2015 Q2 | $7,905
2015 Q3 | $8,964
2015 Q4 | $13,866
2016 Q1 | $15,560
2016 Q2 | $21,607
2016 Q3 | $24,075

&nbsp;

After a solid Q2, I thought Q3 would be slow, then lead into a great Q4 (the holiday season). Revenue dipped in July, but then made an epic comeback in September.

&nbsp;

September 2016 | $$ 
---|---
Revenue | $10,328
Expenses | -$1,109
**Profit** | **$9,219**

&nbsp;

What's behind this increase? Traffic continues to climb slowly and organically, which means more ad revenue.

But the real drivers are affiliate revenue (Amazon Associates commissions more than doubled in Q3) and [sponsorships](http://www.themodestman.com/keep-your-shirt-tucked-in/).

I think for many bloggers - especially those outside the business and personal development space -  should focus on sponsorships as a monetization method, rather than online courses and ebooks.

For example, my e-guide sells about one copy per day, which comes out to about $800/month. but one sponsorship could be worth thousands.

But a good partnership with a relevant brand (i.e., one my audience really likes) could generate thousands of dollars ever few months, especially now that I can offer [videos too](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClbfoD1o7sV0VxErpxTCpyw). Lots of brands want videos these days, even though my channel is still very small.

I found that the key is to make sure all your content is valuable even without the sponsorship. If it can't stand alone, it's kind of just a commercial, and people see right through that.

**Affiliate Revenue**

I've still got a couple of pieces of content that are ranking really highly and driving lots of traffic to Amazon - simply because it's the best place to buy the products that these articles focus on (watches, socks, etc.).

For example, these two posts:

- [Watches for Small Wrists](http://www.themodestman.com/watches-for-small-wrists/)
- [Best No Show Socks](http://www.themodestman.com/best-no-show-socks/)

It's not too hard to get a high ranking post these days if your content is good. I've found that including multimedia - pics, videos, tables, infographics, etc. - seems to help. But that may be anecdotal because I always try to include that stuff (no one likes a solid wall of text).

339,h9yucp,False,,74,I researched 63 business opportunities the virus has created (but are continuing post-lockdown).,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone,

I posted here a while back about how I built and sold my trend-spotting tool, Exploding Topics, in 6 months. Since it was an acqui-hire, I’ve still been working on the tool and improving how it works.

(Partly thanks to the great feedback you guys gave me!)

And I spent all last week using it to figure out what the long-term impacts of COVID-19 might be.

Specifically what new business opportunities have been accelerated by the virus… and are outlasting the lockdowns.

There are some pretty surprising ones.

I made an awesome interactive version with charts and definitions of each trend that you can [check out here](https://explodingtopics.com/post-covid-trends).

963,6jeflp,False,,174,"My Maryland crab and crab cakes company now ships fresh perishable seafood nationwide and I think we can generate $20,000,000 in sales in less than three years.",Entrepreneur,"What is Cameron's Seafood Market? 
I'm Cameron, the name behind Maryland's largest brick and mortar takeout seafood company, which started in 1985. www.cameronsseafood.com. We specialize in Maryland Blue Crabs, crab cakes, spiced shrimp and fried and broiled fish platters. There are 14 stores which generate north of $2,000,000+ per year in gross sales and three food trucks which do ~$500,000 each. Total annual sales are $20,000,000+ and have been steady for years (this is a separate problem - you always want to be expanding). 

The food is absolutely delicious! I eat everything there! 

We have several franchises but they are poorly run. Their managers set different prices and offer some different products. Their owners are required to buy product from our wholesale division but I think it hurts our brand image. My uncle, the owner, isn't overseeing it properly. I plan to overhaul this next! 

Store Strategy
We have the lowest prices in Maryland and we cater to a customer looking for inexpensive seafood. We offer daily Facebook specials and weekly snail-mail coupons to further discount our product. We are the low-cost provider. We tried a high-end store in Bethesda, Maryland years ago that flopped. It was difficult keeping our prices uniform when 5-10 miles away we had discounted store prices. 

Now for some numbers. Our profit margins in stores range from 40% to 45%, which is low. We make our money on volume as crabs are typically a social food bought for 4 to 12 people on average. 

We have about 1,000,000 customers and get tremendous food traffic daily. If you ask anyone in the State of Maryland, they know Cameron's! 

Who Runs it? 
My family moved over from Iran in the late 70's. Both my father and Uncle started this business as a second form of income in 1985. My father invested and my uncles runs the day-to-day. They both work hard but have prejudices and some short-cited and old-school mentality. They care more about the profit and less about customer service. They don't have business systems set up. Things are sloppy. People steal more than in typical cash-businesses. My uncle also accepts food stamps, which borders a legal grey area each year the laws change. He knows that Maryland seafood is like drugs, not food...just eat some Blue crabs and you will be hooked for life! My uncle's son has worked there since he was a kid. He and I are really close (we rent a house together). In 2017 he and I got sick of how the business is operating so we decided to branch out and form a separate entity called Cameron's Seafood Online. 

We just Launched Nationwide delivery yesterday! It took us three months to figure out the online pricing model because we wanted to offer the lowest online price, but that price is almost double our store prices and explaining that to our ""low-end"" customer doesn't go over well. However, Maryland residents move out and need our crabs and our customers have family out of state who cannot get Maryland Crabs or crab cakes.

Fresh vs. Frozen deliveries nationwide
We started with 1-2 day delivery methods because we wanted to ship our seafood fresh. The plan is to launch a frozen option for less price, since our shipping costs dramatically get reduced. But that is phase II. 

Shipping
I could write separate posts on how and why we chose FedEx over UPS (and others) but I'll keep this simple. Logistical companies charge you based on what's higher - the package weight or the dimensional weight of the exterior of your box (L*W*H/139). The second determination is the sending and receiving zip codes. Since we are based on the East Coast this creates three shipping zones. Local, Regional, and National. Ground shipping (ideal) hits local and regional and this is where we plan to heavily market. National shipping requires Overnight or 2-day delivery methods. 

Ground shipping costs range from $17 to $24 depending on the permutation of the product the customer chooses. There is fee ~$3.45 fee for delivering to residential addresses. Since we cannot ship fresh seafood over 48 hours, the ground network is limited to 29 states from our Maryland HQ. 

Styrofoam Containers and the Corrugated box
We tried many forms of boxes and ultimately chose the standard Styrofoam containers inside a corrugated box. The solution works, it's not environmentally friendly however. There are some green solutions (Temperpack) which are a few dollars more per package. We chose four containers (foam + box) ultimately, that range from $5.10 to $7.87. 

Cooling
Gel Packs vs dry ice? The short answer is: both. You need dry ice for shipping frozen products. Dry ice cools to -109F, which will freeze anything in transit. Gel packs take 72 hours to freeze and you need a ratio of 1:3 (coolant to product) for non-summer months and to non-southern locations( the ratio increases to 2:3 for hotter areas). We had to send our product to labs to test for crazy shipping environments - mishandling, turning the boxes upside down, shaking them, humidity, and shipping delays. FedEx will do this free, UPS charges $800 per box being tested. Some packaging companies will test it free in hopes you do business with them. Gel packs can cost $0.40 per pound while dry ice can cost $1.20 per lb (we bought a dry ice machine and get Co2 delivered so our costs will drop to ~$0.75. Ultimately a combination of mostly gel packs with a little dry ice seems to work best. 

Website
My wife is amazing, in many ways. She designed the site from ground up using WooCommerce. We tried Shopify and the other 5 big ones but ultimately with our dynamic shipping requirements we found Woo to be the winner. Our site is built off WordPress and and a Divi extension. Costs to build were low at $2,000 but I think we could have charged someone $10,000 or more for the work we have done. www.cameronsseafood.com. We used the same URL links as our old, crappy, website which received 220,000 annual hits so we are retaining that SEO.

Numbers
Our online profit margins range from 30% to 50% since we can leverage the store infrastructure at no cost! We figured out flat-rate shipping options with a free-ground shipping model for orders over $200. http://www.cameronsseafood.com/shipping/. We lose from $20 to $50 depending on the order, even though we bake most of the shipping costs into our products. The psychology free shipping and higher product costs is better than selling the product at cost + margin and passing the shipping fees to the customer. We ultimately are catering to the 1-2 day ground network customers in the 29 states since they are eligible for free shipping. 

Marketing
My cousin is my partner. He is in the field daily fulfilling the orders while I'm better at creating marketing, business systems, and development. Basically he does stuff in the stores and I run stuff outside the store. I'm more experienced at running businesses. It works. 

We plan to utilize:

-Press releases

-printed posters in each store and truck location

- Referral cards - with each purchase (over 10,000 purchases per day) whereby when you use someone's referral link you get $10 and they get $10 off. 

-PPC and Facebook adds (works for our current store locations) in the beginning with a $20,000 budget. I'm exploring some cost-per-action tools so I'll have to determine the value of one customer to set my ""cost.""

-Landing Pages: I plan to create landing pages for each product, which links to the store. 

-Blog: I plan to utilize a blob for a long-term strategy.

-Mail-Chimp: targeted adds to our existing 1,000,000 customers.

-Twitter, Linkedin Groups, Instagram influences (costs a lot) and our instatgram. 

-SEO (takes a while) but this process is underway. 

-Giveaways - weekly contests of posting your best crab pictures will win crab cakes (we choose top 3 winners) and brand it on Instagram.

- Magazine adds

Competitors are crabplace.com, ordercrabs.com, ilovecrabs.com, lacrawfish.com

Questions
What marketing channels am I missing? How can I create a grand opening splash? Money isn't an issue, exposure to the 29 states in the US where we can offer ground shipping is.

How do you think I can capitalize on my 1,000,000 existing customers and their friends given they will not pay our online prices?

I will be working hard over the next year to build up the online brand. Appreciate any input.

81,5mzpz6,False,,610,"In 2016 I made $316,154.15 via the Amazon Affiliate program. AMA!",Entrepreneur,"Obligatory proofs: http://imgur.com/vPH7zZ0

**First** - I'm not selling or promoting anything. No backlinks to blogs here. In my day to day life I don't get an opportunity to network with people in this space or adjacent industries and people I know don't really have a clue what it is I do so I simply enjoy sharing my insights for the sake of contribution and occasionally discovering opportunities from others I didn't know about.

**Second** - the net profit on this amount is approximately $216k. The costs were spread out over 2015 and 2016 and were approximately $100k altogether +/- 5k.

There are tons of guides on the internet and a bunch of case studies of varying success/investment at /r/juststart that are mostly related to Amazon affiliate marketing specifically.

**A little bit about who I am and background:**

I'm 30, married, no kids. I dropped out of college the end of my 3rd year as a music major (I played Trumpet/Euphonium). 

I came from a fairly impoverished family whom I am mostly all but completely disconnected to now. I grew up in an old beat up trailer on a piece of property that was literally used as a garbage dump that my parents got for around $10k and between the two of them made around 15k a year until they got divorced and my dad went to prison for manslaughter.

I moved out when I graduated HS at 17 and never went back with about $100 in my pocket.

I worked 50-60 hours per week (80 during the summer) after I turned 18 doing night shifts, weekend shifts, and shift I could get between and after classes to have enough money to support myself and still failed miserably, it was barely enough money to keep my car running and keep my health together (I was very unhealthy and overweight, had a lot of health problems around 18-19 and no health insurance). I did adult foster care in group homes, where there were usually six extremely MR adults (can't talk, wear adult diapers, basically can't function at all except pace around making noises and eat) for around $5.50 an hour. Had to bathe them, give them their meds, feed them, ect. The hardest part was they had to be taken out into the world on ""outings"" to eat and stuff. I think the most embarassing thing that ever happened was taking them to Pizza hut and one of them jumped out of the booth into a families booth and just started shoving all their pizza down his throat furiously and ripping all the food off their plates in literally a 5 second time frame.

I had a huge interests in computers, somehow by the grace of the old gods and the new my parents bought us a computer when I was around 9 with Windows 95 on it and since I really had nothing else to do as a kid I spent literally every waking moment learning how every nook and cranny of the computer worked until we got dial up internet around 3 years later. 

The internet changed my world really, it was my connection to the outside world and let me see that a world did actually exist out of that trailer in the woods and there was a wealth of information.

I taught myself HTML and created my first websites hosted on Geocities and Angelfire when I was around 12 and also pirated my first copy of Dreamweaver even though it took 3 days to download on 56k.

From 2000-2010 I built several forums and websites for gaming communities I was a part of, namely Half-Life/Counter-Strike, Everquest, and Lord of the Rings Online. I never once thought of my skills as ""monetizable"" and figured pretty much anyone could do that stuff.

Sometime in 2008 I started getting serious about getting healthy, I was an insane 330 lbs, and got down to about 190 after getting really involved with the community at bodybuilding.com. It was there I stumbled about a thread about SEO and Affiliate Marketing some time in late 2010 which spurred basically a 7 year marathon of content absorption around the topics and everything related to them.

It took four years and probably over 100 domains and iterations to create a website I could actually consider a success.

I worked as an IT guy at a bank and a chemical company after I dropped out of college. I managed to get an entry level helpdesk job for $13 an hour and worked my way up to $21 after 7 years and several job changes I used to leverage little promotions and raises. 

At the end of those 7 years I moved to Washington DC area and did the same job for $38/hr at a bank.

After 3 years of doing that job I quit at the end of Q1 2016 to focus on building profitable websites and explore new business opportunities.

I'm not an especially materialistic person and I don't really feel like I need much more than I have now at 30. Happily married, no kids, no debt other than a mortgage that is about 30% paid off (about 250k left on it). My wife and I bought a house about an hour out of the city and she works at home remotely now.

We're trying for kids but so far it hasn't been successful so I'm not sure if that is 100% in the cards or not yet.

For fun I'm mostly lifting weights and playing Heroes of the Storm (can't put this game down), or reading reddit/blogs/forums. 

I spent a lot of time traveling when I worked for the bank, and also spent a lot of time traveling recreationally over the past 4-5 years and had a lot of great experiences, but sadly I feel like I'm all traveled out and it's not something I look forward to like I used to.

I got to a point where I was sort of asking myself what's next, so I turned my basement into a small warehouse and am launching an ecommerce store just to get my feet wet. I've been sending everyone else sales for the past few years I figured I'd see what it's like to drive some of my own.

AMA about internet marketing/SEO/Amazon affiliate program, working from home, quitting your job, relocating your life, or HOTS - just here to network and chat since I don't have a lot to do today while I'm waiting for China to ship me dozens of samples for the new store.

**UPDATE: Thank you all for the awesome questions! It was a lot of fun and am surprised by the amount of participation, there are clearly lots of you interested in Internet Marketing/SEO/Amazon Affiliate. Thanks for the gold strangers. I may get around to creating an online resource for this sort of thing and if I do I'll stop by to let you know about (Maybe Q2 this year).**

Sorry if it seems I’m bragging, I swear that is not my intention - that’s my actual situation and the way I feel with no filters.

I fought for it, I don’t come from a privileged background - it was all sweat, blood and tears. I was (and still am) an immigrant who started with $7/hour and has been living 10,000 miles away from his family for the past 15 years.

I made it, at least I got somewhere. But I’ve figured I haven’t reached my final destination yet.

Today, I left it all. I resigned. Sold my Merc. Relocated to a cheaper country. Hired a team of one (my CTO). 

Talked through things to my wife to make her understand I’m not gonna have a salary for a year or two - she doesn’t get it, she says why do you start a business to become poorer?

I fucking hate being an entrepreneur. Feels like a curse. Feels like you are never content. 

But I can’t live without feeling to be one.

Wish me luck guys.

EDIT: since many misunderstood me saying that “I hate” being an entrepreneur, I need to specify that I was being ironic. Obviously, if I have taken this decision, it means that I love it with all my heart.

It’s like chocolate - I hate that because I love it too much, and always want more of it.

I have been an entrepreneur already in the past, loved it but failed, and I’m now back at it.

820,730tyz,False,Lessons Learned,182,The Youtube Middle Class (What Nobody Tells You),Entrepreneur,"In Dec 2016, I quit my day job and started a Youtube channel. I was sick of the corporate world and it sounded very appealing to create videos around your passion. (Also felt great to work the right-side of the brain, after 5 years of numbless PowerPointing/Excel) 

Before I started, I made the naiive assumption that many of the large Youtubers I followed were making a full-time income based off their weekly videos. It certainly seemed so (at the time) based on the lifestyle they portrayed

I thought that if I could match the content quality of some of these Youtubers, I could also start to make a reliable income on Youtube. (Boy was I wrong!) After 8 months of full-time Youtubing, I got my first Youtube paycheck of a whoppping.... $100! Hard to call it pocket change - more like pocket lint given 8 months of vested hours. 

On the side, I started to interview (lesser-known) fast-growing Youtubers to see what they were doing different. After many interviews, I realized that the vast majority of content creators on Youtube (channels with <500K subscribers, what I call the Youtube Middle Class) are not able to live solely off their Youtube earnings. Most Youtubers are supplementing their earnings with personal savings, freelance work, affiliate marketing and other side businesses like merch. But very few actually talk about this business side in their videos. 

If you are interested in starting a Youtube career, think about potential freelance work that could supplement (the slow and frustrating) Youtube AdSense Revenue for 2 years. No matter how good your content is (unless you are simply brilliant), it will take >2 years before your channel builds critical mass.

If you like long form content, I have started to documented these interviews with fast-growing (lesser-known) Youtubers. I have 14 interviews here now at www.youhackers.com. For those who are considering Youtube, happy to answer any specific questions.

Full time as in 8 hours a day? Also, how much of that time was spent promoting the content? Not sure if that's your main Reddit account but you haven't shared a single video on here from that account.

I'm currently trying to get my own online business off the ground, I'm online 8-12 hours a day depending what I'm doing with over 80% of the time being productive according to Rescue Time. In exchange for all this i'm making probably $500 per month right now and i'm totally fine with that as its $500 per month than I made when I started and its unreal the amount of stuff I have learned.

940,f00nsl,False,,93,"I've just pressed that ""publish"" button on my app!",Entrepreneur,"That feeling... I've been trying to get to this point on this app for ages, and yes, it's been way more complicated than I thought it would be starting out, and my budget was a grand sum of as little as possible, but man it's a great feeling. 

For me, it's the greatest thing when you work so hard on something, you come up with the whole concept and then you can see it in real life, working in front of you. I love it. 

All this hype, but why? Well, it's over cheese. Yes, cheese. I'm English, but live in France, just outside Switzerland. As a family, we love cheese. And wine. We're becoming locals...in a sense. 

One day, after some wine and a plethora of cheese, my wife turns to me and says,  
""Ross, imagine if there was a Vivino for cheese..."" 

That was it. She gave me that look and said, Ross, please no. Not again, but it was too late. The seed was sewn and I had to make it so. 

If you are unfamiliar with vivino, it's the wine app that you take pictures of wine, it recognizes it and it gives you a rating of that wine and tells you about it. I've worked on projects with similar technology before and I know what's possible, and I knew having an app that could recognize cheese, tell you about it and recommend pairings of wine/beer, fruits, crackers, chutneys etc. was 100% possible.  


And it was. The problem though, is that you forget that cheese is not a bottle of wine. Wine looks pretty much the same and the technology behind that is text recognition within images and also some image recognition. Cheese looks different depending on maturity quite a lot. It turned into a genuine data science mission. But it was possible... 

The app is pending publication on the Google Play store for it's Beta and yes it's not 100% finished, but it's bloody getting there. 

I now rely on people adding cheese to the app to fill out the data and train the model, so it learns and gets better. We have just short of 10k images of cheese, which covers 10 cheeses with a 92.4% accuracy. Yea, I get it, there are thousands of cheeses, not 10 the model needed a base. Every cheese that is now added will teach it. 

I'm adding more each day and as soon as the app is in Beta I'll be ramping up all data on pairings, similar cheese and just all cheeses in general. 

So I'm sat here, having presses the button 24hrs ago, impatiently waiting for that published flag on Cheezus, so I can finally go to the app store and download the app. This is only the first real hurdle, there are many more to come, but sometimes when you've been working on something so hard, this little milestone feels like everything.

321,cw45n5,False,Case Study,133,"Opening a cafe/bakery, 3 months later",Entrepreneur,"I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/bk96pl/were_opening_a_bakerycafe_tomorrow/) about opening a bakery/cafe 3 months ago in Scotland. I figured that people might be interested in an update and lessons learned for anyone else thinking that they'd like to do this:

the scene:

* We (both aged 31) took over an old bank that required a complete renovation & planning permission to operate as a cafe/bakery/retail space, rather than buying an existing unit with the equipment and planning in place. 
* We budgeted for £40,000 ($50k) but ended up spending about £65,000 ($80k) on the intial outlay
* We self-funded everything and have no debt, investors or family to which we owe money. To get to that position, we bought and did up properties for 4 years, with our last flipper making us, incidentally, £65k.

the fun: 

* The first few weeks were crazy busy, we were operating at double our regular capacity (judging from sales 3 months down the line vs sales in the first couple of weeks)
* My wife left her 9-5 job and runs the bakery/cafe full time, I still work 9-5 but as a remote software developer
* We've given 6 people jobs, including paying our chef twice as much as she'd ever earned before allowing her and her kid to go on a first family holiday in 7 years. Another staff member is finally moving out of her mum's house. All our staff are paid considerably above minimum wage, and 100% of tips go to staff (not me or wife)
* We've had hundreds of 5 star reviews and no reviews less than 4
* We've been able to take a 5 day holiday/break in London already and the staff didn't have to call us once
* We have a strong core of regularly who would be lost without us now
* People travel to visit us 
* Our life in general has more freedom

the not fun:

* Our second-hand mixer broke down, after leaking oil into 10 kgs of sourdough dough (our sourdough is massively popular, sells out every day), we had to get a new mixer (expensive)
* Our second-hand oven broken down, (pretty important for a bakery!) and we had to get a replacement (£5,000)
* Our second-hand fridge broke down so we had to get a new one (£2,000) which weighed 320kg and had to be lifted in through the fucking window and fucking hell that job sucked.
* All this shit happens at the worst times, too. My wife took her first pay from the business, and boom - suddenly you owe 4x of it.
* Negative customer comments or Facebook messages etc are absolutely brutal on your mental health. You've spent absolutely loads of your own money on this, painted it, built it, balanced the books, ensured your staff are paid, orders are in, your facility is hygienic... and then someone complains about something like the price of a scone. It's hard to put into words how much you can let this shit get to you. 99 good reviews and 1 bad means you spend the next 2 months awake at night stressing about the 1. I haven't found a way to get over this yet. Advice would be helpful!
* If you're the person running the business (like my wife) you don't really get days off. Any time she's home she's doing admin for it. We got the 5 day break but she was still working away on things while we were in London.

It's a bit of a wild ride, running a bricks and mortar place. My friends have asked if I have any advice on starting a business like this, I'd say:

* Think about whether or not you really want to do this. Our staff, even the 17 year old, is paid better than my wife at the moment and will be for some time while we invest back into the business. It's fortunate for us that we have no debts and I'm in a career that has good salary potential. 
* Consider the impact on your relationships and social life. Certainly at first, you don't get to go out and do much. And sure, some people who run businesses might not do that right now, but when you have the business then you don't have the agency to make that decision like you do when you don't have a business. Our in-laws had a kid about the same time as we started working on the cafe - they've had more nights out than us. You surrender an awful lot of freedom at first.
* A background in food/personnel mgmt is important. My wife ran a large supermarket a number of years ago. She knew that owning a cafe wasn't just sauntering around drinking lattes. It's cleaning out the grease trap, dealing with the public, staff life events, difficult customers, impossible standards. 
* Service, service, service. Train your staff to provide a good service, as it's one of the main reasons that lots of customers prefer your venue over another.

* I wish I had someone to consult with on marketing the bakery. I'm bored of Facebook updates

I hope that this has been in some ways enlightening to the running of a cafe. We're not parents, but I imagine it's a lot like owning a child - hard work, sleepless nights, stressful, but at the same time strangely rewarding. 

And after all is said and done, it's great to own a place that [looks this damn good](https://i.imgur.com/nKmAWeb.jpg).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cw45n5/opening_a_cafebakery_3_months_later/,737,[deleted] ,2019-08-27 13:02:59

I've expanded into Europe, Canada, and India (Amazon FBA)...Japan and Australia are up next.  

I haven't checked in on this sub in a while, so I'm curious to hear what's up?  What's new?  Are people still obsessed with drop-shipping t-shirts using Instagram influencers?  Are people getting the hint and just getting on Amazon already?  Are people still selling those dumb courses?  What questions do you have for me?  I'm here to answer...

242,a03csr,False,,112,Some learnings after growing a business to an 8 figure valuation,Entrepreneur,"Hello all,

First time poster and TLDR I founded a company 18 months ago and our recent round values our business at +$10m

I was a late starter to entrepreneurialism and had a good length stint in finance (trying one startup while still being employed) before founding my current business. My family has an entrepreneurial background and because of this, I have always had ambitions for building a business but I genuinely was too afraid to take the risk (for whatever reason). Having now ran the company for just over a year, we have been a lot more successfully than i could have anticipated which has culminated in a proper valuation. While we still have a long way to go (you never know what happens), I guess you have to enjoy the milestones when they come

Some things I have learned.

1. Take the risk - if you are fortunate to find a problem to which you can realistically create a solution, you are on the right track. If this solution has a big enough market (it doesn't have to be a multi billion opportunity) and you can find some potential customers who confirm they would pay, you are wasting your time not taking the risk.
2. Markets don't have to be $100bn in size. VC's will often say that the addressable market needs to be ginormous to even attempt. While it may be true for them to make their 10x return, it is not true for you. If you can get 1% of a $100m market which has high margins and is easy to access, you can begin to build a valuable business.
3. Stay close to home - my first attempt at creating my own business was in a market that I saw from a distance. Because I didn't have direct business involvement in this market, I could not see the actual pitfalls of the industry and how my assumptions underlying my business model were flawed from the outset....
4. Don't throw good money after bad - the only good part of my first business (that failed) was that I quickly saw the flaws in my model, determined I could not solve them and closed the business, staying in my current job. I didn't take angel investment which meant that my current business was not tarred by that early opportunity.
5. Staffing is COMPLICATED - anyone can build the ideal model for an ideal business. Very driven people can even build the infrastructure and launch the business, but the next step is building out your staff. By definition each incremental staff member is less incentivised than the earlier staff member (less options, less responsibility). I have found running a team of staff one of the most complicated parts of our business. It is a completely different skill-set to turn your employee base into a devoted tribe and I have made plenty of mistakes along the way.
6. Keep the burn down - It is not sexy to boast about how much money your start-up burns. Contrary to popular belief, businesses are supposed to make money. In building the business, I have built our software in steps. For example, when I wasn't making that many invoices, I didn't need to automate invoices. Furthermore, I have built the business (a software platform) as revenue generating features first and useful back end improvements second. I was also more apprehensive adding staff in the early stages which meant our initial growth generated strain and long hours. We have now exited that part of our growth but keeping a tight ship is the only way to show fiscal responsibility.
7. Have a co-founder - It's fucking tough. You will be in tears, sweats and anxious at some points, at others you will feel the highest of highs. It's a grind and a rollercoaster; most people are normal human beings, you need someone to balance you out. When we went through two quiet days, I was panicking that something fundamental had gone wrong. My co-founder helped me rationalise that business isn't a straight line.
8. ""Why can't a larger player just copy you"" - you will hear this from any investor you pitch to, your employees and yourself. If that statement were true, there wouldn't be millions of small businesses in the world. Clearly there is some complexity to copycatting. Most times you don't realise that big players don't care about you and they are unlikely to copy a minnow and spend millions of dollars in the process. If you have something truly unique, a purchase is more likely.
9. Go into existing markets, don't create new ones - The big ideas that haven't been done before sound super sexy. ""Did you know 200 million cups of coffee are drunk every day in the States, we are going to make a Deliveroo for coffee! Just 1% will make us MILLIONS"". Creating a completely new market requires MASSIVE capital, MASSIVE time and constantly fails. Look for a market that exists, create a business that segments that market by solving a particular problem. Your customers already know you, they already feel the problem, when you present the solution, some will buy in.

I'm sure I am missing quite a few other important lessons. It would be great to hear from other founders

825,av767l,False,,68,Sweet Baby Jesus This Is How You Find An Audience To Target On Facebook,Entrepreneur,"I originally intended to write this as a response to this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/av4eqe/how\_should\_i\_be\_spending\_my\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/av4eqe/how_should_i_be_spending_my_time/)

And thought. 

7FM. Bro? What can **YOU** do for your Country? You've taken so much. It's time to give!

This is it. I'm tossing this advice out into the wild and I'm using everyone's favorite, polarizing topic - **religion**! 

I'll show you in less than 2 minutes how anyone can find their ideal audience on Facebook even if (and especially if) you don't already have a FB page full of people that like you, AKA ""An audience"". Don't worry. You don't need it. You only need to know an interest. Any interest will do. As long as you know this interest relates to your audience, you good bruh. 

Ready? Let's do this, homies!

**First rule of Facebook Club?** You need to be using [Audience Insights in Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/ads/audience-insights/people?) if you really want to discover your ideal demographic.

With this lovely tool you have access to aggregate stats on billions of people and how they relate to what they do on Facebook. We're not talking intimate details, or anything with personal info, but we are talking about Age/Sex/Location, Interests & Devices. 

Basically, all I need to know to get started!

Speaking of, let's go! Just don't forget to actually be logged into FB because...well...um...that's kind of a requirement.

On the initial popup click the box that says ***Everyone on Facebook,*** unless you already have a massive audience on a FB page you control. Which, if that's the case. Go away you're no fun.

On the left-hand sidebar, under the **Interests** section type in ***Christian Music*** and hit enter. 

You want a nice, big audience to start with. You can use whatever you want, but this is a good interest to target when targeting Christians because if there's one thing I know about religious peeps, they love their music...and also the **bible**, so you can go ahead and target that instead if you like, I'm choosing to go the music route because it's more commercial in intent than the bible is.

On the main page you'll see it refresh under the default ***Demographics*** tab and load up with pretty bar charts. Yay!

Right away I know that **65% are female**. I'm not even gonna mess with targeting males if I want to maximize my ROI. I might split test that 36% just to see, but my hopes will be low because the data tells me so. 

**52% of all people that like Christian Music are married**. Done. I'd throw in the 29% that are single as well into a different ad set and test that, too. They just aren't married yet, ya know?

Now, skip on over to the ***Page Likes*** tab near the top of the main page. This is where the gold is, and no, I'm not willing to go in order and I'll omit any that I've seen multiple times in other unrelated searches (they can't all like Mint Julep Boutique!)

* Faith Family America
* Country Music
* Duck Commander (Phil Robertson)
* Paula Deen
* CMT

and on and on. The lower down on the list, the less relevant as a whole it is. 

These are the pages that are most liked as an aggregate, and now, you don't just have to target ***Christian Music***, you can target **married females that like country music**, or CMT or Paula Deen, .etc. 

Just so we're clear here, we're gathering these demographics to target later in our ad campaigns. So don't just look at them and say ""wow, cool, so that's who they are and where they hang out!"" - you have to actually use them in your ad targeting.

Now let's go to the ***Location*** tab.

Well, well. What do you know? The great state of Texas is home to BBQ, High School Football & a good percentage of our core audience!

Cities like **Dallas & San Antonio** stand out as heavy hitters in this report. Do I trust it? Meh. It's a good baseline to work with. We can start there.

I'm not saying ignore other cities, just make a special attempt to focus here or even regionally. 

**NOTE:** Up to you if you want to make Texas specific ads or not, that's your call. (it would be more relevant and would lead to higher CTR in most cases. The tradeoff is that they're more labor intensive to create)

I wouldn't say treat *Location* with a grain of salt, however, I will say that it's best not to ignore certain locations just because they're not on this list. Maybe NYC isn't home to a bunch of country music fans, but does that mean there aren't millions of Christians? Probably not. Just because the results skew South doesn't mean you should ignore the other directions on the compass. 

OK. Let's go to the final tab, ***Activity***.

As you can probably guess, the world is mobile. They went mobile years ago and never looked back. So, don't be surprised that 64% of your entire audience is mobile! 

**NOTE:** If you don't have a mobile-responsive website and funnel that's on you. You've been warned. 

Now, let's check those device splits!

Ah, yes. Nearly 50/50 iOS & Android. Figures. 

Well, here's a little tip from your boy 7FM. You need to split-test both of those OS's, because they don't perform the same and they never will. 

I see dramatically different results when targeting one OS over another and it really varies from product to product. I've found that free products, free signups, free anything will get that Android crowd going. If it requires paying for something, iOS typically wins out.

Without going into crazy conspiracy theories, Android devices are cheaper. People who own Android devices (as an aggregate) have less money. I'm not talking about feature devices like Galaxy's, Note's and Pixels. I'm talking mass-market Android phones that you impulse buy for your entire family at Walmart. 

Android users get a lot of apps for free and as a whole, typically don't have the purchasing power, nor intent of iOS users. iOS users have a 2x higher AOV than Android users, and it's technically closer to 3x. 

Wait...I just said phones. What about tablets? *""Lord, please tell me he didn't forget about the almighty tablet!""* you say.

Ahhhh, man I don't want to give too much away here but **PAID PLATFORM** Tablet users in almost every case are dead money. Your gameshow network loving grandmother uses it to play Scrabble online and mass-click ads that get in her way. 

Test it, try it, absolutely never take my word for it; but, just know I told you so ;)

There you have it. You've found your demographic like a boss and all you had to do was know one interest that your desired demographic might have. 

**Quick Tip:** When you're done with this try it again for a different interest and see if you can cross match. You want to find the overlapping results to know you really hit it.

827,7kyelf,False,,125,$10K/mo selling a bidet product.,Entrepreneur,"Hi /r/Entrepreneur, my name is Pat from [Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com) where I do interviews with successful e-commerce entrepreneurs. Here is my interview with the founder of Nadeef Bidet.

Ahmad Iqbal explains how he created Nadeef, a hand-held bidet while working a full-time job. He now earns $10K/month and has started his own Shopify app.

### Background.

My name is Ahmad Iqbal and I started [Nadeef Bidet](https://getnadeef.com/) two years ago. I am 29 years old, and I’m currently based in Mississauga, a suburb of Toronto, Canada.

Nadeef is a hand-held bidet company. Its purpose is to provide a hygienic bathroom experience. A bidet is like a mini shower you can use while you’re on the toilet. Without getting too graphic, just like you wouldn’t just wipe off chocolate cake from a plate with a kleenex and call it clean, I don’t think it makes sense for bathroom users to just use toilet paper.

Currently, we’re growing slow and steady. The first year was quite slow because I was still figuring things out, 2016 was a lot better, and 2017 has also been great. It’s growing every year, and each year I’m having to spend less time marketing it.

As the sole founder, I’m doing sourcing, quality control, fulfillment (much of my inventory is in my garage and my trunk), customer service, website management, as well as marketing of course. And when I need help, my awesome family steps up.

[What my bidets look like](https://www.starterstory.com/static/media/nadeef-product.a6410035.JPG)

### How I came up with the idea.

I was born in Canada, but as a child, my family and I moved around the world a lot. Before turning 22, I had lived in Pakistan, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Korea, England, United States, Italy, Dubai, not to mention Canada. My dad has a pretty cool job which required him to spend years at a time in different countries, and I believe that travel gave me a lot of perspective and maturity for my age.

I didn’t know it at the time, but the traveling was what eventually gave me the idea to start Nadeef. Basically, in Middle Eastern countries and places like Japan, Korea, and Pakistan, having a bidet is quite common. In fact, the houses and apartments have hand-held bidets built in as standard. So growing up with this bathroom hygiene I expected it as standard. Personally, I cannot use a bathroom now without a hand-held bidet - it just doesn’t feel right. There are millions of people that share this pain with me; my friends and family, and many people in our community.

The substitute that we immigrants have found is to use what we call a “lota” which is basically like a water-pot. It does the trick, but having a real hand-held bidet is like a 10x improvement on the whole experience. I used the water-pot method for all my years in Canada (I moved to Canada for university), but a few years ago decided this was a problem worth solving. And that’s how I got started with it.

I started by asking my target market (my friends and family in North America) why they don’t have hand-held bidets installed in their toilets. I got two recurring answers:

1. Seems like it would be hard to install, needed renovations, or some very sophisticated plumbing.
2. They don’t sell them here.

I knew that both of these concerns were addressable. For the first issue, I just had to make sure the design of the bidets were super easy to install - the Nadeef is installable within two minutes without any tools, drills, or screws needed. And the second issue could be solved through Facebook advertising - people just needed the awareness.

I’ve always been entrepreneurial. I had a previous tech startup between the ages of 22-26, which failed. But, I learned a lot during the process, especially wholesaling through Chinese manufacturers, something I learned from my co-founder at the time. Our previous startup was an interactive name badge business where we sourced lanyards and name tags from Alibaba. That eventually pivoted into an online ticketing company called Atendy, but we had to shut down due to lack of traction. Both my co-founder and I had no idea how to run a tech startup. We made many bad team decisions, partnership decisions, and frankly, we were not in the right place in our lives to handle success. Also, we had no idea how to be successful with online marketing.

### The process of creating Nadeef.

First things first, I searched through Alibaba’s directory to find any suppliers that manufactured hand-held bidets. I found some suppliers who I thought were good and ordered a sample from about 5 of them. Once the samples arrived, I installed each one over the course of a couple of weeks and tested it on a daily basis for quality. After about four months, I found one design which I thought was really good and the had the best quality. When it comes to plumbing type products, you don’t want to risk anything because leaks can be very costly to a homeowner. Quality was a huge concern.

After I figured out which supplier I liked, I created my store on Shopify, and went live with sales. I knew a little about Facebook advertising, so I just published an ad targeting immigrants in my suburb. I didn’t have any inventory because I couldn’t afford it. I just wanted to know if people would buy. And it turned out a lot did.

I placed my first inventory order after I made about 20 sales. By the time I received that shipment of 100 units, I had already sold the 80 that were left over.

[My bedroom with all the bidets lined up that I had to ship](https://www.starterstory.com/static/media/nadeef-bidet-weekly-shipments.b2c89548.jpg)

At this time I didn’t have the foresight around the packaging of the box. I wanted at least some brown paper wrapping, so I went to Ikea where they have those large rolls of brown construction paper that you can take for free and tore off like 10 meters of it. I had to basically gift wrap all those boxes by hand. In my next order, I asked the manufacturer to package them in brown boxes individually.

Getting so many sales right away was pretty awesome. Shortly after, I placed another order for 250 units. We were off to the races pretty much from the start. I know this is a rare occurrence, but I wasn’t surprised. I knew there was a need for this product, I knew the pain-point, and I understood my market.

An important distinction I made at first was to only target my local market. There are a lot of Pakistani, Indian and Middle Eastern immigrants in Toronto, so the audience was large enough for me to just focus here.

### Attracting new customers and growing.

Facebook Ads were what got the party started, but growing beyond marketing on Facebook took a little while. Initially, I thought it was all I needed to know, but soon realized I needed to figure out other facets of online marketing.

I soon discovered the power of “building roads” to my product. In entrepreneurship, I think newbies fall prey to the notion that “if you build it they will come”, but this is so false. This is what burned me on my first tech startup - I was too focused on the product and not enough on the **roads** to the product.

I see entrepreneurship as an equation. On one side of the equation is product, and on the other side is marketing. Most people just solve for the product side. E-commerce entrepreneurs spend too much time thinking about whether or not they have the right product, sourcing the product, designing, logo, packaging, etc. And when it comes to marketing, they think Google Ads or Facebook Ads are sufficient. But it is not. By relying on those channels, you are renting roads, and you’ll always have to pay to use them. It’s better to build your own roads.

These days, with Alibaba and the rise of new software tools like Shopify, building the product and website is the easy part. There are repeatable formulas you can implement to get a product listed on a website. The hard, the uncertain, the chaotic, and the variable part is marketing and understanding your customer. And it's not just advertising - it also includes learning, experimenting, delivering, supporting, and growing. The market is a living thing. The product is just an inanimate object.

Sorry for the rant, but basically I just started posting my products through every channel (road) I could find. I just started experimenting a lot. I posted on Kijiji, a Canadian classified ads platform, and eBay. I added buy buttons to my Facebook page. I started a blog on the website. I reached out to influencers. I started adding discount coupons inside the packaging for my customers to share with their friends. I put up flyers at local Halal grocers. I wrote Quora posts. I invested in SEO. I even bought ads in local foreign language TV channels.

But all said and done, Facebook Ads is still my most successful funnel because my audience is just so well defined. Right now, the majority of my sales come from Kijiji, Facebook, and organic search results.

### What would I do different?

I would have focused more on the US market. Canada is good, but the US is so much bigger. I still haven’t been able to crack that nut. Cost per acquisition in the US is significantly higher than CPA in Canada, which is what has kept me in Canada mostly.

I would also go back to earlier this year and spend more time marketing through non-Facebook channels. Earlier this year I told myself I wanted to focus on organic and owned traffic. So, this summer I turned off all my Facebook ads. I did this at the wrong time. I shouldn’t have done it in the summer when my sales are higher than other times of the year due to the increase of people moving into new homes. The lesson I learned was when you know something works, then double down on it. I did the opposite. I knew my sales were high in the summer of last year, but I neglected that fact when I turned off my ads in the summer this year.

### Competition.

I don’t think about competition. I know my niche. I know my audience segment. I sometimes worry about Amazon because customers could easily just discover the product through my site but then go to Amazon to buy from there. But I provide much better customer service. A large subset of any audience will always appreciate good customer service. I think customer service and customer relationships are my competitive advantage.

Funny story is, I focused so much on customer service and experience in the beginning that I even offered installation services to anyone who bought two or more bidets within the Greater Toronto Area. I discovered there were loads of potential customers were unsure of their own ability to install the bidet. They wanted someone to do it for them.

So, I figured I could do the installations myself for my customers. Not only was this another revenue stream, but also give me face to face time with my customers and encourage word of mouth to their friends.

So, between Summer 2015 and Summer 2016, for one year, I was a ”plumber” on evenings and weekends installing bidets. I did all of this while I still had my full-time job as a Senior Technology Consultant at a top global consulting firm. That was both a fun and not so fun experience. It was fun to take on this other persona of a tradesman, blue-collar worker, given that my full-time job was as a white-collar consultant. During the day I was advising senior executives about their technology strategies, and on nights and weekends, I was a plumber.

But, it was also not fun in the sense that I had to interact with a lot of rude people. I now understand the saying “see how someone treats their waiter at a restaurant.” I could tell some people assumed I was some punk kid. Sometimes after working late I’d still have a suit and tie on installing bidets. That was a funny sight, and definitely made a word-of-mouth worthy impression!

I had to eventually stop offering this service because I no longer had to time, and because I hate traffic. I found myself being stuck in traffic for four hours a day between commuting to and from the office, and then to and from customers’ homes. But from a revenue aspect, it was worth it. Those customers would often refer their friends, and I still get referrals to this day from installations I did two years ago.

### Plans for the future.

Right now, I’m actually focused on my new technology business. While I was running Nadeef on Shopify, I saw lots of opportunities for software tools to help make other merchants’ lives easier. Since I became a semi-successful small e-retailer I started to see the world through that lens. For this reason, my friend and I started building Shopify apps.

The first app we built was called Shopiflip. It was a marketplace to buy and sell Shopify stores. We built this because we realized small businesses are extremely illiquid assets. You can sell a house pretty easily, but it’s hard to sell a business. That lack of liquidity could make an entrepreneur less likely to start a business. So we developed a marketplace where Shopify merchants could list their stores and buyers could bid on them. Even if a store didn’t make much money, an entrepreneur could de-risk their startup efforts by at least selling it for a few hundred dollars (like a plug and play store).

We were pretty excited about what we built. My friend and I even had conversations with senior folks at Shopify about it, including Shopify’s Chief Marketing Officer. However, we learned that Shopify was building their own version of Shopiflip called Shopify Exchange, which they launched a year and a half later. So when we realized Shopify was trying to do it themselves, we put a halt to it knowing we wouldn’t be able to compete with them.

The next idea came from my own need running Nadeef - recovering abandoned checkouts. I found that when I called a customer who abandoned their bidet checkout, I would recover like 55% of them (the industry standard of the auto-email cart reminder is just 10%). The problem for me was I would go hours, sometimes days, without checking my Shopify admin so I was missing my hottest leads. So, my friend and I hacked together a very basic Facebook Messenger bot that would simply alert me when someone abandoned their checkout. It would send me the customers details and a one-click button to make a phone call.

We named it [Scout](https://www.connectwithscout.com/), because it’s like a Scout that works for your store and is always on the lookout for your hottest leads. We have done well so far, and you can download it on the Shopify App Store. We’ve had almost 5,000 Shopify merchants install Scout, and growing this business has become my main focus. It’s been growing more than 10% per week for the past 13 months (this time last year we had about 20 installs). About four months ago, I decided to quit my consulting job to focus on Scout full-time. I now have a team of four working on Scout, and we’re looking at bringing on a fifth. [You can find Scout in the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/scout-cart-recovery).

### Tools I use.

I use [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/?ref=starter-story) as I mentioned above. My favorite app, obviously is my own, Scout. It has helped me recover thousands of dollars per month in sales from recovering abandoned checkouts.

I believe 110% that as small retailers, our competitive advantage is owning our own customer relationship. With marketplaces like Etsy, Amazon, eBay, etc, you don’t really own our own customer. Amazon sometimes won’t even tell you who your customer is, which is crazy.

Scout enables us to leverage my most competitive advantage: my customer base. I can call, SMS, or send personal handwritten thank you cards to my customers through Scout. I can’t count how many lessons about my own business I’ve learned through just having a phone call with my abandoned checkout customers. For example, I found that lots of customers were abandoning their checkout because they wanted a secondary product (a hot water connection) which they couldn't easily find on my site (It was there, just not easy to find). As soon as I heard this, I added a BIG RED button featuring the hot water connection, and quite literally overnight my order value increased by $20. That would never have happened if I didn’t talk to my customers.

[YouTube installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMVd1GLfmA4)

For another example, it turns out lots of people had questions about how to install the bidet. After hearing this, I created a tutorial installation video and put it on the homepage and the product pages. Again, my conversions went up significantly. So again, Scout has enabled me to reach out and learn from my market.

[Abandoned cart diagram on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BY6ETOyFXoY/)

I also made this whiteboard diagram to explain Scout more visually. If an abandoned checkout is your opponent, like an opposing football team, you need to have an answer for each player (abandonment reason) before they get too far down your end of the field. And having conversations with your customers makes these “opponents” visible. If you don’t know what they are, how can you address them?

### Advice for others just getting started.

Your first business might not go well at all. And that’s OK. The first one (and in my case, my first three) is a burner. You learn from it so that your next one is set up for success. I don’t believe that the majority of us are even ready to handle success even if we got it on our first try.

A very close friend of mine got me hooked on etymology, which is the study of the origin of words. I looked into the word “travel” once and I found that it’s influenced by the French word “travailler” which means “to work”. So basically, it can be concluded that traveling used to be a form of “work.” If you think about it, back in the day people would only travel if they really needed to, for work, for example, because it was a hard thing to do. No one traveled for fun. Traveling was hell.

So for example, if you wanted to be a dentist, and there wasn’t a dentist in your village, you had to travel to the next village to become an apprentice for an established dentist. And if you got to that village and it turned out the master already had an apprentice or wasn’t able to teach, then you’d have to travel again to another village. While traveling you would need to live in people’s homes, offer to do work to earn your keep, etc. By the time you found a dentist able to take you on as an apprentice, you might have been traveling for months, an experience in itself of growth and maturity. And so reaching the master dentist was tough work. But going through that “travel” set you up for success. If you could survive through that journey and keep going, when you finally found a master to take you on, it would mean you were ready to learn and be successful as a dentist.

I think this lesson applies to entrepreneurs today. I think entrepreneurs are the real “travelers” of our day if you’re basing it on the origin of the word’s meaning. Your first few trials are like your first view villages you had to travel to. The fact that you failed means you’re more ready to handle success and deal with success properly. If you had found the “village” on your first try after just a couple days of traveling, then you may not have experienced enough hardship to truly appreciate the opportunity and be mentally prepared to be a pro.

Failure comes in handy when you are starting to feel success. I think failure makes you humble. It brings you back to earth.

883,622taj,False,,407,I have a shopify site that earns $10k/month. Ask me anything,Entrepreneur,"Hey everyone.
I own an LED shoe shopify site that generates $10k/month in sales (about half that profit): www.lightingshoes.net

I'm willing to answer any questions you have for anyone thinking of being an entrepreneur/ running a side income producer.

Back story: I was learning software development and wanted to learn to build apps for shopify - a up and coming, very popular ecommerce software for the non tech minded. I figured a great way to learn what shopify users wanted was to run a site myself.

I found the site for sell on flippa in December. The owner was averaging $5k/month in sales with it for the past few months and didnt have any time or desire to continue dealing with the customer service needs.

So I purchased the site. It was a MASSIVE amount of work to get it ""cleaned"" up. Work I did:

* Find new supplier: The previous owner was dropshipping from china, and customers were not very happy with the 2-3 week waiting period for their shoes. So I found a new supplier that could ship directly from the US to my customers.
* Redesign site: Shopify has great themes, but you need to take care of the details when created it, something that was not done. The logo had spelling issues, site loaded extremely slow, footer inaccurate, ect
* Increase conversions: site was converting at 0.75%. By improving product images, adding discount popups, ect the conversion was increased to 2%.

Lessons learned

* Small changes can make a huge difference. For example we added a phone number to the site and chat box for visitors. That helps them trust the site more and lead to increased conversion
* Site load time matters also. A test of the site said load time was 8 seconds per page. We're now at 3. That can make a huge difference on a mobile phone
* Mobile traffic is huge! 80% of our traffic is from mobile. Mobile also converts a lot lower due to people just browsing while at a traffic light, on work break, ect.
* Use experts! I hired a conversion optimization expert that provided tons of valuable feedback. Dont be afraid to ask those who have gone before for help

Ask me anything you want to know.

350,g8qexa,False,,161,I haven't left my house in 45 days and my House Painting business is Booming,Entrepreneur,"What's up r/Entrepreneur it's been a while since i've dropped in for a post, hope you all are well. 

I want to preface this by saying I've done a fairly decent job of documenting my business through posts that can be found on my profile, in short, I've been running a painting business now for 3 years.

My goal from the very beginning of this pandemic was to keep my team busy. I didn't care about the profit, I would've broken even if it meant making sure my guys had the option to work. I'm pleased to say that still to this day we're fully staffed and have been making it through this storm. Due to having a newborn, I haven't left my house, I'm writing this to showcase how I've been able to run my painting business at close to full capacity. 

Contrary to the popular subcontractor model, ***I opted for employees***. Although more difficult, times like this prove it to be the better decision overall. They're really making this entire process easy because over the last 3 years we've built such a high level of trust and understanding. I have full confidence in them to perform our jobs to the standard of which they would be performed if I were assuming my normal duties of doing job sight visits. 

**Company background:** 

Our residential house painting company has 10 employees, and our highest grossing year on paper was $921,000 (last year). the prior years were around $560k and $280k. We had our largest month of production in March of this year of $104k.

I've always been big about helping other contractors develop systems in their business, and, after taking my own medicine I'm reaping the benefits of this tremendously. Our teams are broken up into two teams. One of 4, one of 5. Our model is simple, each team has a project manager responsible for overseeing the jobs, reporting to me, and collecting the payments. 

There's been a lot of concern with contractors about the lack of business, however, I've been marketing heavily with HomeAdvisor ever since the inception of my business - the natural thing to do for most business owners is to retreat in times of uncertainty (like this pandemic) but, knowing that this would create a worm hole in the lead distribution for me to capitalize on, I ramped up my spending and have been getting a STEADY flow of house painting leads since. 

April has been a BUSY month despite everything that has been going on. We will produce $75k worth of jobs, with another $40k on the books for next month. 50% is new business that has been generated remotely. 

With a steady flow of marketing, we're averaging 6-8 estimates for exterior painting PER WEEK. This is extremely surprising to me, but I'm definitely thankful.

Here's how i'm doing it: 

**Marketing & Sales Adjustments**

* I've limited my marketing from HomeAdvisor to only send me Exterior requests 
* I hired my PM's wife to visit each house and simply take pictures of the job. I know that I could easily look it up or ask the homeowner to do it, but I still want to be more than just a quote, so having someone physically show up to the house has been a great way to build trust 
* Online quoting has been something I preferred to stay away from simply because I'm all about building relationships and trust. So for me, this has been the biggest adjustment, but I always connect with the homeowner before I send the quote. I'll call them and talk about what I saw in the pictures, go over the scope again, explain our processes, and also how we're approaching COVID-19 and social distancing when we work on the house 
* I've developed an app to help me do cost-based pricing, this helps me accurately quote any job without worrying about measurements and things like that. The purpose of the pictures is to help me get an idea of how much paint I will need. 
* I did receive the PPP loan. This has been a huge benefit. I'm able to cut pricing because the way I see it, this loan is being used and forgiven for payroll, so I don't have to factor in a huge payroll expense. This has helped us sell way more jobs than if I were pricing based on the margins I usually shoot for. 

  
**Production Adjustments** 

* We're only taking exterior paint jobs & empty interiors
* Homeowner gets a phone call before the job, during the job, and after the job. 
* Team has been sending me photos of the progress of the work
* We're being very cautious about social distancing, and encourage people to stay in their houses while we paint, there's no need to interact. 
* If they don't feel comfortable finding a way to give the PM a check, they can pay online with no additional cost for processing the card 
* Financing has been something I've been bringing up a lot, when people want something done in a time of scarcity, there's nothing better than using someone else's money. People have been jumping all over the 0% for 18months financing we offer 

&#x200B;

**Lessons & Advice**

**If you're a business owner and in a similar predicament, you have to adjust.** 

You have to be creative, and you have to get uncomfortable. If you have a team counting on you, my first piece of advice is to price out jobs in a way that guarantees them work. Don't worry about hitting high margins, the focus should be to keep your schedule full. 

**If you're a potential business owner, employees are a great move.** 

Building trust and a foundation of loyal people to come to work for your company and to buy into your vision proves to be the best decision time and time again. 

**There's always a market.** 

It's about how easy it is for those interested in your product or service to find you. In my specific case, I know a very large majority of the contractors in my area shut off their HomeAdvisor leads. Customers are telling me that I'm the only one who's reached out. I'm betting when everyone else is holding, and i'm getting the rewards.

276,40jeqo,False,,140,Last year I started my first brick and mortar business (a hostel). We ended 2015 the highest rated in the country. 8 things I wish I knew beforehand...,Entrepreneur,"Hey r/entrepreneur, 

Really love this subreddit and have learned a ton in the past. So first off, a big thanks! I never see too many posts in here about brick and mortar businesses, so I figured I’d post [**this article**](http://observer.com/2016/01/the-8-unexpected-rules-of-business-that-no-one-teaches-but-everyone-should-know/) I wrote earlier today. It is a bunch of things I learned this year starting a brick and mortar business (a hostel), but the lessons really apply to any business.

I know it is quite long, so I called out the summary of each point with the ""quote"" text"" at bottom of each. 

I hope you get something from it, and happy to answer any/all questions from anyone thinking of going the brick and mortar route, hostel, or otherwise.

--

**1) Just because your competitors fail at something, it’s not your job to improve it**

Most hostels provide a meal approximating breakfast for their guests. Emphasis on “approximating”. One glance at a review of most hostels, and you’ll find the all-too-frequent complaints about the quality of breakfast. ”They put out boxes of pizza and old doughnuts (half a donut each, if that),” wrote one traveler on the review website HostelWorld. From another: “The hostel’s ‘free breakfast’ consisted of ROTTEN EGGS, Stale BREAD.” And that’s only scratching the surface. A hostel breakfast is a culinary roll of the dice.

Why is that? Simple: It is labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive to cook great breakfasts for dozens of guests, each one with their own specific tastes, allergies, and preferences. Hostels run on relatively low margins, so simple decisions like whether or not to serve a gourmet breakfast can actually make a big difference. The result: a meal that begins the day and starts with the best intentions turns out to be too much of a hassle for the hostel owner, and you, the unfortunate hostel guest, are left smearing peanut butter onto white bread and calling it breakfast.

I know what you’re thinking: HK Austin decided to make breakfast amazing, right? Nope. In fact, we decided not to serve breakfast at all. Here’s why: Across the street from HK Austin are the best breakfast tacos in the city (and possibly the world). We encourage our guests to visit Veracruz All Natural, and we’ve never had a single complaint about the tacos or about our lack of breakfast. After all, half the enjoyment of staying at a hostel is taking in the local flavor and culture. We want to encourage that for our guests, and we knew that our own pitiful attempts at breakfast would never compete with the Veracruz migas (a taco that Food Network named one of the Top 5 in America). Competing against that was a losing battle, and one we had no intention of fighting.

> Here’s the truth: Competitive advantages are excruciatingly hard to find, and it’s tempting in business to think that any one of your competitor’s weaknesses is something you can exploit. But sometimes what can seem like a hidden advantage for you turns out to be a warning. That was the case with our breakfast issue. If you notice a defect in your competitor’s product, rather than race to say, “We can fix that!”, take a step back and ask yourself, “Why is that a defect? What is keeping them from fixing it themselves?” More often than not, you’ll discover good reasons why they’ve chosen to leave a flaw in their product, and that knowledge can be valuable competitive intelligence.

**2) Your customer’s ideas for your business are probably wrong**

In fact, it’s worse: Your customers can often lead you astray. But catering to the customer has become a kind of legendary goal, with companies like Zappos setting the standard for bend-over-backward service that tries to anticipate the customer’s every desire and respond to their every whim. In our business, high-end, five-diamond hotels are notorious for going out of their way to do anything and everything their guests ask for, and they often earn their reputations by their willingness and ability to fulfill a guest’s zaniest request.

But that doesn’t mean it’s always the best business practice, especially for a hostel. I learned this firsthand putting together our hostel common room. When they’re at their best, the common room becomes the nerve center of any hostel: It’s where you meet other guests, trade expert travel tips, swap war stories, and, importantly, where you plan the adventures you’re going to have with other hostel guests. It’s no exaggeration to say that a solid common room can make or break a hostel experience.

One of the most disheartening experiences in my own hostel travel was arriving at one in high spirits, only to find a few guests trapped indoors, glued to the television in the common room. Everyone silent, staring at the blue screen as if in a trance. No socializing, and none of the convivial banter that makes for the best memories. If you can judge a book by it’s cover, then you can judge a hostel by the amount of wine and conversation that flows in its common room.

For HK Austin, I decided to head this problem off at the pass: A ban on TVs in the common room. Our guests were, initially, surprised. No TVs? What gives? A few guests even went out of their way to tell us that we absolutely, positively needed a television in the common room. We flat-out refused—and we haven’t regretted that decision for a second.

I’m proud of the space that our common room has become, and I know that it’s due in large measure to the fact that there’s no television around. People use the space to play card games, concoct plans, strike up conversations, drink, and actually enjoy each other’s company, without the endless buzzing distraction of television. In other words, they use the common room to find out what they might have in common.

Sure, it can seem strange to come into a common living area in the 21st century and not see the boob tube against the wall. But the customer isn’t always right, and we had to trust our instincts and intuition. Besides, people will remember their stay at our hostel; they won’t remember the show they never watched.

> Think of what your customers say they want, but that you know in your gut isn’t good for the business. Then stand up for yourself, and make your case if you have to. Don’t let the cult of the customer crowd out your own strong instincts for what you know is best.

**3) Know when to pay full price**

It’s basically the only iron-clad law in business: You will never, ever have enough money when you start. And so, you’ll have to cut a few corners. There’s no crime in that, and everyone who has started a business has done their version of it.

But there’s an important difference between being cheap and seeming cheap. You can save money without appearing to be the cheapest joint on the block. Remember, in business, appearance is reality. Which is why it’s important to know when to shell out a few extra bucks.

For us, as veteran hostel travelers, we immediately honed in on one thing: mattresses. When we were first putting together the hostel’s bedding, we had an important choice to make. Buy the $109 mattresses, which were in keeping with our budget. Or, spring for the $279 mattresses. Multiplied by the number of beds we had, the $170 price difference wasn’t an inconsiderable amount. At the time, that was actually our operating budget for a full month.

We went with our gut and not our pocketbook: the pricey mattresses were the ones we wanted our guests to sleep on. At the core of our business, after all, was people paying us money for time in a bed. Everything else—the atmosphere, the common room, the location, the book collection, the guests, the reviews—was secondary, and, to some extent, outside our control. But if we could make at least the beds an unforgettable experience, we knew we would be putting money on a sure bet.

It was a bet that paid off: Our most common “complaint” these days is that our beds are just too hard to leave. That’s a problem any hostel owner is thrilled to have, but it wouldn’t have happened if we nickel-and-dimed the decision.

> Think about how this applies to your business. Where should you be ruthlessly frugal, and where should you be extravagant? What’s the core part of the business that affects perceptions, and in a universe in which you can’t control what everyone thinks of you and your product, how do you shape the few pieces you can control?

**4) Stop “playing business”**

“Playing business” is a very easy trap to fall into when scrambling to do any and everything you can think of to “help” your business. For me, “playing business” meant, among other things: setting up profiles on sites like AngelList, trying to get local bloggers to come to various BBQs, reaching out to other local business owners, researching complicated legal structures for when it was time to grow, trying to gain Twitter followers, spending weeks on logo creation, and plenty of other premature things that didn’t directly impact a guest’s stay at our hostel that night.

The reality is none of those tiny details matter if nobody likes your product. When we dropped the bullshit and focused solely on the guest’s experiences, our reputation grew, and all of the little details started to take care of themselves. Now bloggers reach out to us for write ups, people follow us organically on Twitter, and other business owners want to talk business with us.

> If what you’re doing each hour doesn’t directly and immediately benefit your customer’s experience, you should probably be doing something else. Be honest with yourself: Are you setting up profiles on these sites for the dopamine hit of satisfaction they gave you, or because they will actually improve the business? Are you ignoring or avoiding some more difficult task that’s actually tied to your success, in favor of idling on social media websites, gaining “followers” who will never become customers, and planning for realities way off in the distance rather than focusing on the here-and-now?

**5) Hire faster**

Every small business owner has a control freak living inside them. Especially when you are starting out, every single part of the business, no matter how insignificant, can seem like something you ought to have your personal stamp on. In our case, this meant scrutinizing everything from the website design to the email templates to the brand of bathroom cleaner, all the way down to making sure I was the one hand-making each bed so that the sheets were tucked in just tight enough. Plus, it was saving us the expense of paying someone else, right? And didn’t Steve Jobs obsess over every detail of Apple products? That’s sort of the same, isn’t it? Of course I should make the beds myself, if only on the what-would-Steve-Jobs-do-if-he-ran-a-hostel theory of business.

You can see where this is going. While it’s great to know a business inside and out, you have to acknowledge the difference between working in the business and working on the business. If your business is going to grow, you have to work on growing it. Otherwise you’re just making beds all day, while the core business languishes.

> The solution is to hire fast. It’s in vogue these days to say things like “hire slow, fire fast.” That’s a fine rule of thumb in certain businesses and companies at certain stages in their growth, but it was my experience that I was reluctant to hire because I was unwilling to cede control. I assumed I knew best, and that anyone I hired wouldn’t do the same high-quality job I could, right down to how tightly they tucked in the sheets. My delay in hiring was a kind of arrogance, and it badly impaired the business.
> 
> When you wait too long to hire, your company can’t capitalize on your competitive advantages. In my case, I’m a partner at a successful marketing company. My competitive advantage is in marketing, branding, messaging, and growing the business and its digital footprint. Instead of focusing on that, I was busy making beds. And as soon as I got out of my own way, and trusted that others knew what they were doing, our business started growing.
> 
**6) Boredom is your new normal**

Here’s an inconvenient truth for anyone about to start a new venture: If you don’t like doing the mundane parts of your business, you probably shouldn’t be in that business.

I’ve seen many hostels fail when the ‘owners’ fall in love with the “lifestyle accessories” they believe come along with owning a hostel: adding “owner” to the LinkedIn profile, hooking friends up with free stays, flirting with attractive people who came through the door. Yet they hated changing beds, cleaning bathrooms, dealing with questions from guests, running the software required to keep track of stays, fixing small problems around the property, and the like. You know, everything that goes into actually running a hostel and making guests feel at home.

> The trappings of owning a business aren’t going to get you through tough times. You have to enjoy every part of the business if you’re going to survive. This might sound like something of a Zen parable, but it’s a fact of doing business that isn’t talked about enough. Mundanities are the business; boredom is the norm. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you will know if your idea is something you’re going to want to pursue on the lowest of low days.

**7) The beginning isn’t the end**

Here’s a daydream familiar to anyone who has had to launch a product: The larger-than-life grand opening. In our imagination, we’d invite our friends, family, and the press, and they’d all be blown away by our perfect hostel machine. We’d pop champagne from the second floor balcony, admire the amazing art on the wall, and laugh with all the guests occupying every bed in the place. Until that exact moment was possible, my partner didn’t want to be in business at all. It was another excuse for inaction, another excuse to “hit the whiteboard” and plan some more, instead of actually hosting guests.

There is no perfect time to launch. A “grand opening” or a “launch party”—these are usually just overhyped events that don’t deliver any kind of sustained firepower, revenue, or sales.
When the time actually came for HK Austin to open, we had bare walls and only half of the beds ready. We couldn’t afford champagne, and we had a grand total of two guests. But we launched faster than we thought, and did everything we could to make the best two-bed hostel in the world. There was no reason to wait till we had everything set up to give it a true effort. In startup talk, we had achieved a minimum viable product. Every day since, we’ve worked to make the place a little bit better and slightly closer to that finely tuned machine of our dreams.

> Start now. Figure out the rest as you go along.

**8) Being human can get you extraordinarily far**

Whole shelves groan under the weight of books about “customer service.” Here’s a simple formula that worked wonders for us: When in doubt, be a human.

What does that mean? Well, we knew our only ace in the hole was going to be the fact that we could beat our competitors on how and how much we engaged with our customers. We didn’t have the sexy murals, established bar crawls, or the bank of good reviews to rest on when new guests came in the door. To be perfectly honest, we didn’t have nearly the best amenities either. But we knew we could lavish time and attention on each guest who came through our door; we could make them feel like old friends. So every single one got a personal tour and an endless supply of conversation and advice. In other words, we treated them like human beings, not customers. We took time to pay attention to what they said (and didn’t say) and we tailored their experience as best we could.

When a guest found themselves flat broke and in need of an unexpected 5 A.M. ride to the train station due to a family emergency, we woke up and gave them a ride, saving them a four mile walk. When another found themselves with nowhere to stay and all local hostels (including our own!) were fully booked, we invited them into our home for a place to crash and a family-style dinner. When one guest was too shy to go to two-step lessons on their own, we scrambled our local friends to accompany them—creating a memorable night for everyone involved.

This didn’t cost us gobs of money, nor did it require us to do anything more than pay attention very closely and respond with energy and empathy. You’d be surprised how far simple humanity can get you in business. We were competing against hostels and hotels many times our size and with much deeper pockets, and yet, we were able to compete with them on ratings because we made each guest feel like a guest and not a line item on our balance sheet.

> When you’re starting, you don’t have many unlimited resources. But you do have a limitless capacity for work, endless opportunities to provide a great experience, and the proximity to your customer that reminds you they are a person, not a profit center. Given you’ll be starting with a minimum viable product—not a finely tuned machine—it is important to understand how much extraordinary customer service can make up for. At the start, you won’t be able to match your established competitors in all aspects of business, but outshining their stale customer service can be a way to make up the gap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/40jeqo/last_year_i_started_my_first_brick_and_mortar/,778,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

64,7r1xgp,False,,261,Making $1000 per night cleaning restaurants,Entrepreneur,"I started a commercial cleaning company about 4 years ago. Over the years I've gained many skills that I never thought of before and slowly my business became a bit more specialized. I now focus primarily on cleaning restaurants and doing floor care.



I enjoy providing this service because I've gotten pretty good at it, and I dont have much competition. [I've made a short video](https://youtu.be/43k5muK79nQ) on a job-site that shows exactly what I do for a typical customer.



If you cant watch the video for some reason, basically its just me on a job-site talking about what I'm providing for this specific customer. This customer is a popular Raman Bar and we are cleaning everything from the ceiling to the floor and I just show some of the tasks that I've completed.  On average, this kind of job is about $1000, depending on the tasks and labor required.



I've seen a lot of people discuss the idea of starting a cleaning business on this sub over the years, and I thought maybe someone on this sub would be interested in learning a little about specialized cleaning instead of just regular janitorial or house cleaning.

Edit:Thank you guys for all of the great feedback. I'll answer as many questions as possible. I know its in bad taste to ask this here, but would you mind subscribing to my channel if my video interested you?

756,4x9fo9,False,,125,"From 0 to over $30,000 revenue in 6 months.",Entrepreneur,"As a long time follower of the entrepreneur sub I wanted to share my own story of how I've managed to start a successful side business in a niche market. About 6 months ago I was looking to create furniture for my apartment as I was frustrated with the idea of paying retail prices for furniture that I considered would likely be easy enough to make on my own, it turns out I was not alone. I have always been a fan of hairpin legs, which are a style of steel furniture legs which have been around for ages, and are clean and simple in design. I bought a set for a coffee table I was making, and was convinced that I could make them better than the set that I had purchased, and market them better as well. It had the potential to be a very straight-forward and simple side business. As someone who has worked in branding and web development over the past 5 years, I’ve found it to be quite tiring providing a service and trading time for money day in, day out, and I was anxious to start selling a physical product that could provide me with another form of revenue. 

**Concept validation:**

Craigslist: If you're selling a product and you want to know if people have interest or not, I've found Craigslist to be a very good way to test this. Simply post a quick ad with the target price and see how much traction you are able to get. This helped us to validate that the local market was willing to pay our price and that we had enough interest to further the concept and to this day, we are still receiving consistent sales. 

**Getting started:**


As soon as I realized that I was getting quite a few emails / calls per week just from the craigslist it was time to take action and take the next steps to get this business launched. After about 25-30 hours of research into the market and product development, I forked over roughly $1,000 out of pocket in equipment to begin building steel furniture legs, starting on the balcony of my apartment. I quickly knew that in order to make this business successful that I would need a business partner. While initially unconvinced that this business idea could work, I showed my roommate who was the most viable candidate the calls / emails received and he started to perk up quickly and soon saw the potential.

After developing our product through trial and error, and getting to a point where we were happy with what we could produce – we started to market  ourselves directly through craigslist and launched a quick one page website and blog, doing the best we could to optimize for relevant keywords. After a month or so, we started to see some steady traffic on the website and sales picked up. I will say that the blog has been hugely instrumental in our success to date and that many considering the same path should absolutely consider investing a small amount of time into writing some posts. Ours are simple, but they work, and we’ve gained a ton of traffic for it!

We eventually started receiving calls from local furniture makers, businesses, and your DIY-type consumers. I think it’s important to note that we operated this business in a niche market which
was extremely helpful due to the fact that there wasn’t a lot of competition in search results and it was relatively simple to rank high, and fast. 

I would also like to recommend for others following on the same path of trying to launch almost anything, that I feel it's important to leverage your local market first, and work on your local SEO and existing connections. This really does help to establish a base and is far easier than trying to expand nation-wide immediately. 

**A note on setting up the business:**


Initially we didn’t do much to get the business started, simply registered our name / domain and setup a small business bank account and typically accepted cash on pickup, or interac e-transfers, we kept it lean and simple and just ran with it not worrying overly about the technicalities / details initially. Everything one step at a time, on a customer by customer basis continually refining our offering / pricing as we went along. We now have a more professional e-commerce website setup which has been gaining traction on squarespace. 


**Fast forward to today:**


As of writing this, we have fairly consistent online sales, a strong customer base of furniture makers that consistently come back to us with more orders each month, a small shop which we pay $400 / month for and we’ve managed to grow to over $30,000 in revenue over about 6 months which as a side business in a niche I am very happy with. We continue to work on our existing product offering and working hard to add new products.

As well, since I know many of you will likely ask,
Here is our website for the curious:  http://vancouverhairpinlegs.com 


**What I attribute our success thus far to in this venture.**


* Simple product with a relatively low material cost.
* Niche / trend market, low competition in search results
* Having a great business partner with complimentary skills.
* Stay lean, use tools that can help you such as squarespace to launch quickly.
* Use craigslist to validate your product quickly, and as a sales tool
* Try to blog consistently in the beginning.
* Don’t overthink it or get caught up with every little detail
* There is no fast and simple way to make a ton of cash, just hard work and dedication.
* Don’t play in crowded sandboxes.
* Find the path of least resistance, start now, and improve as you go.
* Iterate, Improve, Improvise

865,a36byf,False,Best Practices,100,The Best Way To Make Money For Young Entrepreneurs - Invest In Your Education.,Entrepreneur,"I get it, a lot of the people on this sub are new, don't own businesses and are lurking.   
Here's the cold hard truth, most of the time to any savy businessman, your questions and comments are absolutely basic level. Now before you downvote me hear me out -   


Having browsed this sub for a long time the level of information provided here is honestly quite poor, yes there are sometimes people who come in with successful businesses and drop great threads (thank god they usually get upvoted) - But a lot of the time it's straight up beginners discussing with beginners, the blind leading the blind so to speak.     


Sometimes the comments / questions made by users of this sub downright amaze me about how basic they are, and these are people who are about to dive into businesses. I have been a freelance marketer (handle many small business/medium businesses and beginners) for a long time now, as well as own two businesses myself - the questions some clients ask me (especially beginners) are so naive it seems like they haven't researched a single thing on what they are getting into.    


Guys, please hear me out, there is a reason that 50% of businesses fail in the first 5 years. I used to sit back and wonder always why this stat was so high, but trust me from seeing the level of entry over the last few years (freelancing) I know the answer. It's a pure lack of basic business knowledge. Now i'm not taking a shit on new entrepreneurs, I'm actually doing the opposite, I'm genuinely trying to help.   


Invest guys, invest hard in your own education. Read INFORMATIVE BOOKS (not subreddit posts), go to university (optional obviously and situational) or complete a small business course, watch udemy videos and develop yourself. You can't just jump into business without even understanding the complete basics. Some people don't even know what google ads are, or facebook audiences, or even how to advertise locally, they don't understand financials or anything related to business. Educate yourselves people, go away from this sub and educate yourself as you really won't find the tools you need to be successful purely from this sub (it's an echo-chamber). There is a difference between diving into a new business venture as an educated entrepreneur, VS starting in the business world itself with absolutely no idea wtf you're doing.    


TLDR: Move away from this sub if you are a complete beginner and learn the ABC's Of business. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/a36byf/the_best_way_to_make_money_for_young/,428,"Although I completely agree with 99% of everything you wrote, I would also add that sometimes to get that business experience you should just jump straight in at the deep end.

951,arqmdz,False,,48,A message to everyone starting out. Cutting costs and being cheap are very different.,Entrepreneur,"I want to first start out by saying I was once very very cheap when starting out my online business. I tried to save $2 everywhere I could and as a result, the quality of my business suffered. I am making this post because I wish someone told me not to cheap out when I first started.


I have noticed over and over on this thread and many others, young starters are terrified with using superior platforms that cost $5-$10 more per month such as Shopify and are willing to settle for the cheaper platform.

What everyone needs to understand is that the proven platforms that cost a few bucks more are often worth it. They typically come with more features, support, themes, workability, and much more.

*This goes way beyond platforms and I hope everyone can take this post into consideration for their exact business.*


**Cutting Cost**: Everyone and I mean everyone should cut costs where they can to make there business more profitable! Cutting costs refers to activities such as negotiating warehouse pricing so you can stock more inventory, moving from a traditional office to a WeWork, cutting ineffective ads from your campaigns, hiring virtual assistants from across the globe for cheaper international rates, removing paid apps from your store after testing and learning that they have not resulted in a positive return. Cutting costs are essential for the growth of profit margins and every business should try their best to cut costs in the right places.


**Being Cheap:** There are plenty of times in your life where being cheap is the best option, when you are trying to please customers, being cheap is not an option. Being cheap in your business refers to seeking alternate operations that you would never perform if you ""had the money"". Specific cheap activities include using alternate websites such as freewebstore, not building an email list because of the monthly costs involved, using a free domain (.myshopify.com), removing certain product features that cost a lot but drive sales, refusing to accept PayPal because of a 2% fee, shutting off ads after 6 hours without a results. Being cheap has no place in successful business operations. 

&#x200B;

Moral of the story: Be smart about your expenses. Cut costs in the places that they should be cut to increase your profit margin while continuing to deliver an excellent customer experience. Cheap out by buying a cheaper drink or asking for a water cup, do not cheap out on your business. 


*Cheaping out on your business only hurts yourself in the long run. You will lose unsatisfied customers, retain lower conversion rates, and deal with a ton of headaches if your business picks up.* ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/arqmdz/a_message_to_everyone_starting_out_cutting_costs/,400,Wow great info and insight does anyone here know a good platform to build an onine store? ,2019-02-17 23:39:14
927,db1tj7,False,Young Entrepreneur,181,I need to learn how to run a hotel by the start of summer.,Entrepreneur,"My grandma runs the family's hotel that nobody else in the family can help, anyone but me.
I'm a Greek 22yo student I have no experience or whatsoever on that matter.
The hotel has 15 rooms it was built before world war 1, the only staff is my grandma, the booking is done via phone (if she ever hears it ringing) with no computer, no databases, online booking .. nothing.. pretty much everything is being done on paper.

The hotel is not at the best condition but it offers wifi and its clean. (the TVs in the rooms are those old small boxes), it's also located in Greece in a somewhat tourist area that mainly attracts old people.

Nobody wants to invest in this mess but it's also a good chance for me to prove my worth using my social and cooking skills and earn some money for me, my grandma and the hotel itself.

So my thoughts were to first take some nice photos, upload it to trip advisor create a compelling profile to social media, create a breakfast menu, room service, drinks, coffees. I'll probably be bringing a friend of mine to help me with the bookings/reception and also help the customers with their luggage.. I don't know, I have no tangible plans yet.

So you can try and hire a manager who is qualified. Or even better is rent the entire hotel out to someone. That monthly rent will be the same  as you running around working as manager.  After say 5 years of turning the business around you can take it over again.

The first thing is you need a restaurant because it will make more money than the rooms. 2nd is tour desk. 3rd is a bar. So you see  there is a lot to do. A professional will be able to manage it all with ease. ",2019-09-29 21:50:43

My co-founder and I are still in the early days of growth but if it wasn't for this community and /r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, our launch wouldn't have been possible. As a thank you - I'm back again with some insights and info that I hope can be helpful.

Here are some of the things I wish someone told me before I quit my 9 to 5. It’s also a few of the answers to the questions that people asked me privately over DM or in email. I've included a lot of these tactics in my upcoming guide on [escaping the 9 to 5](http://rosssimmonds.com/hustle-manifesto/) as well. I hope you folks find it useful and while I know that grammar is important, I’m pushing through this because I have to get back to work 

**What I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Quit**  

1.	**Learn to say no** more often than yes. Lots of opportunities will come up but picking the right ones is more important than saying yes to everything and not being able to give the important opportunities as much effort and time they deserve.
2.	**Start building relationships way before you decide to quit**. These relationships are going to help you more than you know down the road. You don’t have to plant seeds that you’re looking to quit your job but show these people that (1) you care and (2) you can help them. If you do that, they will help you when you need them most.
3.	**Invest in yourself and your future TODAY**. Don’t wait to read books and blog posts on entrepreneurship or accounting until after you quit. Read now while you’re employed and have a steady paycheck so you’re not scrambling for this knowledge when you should be building your new business. 
4.	**Expect things to go wrong.** Everything. It might not actually happen but this mentality will help ensure you’re prepared and doing the best you can to keep things on the right track.
5.	**Maximize revenue, minimize costs.** Sounds like basic business advice but too often will you find entrepreneurs forgetting the importance of keeping costs down. I'm not saying nickel and dime people but don't be afraid to ask for lower rates on software, banks, credit companies and when working with established suppliers.
6.	**Everything needs more time.** Everything takes longer than you thought at first. Once you get a few projects under your belt it will be easier to estimate timelines.
7.	**Save cash before and after you quit.** Keep a couple thousand dollars in a separate bank account for a rainy day. Trust me, rainy days will happen. And before you quit, make sure you have 3-4 months runway in projected revenue or in the bank. My approach was simple: lock in one client that would allow me to cover my mortgage and hustle like crazy to get more work ASAP.
8.	**The phone isn't your enemy.** As much as you might hate talking on the phone; some of your clients and partners will prefer it. Make it a habit to pick up the phone and call someone instead of relying on email, text and instant message. This is more of a Gen-Y and Millennial issue than anything else. 
9.	**Just ship it.** You’re going to be your own worse critic. It’s easy to become paralyzed by critiquing your own work – Just ship it. Whether it's a blog post, proposal, email campaign or media outreach - JUST SHIP IT.
10.	**Take on amazing clients and projects as early as possible.** These projects and clients might not pay as much but during your early days, it's important to take on work that will help differentiate you from the crowd. 
11.	**Embrace the right tech.** Streamline your workload with the right technologies in place. Use a tool like Freshbooks for invoicing, Basecamp for managing projects, Dropbox for storage, WP Engine for your website hosting and Slack for communicating with partners and suppliers.
12.	**Hack your inbox** with tools like Boomerang that will help you schedule emails to go out at a later time. People don’t like emails at 2AM so use Boomerang to schedule it to go out at 8AM the next morning. Other tools include FullContact.com.
13.	**Multi-tasking is a myth.** You get more done by simply focusing on one thing during a set period instead of attempting to do 2 or 3. 
14.	**Create a “Kill List”** that highlights the various items you need to do the next day every night before bed. Start with the most difficult items and cross them off your list one by one as you do them.
15.	**Make goals and revisit them every month.**
16.	Don’t be afraid to **ask for help.**
17.	Don’t be afraid to **ignore some advice**. It’s not all good.
18.	**Remove distractions to prevent procrastination.** Don’t work in the living room because you’ll make the mistake of turning on the PlayStation. Don’t work in the kitchen because you’ll attempt to cook something delicious. Work in a place where your focus is going to be on the work.
19.	**Learn to handle criticism.** Never take it personally. Whether it’s a project or an idea – isolate the criticism from yourself as an individual and recognize that it’s a vehicle for you to improve. [This post from James Clear is a great one for this.](https://blog.bufferapp.com/haters-and-critics-how-to-deal-with-people-judging-you-and-your-work) 
20.	Charge what you're worth. This [course](http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/free-pricing-course/) from /u/BrennanDunn is spot on and will help change the way you look at pricing your product or service. 
21.	Know at least two good jokes or stories you can share in practically any situation to lighten the mood.
22.	Keep your word and embrace those who do the same.
23.	**It’s okay to delegate.** People who help you might do things differently than you but they will still get it done. It might not be exactly the way you wanted it but sometimes you just need to walk away and let people learn on their own and do their own thing.
24.	**Drink more water.**
25.	**Don’t take on projects you don’t believe in at a discount.** The opportunity cost is too high. If they’re haggling for a lower price point, it’s likely that they don’t value your work as much as a client who you actually believe in but because you said yes to this project won't have time to take on.
26.	**Spend less time with talkers and more time with doers.** Lots of people will talk about what they are going to do in the future. Few people actually step up and take action. Spend more time with those who take action and it will rub off on you. 
27.	**Meet more people.** Go to events and force yourself to not hang out with the same folks at every conference. You build your net worth by building your network. 
28.	**Keep your mental health in check.** Entrepreneurship is filled with highs and lows. It’s filled with [Gutters & Strikes](http://tomtunguz.com/strikes-and-gutters/) as Tomasz Tunguz once said. Stay sane through personal reflection, spending time with great people, journaling, meditation, etc… 
29.	**Public speaking is a great biz dev tactic.** The conversion rate at events for new business is higher than the conversion rate of tweets and LinkedIn updates.
30.	**Streamline your processes.** Create a proposal and process at the beginning that can be used in a very cookie cutter approach from one client to the next. The steps you take to onboard a client should be so straightforward and automatic that someone else could come in and run that process without you. The goal here is simple: create a business that could some day run without you. 
31.	**Spend time understanding how to give effective feedback.** This [article](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/criticism-and-ineffective-feedback) is worth reading. 
32.	**Challenging work is the best work.** When you take on a project that sounds very challenging – you’re either going to do something awesome or learn something new. Say yes to challenging work because it’s going to look amazing in your portfolio when you’re done. 
33.	**Invest in people who invest in you.**
34.	**Get a good lawyer** and ensure that your contracts are solid.
35.	**Read** the following books: E-Myth Revisited, Getting To Yes, The Black Swan, Good to Great, The Power of Habit.

214,cz6su7,False,Lessons Learned,262,Avoid GoDaddy like the plague.,Entrepreneur,"Recently I was helping a non-profit redesign their website and made me appreciate the advice I got early on to avoid GoDaddy.

This wasn’t a normal project for me. I focus on helping early-stage startups establish their growth strategy. But they do excellent work and the couple that runs it (both 80 years-old) are friends with my dad.

**What made GoDaddy such a royal pain to deal with?**

As an entrepreneur I know put it, GoDaddy is like the Walmart of web hosting. They dont care about the customer. They just want you to buy their product and get out. 

More specifically, here are some of my frustrations:

1. Poor customer experience. The UX is terrible. And if you don’t know a lick about web hosting, it’s hard to know what services you actually need.
2. Overpriced. The NPO was using their drag-and-drop website editor. The tool felt like it was from the 90’s. It was BEYOND painful, slow, and glitchy. I transferred them over to another tool at the same price and built a more user-friendly website.
3. Ignorant support. Open up a live chat and feel the pain of talking to someone who seems even more clueless than you.
4. Slow website performance. Slow speeds creates a poor experience for your customers. It also hurts your organic traffic (SEO) and conversions (CRO).
5. Relentless (and borderline predatory) up-selling. This was the icing on top of the crap cake. They upsell you on services you don’t need, some of which are free (for example, SSL certificates). But if you aren’t technical or knowledgable, you’re more likely to fall into their trap.

Much of the same could also be said of EIG hosts (BlueHost, HostGator, HostMonster, etc) and 1 & 1 (now Ionos).

One founder I know said he had no warnings about reaching his limits on his shared hosting account. As a result, his site got shut down for having too much traffic. He could only email because he did not pay for “priority support” and had to wait 24 to 48 hours to get site up and running again.

This is one of the most overlooked dangers of entrepreneurship. Buying a cheap product or service can be more expensive in the long run.

Do yourself a favor and do some research before committing to a hosting and domain provider.

***

EDIT 1: Host/domain recommendations

Some of you have been asking for suggestions from me (comment+PM) and others. I’ll provide my suggestions below. And if you know a good provider, let everyone know in the comments below.

**For domains:** Hover or Namecheap.

[Hover](https://www.hover.com/): .coms start at $12.99. Never had an issue with them.
​
In the end, a domain is a domain. As long as they have the TLD extention you want, you’re good to go.

One thing to know is many of the providers I mentioned to avoid (GoDaddy, EIG, Ionos) will make it frustratingly difficult to get out of once you bought a domain through them. This may be fine while it works. But the moment you have a problem, you’re screwed.
​
[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/): .com domains start at $8.88.

Overall, they’re a good choice. Their support is good, but I’ve had long wait times with their live chat a couple times. Their pricing is fair and honest, you won't see any surprise charges appearing on your account at the end of the year. 

I wouldn’t use them for hosting. While they’re low cost to start, when you add up all the costs, they’re a pricier choice. Especially when you consider the time cost.

Also suggested in comments: 

1. Google Domains
2. NameSilo
3. porkbun.com
4. Name.com
5. Nominet (UK domains)

**For hosting:** Heroku, Decibite, or Media Temple
​
Hosting is a complex topic. What’s best for you will depend on your technical ability, requirements, etc. 

Shared hosting is rarely the right option if you’re half-way serious about building a business. You’ll experience attrocious downtimes as companies often throttle your “unlimited” resources.

Just please, avoid GoDaddy, EIG, or Ionos/1&1 at all costs.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/): If you plan on building and scaling web apps, Heroku is an excellent cloud platform. Heroku lets app developers spend 100% of their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling.

It’s easy to deploy, has a free plan for side projects, and a HUGE time-saver.

Heroku also provides:

* Agile deployment for Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Java, Python, Go and Scala.
* Run and scale any type of app.
* Total visibility across your entire app.

Full Disclosure: I’m not a technical co-founder. Most of this was the value my past technical co-founder found when we built a startup together. I’ve heard a lot of excellent things about Digital Ocean as well, but have even less experience with them.

[Decibite](https://decibite.com/): If you’re not technical or want to outsource this headache, Decibite is the way to go.

Some reasons why I love Decibite:

1. Personal relationship. They started as a small business in Calgary, and now serve many customers around the world. Even as they’ve grown, they still provide the same personalized service when they were a “mom-and-pop shop.” 
2. Almost like a business partner. You don’t get some random person helping you. The person knows you on a business level and knows the trouble you are experiencing. Then either assists you, or provides recommend resources.
3. Phenomenal hosting speeds. One of my friend’s transferred to Decibite from BlueHost. His load time went from 2.5s to 1.81s.
4. Not having to have to figure out the technical side of hosting. It’s like a car - I don’t need to know how everything works, I just need it to work.
5. Responsive support. You get access to their tech team via email, live chat, and phone. It’s a very quick turn-around time on any issues.

Even with their VPS, they’ll help you get everything set up and running so you don’t have to manage anything. In other words, you’ll get the resources of a VPS without needing the technical knowledge.

If you’re more technical, the team also knows how to work with your tech-stack too.

The only downside I’ve found is from time-to-time some of the typical automation isn’t there. So sometimes I may start with one host, then transfer everything over to Decibite once they’re up-and-running. But whenever I’ve had an issue, I email the techie and either walks me through it or does it for me.

It’s like managed services at a fraction of the cost.

Full Disclosure: Decibite is a client of mine, so no pressure to get faster hosting if you feel my review is excessively bias.

[Media Temple](https://mediatemple.net/): Great premium service, but...

Media Temple has a phenomenal support team. I cannot recall a problem they haven’t solved. Sometimes going above-and-beyond my expectations. Their UI is an amazing experience and loved almost everything about MT. Sites load fast and definitely superior to GoDaddy, EIG, and Ionos. And their prices are reasonable (though much higher than Decibite).

Full Disclosure: My biggest sticking point is that they were acquired by GoDaddy in 2013. I started using their services before I found this out, which is why I’m somewhat conflicted. [They’ve made it clear](https://mediatemple.net/blog/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition/) GoDaddy and MT are separate brands and do not plan to merge. And I’ve never had an issue feeling like this affects their services. It’s been six years since their acqusition, so it’s a good chance nothing will change. But if you’d rather not risk it, consider looking elsewhere.

Other suggestions listed in the comments:

1. LiquidWeb
2. Amazon AWS (Amazon S3)

Edit 3: If you've had a large recent issue with a company after talking to customer support, I'd recommend going through the Federal Trade Commission. I did this when Comcast tried to not refund me my ~$200 which their support team promised. 

The FTC is for US companies. But some of this process may be helpful even outside the US.

My rough process:

1. Call the company and find out what they will do.
2. Document the conversation so you have something to refer back to. Nothing fancy needed, just a few notes will do.
3. If they don't deliver, call again and politely mention you'll contact the FTC if need be. The goal is to show the FTC you made a good effort to use the right channels.
4. If possible, get Paypal and/or your credit card company to help get you a refund. They often have buyer protection. A debit card/direct bank withdrawl offers no protection (which is why security professionals recommend using credit cards). Usually you have 60-90 days after the purchase, or more for some companies.
5. If all else fails, [submit a complaint to the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/faq/consumer-protection/submit-consumer-complaint-ftc). Use an email + phone number you can be reached at as that's where upper management will reach you.

Edit 4

There were a few people who reported this post. I had an excellent call with /u/BigSlowTarget and we discussed everything. 

He asked I make fully transparent my relationships with Decibite, even though I mentioned it in Edit 2.

As I stated above, Decibite is a marketing client of mine. We connected on Reddit and originally worked together on-and-off since 2014. Although I'm connected to Decibite, I'm not a co-founder. While I believe they are an excellent web host for non-technical entrepreneurs, I also offered other hosting recommendations I'm not affiliated with because my intent wasn't to trick anyone to buy their services.

Whether or not you choose Decibite, I hope you find this post helpful in making smart hosting decisions (e.g. not GoDaddy, EIG, or 1&1). :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/cz6su7/avoid_godaddy_like_the_plague/,866,"I am inclined to agree with the others. This post is dumb and wrong. If you're a developer... you will know what GoDaddy is good/not good for. If you're not, then yes they have silly UX's that are made for people who need a WYSIWYG editor.

I don't pay for premium support but anytime I've needed something, I can usually get it resolved in a hurry. 

Lastly, they don't upsell you anything that every other host doesn't also try to upsell... ",2019-09-03 16:01:00

So we just published a gigantic resource for learning how to market a SaaS business. It’s a long-ass 14k word guide with 41+ tactics, 50+ case studies, and pretty much everything you need to know to take your SaaS from 0 to 100.

We’ve received amazing feedback (both positive and constructive) over the past two days, and a bunch of people also asked me to post this here, so here it goes. I made a somewhat Reddit-friendly summary of just a handful of the strategies. Hope you find this useful!

## Strategy #1 - Get your SaaS featured on online media

Getting that sweet, sweet, TechCrunch mention can have a ton of benefits for your SaaS. You get the social proof of hanging that “Featured On” section on your landing pages, immediate traffic, chance to impress new investors, and so on.

A lot of companies invest a ton of money in RP agencies and get “Eh” results at best. See, what most of those agencies do is send a generic press release to their media list, and call it a day.

They get you results? Good! They don’t? Well, you get the canned “the media wasn’t interested in your story, unfortunately.”

Want to DIY your PR AND get much better results? Here’s how:

The idea is, you need to find people who wrote about your competitors and send them a pitch they can’t refuse.

Since they already covered your competitor, that means that they’re interested in your type of software/niche.

As long as your product is good and your pitch spot-on, they just DON’T have a reason NOT to write about you.

So, that brings us to **step #1**: Create a list of your competitors.

Then, Google their names with the following search query:

`[keyword] -site:[competitor’s website]`

Or, a real example:

`asana -site:asana.com`

What this does is, it gives you a list of website that talk about your competitor excluding their own domain.

For each media feature you find, extract the following information:

* **Media Name**. i.e. Huffington Post
* **Article Name**. i.e. “Asana launches new automation features”
* **Journalist Name**. i.e. MadeUp Mc Journalistson
* **Link to the Article**
* **Scoop**. What’s the article about?

Then, find each journalist’s email. To do this, use one of the gazillion email finder tools out there. Some of our favorites are:

1. [ClearBit Connect](https://connect.clearbit.com/)
2. [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/)
3. [Snov.io](http://snov.io/)

Finally, send a personalized email to each journalist. Here’s the template we like to use:

>**Subject: Your Article on \[Topic\]**  
>  
>Hey \[Name\],  
>  
>I saw that you wrote about \[Company They Covered\]’s new \[Feature / News\].  
>  
>Thought that you might be interested in covering \[Your Software Name\]. We’re like \[Company They Covered\], but with a different focus. What really makes us stand out is…  
>  
>\[Feature 1\]  
>  
>\[Feature 2\]  
>  
>\[Feature 3\]  
>  
>If you want to check it out, I created a special promo code that should give you free access to the software: \[promo code\]  
>  
>Let me know your thoughts!  
>  
>Best,  
>  
>\[You\]

Beware, though, that each email you send should be:

**1 - Personalized.** Don’t just send the same canned email to everyone. Actually understand the points the journalist is covering, and focus on those exact points in your email.

**Good Example:**

>Hey \[Name\],  
>  
>I’m writing to you about your article on \[Company X\]. You mentioned how you didn’t like \[Feature\] about \[Software\]. We agree - \[reasoning why this feature is bad / incomplete / whatever\].  
>  
>At \[Company Name\], we have a very similar product as \[Company X\], but we managed to make the \[feature\] a lot better by \[how\]. We thought you’d be interested in checking it out! Just use this promocode, and you’ll get a lifetime free account to give it a try!

**Awful Example:**

>“Hey Sir / Madam,  
>  
>I’m writing to you in regard to your article on \[topic\]. Very good article - super comprehensive! I, too, own such a SaaS product. Thought you’d want to give it a look too: \[link\]

**2 - Short and to the point.** A lot of CEOs we’ve worked with think their product is a LOT more than it actually is. Instead of focusing on the product in their email, they write like a long-form essay on what’s the mission of the company, what features they’re working on, etc.

**Newsflash**: no one cares. Stick to what features you have and how they differentiate you from the competition.

## Strategy #2 - Cross-promote with complementary products

This strategy isn’t as common, but with the right partner, it can really get you results.

The idea is, you find a partner that has something you want and offer an exchange. Some things you could swap are:

* **Product Feature Posts** \- Both parties create an article featuring the partner company’s product, and advertises it to their audience.
* **Email Blast** \- Send an email to your entire user base pitching the product. Make it convincing, and talk about how the partner’s product compliments yours (and suits the user’s needs).
* **Advertise on Facebook** \- Create an ad on Facebook promoting the partner’s product and target your user-base. To do this, extract the names/emails of your users, and upload them as a custom audience on Facebook.

Now, since all that is pretty vague, let’s cover a real-life case study.

## Case Study: Hired & Pocket

Pocket, if you haven’t heard of them, is an app for saving articles for offline reading. A TON of their users are techies & IT people.

Hired, on the other hand, is a reverse job board. Companies apply to developers, and devs get to pick where they want to work.

So, the two made a deal:

Pocket would blast an email promoting Hired.com to their audience of 1.7+ million people

In exchange, Hired would let Pocket hire several developers for free.

[Here’s what the email blast looked like](https://snipboard.io/2JyENh.jpg).

The deal was a win-win: Pocket saved themselves 5-6 figures for hiring costs (Hired.com charges up to $15K+ per successful dev hire), and [Hired.com got 40,000+ registrations](https://www.slideshare.net/_TheFamily/growth-case-study-hiredcom-building-foundations-for-scale-by-zack-onisko-vp-of-growth-at-hiredcom).

## Strategy #3 - Create a micro-site

A micro-site is a small web-based tool that solves a very specific need that your potential customers might have.

Then, you market the hell out of this tool and upsell your main product when possible.

For example, [HubSpot’s website grader](https://website.grader.com/) is a separate website/tool that helps you understand how well your website is optimized in terms of…

* General performance
* Mobile optimization
* SEO
* Security

It’s safe to assume that anyone that cares about how well their website performs could end up using one of HubSpot’s gazillion tools.

And then, of course, when you land on their tool, you [get an upsell for giving HubSpot a try](https://snipboard.io/bWQRC8.jpg).

According to the book [Traction](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Guide-Getting-Customers/dp/0976339609), the website grader was used by over **3 million websites** since it’s launch, and HubSpot gets a very decent number of leads from it every month.

Want another micro-site example?

If you dabble in SEO, you’ve probably heard of [UberSuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/).

In 2017, Neil Patel acquired it for $120,000, completely revamped the old design, and is now using it to generate leads.

Sure, the tool is 100% free, but if you want to get the most out of it, you have to sign up, and once you do, you get an [email from Neil upselling his agency](https://snipboard.io/dDp8Zn.jpg).

**If you'd prefer to read the script instead of watching the video, here it is:**

**The $100 Startup**

**By Chris Guillebeau**

**About The Author**

Chris Guillebeau is a world-traveler (he has travelled to 193 countries—out of 195 countries in the world), a public speaker, blogger, podcaster, and bestselling author who, in addition to the $100 startup, also saw massive success with his first book publication, ***The Art of Non-Conformity***. His books and blog focus on self-development, travel, and lifestyle (microbusiness) entrepreneurship.

**The Book’s Main Idea**

*“This book is for those who take action and those who provide the inspiration.”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

The $100 Startup is a business-centric book whose aim is to help prospective entrepreneurs become aware of the challenges that come with creating a successful small business that generates enough revenue to allow the entrepreneur to escape the 9-5 rat race and start living a ‘rich’ life.

*“The new reality is that working at a job may be the far riskier choice.”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

**A look at the main ideas shared in the book**

The book shares the following main ideas:

**1: Passion + good business sense is the magic formula**

*“The missing piece is that you usually don’t get paid for your hobby itself; you get paid for helping other people pursue the hobby or for something indirectly related to it.”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

The secret to all success is simple really: *capitalize on your passions but do so with good business sense by looking into how you can turn your skills (or passion) into a workable and successful product/or service.*

Aim to strike what Chris calls convergence, a state where your skills or passions are valuable in the sense that they intersect with the things/elements other people find useful. If you can strike this convergence and from it, package your passion/skills into a service or product a specific audience would find invaluably useful—in that it serves a purpose such as helping solve a problem—you will create a successful business because:

*“Passion or Skill + Usefulness = Success*

*Or*

*“(PASSION + SKILL) –> (PROBLEM + MARKETING) = OPPORTUNITY”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

For someone starting out in entrepreneurship—perhaps starting with $100 or less—to aim for this convergence, ask yourself, “Which skills or passions can I package into a valuable service,” or “what am I good at that I can offer to a ready audience?”

*“Ask three questions for every idea: a. How would I get paid with this idea? b. How much would I get paid from this idea? c. Is there a way I could get paid more than once?”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

**2: Where great business ideas come from**

If you have ever wondered where great ideas come from, Chris offers invaluable insight. He notes, “*Great ideas are everywhere. They are seized opportunities from an emerging technology, or a solution to a hidden or glaring problem.”*

To find a great business idea, aim for convergence of your passion and what is useful to others, but also cultivate a deep understanding of your target audience not based on conventional targeting wisdom—targeting audiences based on age, gender, income, etc.—but based on what matters the most to the people you intend to serve:

*""What do people really, really want? At the end of the day, they want to be happy, and businesses that help their customers be happy are well-positioned to succeed.""*

*Chris Guillebeau*

**3: Your success depends on the actions you take**

Success—business or otherwise—is not that complicated really. All you truly need to do is take action; yes, spend time planning—because failing to plan is planning to fail—but more importantly, spend more time acting. This is the secret to small business success.

*""There's nothing wrong with planning. But you can spend a lifetime making a plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action, action wins.""*

*Chris Guillebeau*

We are fortunate enough to live in an age where all the information we could ever need to succeed in our lives and businesses is readily available to us. At the click of a button, you can test business ideas, launch a microbusiness, and grow it into a thriving business. Without action, however, creating any sort of business success is impossible because:

*“Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.”*

*Chris Guillebeau*

Being an entrepreneur or microbusiness owner calls for what Chris calls, “planning as you go” or “bias towards action.” This means finding that convergence and then getting started with implementing your idea right away by creating and launching a prototype of your product/service. With the product/service in play, you can “learn and plan as you go” and scale your business.

**Conclusion**

All business success comes from action taken at the right time. As long as you can create something a specific audience will find valuable, you can create a low-startup cost business around it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/b45hfh/i_made_an_animated_summary_of_the_100_startup_by/,465,"Hi, I'm a CEO of a very successful business and (top tip alert) I often watch videos and read whilst I'm bearing down over the lavatory; this way I don't waste anytime that could be spent making pounds.

The new Macbook had only one type of connecter (Type C), and if you wanted to use anything with the old tech (Normal USB) , you needed an adapter. And that was expensive at BestBuy, so I competed. 

At first, I thought I should buy the entire docking station, and sell those. Here is an important lesson; **if Chinese sellers are selling something that is close to the retail price, abandon it. They have realized the market, and won't sell for cheap**. 

Back to the drawing board, I started using tools already on Amazon

* Check Amazon reviews; around 1% of people leave a review, and make sure there are recent reviews. Like reviews are this week
* Check sellers that dominate the market, and why they do. (If they are a brand, forget about it)
* Use incognito, and search on Amazon to kill any cookies. You need to know what your customer will see.

&#x200B;

2) Ordering the product

I found a Type C converter, and bang, went for it. So I headed to AliBaba

**I would no longer recommend buying from China. Due to the corana virus, your packages will be held back. Also on a moral note, I recommend you stop because of their treatment of Ughyrs, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Let alone the ignoring of IP.**

***So buy from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Turkey****.*

First thing I did was contact 6 suppliers. And see what they had to offer. On top of it, I began to watch videos of anything related to Type C. 

I stumbled on a Linus Tech Tip video. He talked about how type c connectors that have a seam in the middle are signs of bad quality, and the ones that came a whole piece, are much better quality. 

So I went back to my suppliers, and they all admitted that the ones they sell are the ones with seams. 

**Just because a seller on Amazon sells something more expensive then usual, does not mean it is automatically better quality.** 

Negotiate, Negotiate, Negotiate!

I was able to bring down my prices down by 2/3' d's. They make crazy ROI's on these things. It's acceptable, the more you order, the more leverage.

**Download WhatsApp for easier communication**

**Refer to yourself as a Employee at your company, not a sole worker, much harder to negotioate**

**If competition sells something for cheaper, screen shot it, and show it to them**

Here are the rules to tell your Supplier to prepare for Amazon;

1. MUST BE IN A CLEAR POLY BAG
2. Purchase a UPC code (For every variation, color, size, etc). Here is where I got mine:[https://www.codeupc.net/pages/buy-upc-codes](https://www.codeupc.net/pages/buy-upc-codes) (Not sponsored)
3. Tell them to print the code on the poly bag

Threaten to use AliBaba's protection policy if the order does not come as required, before buying, you have an area for notes. Add your requirments on the note section. 

**On mine, I added on the note section that they will come without Seam, as well, they will work for Macbook.**

Another thing I needed to make sure, is that you can fit 2 side to side on both Macbook Ports (Learned that from reading the bad reviews on other products) 

**Pay a little more, and use U.S shipping.** 

My product was smaller, so It was no issue.

**Dealing with a chinease shipping company is a night mare compared to U.S ones.**

I recommend UPS, but Fedex and other are good as well. 

3) Product is here, prepping it

I did not know of the UPC code requirement, so I ended up buying them, printing them on stickers, and staying up 2 nights sticking 1,000 stickers of barcodes on 1,000 products. 

**Make sure you adhere to the Shipping guidelines of Amazon, bag them as they say.**

4) Product is shipped to Amazon, what now?

The product took about 2 weeks to be available. Reason for this is because Amazon takes your packages, and uses Algorithims to see who will most likely buy it. Then sends those to nearby warehouses. You don't know where they would go. 

I first signed up to the ""Light weight"" Program

**DO NOT SIGN UP TO THIS PROGRAM.**

The program may seem to be cheaper, but in fact, you lose one-day shipping. Especially when you are dealing with a big competitor, this will basically break your product. 

\----------------- Pricing My Product, wasting $500 in ads -------------------

First thing I did, is price my product cheaper then the competition, sales where slow. 

So I watched the Gurus and, then, understood the Whole Amazon scam.

I made around $700 in sales in my first month with ads. After all said and done, I lost $300 that month. I bought my products for $450, and lost lot's of money. 

But it was kinda okay, since it gave me the momentum to be seen, and start selling without ads. 

So all those guys on Youtube ""OMG MADE $5,000 on a $400 INVESTMENT"" 

They will all show you the sales number, but never the Ad Money spent. 

**AMAZON has a support team that you can take advantage of that will help you price, and recommend how to move forward, take advantage of them.** 

So now, I began to price my product low, and always changed the price on a daily base. I know it's exciting and scary but **CALM DOWN, don't change your price every day. Wait at least a week to see trends.** 

What I was really happy for, was when my competitor began lowering their price. A MAJOR sense of accomplishment. That this company acknowledges you as a threat, feels good. 

Then, began realizing that I am still losing money, what 

**Amazon standard fee of $40 a month**

So, let's break it down.

Fees: 2.71

Price: 4.99

Profit: 2.28

40/2.28 = 12

So I needed to sell at least 17 to break even. I wasn't making that. So now, I decided to settle for $1 profit. And after 3 months of working, I finally turned 1 profit.

472,6mm8sc,False,,133,"How in 17 months we managed to bring an Impossible dream alive, today valued $3.500.000",Entrepreneur,"*Before starting this post we would like to set a couple of statements.*  


First of all, we’re writing this with a big smile and strong **emotions** in our heart.


Second, thank you. We want to say thanks to all the people making this subreddit great. 
We followed you guys for years, and sincerely you inspired us in starting this adventure and to achieve so much.


We are the three founders of an **Impossible idea** that day after day, night after night, became real. 
This reality is called *Movitra*.



And btw, sorry for the English. We are Italian! Pizza! Mandolino!


Our adventure starts in 2015.


We were having a good day at the beach, living life


Suddenly, a girl not above her 40’s hugged a little child and in doing so, her sunglasses dropped off, ruining the lenses on the gravel. Those pair of sunglasses were expensive and her disappointment was palpable.


We don’t know exactly what happened and what kind of reaction our brain had. But in that moment we had **The Idea**.


Everything was there, ready to be created. Movitra, The Impossible Spectacles.


Well ok, we didn’t came up with the name in that moment, but the concept of creating sunglasses with a *mechanism made to protect lenses from scratches* was there. The naming came time after.


After one month of hard working, we deposited our first patent (today there are 6).


The idea was simple: eyewear with a mechanism that permits to the glasses to rotate, using the frames to protect lenses.


In that phase of our life we discovered one of the most useful things ever:
**alone is not enough.**


We have learned that, simply, not everything is achievable alone.


* Want to patent something? *Look for help*.
* Want to write a catchy copy? *Look for help*.
* Want to create a logo? *Look for help*.


At the beginning, we  just planned to save money. 
But at the end that was just not worth it.


We were not great experts of the eyewear industry, but day after day we found ourselves full of passion and suddenly we built a culture about it.


We came across all sort of problems together.


At the start we wrote on a paper what we wanted for sure:
* Best materials.
* High social placement on the market.
* Follow our “Impossible” concept.
* Patents.
* Never stop to innovate.


Then we had to solve our main problems.


* **Money**.
* **Money**.
* **Money**.
* **Money**.
* Where to get **money**.
* Find partners.
* **Money**.


One year and 20k € after, we needed to make things serious.


We perfectly remember one of the most productive meetings.


The meeting was all about “How can we find the money to create Movitra”.
We just wanted the minimum money to start production, we weren’t looking for profits.


Now, don’t take me bad. Is not that we didn’t want to make money. We are not saint, we love to live life and have fun. And of course, we have our dreams and personal goals.


But in that moment, we were so united. We were a 3-man army. We weren’t thinking about the big money, we just wanted to start our business knowing that with our skills and the potential of the idea, more money would have just start coming by its own.


Anyways, in that meeting we analysed 3 solutions to get money *(if you know more ways maybe you can teach me something new :P)*.


* Being rich and do everything with your money. Of course is a valid alternative but way too risky. Also we weren’t capable of it.


* Ask to a bank. We didn’t trust this option. There were pros and cons but we weren’t comfy enough.


* Find business angels ready to give some cash in exchange of some shares.


We found the third option the most convenient.


Ok we had to give away part of Movitra but on the other hand we had the chance to decide **WHO** to bring on board. We chose 2 great professionals and entrepreneurs.


Near the end of 2015, we officially created **“Movitra – The Impossible Spectacles”** brand.


By this point we were 5 young and passionate humans.


We had enough money to start the production, and so we did.


You won’t read the WHOLE story because probably won’t fit in a book, but when you see “after one year” or some big-time jumps, we did a lot day by day. Every day. Every month. No weekends. Personally, we were always around talking with factories and industries, designing new models, creating our website.


And finally, our first glasses worked. And we loved it. And we continue to fall in love with our job every morning. 


We like to think we officially started in February 2016, with the first presentation of our eyewear in the place where all the fashion opinion were pointed atm: MIDO in Milan.


We worked with PR, Social Media, Advertising, design, graphics, and in less than 6 months, Movitra – The Impossible Spectacles were sold in more than 130 shops and optician around the globe.


Proudly, we would like to underline some shops like Barney’s in New York, Colette in Paris, Matches in London…


We chose to sell our eyewear through pre-collections and through optical markets.


While we had direct contacts with optical markets, pre-collections meant that buyers come to us and buy.


**Pros**: they come to us, so we don’t have to spend a lot of money traveling and in expensive hotels and cities.


**Cons**: Buyers buy, then sellers sell. This means sellers often don’t know our product, our philosophy, our concept. Some sellers don’t even know that our eyewear can rotate to protect lenses!


So on one hand we had a great potential. We were happy, sincerely focused on reaching high standards.
On the other hand, we had a lot of *problems*.


**Seriously.**

*Lot*

*of*

*problems.*

**Tons.**


You cannot even imagine. 


They were subtle, unnoticeable. 
But just like the feeling we had when the idea caught our brains, the sensation that something wasn’t working blew up our minds.


By that time we sold 5.000 sunglasses. Honestly we can’t say if this number, for a startup, is big or not. We just knew we were satisfied and had the resource to grow even bigger.


These are the problems we had:
• Be *recognized*. 
We received a lot of greetings and compliments about our style, our innovation, our invention and our patents. Sunglasses never used a similar mechanism to protect the lenses from scratches. Fashion magazines were showing us and quoting us. The problem at that point was that, once people used our sunglasses, it was not obvious that they were Movitra. They were just a pair of sunglasses on someone. We needed to leave a mark, to be characterized, to be indistinguishable.


* *Exclusiveness*. 
Our brand wasn’t viewed as special, unique, Impossible. And the only way to achieve this goal was to create an Impossible strategy. 


* Gain *margin*.
One of our main pillars has always been quality. This means we spend a lot of money to produce sunglasses and even more to pay licenses and patents all over the world. We had to find a more useful and profitable way to sell our product, bypassing the retail system.


**We hope you take these points in mind if you are going to startup soon.**


We had a real period of stress. The things were going fine but we were feeling inside that our ambition wasn’t going so far. 
Like… we achieved the sky but our goal was to be much much higher.


So, a couple of months ago, we had to play our cards and change something. 
One of us had this old friend he didn’t hear since at least a decade. They were really good friends, but time have put them apart.
Reading often the newspaper and marketing blogs and magazines, our partner knew his friend became Creative Director of one of the most well growing advertising agencies in Italy. We were embarrassed because our brand wasn’t big like the brands he was used to manage, but we had to call him.


*«Do you know those friendships that influence your life so deeply that even after a decade, just hearing a voice, you remember all the good old times? It’s simply what I felt when he answered my call with “Hello”.»*


When the Creative Director knew about Movitra, his story, his product, he fell in love with it.
We can’t say it for sure, but we’re pretty confident in saying that when he was talking about our brand, he was already starting to have great ideas and ways to promote it.


That week we had dinner together at least 3 times. *There was so much enthusiasm around that table!*


After a meeting with his whole creative department, we started working at the ideas.
We have to say one thing: we have been lucky: he believed so much in this project that everything was affordable.


**Meeting after meeting, things were building up.** 
We had a bomb ready to explode in our hands, but we as a team were a bit skeptical.
So one day, without any expectations we had a meeting where the creative department presented us **“ERROR404”**. 
A way to solve all our problems in just one product. 


**BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM**


We weren’t even ready for it, ahah.


We managed to create bicolor sunglasses aiming to be Impossible. 
Impossible in everything, starting from the naming. 
Impossible in the way of buying them. 
Since the high quality of the product and the tricky way of building it, we invented a “queue” system that permits just a couple of sales per day. This makes us manage in a more fluent and responsible way the production of ERROR404. 


Well, guys, the website is online **since the 1st of July (11 days ago) and we have more than 8000 people in queue to get our new product.** 
The production line is already finished and we are striving to find a way for producing them more. We avoid retailers, sending the product directly to customers, avoiding any type of useless cost and, *very important*, giving **free shipping**.


**People, magazines, influencers, print, everything is starting to talk about us and it’s incredibile!**


**Results?**
Today Movitra is valued **3 million €**. 
We plan to reinvest all the profits into the brand, communication and new patents. Mostly, we've never been so proud about work. 


**And trust us, we just started!**


If we should look back in this adventure, we would like to talk about what made our success, instead of the tiny mistakes. We think it’s important to see the bright side of something, and too often on this subreddit we see people asking *“what to avoid” “what don’t do” “5 mistakes that…”.*


**First, the commitment.** We had an idea and we pursued it so much that it became our life.


**Second, “Problem Solving Idea” it's more important than “Good Idea”.** Don’t look for the idea that can make you generate money like nobody else in the world. Go out, have fun, meet new people, with the constant thought that all the problems that you find out there may be solved in a creative and never-seen-before way. This excite us so much!


**Third, execution.** A nice idea well executed will find its success. A good idea badly executed will never see birth.


**Fourth, aim high.** *Never be satisfied. We are? No. We’re happy.*


Probably we skipped a lot of little steps in this process, like our commitment for the design of the product and the logo, how we came up with the name (latin union of words Movere and Vitra (Movement and glass), how exactly the patent works, who are we and so on. We ask sorry for this, but the time is short.


**Of course if you have any questions, doubts, curiosity or else, feel free to ask in private message or here. 
We will answer, promise.**


P.S. We just wanted to make a short post saying thank you to the community, but came up with this...


**P.P.S. Thank you.**


*TL;DR: We were at the beach. Had an idea. Worked day and night for 2 years . Invented a product. And now the goal is to grow a lot more and achieve TONS of dreams.*

**wow! wow! wow! We wouldn't expect all this curiousity around the world of our brand and our story! This makes us even more proud and more committed to this project. We are really sorry if someone has made a question and we didn't answer, but we are trying our best. If we skipped your comment please let us know via PM**

Here is some new information inspired by you guys.



**EDIT 1:**


* *Can I get a code to skip the queue on your website and be your influencer?*

Sincerely, we thought about it. Probably is not the right choice for the brand, but is our choice: we will not give codes here on reddit, since we don't want to make our presence just a marketing stuff. We are here to share our opinions, our dreams and our experience, not to sell anything. Pardon.


* *How did you guys managed to find angels?*


We didn't found our partners on a dedicated platform or some kind of event. With humility, and of course with a strong market research and a business plan, we asked to our closest friends if they wanted to join our big dream by investing in it. They spread the request via word of mouth, and finally two guys we trust showed up.


* *Can we have more infos about your patents?*

When we had the idea, we started to search if someone had already a patent on the mechanism. Nobody did. At the beginning we looked for our idea on google, then on google patents. We did at least 3-4 days of research before being sure that nobody ever did the same thing. So we started to call some patent offices. They told us that we had the requirements to do it. So we chose one of the best ones because we were sure about the potential of our idea and didn't want any kind of problems.
Patents have been one of the most expensive things in creating Movitra. First, we set the patent request in Italy, where the brand was born. This request gave us worldwide coverage for 12 months plus 18 months thanks to a technical procedure called PCT. This step was worth 10k€. After the expiration of these 30 months, we had to set our patents worldwide state by state. Each nation asked us from 4k to 20k euros. This price increases every year because the nation thinks that if you renew it it's because you earned money from it.


* *How did you choose the factory?*

Choosing the right factory has been a loooooong and hard adventure. We are based in Italy, and in the region called Veneto there are a lot of factories. For 2 weeks we travelled there trying to find the right one for us. Some said our project was impossible, others were expensive, others were too cheap. At the end, we took a risk: we chose the most expensive one that was already working with giants of the eyewear industry. We spent more money, but we are sure of the quality of our product.


* *What does it mean to ""well execute"" an idea?*

In our case, well executed idea has a lot of meanings.

• Make a quality product that works.

• Respect the timings and the deadlines. Both brand side and factory side.

• Respect and talk with our customers, be interested in them, hear them.

• Back office and distribution.

• Caring about communication.

• Be smart choosing the best way to achieve results such as: creating a website, building up the shipping methods.

• And much more.

766,3v43nz,False,,62,A beginners guide to importing electronics from China,Entrepreneur,"Hey guys, 

Me again with another post in regards to importing from China. I've previously posted with similar subjects [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/34x4l5/case_study_importing_a_power_bank_from_china_all/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/38i1yq/alibaba_hacks_the_most_efficient_way_to_find/). 

I wanted to give you a rundown on the essential requirements & regulations when importing electronics from China to the US & Europe. 

I have recently been asked a few times to write about regulations for electronics and why I chose electronics. I choose electronics for myself because I’ve been in this category for nearly 17 years so I feel confident importing/exporting them. 

Many “gurus’ will tell you to shy away from electronics because of the regulations, high returns and what to do with defective items. While I do agree that a beginner should stay away from electronics I do encourage you to import electronics at one point because the margins are higher than your standard household product.

Especially if you have it OEM manufactured products (your own design/software/application). However manufacturing an electronic OEM item requires profound technical knowledge (or at least a knowledgable factory and engineers) and financial pre-investment in most cases.


Most suppliers won’t offer free services to help develop the product unless you commit with a certain order quantity, have yearly agreements or previous (mostly large) business with the factory.


Why is it so difficult to find manufacturers who comply with regulations already?
Most suppliers that develop a new product do not invest in the certifications in the beginning because they don’t know yet if the product actually sells so why invest in certifications that can run into thousands of dollars?


Try to work and find suppliers who mainly work with larger European and US customers or retailers that did the work for you already. Because when retailers look for electronics they will absolutely make sure that they comply with the law.
You will want to buy from factories that are either compliant already or are willing to work together with you to get the product compliant.


Dismiss suppliers who aren’t interested in making the product compliant if the response is something like: “all the other buyers also don’t need it”. Ideally you can convince the supplier to invest his money into certifications and making the product compliant for different markets and regulations because it also benefits him. The more clients he can sell his products to (because they are certified) the better for him too.

Lets take a look at general regulations first.

**EUROPE**
 
Europe is generally stricter than the US and has a couple more regulations that are to be met if you wish to import legally to Europe.

**CE**

The CE marking is a mandatory conformity marking if you want to import into Europe. It basically confirms that your product is manufactured according to certain European standards. It covers most standards and this is the absolute minimum you need to have when importing to Europe, no matter which product actually. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE_marking
Required by law: YES

**GS**

GS or “Gepruefte Sicherheit” is a quality seal issued by a third party laboratory and mostly recommended if sold as a retailer or to retailers. It is voluntary and NOT required by law but it has been an established trust and quality seal commonly known by consumers, especially in Germany. The requirements to get a GS certificate is higher than the one for CE. GS is not available or doesn’t make sense on several products such as battery operated items. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gepr%C3%BCfte_Sicherheit
Required by law: NO, voluntary and used as a seal of quality for consumers. 

**R&TTE**

This directive covers any radio-transmitting device and is usually already covered within a GS or CE certification.
http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/electrical-engineering/rtte-directive/index_en.htm
Required by law: YES, any of the following products need to comply: WiFi, Bluetooth products and Radio-Emitting devices (Smartphones, tablets, smart devices)

**LVD**

The Low Voltage Directive does not supply any specific technical standards that must be met, instead relying on IEC technical standards to guide designers to produce safe products. Products that conform to the general principles of the Low Voltage Directive and the relevant particular safety standards are marked with the CE marking to indicate compliance and acceptance throughout the EU.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Voltage_Directive
Required by law: YES applicable to products or electrical equipment with a voltage at input or output terminals between 50 and 1000 volts for alternating current (AC) or between 75 and 1500 volts for direct current(DC)

**EMC**

EMC or “Electro Magnetic Compatibility” regulates that the products may not interfere with other electronics products. Meaning that components of a product need to be manufactured according to several CE or GS standards to comply. If your product has a GS certificate EMC will usually be tested. Some CE certification and test reports include EMC testing. Make sure to check this in the report. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_compatibility
Required by law: YES but different nations can require compliance with different standards. In European law, manufacturers of electronic devices are advised to run EMC tests in order to comply with compulsory CE-labeling. EU directive 2004/108/EC (previously 89/336/EEC) on EMC defines the rules for the distribution of electric devices within the European Union.

**ROHS Directive**

RoHS or the “Restriction of Hazardous Substances” regulates the allowed content of 6 substances within the product. These are: Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium, PBB & PBDE. It is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to solve the problem of huge amounts of toxic e-waste. Most suppliers have at least a report for the incoming raw-materials that they later use for the final product. So while they do not have a RoHS certificate for the entire product they may have the material tested which is generally accepted by authorities.
Required by law: YES, however raw material report as opposed to full report is widely accepted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive

**REACH Directive**

Most suppliers have never heard of REACH altough it has been around since 2007. It is essentially the upgrade to RoHS but regulates more chemicals and substances. It has different phases that regulate the chemicals used in manufacturing and once in full force all importers need to comply (within the European Union). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration,_Evaluation,_Authorisation_and_Restriction_of_Chemicals
Required by law: YES

**WEEE Directive**

The Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directive is mandatory to be fullfilled by the manufacturer. The marking needs to be on the sales packaging or product.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Electrical_and_Electronic_Equipment_Directive
Required by law: YES but different nations can require compliance with different standards.

**Sub – Regulations & Directives**

Each of the above have several sub-regulations that have to be met. But generally if you buy a certian product from a supplier and it is say for example CE or FCC certified it should have automatically been certified by the sub-regulation.

 
**UNITED STATES**

The US generally has “loose” regulations compared to the authorities in Europe. Having said that I do recommend that you comply to all regulations as you don’t want to import a product that can cause fire or other hazards. “Loose regulations” also doesn’t mean that they are actually loose because you still are required to comply but again, Europe is stricter when it comes to enforcing and checking at customs or at retailers. A FCC certification is usually obtainable for a couple hundred $ while a GS certificate can go into the thousands. Of course there are products that are highly technical and or pose a risk or hazard and are difficult to certify by FCC for example.

**FCC**

The FCC basically regulates anything that is electronic including WiFi, Bluetooth, Radio transmission etc. You will want any device that you import that is electrical and remitting radio waves (in any way) certified by the FCC.
There are two regulations within FCC for both Intentional & Un-Intentional radiators. Intentional radiators for example are: Bluetooth speakers, WiFi devices, radios or smartphones. Unintentional radiators are: Headphones, Earphones, power packs, PCB’s etc.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_Declaration_of_Conformity
Required by law: YES

**UL**

UL is a certification company that certifies your product according to several different standards. Say if you have a FCC certification you may still need to certify by UL, especially if you are a retailer. It’s a seal of quality that consumers appreciate on certain products https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization)
Required by law: NO/Voluntary and used as a seal of quality for consumers.

**RoHS**

RoHS is also recognised in the US and widley available at suppliers. RoHS self declarations are generally accepted by authorities.
Required by law: NO

Further information you should be aware of

**Full certification**

Having a full certification on a product is the best and safest way to go. What does that actually mean? Lets look at an example: You want to import a hair trimmer/clipper. The hair clipper itself runs on a integrated rechargeable battery. The battery is charged via a universal external charger/adpater with a plug. In 90% of the cases the supplier will only have a FCC/GS/CE certificate for the charger/adapter. Why?


Because the adapter can be certified with GS/FCC/CE easily and can be used on hundreds of different products that need a universal charger. So it makes sense for the manufacturer to certify the charger because he can sell it with different products and only needs to certify the adapter  once. He can also sell his charger to other suppliers who are in need of universal chargers only for their products. While the hair trimmer is a separate unit in itself and may not sell well. So why would the factory pay a lot of money to certify an entire product if they may not sell it.


If possible find a manufacturer who has a fully certified product. Those are likely suppliers who work with large western retailers. Having said that if say the charger has a full certification like GS/CE or FCC and the hair trimmer itself only has CE it is also acceptable to authorities. If you want to make sure that you comply or satisfy authorities you may ask the supplier to issue a Letter of Guarantee that the entire product has been manufactured according to standard or regulation “X”. But satisfying authorities should not be your eventual goal. Your eventual goal should be to import a safe and reliable product that lasts and delivers good reviews or sales.


A full certification is quite expensive and therefore not often found. Yet some markets like Germany demand full certification especially from retailers. If you are an online seller and your exposure to the authorities is minimal you could start by meeting only minimum requirements (CE, FCC for example).

**Labelling & Marking**

The following markings must be on the final packaging or box in which the product is sold to the customer where applicable:

WEEE, FCC, CE, GS, Made in China, Recycle symbol 

I say applicable because as mentioned not every product needs to comply with above regulations.
You will also want to put all labels and markings of the product on the Instruction Manual. Electronic products usually have instruction manuals so you’ll want to show in there what your product complies with.

You are actually required by law to mark all regulations met, either on the box of the product or inside the instruction manual (if there is no space on the sales packaging).

**Returns and damaged products**

Unfortunately returns of electrical products can be as high as 20% in some cases. That could be due to poor manufacturing, faulty components that didn’t get checked properly, the client mishandling (or misunderstanding) the product and several other reasons. It comes with the territory when selling electronics and the only thing you can do as a seller is to take care of the manufacturing side and handle returns from customers with proper manner. Don’t try to argue with customers and simply refund or exchange the product for a new one.


However you should collect all data collected from returns and defects and claim the lost profit/money from your supplier when or if you re-order. Make sure to communicate the issues to the factory and have them deduct the total amount lost from the next invoice. Send all material that you can gather from your customers to the supplier to have a strong case against the supplier. If you aren’t going to re-order (maybe because of the issues) try to get the defect/returned units replaced by him or even better a cash payment in the amount of your loss. The latter may be more difficult as suppliers will want to have you re-order before they give out any money for returns.

**Self-declarations**

In some cases it doesn’t make sense to certify a product because your quantities are low or the product is so cheap that the certification cost don’t justify certifying it. In that case you may ask the supplier to issue a self-declaration which is in some cases accepted by authorities. Please note that you cannot issue a self-declaration, it has to be done by the manufacturer.
 

You would at least need to be compliant with basic requirements like raw material being certified or tested and according to regulations. However most countries in Europe only allow CE or RohS self-declarations for several items, mainly low voltage or battery powered products. Check with your supplier what he can offer you.

**Lets take a look at a few examples**

Please note that the following are recommendations and there may be additional requirements for each country depending on your sales channel.
I know for a fact that many importers ignore these regulations, hoping not to get caught.
I am not telling you what you should or shouldn’t do but many countries have lax enforcements so importers simply ignore it. I personally like to have everything in order and proper certification to avoid any problems in the future.
It’s best to check with a third-party inspection company but this should get you started when sourcing for electronics:

**Bluetooth Speaker (Low Voltage product)**
EU: CE, REACH, ROHS, LVD, R&TTE & GS on the adpater recommended if product comes with a external charger (they usually come with USB charging cables)
US: FCC, UL recommended if you are a retailer
Not to forget that you need to pay BIG (Bluetooth Interest Group) a fee of 8000US$ (4000$ if you are a member) if you are planning on private labelling your product. Prior to February 2014 private labelers were able to register their private label under the manufacturers Bluetooth chip license but BIG changed that and made it not possible anymore. I know that there are many small time buyers who don’t care and risk it because its still a grey area but basically they are illegally branding Bluetooth products.

**Solar powered garden lamp (Low Voltage product)**
This is a very simple product but highly competitive. The good news is that they are battery operated and low voltage powered.
EU: CE self declaration, RoHs self-declaration
US: FCC self declaration

**Vacuum cleaner (High Voltage product)**
EU: CE, GS recommended, RoHS, REACH, EMC
US: FCC, UL recommended

Wired-Headset (Non-Bluetooth, no direct Voltage)
EU: CE, RoHS self declaration
US: FCC self declaration

**Miscellaneous**

Many small importers in Europe or the US illegally import products hoping not to get caught (or not knowing there are regulations to be met). Basically playing with fire just to save a couple hundred dollars on certifications and compliant products.
Also paying for a certification report doesn’t mean your supplier can comply with the regulation. Before you place an order with the factory make sure to ask him that the material and components will actually pass a FCC or CE testing for example, otherwise you waste money on a certification and the product may not even pass the requirements.

 
One thing that I recommend beginners with electronics is to have the certifications from the supplier verified by a third-party. If you work with a third party inspection company like Asiainspection, TUV, SGS or others they are usually open to check certificates for you. That is if you already do business with them otherwise they charge a small fee. You can simply ask your contact at the third-party inspection company to look over the documents that the supplier sent you.
 

Do not engage with a supplier or product that cannot comply to regulations otherwise your products might be seized by customs or even have to be withdrawn from the market if an authority finds out you do not comply with regulations.

 
If a supplier tells you he doesn’t have the necessary certification and “its ok his other customers also don’t need it” stay away or be prepared to invest a couple hundred US$ for a certification (FCC or CE usually goes from 400-600US$).


Yes, it is sometimes a grey area, especially in the US if you ship things by Air directly to Amazon for example that you do not get caught, but I do not recommend going this way.


If a supplier doesn’t have a certificate or is unwilling to invest in it move on to the next supplier. However if you are willing to invest yourself in the certification (make sure to ask the supplier if the product can pass first) I would recommend to do so. Furthermore if you invest into a certificate you will be the holder of the certificate and the supplier is not allowed to sell the product with certification to anyone else but you. This applies to all certifications.

**Inspections**

I can’t stress enough how important inspections are, especially with electronics. You will want your goods to be inspected to avoid a high rate of returns,defects or not compliant manufactured products. Pre-Shipment inspections can save you a lot of troubles and are well worth the investment. The inspectors will not only test the product but they will also make sure that all is compliant with laws and regulations.

**Product Liability Insurance**

I also recommend once you import electronics in larger quantities that you contact your local insurance company and have a product liability insurance on your products. This is to protect yourself from any unforseeable issues.
Even you may have manufactured a product to the best of your knowledge something can go wrong or someone mishandled the product but you may not proof it. For example a few years ago I worked for this large German retailer and we had a fan heater manufactured to all possible standards and regulations.


One day a customer hired a lawyer and sent a letter to the retailer explaining his house has burnt down because of the fan heater he bought from them and he is looking for compensation and a full law suit. Since the fan heater was manufactured in China and sourced trough the buying office I worked for I was put in charge of the situation. When I heard of the problem the first step was obviously to speak to the supplier, check the certificates and look at the Inspection. All was in order, the said unit was manufactured at the highest standards and we suspected that the customer covered the fan heater with a towel and thats why the unit started burning.


However we couldn’t proof that and the client won the lawsuit. The retailer had coverage from his product liability insurance and at least the financial damage was settled. The bigger damage was obviously the public problem they had but at least the financial issue was off the table.

**Summary**

So what do you actually need for sure? Thats difficult to say as it depends on the product and ideally you will want the supplier to provide you all of the above. But realistically that never happens. In most cases suppliers do not even have CE certification which is actually easily obtainable. I can only recommend to have a supplier who has the minimum requirements such as FCC and CE certification.


RoHS is also easily obtainable these days and if a supplier doesn’t even have a self-declaration or certification for incoming raw materials look elsewhere. Unfortunately each product has different regulations however above general guidelines give you an idea what to look for. Also there is no website that tells you exactly what you need for which market (Business Idea??? :) ) and all is done trough research or ideally you speak with your third-party inspection company. In most cases they will charge you for giving out this information but if you work with them for a while already they might do you a favour and give you the information for free.

540,guk5en,False,,140,A lesson from a failed startup,Entrepreneur,"I ﻿spent almost a year working on a habit tracking app called ﻿﻿﻿[*habitly*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/habitly-habit-tracker/id1464807438)﻿, and it failed. ﻿﻿There are many reasons why it failed, but in this post I want to talk about just one. Since it has become a valuable lesson for me I ﻿think it could help you too.

# ﻿Customer feedback

﻿﻿My app had a horrible [retention rate](https://imgur.com/gallery/2WNN8r8). I thought one way I could improve the retention rate, was to add features that the users want. The most requested feature at the time was the ability to add one off tasks. So thats what we added.

2 weeks of designing and 2 weeks of development later the new update is out. Habitly is now a habit tracker combined with a to-do list.﻿

# ﻿The result

* Less than 1% of users used the new feature
* ﻿The retention rate went down

﻿What just happened... The users literally requested this and none of them use it...

# Value proposition

Habitly's value proposition is to help people track their habits. And adding a to-do list provides no value to the people who download the app to track their habits. **In fact it actually made the app worse...**

One of the consequences of allowing people to create one off tasks was that it increased the number of steps needed to create a habit. It made the app more complicated.

&#x200B;

# ﻿Build on top of your value proposition

Every single aspect of your business should be built ON TOP OF your value proposition. For example, we should've only added features that helped people track there habits. When marketing we should communicate our app as ""The best way to track your habits"".

Every single decision you make should be based off of your value proposition.

# Better alternatives

The value of having all your habits and tasks in one app isn't enough to convince a person to use the app when both the habit tracking features and the task features suck.   There are popular apps/software where every single feature is based around creating the best to-do list. We only had one feature.  Clearly people are going to use alternatives.

# Sidenote

This may sound obvious to many of you but it wasn't for me when I started. One other lesson I learned was don't spend 4 weeks on a feature that nobody wants.

This isn't a self promo for habitly. I stopped working on it months ago and it's free.

36,fzsn7v,False,,304,How to get rich without being lucky ( Picked up from twitter),Entrepreneur,"Pre note: First Silver ! Elated much :)
—————————————

Hi Folks!

Picked up an interesting (and much famous thread) from twitter by a user named Naval (founder of AngelList) on twitter.

Here's a summary of the tweetstorm.

Link to the twitter thread -   [https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) 

 \---------------------

Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.

Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.

Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.

The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.

Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.

Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.

Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.

Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.

Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.

When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.

Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.

“Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”  
\- Archimedes

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.

Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.

Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.

Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.

If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.

There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.

Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.

Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.

You should be too busy to “do coffee,"" while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.

Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.

Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.

Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you.

Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.

When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.



Have a great day :)

Mods: Please let me know if there is anything that I should change in this post. I truly want to bring value to the r/Entrepreneur community because it has helped me out a lot in the past. If you're looking for the exact templates I used, you can find out how to get them at the bottom of the post.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Unfortunately, getting new clients is one of the biggest challenges that agencies face. According to a study by Hubspot, 60% of agencies say that their biggest pain point is finding new clients.

When asked what’s preventing their agency from growing as quickly as they would like, 55% said that they need more sales and/or marketing. It’s obvious that getting clients is the #1 concern for most agencies.

As a freelancer, getting clients is at the top of my list as well. In all honesty, I don’t have a diverse number of ways to get clients. I’m not a content marketer, I don’t know paid ads, and I’m not a great networker either.

But, one thing I am good at is getting sales on the phone and via email. After recently going full-time as a freelancer and working on building my business, I have more time to prospect and getting more clients has become one of the main focuses in my business.

I’ve done lots of cold calling in the past but never to sell content writing services. I feel that cold calling is a better channel for selling digital marketing services rather than just selling content writing.

I have content writing clients that I’ve worked with for years that I’ve never spoken to on the phone so I know that it’s not necessary to speak on the phone to secure these types of clients.

**What’s Stopping You From Getting Results With Cold Email**

So, we know that cold email, done properly, works. But, there are some roadblocks to getting good results

**Time**

Sending out targeted, well-written emails takes time. Finding the right prospect, doing research, crafting the right email, etc.

**Copywriting and Targeting**

You have to send the email to the right person and your email copy has to pique their curiosity enough to get them to reply to your message.

**Attention**

People’s inboxes are getting slammed these days. The fight for attention is brutal. According to DMR, In 2018 the average office worker sends out 31 emails and receives 94 every day.

**Follow up**

I’m sure you’ve heard the old saying that the fortune is in the follow-up. It’s true. According to Marketing Donut, it takes at least five follow up attempts after initial contact before a customer says yes. They also found that 92% of salespeople give up after no number 4 meaning only eight percent of people asking for the sale a fifth time. This infers that 8% of salespeople are closing 8-% of sales. Following up is mandatory if you want to make sales.

But, if you’re sending out a large amount of email to new prospects every day the number of follow up emails you’re sending can add up quick. No one wants to spend their whole day stuck in their inbox.

But, what if you could use automation to scale cold email? Instead of sending out manual, personalized emails one by one you could send personalized emails with automated follow up. If you’re interested in getting the results of a great cold email campaign without a ton of manual work, keep reading.

**Very Important: Please Read**

For this experiment, I decided to send short emails and use automation instead of manually sending emails and personalizing them. There are a lot of people who crush it by spending more time on their campaigns and I know for a fact that more personalized and targeted emails get better open and response rates but they also take longer to create and send.

I wanted to see how quickly I could put together a winning campaign instead of sending out personalized cold emails manually. What works best is figuring out what works for you and your business. Test out both methods and see what you like best. Now, back to the case study.

**The Three Apps You Need to Create an Automated Email Lead Gen System**

I wanted to get advice on an unrelated business problem so I booked a consulting call with Kai Davis through Clarity.fm – an online platform for getting business advice from experts via a phone call. Kai helps consultants get more clients without spending more on marketing.

The conversation eventually led to getting customers and on that call, he gave me insight into a part of his outbound marketing stack that changed the game for me. First, let’s do a quick rundown of the tech:

**Mailshake**

Co-founded by Susan Patel, this is an awesome tool that scales cold outreach by not only letting you mail merge your contacts but it also follows up with your prospects unless a certain condition is met like your recipient clicking on a link or replying to your email. This tool saves an enormous amount of time because it essentially lets you “set and forget” your campaign. Well, you can’t exactly forget about it but it will save you from having to do a ton of follow up.

**Pipedrive**

This is an outstanding CRM because it’s incredibly simple. It allows you to stay organized without all the bells and whistles that are in other CRMs. This tool really comes in handy when you’re handling a large volume of email because you can respond to email, create deals, and move deals between stages all within the app. No need to switch back and forth between Gmail and Pipedrive. You can handle everything within Pipedrive.

**G Suite**

I try to work with Google products whenever possible. They’re simple, easy to work with, and great for collaboration because just about everyone uses at least one Google product.

G Suite is really useful when you’re cold-emailing because your send limits with a free Gmail account are only 200 emails/day but with a paid G Suite account you can send up to 2,000/day.

I don’t send anywhere near that many (only \~250/day) but it’s nice to know that I can send as much email as I need to without worrying about getting thrown in Google jail, i.e. getting my account suspended for going over my send limits.

**How to Get Clients with Automated Cold Email Lead Generation**

So, now we’ll get into how the whole system works. Try to stick with me here.

Kai told me how he uses Mailshake to send out cold email campaigns to a list of prospects by linking the Mailshake app to his G Suite Gmail. Gmail is also linked to Pipedrive (called two-way sync) so that all sent and received Gmail messages show up in Pipedrive automatically.

Once someone replies to your email you can go into Pipedrive and manage it, i.e. create a deal, delete the email, etc.

This keeps everything organized and makes dealing with massive amounts of email much easier. Without this setup you would have to send initial and follow up emails out manually, deal with tons of message threads, and keep track of my deals in some other way.

This setup made it incredibly easier to scale outreach. With my framework in place, all that was left to do was write my email sequence, gather my prospects, and start firing off some emails.**Getting Clients – Step by Step**

To execute this cold email campaign there are a few things I had to do.

**Find Targets**

First, I needed to figure out who I would be emailing exactly. There’s a lot of talk online about creating customer personas using demographics and psychographics. Understanding your customer is good practice in sales and marketing but I prefer to follow Dan Noriss’ advice from the book, “Content Machine”.

Dan built a seven-figure business, WP Curve, using content marketing with $0 spent on advertising and he eventually sold it to GoDaddy. He obviously knows content marketing. In the book, he says to make content for a community instead of individual personas.

Although I wasn’t looking to find a community for content marketing purposes, I decided to adapt it to my approach because I was still looking to get my prospects to take action. I decided to contact agencies that offer SEO because they always need content. I’ll get into who I decided to target at the agencies later.

To find the agencies I went to Clutch.co. If you aren’t familiar with Clutch.co, it’s pretty much Yelp for digital agencies.

When it comes to actually getting the data it’s a pretty tedious process but there are lots of tools that can help like LinkedIn Navigator, Hunter, and Find That Lead.

Once you find the data you’ll need to test the emails using something like Mailtester.com, Verifyemailaddress.com, or Email-Checker.com.

You can either find it yourself or pay someone else to do it. I decided to outsource the work. I went over to Fiverr and found a provider that offered an appropriate gig, i.e., I’ll find X number of leads $X. My lead cost ended up being $.20/lead.

When it came to figuring out who to contact I decided to start with directors and managers of Content, SEO, etc. of the agencies.

I figured that those people were in charge of content and content writers so they would be the right ones to target. I got decent results with that. More on that later. But things really kicked up a notch when I decided to do two things.

**1. The Waterfall Technique**

I found out about the Waterfall Technique by watching Bryan Kreuzberger on an episode of Andrew Warner’s Mixergy show. Bryan Kruzeberger used the Waterfall Technique to win $20 million in business from companies like MasterCard, Bank of America, and Home Depot. So, let’s get into the technique.

Bryan would write separate emails to the CEO, CMO, VP of Marketing, and Director of Marketing. This technique banks on the fact that CEOs love to delegate. The CEOs won’t respond to you’re email but they’ll delegate it out to the right department, i.e., they will forward the email. Your message will move down the ladder like a waterfall and flow to the right person.

You’re using the company’s hierarchy to your advantage. Instead of spending a ton of upfront time trying to reach the decision maker and emailing him or her directly, and probably getting your email deleted, your email will get passed down from the CEO and the person you want to reach has a better chance of responding because they’re getting your email passed down from their boss instead of you directly.

I use a slight variation in that I don’t email several people at each company. I only email one. I’ve found a lot of success using this technique. You save time by not having to find the decision maker and you have a higher probability of getting a reply.

**NOTE:** If you’re using Mailshake, make sure that you check your campaigns every day. If you get a response to one of your emails that isn’t a direct reply, your campaign will keep going and you may continue to email a company that you’re already in a conversation with.

You don’t want to keep them in your email campaign when you’re already talking to someone else at the company. Instead, you’ll want to pause them or unsubscribe them from your campaign.

**2. Niching Down**

Number two was to niche myself down. Instead of just offering general content writing services, I tested niching myself down to legal content writing and as a writer that was local to the Chicago area so I had to tweak my messaging just a bit.

My hook was that I am a former law student so I have more knowledge of legal issues than the average freelance writer. For my local pitch, my hook was that I was local to the Chicago area I saw a much better response to my emails once I did this.

Writing and Scheduling the EmailsThe next thing I had to do was write and schedule the emails. If there’s one thing I know it’s that the fortune truly is in the follow-up.

Most people will ignore your first attempt at outreach but after several well-crafted follow-ups, you’re much more likely to get their attention and get a reply. After doing some research I came across a few awesome blog posts by Steli Efti at Close.io about writing good follow-up emails.

After reading these articles I was able to write and schedule eight emails in Mailshake.

Here was the sequence:

Initial EmailsFollow-up 1 day laterFollow-up 2 days laterFollow-up 5 days laterFollow-up 7 days laterFollow-up 7 days laterFollow-up 14 days laterFollow-up 14 days later

**Email Timing**

There was no hard and fast rule on when I would send out emails. I wanted to test as much as possible. I did notice that early in the morning and late at night towards the middle of the week did well, i.e., around 5 am local time Tuesday through Thursday. The weekend was also good too – Saturday/Sunday morning and afternoon were also good times.

**Email Copy**

When I wrote my emails I had one goal. That was to get a reply, i.e. start a conversation. The problem with most cold emails is that they are too long, too detailed, and they ask for too much. Here’s a terrible cold email that was originally published on Jill Konrath’s blog as an example on how not to write a cold email.

**Why This Email is Bad:**

**Too long** – Coming from an unknown sender, this is too long for anyone to read.

**Too “Me” oriented** – Immediately goes into how good the sender’s company is. This is a big no-no.

**Too big of an ask** – This immediately asks for a phone call. The prospect doesn’t know who you are. No one wants to jump on the phone with a stranger who is trying to sell them.

**Too much, too soon** – The sender jumps right into the service offering without the prospect showing any interest.

The goal of a cold email isn’t to sell. The goal is to get the prospect’s attention and get a reply. I even consider “no” a good response because at least I got a definitive answer. The worst response you can get is no response. Here’s the initial email I used:

Subject: quick question

Hey {{first name}},

Was hoping you could point me in the right direction. Are you the contact at {{company name}} that handles content for clients and if not could you please let me know who is?

If so, I'm curious - would you be interested in working with a reliable freelance writer that's local to the Chicago area? I would be happy to send over links to a few sites where I've been published.

Thanks in advance,

**Why this email is good:**

**It’s short and to the point** – People don’t have time to read cold emails all day. Try to keep your email to 2 – 3 sentences. If it can fit on a smartphone screen, you’re good.

**Show value and spark curiosity** – Briefly let your prospect know what’s in it for them and build in a little curiosity to get them to ask for more. You don’t want to give away the farm in the first email. Keep them guessing just enough to make them hit the reply button.

**Give them an out** – Make it easy for them to say “yes” or “no”. In the email, I explicitly state how the prospect should respond to the email if they want to move forward or if they want to stop receiving emails. They don’t even have to think about what they should say next (this is good).

I agree that personalized emails have a much better chance of getting a response but for this campaign, I was really going for speed and efficiency. If I was selling a higher priced service, or to a larger organization, I would have given more thought to making my emails more personalized.

Also, humor works well 🙂

**Following Up Is Non-Negotiable**

The topic of follow up deserves it’s own post altogether. Follow up isn’t just good practice. It’s vital to your email campaigns. If you don’t follow up, you won’t sell.

Tools like Mailshake are great for automatic follow up on ice cold prospects but once someone engages with your email, it’s your turn to manually take over and show some salesmanship. Most cold email information on the web is just about the initial email template but your follow up game will have to tight (great) to win deals.

Handling ResponsesYou’re going to have to wade through tons of email during this process. This part requires a lot of heavy lifting. You’re essentially panning for gold – sifting through mountains of sand to find your gold.

Some will be flakes and others will be nuggets. What you do at this point can make or break all the work you have done up till now so you want to make sure you get it right. There are four types of responses you will get to your emails:

**1. Bounces2. No response3. Go to hell or No thanks4. Interested**

**Bounces**

Remove these from your campaign at the end of the day so that you don’t email them again. No need to clog up your inbox with bounce messages.

**No Response**

There’s nothing you can really do with no responses. The best thing you can do with these people is to save them in an excel sheet and put them in a new campaign with a different angle in about six months or target someone else at the company.

**Go to Hell or No Thanks**

You’ll need some thick skin when you execute mass email campaigns because you’re going to get some venom thrown back at you.

Just make sure to take them out of your campaign, move on, and don’t sweat it. But don’t forget to take a screenshot of the email so you can put it in your next reddit post 🙂

Other people will just say no thanks. This is fine. Just make sure to take them out of your campaign and let them know that they have been removed.

**Interested**

This is where the money is. You need to respond very carefully here. The main principle is you want to give enough information to pique interest and not dive too deep in the beginning. People are automatically looking to put you in a box and label you.

You want to avoid that as much as possible. Think of your email exchange as needing to have several different stages. They need to know who you are, that you can do what you say you can do, how the process works, your pricing, etc.

You’ll notice that after answering tons of emails you will get the same type of questions over and over again. For example, for this campaign my prospects wanted to know three different things:

**Portfolio** – They wanted to see examples of my work

**Price** – They wanted to know how much things cost

**Process** – They wanted to know what my process was for completing assignments and turning things in

The best advice here is to figure out your sales process and help your prospects check each box as the move along. Don’t jump the gun and give them all the info about your offer before they ask for it. Guide them through each step.

If you have a good about page, people won’t need to ask you who you are because they will just go to your website and read about you. Make sure to end your about page with a good call to action!

**The Phone: Where Deals are Won or Lost**

I had to close some of my deals on the phone. Phone sales is way too big of a topic to fully cover in this post.

But, if you’ve had an extended email exchange with someone and they want to talk to you on the phone, it most likely means that they are interested but they just want to speak with you so they can make sure you are a real person and check off a few more boxes.

Be confident, stay loose, and make sure you close the deal, i.e. work out the next steps before the call is over. Get some type of commitment, even if it just means that you lock down a date that you will follow up with them. Don’t leave the call without setting clear expectations.

**The Results of My Campaign**

Here were the results of my email campaign:

**Number of email batches – 5**

**Number of Prospects – 783**

**Emails sent – 3,579**

**Bounces – 99 (13%)**

**Opens – 1,914 (53%)**

**Replies – 188 (24%)**

**New Customers – 10**

**Expenses: $166.70**

**Revenue: $3,602**

**Gross** **Profit: $3,435.30**

**ROI: 2,061%**

**Looking Back**

If you’re looking to start your own cold email campaigns, here are some things to consider:

This is fishing, not hunting. You’re trying to find people who have a problem that you can solve. You aren’t going to “convince” anyone to work with you.

You have to find people that have the pain and then your job is to remove any objections they may have. Find people who are looking for a solution. Out of every campaign, you’ll get people who are so happy that you contacted them because they’ve been waiting to relieve this pain.

Don’t think of it as getting them to say “yes”. Think of it as removing every single objection they have until “yes” is the most logical response. Make it a no-brainer.

Timing is a huge factor. You can’t optimize having good timing though. All you can do is keep doing outreach.

**What Worked**

**Using templated responses**

As mentioned earlier, After working my way through tons of email I started to notice patterns to responses. Pipedrive has a template feature which lets you respond to emails with a templated response.

This was a huge timesaver because I was able to throw in a template and make a few small edits instead of writing an email from scratch. Of course, you can always copy and paste a templated email from anywhere but Pipedrive made it super convenient – which I love.

**Closing on the phone and using a foot in the door offer**

When you’re on the phone close the deal with a foot in the door offer. Give them a risk-free offer, instead of a high ticket one, just to get to the next step.

Take a small step instead of a leap just so you can gain trust, show your skills, and win additional business.**Making a small ask**

Don’t give away the farm as soon as you get a positive response from someone. When someone responds it doesn’t mean that they are ready to buy immediately.

If they have a question, answer it and keep the conversation going. They most likely want a little more info. Give them what they need to get to the next step of the sales process.

**Timing**

Like I mentioned earlier, the more you email, the “luckier” you get.**What Didn’t Work**

**Emailing the decision maker directly**

Emailing the CEO and using the waterfall technique worked much better than emailing a department or decision maker directly.

**Bad data**

Some of the lead lists I got back from my lead generator were full of bad emails and the wrong types of companies. I would do a better job at cleaning these lists in the future.

**Leaving campaigns on “auto-pilot”**

These automated email campaigns aren’t 100% set-it-and-forget-it. Just like a farmer needs to attend to his crops every day, you’ll want to spend time checking over your email campaigns doing things like cleaning your inbox, updating your CRM, responding to people, removing bad data, etc.**What I Will Do Next Time**

**More personalization using mail merge tokens and niche down**

I may try using more mail merge personalization in future campaigns. To do this I would segment my lists to keep things organized and to make sure that my messaging stays more targeted. Niching down worked better for me in this case study so I will definitely want to explore that further.

**Send more emails**

I got busy with the work that I won during these campaigns and I paused them so I could catch up on my work. DON’T DO THIS! No matter what you should keep your campaigns running so you can keep your pipeline full.

You have to continually, mail, test, split test, optimize, etc. to keep your funnel full. Your pipeline is a direct reflection of your past 30 days of activity. Pausing your campaigns will set you back and can lead to a down month.**Do The Math**

Before my next set of campaigns I will look at my metrics and tie my revenue to activity, i.e. I will break things down and figure out how much each outbound email is worth to me. That way I can figure out how many people I need to email to hit my revenue goals.**Clean My Lists**

In any batch of cold email prospects, you’re bound to get some emails that are fake, no longer valid, or otherwise non-existent. Getting hard bounces from emails can hurt your domain reputation and email deliverability rate.

For a cold email campaign to be effective you need to keep as many emails out of the spam box as possible. I’ll make sure to clean my lists using a service like Neverbounce the next time I fire up a campaign. Neverbounce verifies and cleans your email lists to improve your email deliverability.

**Split Test My Campaigns**

I will definitely try split testing my campaigns in the future. I’ll start with optimizing for opens, then replies, and finally, appointments set. This will improve my conversion rate meaning that I will get better results from sending out the same amount of email.

**Sell More Expensive Services**

To improve ROI I will start pitching more expensive services. If I sell products at a higher price point I will get a better return on my time spent working on a campaign.

My average order value was low ($100 – $125 per 1,000-word article) so I spent less time on personalization. If you’re selling more expensive services or selling to larger companies then I would for sure spend more time on personalization. I’m looking for the low-hanging fruit on a short sales cycle with my emails.

**Wrapping Up**

At the end of the day, I consider the campaign a success because I was ROI positive (over 2,061%). I learned a lot from the campaigns and will definitely use what I learned in my next campaigns.

If you’re looking to drum up quick business from new customers you’ll be hard-pressed to find a much better way than cold outreach via email or phone.

I hope this case study was valuable to you and feel free to ask me any questions you may have about the process!

Edit:

It slipped my mind to add COSS. I was more focused on the email and sales part of the post that I completely forgot to add it. My COSS is roughly 20% - 30% of revenue which would equal roughly $900.50 making my net profit $2,534.8 (1,521%).

I suggest you read the [whole thing](https://www.shopify.com/blog/194984713-17-year-old-making-13500-a-month) (it's pretty short). But here are the take aways :

**The Interview** ➜ https://www.shopify.com/blog/194984713-17-year-old-making-13500-a-month


**The Store** ➜ https://www.watchoutfitters.com/

#1. Choosing a product to sell :

####Start with a product or at least a vertical that you know more than average person about. 
    
    
> **How did you decide what you would sell?**

>Since it was my first time selling something online, I wanted to chose a product line that I knew something about and that I had a personal interest in.

>**There are a lot of jewelers in my family and I personally love watches**, so I decided to launch my own store based on my hobby and knowledge of watches.
    
#2. Marketing and Learning Fast :
####Do a small test, you'll probably fail, measure it, find the right questions to ask, and find the right people to ask your questions from.


>My first ecommerce store, Watch Outfitters was launched with Shopify on January 2nd, 2016. I had absolutely no experience selling things online and had to put in a lot of time to get started.


>I watched webinars, followed the Shopify blog, followed Youtube tutorials, and I also asked specific questions to people in the Kingpinning and Shopify Strategy groups on Facebook when I got stuck.
>**It took me a little while to learn how to ask the right questions.** For example I didn't’ just ask, “How do you set up a Facebook ad?” I’d ask, “I’m setting up a new ad campaign and am looking to do some split testing—how do I know which segments to test?”

#3. Getting your first sale
Getting your first sale will happen when you find a way to connect the value add of your product to the needs of your customer. Obvious but easy to lose sight of when you focus on just driving traffic.
>The mind shift happened when I stopped focussing on “selling things” and started to ask, “how can I add value to my customer?”I began to focus on what my customer wanted and **then provided specific copy and imagery** that spoke to those wants.

Of all the channels we’ll be discussing, SEO is the one that there is the most misinformation about. Some of it is subtle, but some of it is widely spread and believed by so-called SEO consultants who actually don’t know what they’re doing.

SEO is very simple, and unless you’re a very large company it’s probably not worth hiring somebody else to do. It’s also something that has a lot of faux veneer around it. Consultants want to make it seem incredibly difficult so that they can charge you a lot, but I'll show you exactly how to do it, step by step, and you'll win.

How Google Works In order to understand what we need to do for SEO let’s look back at how Google started, how it’s evolving today, and develop a groundwork from which we can understand how to get ranked on Google.

First, we're going to reverse engineer what Google is doing, and then simply follow their rules, picking the right keywords, and get your sites ranked.

#The Early Days of Google 

The idea for PageRank — Google’s early ranking algorithm — stemmed from Einstein. Larry Page and Sergei Brin were students at Stanford, and they noticed how often scientific studies referred to famous papers, such as the theory of relativity. These references acted almost like a vote — the more your work was referenced the more important it must be. If they downloaded every scientific paper and looked at the references, they could theoretically decide which papers were the most important, and rank them.

They realized that because of links, the Internet could be analyzed and ranked in a similar way, except instead of using references they could use links. So they set about attempting to “download” (or crawl) the entire Internet, figuring out which sites were linked to the most. The sites with the most links were, theoretically, the best sites. And if you did a search for “university,” they could look at the pages that talked about “university” and rank them.

#Google Today 

Google works largely the same way today, although with much more sophistication and nuance. For example, not all links carry the same weight. A link from an authoritative site (as seen by how many links a site has pointing at it) is much more valuable than a link from a non-authoritative site. A link from Wikipedia is probably worth about 10,000 links from sites that don’t have much authority.

At the end of the day the purpose of Google is to find the “best” (or most popular) web page for the words you type into the search bar.

All this means is we need to make it clear to google what our page is about, and then make it clear that we’re popular. If we do that we win. In order to do that, we’ll follow a very simple process that works every single time with less effort than you probably think is required.

##Gaming the System 

Google is a very smart company. The sophistication of the algorithms they write is incredible; bear in mind that there are currently cars driving themselves around Silicon Valley powered by Google’s algorithms.

If you get too far into the SEO rabbit hole you’ll start stumbling upon spammy ways to attempt to speed up this process. Automated software like RankerX, GSA SER, and Scraperbox, instructions to create spam or spin content, linkwheels, PBNs, hacking domains, etc.

Some of that stuff works very short term, but Google is smart and it is getting smarter. It gets harder to beat Google every day, and Google gets faster at shutting down spammy sites every day. Most don’t even last a week before everything you’ve done disappears and your work evaporates. That’s not the way you should do things.

Instead of Internet-based churn and burn we’ll be focusing on building equity in the Internet. So if you see some highly-paid SEO consultant telling you to use software and spun content to generate links, or when you see some blackhatter beating the system, just know that it’s not worth it. We’re going to build authority and get traffic fast, but we’re going to do it in a way that doesn’t disappear or cripple your site in the future.

#On-Page SEO 

The first step in getting our site ready to rank is making it clear to Google what our site is about.

For now we’re going to focus our home page (our landing page) on ranking for one keyword that isn’t our brand or company name. Once we do that and get that ranking we can branch out into other keywords and start to dominate the search landscape, but for now we’ll stay laser focused.

Keyword Research The first thing we need to do is to figure out what that keyword is. Depending on how popular our site is and how long it’s been around, the level of traffic and difficulty we’ll get from this effort may vary.

##The Long Tail 

There’s a concept we need to be familiar with known as the “long tail.”

If we were to graph “popularity” of most things with “popularity” being the Y axis and the rank order being the Y axis, we’d get something like a power law graph:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BJTF2S1LVXK5ig75

There are some big hits that get the majority of attention, and after a few hits the graph falls sharply. The long-tail theory says that as we become more diverse as a society the yellow end of the above graph will stretch forever and get taller.

Think of Amazon. They probably have a few best-selling products, but the majority of their retail revenue comes from a wide variety of things that aren’t bought anywhere nearly as often as their best-selling products. Similarly, if we were to rank the popularity of the songs played in the last 10 years, there would be a few hits that would garner the majority of plays, and an enormous number of songs that have only a few plays. Those less popular products and songs are what we call the long tail.

In SEO this matters because, at least in the beginning, we’re going to go after long tail keywords — very exact, intention-driven keywords with lower competition that we know can win, then gradually we’ll work our way to the left.

Our site isn’t going to outrank ultra-competitive keywords in the beginning, but by being more specific we can start winning very targeted traffic with much less effort.

The keywords we’re looking for we will refer to as “long-tail keywords.”

#Finding the Long Tail 

In order to find our perfect long-tail keywords, we’re going to use a combination of four tools, all of which are free.

The process looks like this:

1. Use UberSuggest, KeywordShitter and a little bit of brainstorming to come up with some keywords

2. Export those keywords to the Google Keyword Planner to estimate traffic level

3. Search for those keywords with the SEOQuake chrome extension installed to analyze the true keyword difficulty

Don’t be intimidated — it’s actually very simple. For this example we’ll pretend like we were finding a keyword for this book (and we’ll probably have to build out a site so you see if we’re ranked there in a few months).

##Step 1: Brainstorming and Keyword Generating 

In this step we’re simply going to identify a few keywords that seem like they might work. Don’t concentrate too much on culling the list at this point, as most bad keywords will be automatically eliminated as a part of the process.

So since this is a book about growth hacking, I’m going to list out a few keywords that would be a good fit:

- Growth hacking

- Growth marketing

- Internet marketing

- Growth hacking guide

- Growth hacking book

- Book about growth hacking

- What is growth hacking

- Growth hacking instructions

That’s a good enough list to start. If you start running out of ideas go ahead and check out keywordshitter.com. If you plug in one keyword it will start spitting out thousands of variations in just a few minutes. Try to get a solid list of 5–10 to start with.

Now we’ll plug each keyword into UberSuggest. When I plug the first one — “growth hacking” — in, I get 246 results.

Clicking “view as text” will let us copy and paste all of our keywords into a text editor and create an enormous list.

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*BkT8uUYV3p2hsXCI.

Go through that process with each keyword you came up with.

Now we’ll assume you have 500+ keywords. If you don’t, try to start with something more generic and broad as a keyword, and you’ll have that many quickly. Ideally you’ll have over 1500.

##Step 2: Traffic Estimating 
Now that we have a pretty good list of keywords. Our next step is to figure out if they have enough search volume to be worth our while.

You’ll likely notice that some are so far down the long tail they wouldn’t do much for us. For example, my growth hacking list came up with “5 internet marketing techniques.” We probably won’t go after that one, but instead of guessing we can let Google do the work for us. This will be our weeding out step.

##Google Keyword Planner 

The [Google Keyword Planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) is a tool meant for advertisers, but it does give us some rough idea of traffic levels.

Google doesn’t make any promise of accuracy, so these numbers are likely only directionally correct, but they’re enough to get us on the right track.

You’ll have to have an AdWords account to be able to use the tool, but you can create one for free if you haven’t use AdWords in the past.

Once you’ve logged in, select “Get search volume data and trends.”

Paste in your enormous list of keywords, and click “Get search volume.” Once you’ve done so, you’ll see a lot of graphs and data.

Unfortunately the Keyword Planner interface is a little bit of a nightmare to work within, so instead we’re going to export our data to excel with the “download” button and play with it there.

Now what we’re going to do is decide what traffic we want to go after.

This varies a bit based on how much authority your site has. So let’s try to determine how easy it will be for you to rank.

Go to SEMrush.com and enter your URL, looking at the total backlinks in the third column:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*aV3sF59d8Bt3Aqqw.

As a general rule (this may vary based on how old your site is, who the links are from, etc.), based on the number of links you have, this is the maximum level of “difficulty” you should go after.

**Number of Backlinks:Maximum Difficulty**

\<30:40

<100:40–50

<1000:50–70

1000+:70+

Go ahead and sort the data by difficulty, and eliminate all of the stuff that is too high for your site (don’t worry, we’ll get those keywords later). For now you can simply delete those rows.

##Exact Match 

One important thing to note is that Google gives us this volume as “exact match” volume. This means that if there is a slight variation of a keyword we will see it if the words are synonyms, but not if they are used in a phrase, so the traffic will be underestimated from what you would expect overall.

Now with that disclaimer sort the traffic volume highest to lowest, and from this data pick out five keywords that seem like a good fit.

Here are mine:

- growth hacking strategies

- growth hacking techniques

- growth hacking 101

- growth hacking instagram

- growth hacking twitter

Mine all look the same, but that may not necessarily be the case.

##Keyword Trends 

Unfortunately the “keyword difficulty” that Google gives us is based on paid search traffic, not on natural search traffic.

First, let’s use [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/) to view the keyword volume and trajectory simultaneously. You can enter all of the keywords at the same time and see them graphed against each other. For my keywords it looks like this:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*10BiNkXI3C3mEvYb.

The ones I’m most excited about are purple and red, which are “Growth hacking techniques” and “Growth hacking Twitter.”

Now we’ll take a deeper look at what the competition is like for those two keywords.

##Manual Keyword Difficulty Analysis 

In order to analyze how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword, we’re going to have to look at the keywords manually, one by one. That’s why we started by finding some long-tail keywords and narrowing the list.

This process gets a lot easier if you download the [SEOQuake Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seoquake/akdgnmcogleenhbclghghlkkdndkjdjc?hl=en). Once you’ve done that, do a Google search and you’ll notice a few changes.

With SEOQuake turned on the relevant SEO data of each site is displayed below each search result.

We’re going to alter what is displayed, so in the left-hand sidebar click “parameters” and set them to the following:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qVN8Re6-d0RqvJ07.

Now when you search, you’ll see something like this:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9c46odS5ItXx3F5X.

SEOQuake adds a ranking number, and the following at the bottom:

**The Google Index:** This is how many pages from this base URL Google has indexed

**Page Links:** The number of pages linking to the exact domain that is ranking according to SEMrush’s index (usually very low compared to reality, but since we’ll be using this number to compare it wil be somewhat apples to apples)

**URL Links:** The number of pages pointing to any page on the base URL

**Age:** The first time the page was indexed by the Internet Archive

**Traffic:** A very rough monthly traffic number for the base URL

Looking at these we can try to determine approximately what it would take to overtake the sites in these positions.

You’ll notice that the weight of the indicators change. Not all links are from as good of sources, direct page links matter much more than URL links, etc., but if you google around and play with it for a while you’ll get a pretty good idea of what it takes.

If you have a brand new site it will take a month or two to start generating the number of links to get to page one. If you have an older site with more links it may just be a matter of getting your on-page SEO in place. Generally it will be a mixture of both.

Keep in mind that we’re going to optimize our page for this exact keyword, so we have a bit of an advantage. That said, if you start to see pages from sites like Wikipedia, you will know it’s an uphill battle.

Here are a couple of examples so you can see how you should think through these things, starting with “Growth hacking techniques.”

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YErpxe0guQCv8f2E.

Entrepreneur.com is definitely a big name, and “growth hacking techniques” is in the title explicitly. This will be difficult to beat, but there are no links in the SEMRush index that point direct to the page.

(By the way, I wonder how hard it would be to write an article for entrepreneur.com — I could probably do that and build a few links to that easily, even linking to my site in the article).

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hJxs4ukw38FD_rzA.

Yongfook.com, have never heard of that site. 206 total links, not much traffic, this one I could pass up. It does have quite a bit of age and “Growth hacking tactics” in the title explicitly, so that would make it tough, but this one is doable to pass up after a while.

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FXNrc-YR8rEbVY90.

Alright, so quicksprout is relatively popular, a lot of links, good age, lots of traffic, a few links direct to the page but not a ton.


But the word “tactics” doesn’t even appear here. This page isn’t optimized for this keyword, so I could probably knock it out by being optimized specifically for “growth hacking tactics.”

Let’s jump down a ways to see how hard it would be to get on the front page.

17 total pages indexed? Created in 2014? No links in the index, even to the root URL? This one’s mine. I should be able to front-page easily.

So this looks like a good keyword. Now we just have to get the on-page SEO in place and start building a few links.

(Note: After doing this a few more times I learned that I could probably get austenallred.com toward the top of ""growth hacking press,"" so I changed the on-page optimization of one of those pages to focus on that keyword, and we'll see how it goes. 

#On-Page SEO 

Now that we have our keyword selected, we need to make sure Google knows what our site is about. This is as simple as making sure the right keywords are in the right places. Most of this has to do with html tags, which make up the structure of a webpage. If you don’t know html or understand how it works, just pass this list to a developer and they should be able to help you.

Here is a simple checklist you can follow to see if your content is optimized.

## On-Page SEO Checklist 

☐ Your keyword is in the <title> tag, ideally at the front (or close to the front) of the tag

☐ Your keyword is close to the beginning of the <title> tag (ideally the first words)

☐ The title tag contains less than the viewable limit of 65 characters (optional but recommended)

☐ Your keyword is in the first <h1> tag (and your page has an <h1> tag)

☐ If your page contains additional header tags (<h2>, <h3>, etc) your keyword or synonyms are in most of them

☐ Any images on the page have an <alt> tag that contain your chosen keyword

☐ Your keyword is in the meta description (and there is a meta description)

☐ There is at least 300 words of text on the page

☐ Your keyword appears in the URL (if not the homepage)

☐ Your keyword appears in the first paragraph of the copy

☐ Your keyword (or synonyms — Google recognizes them now) is used other times throughout the page

☐ Your keyword density is between .5% and 2.5%

☐ The page contains dofollow links to other pages (this just means you’re not using nofollow links to every other page)

☐ The page is original content not taken from another page and dissimilar from other pages on your site

If you have all of that in place you should be pretty well set from an on-page perspective. You’ll likely be the best-optimized page for your chosen keyword unless you’re in a very competitive space.

All we have left now is off-page optimization.

#Off-Page SEO 

Off-Page SEO is just a fancy way to say links. (Sometimes we call them backlinks, but it’s really the same thing.)

Google looks at each link on the web as a weighted vote. If you link to something, in Google’s eyes you’re saying, “This is worth checking out.” The more legit you are the more weight your vote carries.

## Link Juice 

SEOs have a weird way to describe this voting process; they call it “link juice.” If an authoritative site, we’ll say Wikipedia for example, links to you, they’re passing you “link juice.”

But link juice doesn’t only work site to site — if your homepage is very authoritative and it links off to other pages on your site, it passes link juice as well. For this reason our link structure becomes very important.

### Checking Link Juice 

There are a number of tools that let you check how many links are pointing to a site and what the authority of those pages are. Unfortunately none of them are perfect — the only way to know what links are pointing to your site is to have crawled those pages.

Google crawls most popular pages several times per day, but they don’t want you manipulating them, so they update their index pretty slowly.

That said, you can check at least a sample of Google’s index in the Google Search Console (formerly known as Webmaster Tools). Once you navigate to your site, In the left-hand side select “Search Traffic” then “Links to your site.” There’s a debate raging over whether or not this actually shows you all of the links Google knows about (I’m 99% convinced it’s only a sample), but it’s at least a representative sample.

To see all of your links, click on “More” under “Who links to you the most” then “Download this table.” This, again, seems to only download a sample of what Google knows about. You can also select “Download latest links” which provides more recent links than the other option.

Unfortunately this doesn’t let us see much a to the value of the links, nor does it show us links that have dropped or where those links are from.

To use those there are a wide variety of tools: If you have a budget I’d go with ahrefs.com as they have the biggest index, followed by Moz’s Open Site Explorer (most of the data you can get with a free account, if not then it’s slightly cheaper than ahrefs), and finally SEMrush, which is free for most purposes we need. MajesticSEO uses a combination of “trust flow” and “citation flow” which also works fairly well to give you an idea as to the overall health and number of links pointing to your site.

All of these use different internal metrics to determine the “authority” of a link, but using them to compare apples to apples can be beneficial.

#Link Structure 

HTML links look something like this:

<a href=”http://www.somesite.com” title=”keyword”>Anchor text</a>

Where http://www.somesite.com is the place the link directs you to, the title is largely a remnant of time gone by, and the linked text — think the words that are blue and you click on — is called the “anchor text.”

In addition to the amount of link juice a page has, the relevance of the anchor text matters.

Generally speaking you want to use your keyword as the anchor text for your internal linking whenever possible. External linking (from other sites) shouldn’t be very heavily optimized for anchor text. If 90% of your links all have the same anchor text Google can throw a red flag, assuming that you’re doing something fishy.

If you’re ever creating links (like we’ll show you in the future) I only ever use something generic like the site name, “here” or the full URL.

## Internal Structure 

Generally speaking you don’t want orphan pages (those that aren’t linked to by other pages), nor do you want an overly-messy link structure.

Some say the ideal link structure for a site is something like this:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tWHFIzBzG7zq6uii.

That’s close, but it gets a couple things wrong. First, you’ll never have a structure that organized, and second, in an ideal world every page would link to every other page on its same level. This can easily be done with a footer that feels like a sitemap or “recommended” pages. That allows you to specify anchor text, and pass link juice freely from page to page.

Unfortunately it’s impossible to draw such a web without it becoming a mess, so you’ll just have to imagine what that actually looks like.

We have just one more thing to go over before we start getting those first links pointing to our site.

###Robots.txt, disavow, nofollow, and other minutia### 

Most of SEO at this point is now managing stuff that can go wrong. There is a lot of that, but we’ll go over what will cover 99% of needs, and you can Google if there’s something really crazy.

#### Robots.txt

Almost every site has a page at url.com/robots.txt — even google has one.

This is just a plain text file that lets you tell search engine crawlers what to crawl and not to crawl. Most are pretty good about listening, except the Bingbot, which pretty much does whatever it wants no matter what you tell it. (I’m mostly kidding.)

If you don’t want Google to crawl a page (maybe it’s a login page you don’t want indexed, a landing page, etc.) you can just “disallow” it in your robots.txt by saying disallow: /somepage.

If you add a trailing / to it (e.g. disallow: /somepage/) it will also disallow all child pages.

Technically you can specify different rules for different bots (or user agents), but it’s easiest to start your file with “User-agent: *” if you don’t have a need for separate crawling rules.

#### Disavow

Google will penalize spammy sites, and unfortunately this causes some bad behavior from bad actors. Say, for example, you wanted to take out a competitor. You could send a bunch of obviously spammy links to their site and get them penalized. This is called “negative SEO,” and is something that happens often in highly contested keywords. Google generally tries to pretend like it doesn’t happen.

In the case that this does happen, however, you can “Disavow” links in the Search Console, which is pretty much saying, “Hey Google, don’t count this one.” I hope you’ll never have to use it, but if you hire (or have hired) a bad SEO or are being attacked by a competitor, that is how you combat it.

#### Nofollow

A link can have a property called “nofollow” such as this:

<a href=”http://www.somesite.com” title=”keyword” rel=”nofollow”>Anchor text</a>.

If you want to link to somebody but you don’t want it to count as a vote (you don’t want to pass link-juice), or you support user-generated content and want to deter spammers, you can use a nofollow link. Google says it discounts the value of those links. I’m not convinced they discount them heavily, but other SEOs are so they seem to deter spammers if nothing else.

#### Redirects

If you’re going to change a URL, but you don’t want its link juice to disappear, you can use a 301 redirect. A 301 will pass a majority of the link juice.

Importantly, Google views www.austenallred.com and austenallred.com as different sites. So decide on one, and redirect all of one type to the other.

#### Canonical URLs

If you have two pages that are virtually the same, you can add something like <link rel=”canonical href=”https://www.someurl.com/somepage”> to say “hey, treat this page as if it were that page instead, but I don’t want to 301 it.”

And with that, we’re ready to build our first links.

# Link Building

 Link building is where SEO really starts to matter, and where a lot of people end up in a world of hurt.

The best way to build links is to not build links. I’ve worked for companies in the past that don’t have to ask for them, they just flow in from press, customer blogs, their awesome blog posts, etc. If this is an option (and we’ll go over a couple of ways to make it more likely) you’re in a great place.

If not, at least in the beginning, we’re going to manually create just a few.

We’re going to create them in legitimate ways and not hire somebody in India to do so. That is a recipe for disaster, and I can’t even count the number of times I’ve seen that take down a site.

Web 2.0s The easiest way to build high quality links are what SEOs call “web 2.0s.” That’s just a way to say “social sites” or sites that let you post stuff. Now tweeting a link into the abyss won’t do you anything, but profiles, status pages, etc. do carry some weight. And if they come from a popular domain that counts as a link.

Some of the easiest are:

- Twitter (in your bio)

- Github (the readme of a repo)

- YouTube (the description of a video — it has to actually get views)

- Wordpress (yes, you’ll have to actually create a blog)

- Blogger (same here)

- Tumblr

- Upvote-based sites (HackerNews, GrowthHackers, Inbound.org, Reddit, etc.)

If nothing else you can start there and get a half dozen to a dozen links. There are always big lists of “web 2.0s” you can find online, but keep in mind if you’re going to build something out on a blogging platform you’re going to have to really build something out. That’s a lot of content and time, but you have to do it the right way.

We generally keep a bigger list of Web 2.0s here. Some may be out of date, but you should probably only build a half dozen to a dozen Web 2.0s anyway.

## Expired Domains 

Another way to get link juice is by purchasing an expired domain. This is more difficult to do, but there are a lot of options such as expireddomains.net. (Google “expired domains” and you’ll find dozens of sites monitoring them.)

You’ll want to purchase a domain that has expired and restore it as closely as you can to its original form using an archive. These sites likely have some link juice to pass on and you can pass it to yourself.

## Link Intersection 

Another way to find places you can build links is by using a link intersection tool. These find sites that link to “competitor a” and “competitor b” but not to you. Theoretically, if they link to both of your competitors, they should be willing to link to you. Moz, Ahrefs, LunaMetrics and others have link intersection tools that work quite well.

Now that we have a few basic links flowing, we’re going to work on some strategies that will send continual links and press, eventually getting to a point where we don’t have to build any more links.

# Your First Drip of Traffic — Becoming an Authority Site 

Awesome — you have a site that converts well, your SEO is in place, ready for you to drive traffic. Now what?

As you’re probably learned at this point, a site that converts very well but has no traffic flowing to it still converts zero traffic.

We’re going to fix that.

This section takes a lot of time and effort, and in the beginning you’ll likely wonder if you’re doing anything at all. Remember that class in college that is so difficult it’s the point where most people give up, effectively weeding out the people who aren’t ready to major in a specific subject?

### Well this is the weeder-out chapter of growth hacking. ###

Take a Long-Term View The reason so many people stumble on this step is the same reason people stumble on so many steps that take a little effort under time — losing weight, investing in a 401(k), etc. In the beginning you’re going to have a little seedling of traffic, and you’ll be looking up to those who have giant oak trees, thinking, “I must be doing something wrong.” You’re not doing anything wrong. The traffic starts as a trickle before it becomes a flood.

But don’t worry if you’re a startup. Our goal is to get enough traffic that continuing to do this effort will be sustainable (meaning we won’t die before we start to see the rewards), but at the same time we’re building equity in the Internet.

The type of traffic we want to build is the type that will compound and will never go away. We want to create traffic today that will still give us a little trickle in five years. Combining hundreds (or thousands) of little trickles, our site that converts, and a great product we will create a giant river.

Future chapters will go into depth on the networks we need to drive traffic from, so in this chapter we’re going to focus on traffic that’s network-agnostic. Traffic that we can’t get by tapping any specific network.

Just to give you some idea of scale, I’ve seen this process drive over 500,000 visits per day, though the build up to that level took almost a full year. What could you do with 500,000 visits per day?

##Monitoring Alerts 

To start we’re going to use the keywords we found in the SEO chapter, and inject ourselves (and our company) into the conversation wherever it’s taking place.

To do this we’re going to use software called BuzzBundle.

BuzzBundle This software lets us do a few things:

Constantly monitor all mentions of a specific topic, competitor, or keyword across multiple locations on the Internet (from Facebook groups to Quora questions to blog posts) where comments are available
Allow us to leave a constructive comment that references our product or company

Disclaimer: This is not the SEO comment spam you’ve seen This step takes thought, effort, and a real human who understands what they’re typing. I don’t often say this, but you cannot effectively automate this step without it becoming spammy. If you’re trying to replicate the automated SEO spam you’ve seen on various blogs and sites this will probably work, but you’ll get banned, your clickthrough will be a fraction of what it could be, and you’ll be banned

## Productive Commenting 

We’re not going to fire up some awful software to drop spun mentions of garbage onto various comment sections online hoping that brings us SEO traffic. Our comments must do two things:

- Be contextual. We are only going to talk about the topic presented in an article or tweet, and only mention our company when it naturally fits in

- Contribute to the conversation. I should learn something or have value added to my life by reading your comment

If you do these two things a few changes will take place: First, you’ll notice that people click on your links because you’re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute. Second, people will respect your company because you’re a thoughtful person who likes to contribute.

And with that disclaimer, we’ll move on to the nitty gritty of how this is done. Let’s fire up BuzzBundle and get to work.

## Accounts and Personas 

The first thing you’ll want to do in BuzzBundle is go to Accounts -> Add new accounts. This is the starting point for everything we’ll do, as we need accounts to comment.

One thing you’ll notice about BuzzBundle is that it lets you use multiple accounts. I find it beneficial to think from multiple perspectives and therefore multiple points of view, but I don’t want to go too far overboard and be spammy.

I’d recommend doing something simple — create 2–3 personas, each of whom you identify with (or are you), and enter them into your BuzzBundle accounts.

Personally I don’t even change my name, I just use a different one (eg. Austen J. Allred vs. Austen Allred) or use a few photos, just so it isn’t literally the same name and same photo blanketing the Internet.

#### Disqus 

Disqus is a comment system used all over the place, and it carries some caveates. Disqus will ban you if you use the same link in every post, so there are two workarounds:

Use a lot of different accounts, rotating IPs or using a proxy every two days or so
Use your site URL as your “display name”

Both of these work, but the second one is much easier in my view.

## UTM Parameters 

Using links with our UTM parameters here will be very beneficial. We’ll be able to track traffic back to each individual blog or site, and if necessary double down on the ones that are driving traffic.

Link Shorteners If you ever start to run into problems with getting your link posted, it may be useful to use a few link shorteners or some 301 redirects.

To keep it simple you can use a link shortener that 301s such as bit.ly, or if you want to spend a little more time you can set up your own site and 301 the traffic from a certain page to your money site.

##Using BuzzBundle 

Let’s get started with the BuzzBundle.

First, it’s going to ask you for a keyword. We already have a keyword from the SEO section, but we may want to do something even a bit more generic. For this one I’m going to go with “growth hacking.”

Simply hit “go” and let BuzzBundle get started.

It will load different content types into different columns, but generally we are going to be scrolling through until we find something that looks compelling and like we can actually contribute to.

The first thing I clicked on was this:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*FtoN2kYmo5y3Oc1w.

It’s a review of another book about growth hacking. All I had to do was comment, tag the author, ask him if he were willing to review our book, and offer to send him one for free. (If you’re that person reading this now it’s going to be pretty awkward).

My assumption is this person will find the conversation to be completely authentic, because it is. When you're authentically reaching out to people you get rid of all of the icky-ickyThe fact that there’s now a link on his video that people who are searching for something else will find is just an added bonus.

As an aside, I much prefer to hold “shift” and click on a link to open it in my normal browser if I’m just going to be commenting as myself.

The next one I found was a roundup of great growth hacking blog posts from the week.

I left the following comment:

https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m-1C10p2aY9Ymjjz.

Note how I followed him on Twitter so that it’s obviously personal and not an automated spam comment. I even went a little bit overboard and tweeted at him just for kicks.

That is how you get people on your team.

As you get further along and have an idea of how to get a good response, I’d recommend starting to sort by reach, ramping up the number of keywords you’re searching for, and possibly even -gasp- upgrading to the paid version of BuzzBundle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4wbdcz/seo_is_not_hard_a_stepbystep_seo_tutorial_for/,3673,. ,2016-08-05 16:54:42

If so -- Approx how long would you guys like the TLDR to be? A paragraph or two? Or major bullet points. I'll use reddit formatting to make it readable haha.

For reference -- this is the first summary I ever wrote -- and IMO it's too long : [The Lean Startup] (http://www.skipmba.com/the-lean-startup-eric-reis/)  If needed -- I can do something like that but only the bullets.

754,f2g2t5,False,,271,Lady refused to pay me. What should I do?,Entrepreneur,"Hello all,

I am a service and installation technician in a fairly specific market. I received a service call to service something about 1.5 hours one way from my house. So I loaded up all my tools and headed down there and fixed the problem in 15 minutes. 

However, the lady would not pay and her reasons were as follows: 1. It took only 15 minutes she could have done it herself if she was shown what to do. 2. She was not told in advance she was going to be charged. 3. What I repaired happens often and it would be crazy for her to pay every single time a tech comes out to fix it. 

I am pissed off actually. It took me 3 hours 15 minutes total driving and repair and on top of it she is a wealthy stay at home wife of a rich man living in a 1.5 million dollar home plus who knows how many acres and she is giving a very hard time paying $75.

What should I do?

And while my entrepreneurial journey is far from over, I thought the 9 year mark was as good a time as any to share my story and hopefully some lessons that can help you on your journey.  I’ll link to a few things below so you can see that I’m a real boy but there’s no hidden agenda in the links (read: I have no course to sell you!).  

**What I’m building (right now):**  
 
* item 1 - In 2008 I started (and still run) [Demac Media](https://www.demacmedia.com), an 8-figure business with close to 100 full time employees
* item 2 - I am the co-founder of [Pela Case](https://pelacase.com), a 6-figure, soon to be 7-figure eCommerce brand.
* item 3 - I’ve made a handful of angel investments over the years into various industries, including eCommerce brands, an alcohol brand (Qui Tequila), and a night club.  
* item 4 - I’ve also decided to do one of the scariest things I’ve ever done—write my first book called [Anything, Anywhere](http://mattbertulli.com). 

It’s a weird thing putting your thoughts down in a permanent place (especially something as permanent as an actual book) but while I was spending all that time writing, I started to reflect on how I’ve gotten to where I am today. A friend of mine suggested that I write a post like this and I had run out of reasons not to!  

Also, since I started putting myself ""out there"" (speaking gigs, [medium essays](https://medium.com/@mbertulli) etc) I’ve been getting questions from all corners of the interwebs and I needed to centralize this stuff so I can point people to one location. So why not reddit?  

PS: I will monitor this thread and answer any questions you might have. So please, ask away!  

I’ve tried to structure this post into one part story, one part lessons learned, and one part common questions with my usual answers (get asked these a lot).  

This post is ~5,400 words and my team has told me it’s about a 30 minute read...to set your expectations.  

**The Beginning**  

I started my career as a self-taught software developer.  This was in the mid-90’s (I’m 36 now) and to say things were different then would be…well, obvious.  I am grateful for having learned to code in the 90’s as it gives me great appreciation for how low the barriers have come to get into the craft. Like most, I worked a bunch of different jobs from 1999 until 2008 before deciding to break out on my own entrepreneurial journey and start Demac Media.  

**Finding the Gap**  

I had no business plan. Just a rough idea of what I wanted to do. I was working at Netsuite at the time and saw how much business we referred out to service partners and thought that I’d rather be the guy getting referrals than the guy giving them.  It was that simple.  I sort of knew that I wanted to focus on eCommerce since I grew up in a multi-generation retail family (selling furniture) and knew the space very well.  There was also a serious lack of competition in the Canadian market in 2008 as eCommerce had yet to really gain steam with our larger retailers/brands.  That’s one of the keys to our success, we were early.  Probably too early when I look back.  But none the less, we don’t take it for granted that timing was certainly on our side.  

**The Accidental Big Business**  

I also never intended on things getting to this point. After Netsuite I really just wanted something small that made me a decent living and I could call it my own.  I just wanted to have fun with work again, so I made the leap and started Demac Media.  Many of my first hires will laugh when they read this because I was famous for saying we’d never have more than 15-20 employees…whoops!  

As you can tell from the title of this post, it has taken almost a decade to get to where we are.  I didn’t do it alone, far from it (more on that below).  I’ve had so many helping hands in the form of mentors, partners, friends and customers to count.  I learned a great deal of patience over these years and if I could tell my 27 year old self 1 thing it would be this:  

** Be patient and always assume you don’t know shit…cause you don’t. **  

**Continuous Learning**  

I’m highly skeptical of most of what I read or hear when it comes to “top X ways to build a million dollar business in 12 months or less”.  In my experience there are simply too many variables at play for someone to prescribe one way of doing things as THE way to build a great business.  

However, I do find other entrepreneurs stories incredibly helpful.  I have done especially well with studying a wide variety of industries and stories from within those industries and then applying these lessons to my narrow-focused businesses (eCommerce).  I can spend hours a day just reading.  

In other words, I go wide in my learning and narrow in my practice.  

Let’s dig into my biggest lessons learned and I’ll sprinkle in more back story as we go.  


**Lesson 1 - Your network is your net-worth (thank you Jayson Gaignard from Mastermind Talks)**  

I was fortunate enough to have a pretty decent network early on when we were starting Demac.  I give a lot of credit to, and received a lot of value from the early days of Lean Coffee Toronto, a group I was one of the founding members of with the guys from TWG, Bnotions, Jet Cooper and others.  We’d meet weekly to talk about all things “Lean Startups” and how they applied to our businesses.  Most of us had less than 5 employees at the time, but that peer to peer learning was foundational.  

I was new to downtown Toronto when I started Demac so I invested a lot of time into getting involved with the local tech and startup community.  While exhausting I met a lot of great friends and even some mentors / advisors through these years of networking marathons.  I went into all of this just wanting to find my “people” and didn’t realize just how much value would come from these relationships over time.  

Another big “network” win for me was getting invited to Mastermind Talks (MMT) in Napa.  This is a world class event because the people in attendance are world class.  They are some of the most kind and generous humans I’ve ever encountered and I can honestly say I’m a better entrepreneur and better all around person because of the decision to attend and dig-in/participate.   

Through MMT I met an amazing entrepreneur that had a shared passion for mountain biking.  He was the one to convince me to join EO (Entrepreneur Network) in 2016 by inviting me to meet his forum members (all guy with businesses over 10-15M) in Toronto while they were having their quarterly meeting.  Joining this forum turned out to be another major win in equipping me with the tools I need to continue to build and grow businesses.  

It was being at MMT that also gave me the kick in the ass I needed to write my book. Meeting so many others that had taken the plunge and were still standing was encouraging.  I was scared shitless of putting my name out there in the form of something more permanent (ugh, a book) and while this path has had its own twists and turns I know it was the right one.  

My only regret was not investing more aggressively in my network earlier, especially during those early years of starting Demac Media.  

TL;DR - Nobody does this shit alone.  We all need help and lots of it.  Investing in your network is one of the best things you can do if you truly want to build a good business.   


**Lesson 2 - Build a good business first.  Ignore people telling you to dream bigger.**  

In the early days of Demac we experimented with a bunch of different niches and technologies before settling in on Magento (an eCommerce software platform) and going all-in on eCommerce.  One of the best moves we made was formally partnering up with Magento and investing in the platform.  Not only did we get to associate our relatively unknown brand with their very well known brand, we also didn’t have to worry about building software from scratch and could instead focus on servicing our customers by building on something already established.  

I can’t stress enough how important that singular focus on one platform was early on.  Once we stopped screwing around trying to be everything to everyone, the sales and marketing engine started to really work.  I’m now firmly in the differentiate-or-die camp.  Services businesses, especially agencies, need to learn this and apply it.  If you stand for everything, you stand for nothing.  

Targeting a niche definitely narrows your addressable market, but the benefits far outweigh this downside.  Doing this likely means you aren’t going to build a gigantic company, but who the hell *really* wants that anyway?  Most of us just want a great business that makes profits and affords us the life we desire/design.  

I’m a huge supporter of service based businesses.  Most will tell you there are lots of reasons these businesses suck, but dig a little deeper and the real reason people speak poorly of service businesses is because “they don’t scale”.  That’s not entirely true.  They most certainly don’t scale the same way that software/product companies do, but to say something doesn’t scale is too narrow a statement.  Service businesses just scale linearly, largely based on human effort (hours).  You can still build a very good business within the constraints of service based business models, so if this is appealing to you go for it.  Ignore the people/media/whomever telling you that you have to build something that “scales”.  

**Lesson 3 - Something about Yoda and becoming a master of something...**  

I also invested a lot of time early on into learning my industry.  I’m a little obsessive when it comes to needing to read everything.  It drives my wife nuts in our non-business lives since I can go down the rabbit hole on things that sometimes don’t matter much.  However, in business this has served me well since I’m able to keep up with a rapidly changing retail landscape.  I was spending easily 4-6 hours a day in addition to my “job” just reading and making sense of everything I could get my hands on.  

Side Note:  Identifying that I had a unique ability early on was really important in our hiring strategy.  I had received advice from some mentors that I should focus on what I’m uniquely qualified to do and hire people to do the rest.  Massive productivity win for people trying to scale human-intensive businesses.  

I continue to study retail.  When people ask me what I do I sometimes tell them I’m a student of retail, since that’s what I feel like most days.  While I’ve been building Demac Media for 8 years, I’ve spent my entire life in retail in some form or another.  It still feels like home to me and even if I weren’t running Demac I’d probably keep building retail focused businesses as I get tremendous satisfaction out of helping merchants succeed.  

Going narrow and becoming a master of one thing early on can feel really restrictive.  I get that.  I still think this approach has much higher chances of success than trying to create lots of business or revenue streams or whatever other bullshit [insert cheesy internet marketer here] is selling.  


**Lesson 4 - The right customers are always right, the rest are…meh.**  

Key Points:  

* item 1 - Listen to your great customers.  They provide you invaluable feedback.
* item 2 - Shitty customers are just that, shitty.  Life’s too short to work with assholes and assholes typically  don't bring value to the table.
* item 3 - Our customers hire us for our expertise.  Instead of asking our customers what they want us to do, we recommend what should be done.  We’re the expert, not the customer.  


Some of my earliest customers ended up being some of our best customers.  I think we got lucky here.  I even count a few as personal friends of mine and regularly see these people outside of business.  This is something I’m particularly grateful for.  I got to sit side by side with some amazing entrepreneurs that have grown retail/eCommerce companies from $0 to mid-8 figures and more.  I have experienced almost every aspect of a retail business from the warehouse to customer service and everything in between.  This has taken time, but it is paying dividends now (literally and figuratively).  Committing to learning a lot about an industry without any immediate return is very, very valuable.  

For these customers, I’ve given up huge amounts of my own time ensuring they get what they need from myself and my team to ensure they are successful.  When things are working, we push, when things aren’t working, we push.  These types of customers are the ones you build great businesses with.  

We’ve also had some duds as customers.  All the bitching and moaning about clients you typically hear from service business owners is true, by on a case by case basis.  I feel like I’ve experienced it all, but know that I probably haven’t.  Everything from the high profile entrepreneur who changes his mind weekly based on what he reads or hears on a podcast, to the high power CEO who “wants a partner” when really just wants a whipping boy to agree with him.  Luckily these experiences are not the norm.  Most customers we’ve had just want help with things they don’t understand.  The very best customers know what they don’t know and are experienced enough to trust others to fill in the gaps.  


**Lesson 5 - Premature action can destroy you.**  

As we grew the company from 3 of us in my basement to 100 we had to learn all sorts of things we never thought would matter.  One of the biggest lessons was around the incalculable value that a great culture adds to a business.  In ~9 years we’ve managed to have a less than 15% employee attrition rate…including people we’ve had to let go.  

The other more difficult lesson that stands out was not being able to keep everyone happy all the time.  Both customers and employees.  Most mistakes that lead to people being unhappy have to do with doing the right things at the wrong time.  

I outline a specific example in Lesson 6 below of the outbound sales machine failures, but there have been countless other instances where we tried to do something before we were ready.  Opening in new territories, hiring people too soon (luckily not too many), looking at the wrong data at the wrong time, creating too much process too early and on and on.  I feel wiser for it, but this is the shit nobody teaches you that you just wind up having to figure out.  There’s no 10-step program for this stuff.  

Honestly when I think about it, the mistakes we’ve made could easily fill a book.  I’m sure most other entrepreneurs that have been at this a long time would probably say the same thing.  Not all mistakes are good so don’t set out to “fail”.  The best mistakes I ever learned from were someone else's!  


**Lesson 6 - Creating multiple, strong sales channels is how you build leverage, which is a critical component in sustainable growth.**  

Once we were out of the gate and saw we had a sustainable business I decided to focus on adding in additional sales channels that would help create a little more stability.  Depending on one channel to bring in all your revenue is a little scary once that channel gets larger (all eggs, meet 1 basket).  

Our partnership with Magento was something I owned and invested a lot of time into.  Every time we got a new “partner manager” at Magento I would spend time getting to know them and building that relationship.  Now we have a partner (aka - Channel) team that handles these relationships and all of the activities around managing a strong multi-channel business.  This investment into a strong channel early on gave us the sales and revenue to invest into other channels that we acquired customers through.  

~3 years into the business we started to focus heavily on this new thing that people were calling Inbound Marketing.  Shit, we even bought the software (Hubspot) to go along with the buzzword!  To date we’ve published more than 1,100 articles and this is still a major pillar in our marketing engine as our Demac blog gets upwards of 50-60k visitors / mo.  Most of that traffic is just coming to us to learn, but it has helped us establish some thought leadership in our industry and that in turn helps us acquire and convert business.  

We’re now using our partnerships and inbound channels as leverage to create an outbound sales team that goes after our dream list of customers.  We have had some failed attempts at creating an outbound team / machine and now that I’m looking back we were simply too early in chasing these.  We believe we’re ready now, but who knows, maybe I’ll be doing another reddit post in a few years about how we failed here again. (God I hope not)  


**Lesson 7 - Compounded, steady growth is sanity.**  

You can double your business by growing 25% / year for 3 years.  My desired growth of 25-30% per year seemed painfully slow at first, but compounded over time it made for some pretty significant gains in years 4 through 7.  

One of the things I was repeatedly told by my parents and grandparents as they ran their stores was that cash flow was king.  This translated into a bunch of different thought tracks for me, but mostly it meant that if I wanted to grow my company I’d have to do so very tactically, which meant calculated growth that wasn’t too slow and wasn’t too fast so that we best used our cash and didn’t run out.  We managed to mostly pull this off, with only 2 years in 8 where we went too far in one direction or the other for a variety of reasons.  We targeted somewhere in the 25-30% YoY growth range and usually fell into it.  

Having grown up in a small family business (our family sold furniture retail) I was no stranger to the ups and downs of this life.  I knew there would be tough times.  I knew it would take its toll on my family (still does).  However, even knowing this and going into it eyes wide open there were still times where I got the wind knocked out of me.  Shit, I still have days and sometimes weeks where I ask myself what the fuck I’m doing with my life.  Thankfully I mostly enjoy what I do for a whole variety of reasons and when I spend time thinking about the alternatives I quickly regain focus.  


**Lesson 8 - Adopt an Operating System**  

About 1.5 years ago we started to adopt Traction / EOS (look it up) and it has been a game changer in helping us achieve operational scale to match our sales and revenue scale.  This is another thing I would stress to my younger self.  Sheer force-of-will is what got the company to 5M+.  Having an operating system that everyone in the business is using is what is taking us further.  

Around the same time (2 years ago) we also started to invest in what buzzword business folks like to call “senior leadership”.  There were a number of reasons for this, but mostly it had to do with me needing to focus on wearing 1 hat instead of 5. I couldn’t effectively lead/steer the ship if I was stuck in the weeds and I needed help if I was going to get out.  We formalized an exec team at this point and they are the fine folks who run the company day to day now while I focus on where the group of companies is going.  

Implementing EOS/Traction with the team in place was painful but ultimately I think it will be one of our best moves yet.  Having our entire company learn this new operating system together is allowing us to all to support one another, even though it sometimes feels a little pointless.  

Part of EOS/Traction is having what is called a Vision-Traction Organizer (VTO).  The basic idea is that it is a one page document that helps clarify your 3 year vision for your business.  It is a great tool to help you achieve alignment in your teams.  Ours has us continuing to grow Demac while also building out some additional products and business lines.  As long as we can we will continue to help commerce evolve, that’s our purpose.  I suspect that the companies are going to go through a lot of changes in the coming 3-5 years as the retail landscape is just full of change right now and there’s no way we position ourselves perfectly all the time.  


**Lesson 9 - Never stop laying foundation.  It’s the hard work, the uncomfortable work, but the right kind of work.**  

Along the way I learned that I love 'thoroughbred’ businesses, a term that I’ve lovingly adopted from my friend Andrew Wilkinson over at Meta.  There are too many reasons to list in this post as to why I think everyone needs to bootstrap and build businesses so all I’d recommend you do is read material from 37 Signals/Basecamp as a good starting point.  Demac Media and Pela Case are 100% bootstrapped / self funded.  We are focused on being good businesses, not big businesses.  

As I’ve gotten older, and especially as I’ve become a father (daughter, she’s 2), I care a lot less about how “sexy” something is in business and care far more about doing things that support a lifestyle that I’ve yet to figure out entirely (not sure I will).  Relationships are the key to almost all definitions of success and I’m still trying to figure out what that means as my wife and I figure out how we want to live…hence the lifestyle comment.  

In late 2015 I struck a deal with a fellow named Jeremy Lang to acquire 45% of Pela Case, which at the time was an idea he had been perfecting to make compostable iPhone cases.  I didn’t so much care about building a phone case company as I did about creating a better kind of product company, one that left little to no footprint.  This decision was not just good business but also satisfied a personal need to start helping commerce evolve to a better place, and to me that meant commerce/retail needed to get a lot less wasteful.  I won’t go into it too much, but you can only help sell so much garbage (most product people buy is landfill bound) before it starts to weigh on you.  I’m determined to help change this global retail machine into something that we can be proud of leaving to future generations.  

In the middle of 2016 we created a program at Demac Media we called Merchant in Residence.  The program was modelled after the Entrepreneur in Residence found at my Venture Capitalists, with the basic idea being that we’d hire a young entrepreneur to be and give them a brand to build with the backing of Demac Media’s resources.  Enter Sunta, our first MIR and the driving force behind Pela Case growing into a 6 figure business within 6 months and is well on its way to being a 7 figure business by the end of 2017.  

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**  

**Q: How are you growing Pela?**  

I get some version of this question a lot, especially since Demac has worked with hundreds of merchants in various stages of growth/scale.  Everyone wants to know what the secret to building an eCommerce business is and mostly that means they want the silver bullet or tactic that gets them tons of qualified, money-in-hand traffic.  

Truth is, there is no easy answer here and it makes me a little sick trying to think about writing down every little thing I know about this subject.  Here are some of my favourite responses / points that I share whenever I get asked...  

1) Focus on one major channel and master it.  There’s only so many online channels that have meaningful scale and the tools to let you test lots of shit to see what works.  The big 4 (Google, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) are where 99% of us need to start and I like to pick one to go all in on before trying to master others.  For Pela we’ve been heavy into Facebook/Insta (same ad tool) from day 1 and are only now moving on to Google.  

2) Do things manually before trying to automate.  You won’t know what to automate until you’ve done the grunt work.  For example, do manual influencer outreach before you go and get a service/system to do it for you.  Your ROI will be an order of magnitude higher.  

3) Largely ignore all the “How to build a 7 figure eCommerce business” people out there.  Most are just telling you to find a product on Alibaba, knock it off (white/private label it) and sell it on Amazon.  This is hardly the path to what I would call a good business.  Its not sustainable and it certainly isn’t teaching you shit about what its like to really build a brand/business.  

4) Don’t buy every fucking app for your Shopify store.  You don’t need them all at the start and you likely won’t need most of them for a very long time.  Get the essentials first, and by essentials I mean whatever you require to support that first major channel you are going to focus on.  Start adding in additional apps like referral programs, loyalty, complex email flows, and other stuff only once you have a foundation.  

5) Ecommerce costs money.  Why?  Because inventory.  When you enter the world of physical stuff, there’s a natural overhead that comes with it and it's very different from its digital cousins.  This is a very hard industry to get into without some seed capital.  Pela has taken $100k of investment (in straight cash, not time) to get the business growing 15-25% per month.  

6) There’s only two ways to scale an eCommerce company.  Slowly and profitably or fast and unprofitably.  Don’t believe me, do a google search for failed eCommerce startups and tell me how many you find that achieved massive scale and are still around today and/or are in good shape.  If you trust me, save yourself the google search and let me tell you its a very short list.  You’re far more likely to succeed in eCommerce if you aim to build a small, very profitable business slowly than trying to scale quickly.  

7) This is Amazon’s world and we know it.  We are starting to use Amazon as a channel to help us get volume leverage, but that’s about all we use Amazon for.  Our intent is to build Pela into a great, global brand and the way to do that isn’t by allowing Amazon to keep all those customer relationships behind their walls. We are only now (Q3 2017) looking to add Amazon Marketplace on as a channel for Pela and we won’t even be putting all of our products on it as we want to create awareness and leverage back to pelacase.com main site.  

**Q: What’s the most difficult thing about running a company this size?  Or multiple companies for that matter?**  

Balance.  Growing businesses require a lot of nurturing.  The people, the customers, the processes, everything really.  I believe balance is bullshit, but its the only term that everyone seems to understand when I answer this question.  My goal is to operate in a state of flow.  I can tell when I’m out of it as everything I do feels harder, professionally, spiritually, emotionally, all of it.  The ups and downs of building a business has got to be one of the most consistent methods of knocking you out of flow.  

Managing large teams is really difficult (next question will dig in to this).  The best businesses I’ve seen have very simple operating models.  The main challenge with Demac Media is that being a service business with more than 1 service offering is that it is complex and therefor requires more management overhead to scale.  The relationship between scale & complexity is something I think about a lot.  Adding in multiple companies just makes my work more complex but I try and keep the individual businesses fairly isolated so they don’t create complexity for each other (this is also hard when under the same physical roof).  

**Q: Do you like having so many employees?**  

Most of the time, yes.  Sometimes, no.  That’s the honest answer.  I’ve never met an entrepreneur who loves having a lot of employees all of the time.  There are days where I really enjoy seeing so many people helping me on this journey.  Then there are days where I think that the best business is the one without customers or employees (not rational, but honest).  I often have to remind myself that people are messy.  Relationships of any kind are messy.  

To expect the people side of any part of your life to be sunshine and roses at all times seems a little foolish.  Business is no different.  

One of the biggest challenges in scaling teams is communication.  It is very easy for things to get lost in translation with lots of people in a company.  

As I mentioned above, it’s hard keeping everyone happy all the time.  As the leader this is really hard on me emotionally.  I don’t like it when anyone is unhappy as a result of a decision I’ve had to make.  Sometimes I wish I was a bit more thick skinned but after almost a decade of doing this I don’t think I’ll ever be ok making decisions that will result in someone not getting what they want/need.  Trade offs suck, especially with people.  

**Q: What’s my definition of success?**  

First, this is totally subjective.  Regardless of your definition, success and failure sit on a spectrum so it’s good to recognize this and not get too obsessive with an absolute definition of one or the other.  To me success has more to do with freedom of choice combined with some positive impact.  I want the freedom to choose how I spend my time and I get joy from having impact.  

That said, I’m really careful and somewhat protective of my time now.  It’s the only thing I’m 100% confident in not being able to make more of.  This is probably the one thing I’d tell my 25 year old self to think more about if I could.  Having the freedom to choose how you spend your time should also mean taking the time to figure out what charges you up and gives you purpose.

**Q: What’s your exit strategy (hate this one)?**  

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been asked this question over the years.  I never set out to sell Demac and don’t have any immediate plans to do so.  I’ve always said that for me to sell it would need to be a life-changing deal.  I know that selling a company successfully is a very rare thing so I focus on building a good business first and believe that if I do that there will be opportunities to exit along the way.  

I also think that there are many forms of an “exit”.  They don’t all mean selling or IPO.  There are very large companies where the founders are no longer operational but rather shareholders and stewards of the business.  I don’t have an opinion on which type of exit is better because I haven’t put a lot of thought into it.  

My last comment on this.  A few years ago I was listening to a podcast (forget which) where some entrepreneur was talking about how every business he’s started he knew the exit strategy from day 1.  It always struck me as kind of odd that you’d build a business to leave it as quickly as possible…that didn’t feel right.

597,hczt2e,False,,115,You can do a lot with very little,Entrepreneur,"Long time reader first time poster here and I just want to say for people like me who read and read and answer sometimes on here you can break into a market or business with just some determination and dedication. I've been laid off for almost a year from my last full time job. It was a nightmare, I had to go back to bar-tending, mowing lawns, detailing cars anything to get by. Lucky for me I was able to rent a cheap room at a friends house and didn't have to worry about a big rent or house payment. 

The whole time I was on here and on YouTube ""learning"" and trying to find my thing. Yes, sometimes i would take some time to watch people fall off ladders or animals attacking children but who doesn't right? But the whole time I felt like I was getting no where. I felt i would be good at certain niche's and I just need some start up cash. Well I never earned enough to save enough to feel comfortable taking the leap. I see it a lot of here, people afraid to just ""start"". 

I'm here to tell you that we all ""start"" in our own way. Sometimes it a book, or a video that helps get us in the mindset to push thru the negatives and figure it out. I started doing some dispatch work with a old co-worker and he was hiring for a part time guy. The man he worked for was wanting to work less and i guess semi-retire and they needed a extra set of eyes and ears to help book loads and take care of day to day. That was two months ago. I've been full time after the first week and me and my buddy have just finished the paperwork on buying the company from the old man! Well its a structured deal and full ownership won't take place till Jan 2021 but it is ours to run and grow. All my time spent learning to sell and learning to communicate is being used. My ability to be patience and understanding is helping grow the company. These are all things I learned from books and the Internet. 

Now, this was not something I was ""looking"" for. But buy watching drop ship videos and FBA videos and all these books on sales and marketing have given me the confidence I need to grow this company. It may sounds cheesy but learning can take place any time any where. Read as much as you can, watch videos when you are tired of reading. Research anything that interests you. You will find that at the end of the day, all you really need is the desire to solve a problem and will to want to succeed. You will find your ""thing"". You will get that dream job. You don't have to be Elon Musk and follow his schedule to be successful. Just start. 

My partner and I have double are gross sales after our first full month. It not rocket science, its not some magic formula that I paid $89.99 for. It's not some e-book i bought for $10 on Instagram. All you need to do is start. Sometimes that start, is here. Reading these posts where someone has a problem. Now if you have that problem you know, even if you thought you would never need it. You can do. Just start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/hczt2e/you_can_do_a_lot_with_very_little/,535,Congratulations! ,2020-06-21 03:20:50

282,8cm6pd,False,,121,Marketing checklist we use for clients,Entrepreneur,"Hope this helps someone - I wrote this as a reply to a few people in /r/SEO and had good DM's about it, so decided to just make it a post. The list is table stakes for any online marketing, and certainly isn't exhaustive - hopefully others can add their suggested tasks to it too?

---------

1. Get yourself Google Tag Manager \([tagmanager.google.com](https://tagmanager.google.com)\) and install that pixel on the page
2. Get all your tracking pixels in the tag container \- so your Facebook Tracking Pixel, then Twitter, Quora, Adwords, LinkedIn, Reddit \- they all have tracking pixels mate. Get all of them! Also get [hotjar.com](https://hotjar.com) or [crazyegg.com](https://crazyegg.com) so you have some actual visibility on your site as to what people are actually doing \- every swipe, tap, mouse movement and click \- all recorded for you to see what people are ACTUALLY doing on your site versus what you THINK they're doing!
3. Get your Google Search Console hooked up with your Google Analytics hooked up with your Adwords \- there's heaps to this, and it's a pain in the arse, won't lie. I can help you remotely on this if you need a hand or someone else in r/forhire
4. Setup your conversion pixel events in all the ones i mentioned in \(2\) \- these are different to the standard page tracking pixels, as they track who comes to which of your pages: What a CONVERSION pixel does though, is to track when someone purchases, or where they sign up to your newsletter or call you etc \- actual things that make you money there and then, as opposed to just tracking.
5. Create custom audiences in Facebook, Twitter, Adwords and all the ones in \(2\). A custom audience is where you take your existing emails and upload them into each platform, where the platform then matches the emails to accounts on that platform. Now you may only have 100\-200 emails for example, and these WON'T be enough to then run an advert to, BUTTTTT you can then create ""lookalike audiences"" in the platforms where each platform goes off and finds people that very closely match the qualities, aspirations, hopes, dreams, desires and marketing demographics of the millions of available people it has data on \(see why Facebook is under massive PR scrutiny now?\) and then gives you that audience to then market to.
6. Create a newsletter opt\-in that pops up on the site after a set scroll period and/or time on site. Also set the popup to appear when someone is exiting the site \- this is literally called an ""exit intent"" popup. They were going to leave anyway, so might as well try and get their details.
7. Create further custom audiences of people that visit specific pages or click specific buttons or who add to shopping cart but then dont purchase \- as well as one for purchasers too! These custom audiences will be great for what we call ""retargeting"" or ""remarketing"" \- they're where people come to your site, and do some shit but don't buy anything for example, but the tracking pixels ""fire"" and when they go back into their social media platform of choice \- well, there is the retargeting advert for the product they were looking at or the category they were choosing from. You will have seen this yourself when looking at a piece of clothing or wallet or whatever \- when you dont buy it, the product then seems to follow you around the internet no matter where you go \(if the marketer is skilled enough!\)
8. MAKE SURE you have your Google Analytics setup with your ecommerce package too \- so when people start to buy, you know where they are, what device, what time best converts, how many times they came back to the site before purchasing \- and then be able to break down which product\(s\) are selling best based on actual data rather than gut feels.
9. Make sure you have your Instagram account setup for business use, and make sure you apply for shopping tags usage \- these will be invaluable for you to have people tap on your item picture in your feed WITHOUT ads \(sometimes!\) for people to then tap and buy there and then. Powerful stuff but you have to get your instagram account verified as a business.
10. Speaking of business verification \- get your Google My Business all setup too. We've talked about Analytics \+ Search Console etc here already, but when you get your Google My Business all setup with address on the map that gets verified, phone number, web address and open hours etc \- that then leads to great things: Review extensions, location extensions and call extensions and basically ALL the Adwords Ad Extensions can then be used to trounce your competitors. All can be setup free, apart from the PPC obviously!
11. Get cracking with video content! Show some products being made, show them in use from customers who tell how happy they are, show kids with your patches \- really pull at heart strings and invest someone's emotion watching the videos. Yes, even for patches.
12. Setup your YouTube channel too \- get those videos up there on YouTube and Facebook on your business page AND ON YOUR PERSONAL FB Profile too! Do business from your personal profiles and treat all the social networks as business avenues now, rather than post family and friends shit \- still DO that, but keep it to a minimum so you can show people some transparency on the person BEHIND the company.
13. Get ALL your videos you post, transcribed with captions from [rev.com](https://rev.com) \- $1 per video minute, and it helps in getting your video watched and ranked.
14. If you're hooked up in your Google Search Console, feel free to then activate your YouTube cards with the link back to your site that can be sprung at any time during the video. Here's the kicker though \- YT recent fucked everyone in small business just starting out, by saying you can't have that feature unless you have a load of subscribers and watch time. Buy them. Don't worry about it \- you're not giving a flying fuck about these fake subscribers as you're ONLY doing this to get the YT Cards with Link feature unlocked. Don't feel bad or fake \- YT brought this on themselves.
15. Live stream your heart out. Live stream the devices being made and again, show viewers some genuine heartstring tugging stories. That shit gets shared. A LOT.
16. Instagram influencer marketing is good when it works \- but check their account for number of fake followers Vs genuine followers. There's heaps of free tools around, but at time of writing Facebook \(who own instagram\) are cracking down on their API so a lot of the tools will stop working soon. Find one. Rape it for info as much as you can for as long as you can, and then DM these account holders offering them a referral fee \- you'll need a UTM tracking URL for that Influencer to give out so you can track any sales back to them. OR you can agree to a set fee \- say 4c per genuine follower for a shout. Results will vary, but at least you know you got tools to analyse an Insta account now. Glad you liked this list hopefully!

455,dmvn13,False,,140,"Re-Selling Non-Refundable Plane Tickets ~ 6,000,000 Flights Going To Waste Each Year",Entrepreneur,"We give people refunds for their non-refundable flights and hotel bookings! And we provide travellers with unique below-market prices for holidays. Curious fact - one of the most frequently cited reasons for the canceled holiday is relationship breakups.

Have you purchased a non-refundable flight or a hotel room, only to realise that you can't go and lose all your money? It happens to millions of people every year. SpareFare solves this problem by connecting people who have bought flights or hotel reservations but can no longer use them, with people seeking discounted travel options. Sellers can now recover part of the money they paid for their trip. Getting half of your money back is still better than losing everything! And buyers get a true discount of up to 50-60% by not paying the current price of the bookings. It is a complete win-win for both sides.

Like most startups, this one was created out of personal need. It was a lightbulb moment. It all started when my co-founder realized he would not be able to use a flight due to unpredictable work commitments. Full of misplaced hope, he ended up changing the outbound date two times, until he eventually gave up. None of his friends wanted the ticket and there wasn’t a scam-free marketplace he could sell it on. He saw the need for a trustworthy service which salvages costly travel tickets and gives people the chance to fly when all other options dry up. I’ve had the same problem with canceled holidays and it was very obvious to me that this is a gap in the market which needs to be addressed. 

**Who is your target demographic?**

Since we are a marketplace, we have two different types of customers – sellers and buyers. Our sellers are very diverse – everybody travels and plans change frequently. Our buyers are flexible travelers looking for bargain holidays. Students and self-employed freelancers make up a big part of that group. Of course, we are expanding and hope one day to be the go-to place for anyone looking for a genuine discount on their holiday! 

**How did you fund the idea initially?**

I have two co-founders and we met while studying at the London School of Economics.[ SpareFare](https://sparefare.net/) was and still is, funded by our own savings. This gives us the luxury of time to test ideas and fail on our own terms. The three of us were working as City professionals and had some savings we could use. Combined with that we also had to be very cautious about spending.

We are based in London, but paying professionals and employees here is prohibitively expensive for a small startup without investor funding. I am Bulgarian and this has been a wonderful blessing because we outsource whatever we can to Bulgaria. The talent pool there is great and the hourly rates are a fraction of what we’d have to pay someone in London. For anyone thinking of doing something similar – you don’t have to speak Bulgarian to do this, everyone speaks English. Our first employee was a friend who helped with customer service and marketing. 

She did this on an hourly basis and we only paid her for the hours she needed to work that week – some weeks were busier than others and it was difficult to predict at the beginning. She had a full-time job and fit the SpareFare work around that. Per hour, we paid her a sixth of what we would have had to pay someone in London with the same level of experience. Keeping her hours flexible, combined with the low hourly-rate was a very cost-efficient way to hire our first employee. Our developers are all in Bulgaria as well. When I hear fellow startup founders paying £100,000 for a website, it makes me laugh and cry at the same time! 

**What motivated you to start your own business?** 

Prior to SpareFare I was a solicitor (that is a British lawyer for the non-Brits reading this!) working for a big American law firm in London. The job is very prestigious, with high-profile clients and you are very well compensated. Understandably, when I told my family I was going to quit to work on SpareFare, they were less than keen. 

My grandma is still not able to understand why anyone would quit a stable career to pursue their dreams! :D I am sure this was the right thing to do and I enjoy working on SpareFare very much. It is hard and I don’t expect it to get any easier anytime soon, but the thrill of doing a job with a purpose is incomparable. SpareFare is a startup with a mission – make travel more affordable for everyone.  I know that lots of travelers need our service and we are literally creating a new market in the travel industry, so it is very exciting! 

**Do you have any advice for someone just starting out?**

Quite a lot! It turns out I was very naïve about some things in the beginning. And thank God I was, or I might have never started! As a rule of thumb, everything takes twice as long as you think. Always factor in extra time in your timelines. Also, it is much more emotional than just going to work and doing your 9-5 office job. Your business is your baby and everything is personal. Failures feel ten times worse and success feels a hundred times better when you are doing it for your own company! 

Get ready for rejections and people who do not believe in your idea. I know that SpareFare provides a much-needed service in the travel industry, as validated by our many clients and great user feedback. Naturally, I thought that everyone would see things my way, like the idea and want to work with us. In reality, I receive many rejections and no’s. I don’t take it personally and remember that it is just part of the game.

54,dl06pa,False,Lessons Learned,225,"I hit my first $5,000+/month. Here's every mistake I made on the way.",Entrepreneur,"The headline is more to grab your attention than to brag because the rest of this post is not going to be nearly as sexy. I wanted to write this post for people who are struggling to make their first $1,000 or $5,000 - I want to give you an inside look to how I did this, not overnight, but what the ugly, drawn-out process looked like for me.

There's no get-rich-quick tips here. There's no ""hacks."" No ""shortcuts."" I'm a very unlucky person who feels very lucky to be able to make this amount from my laptop at home while dealing with my endless medical issues.

# Background information about the business:

* **Name/URL:** It's my username. I probably don't even show up on Google - also, I don't have social media outside of Reddit so there isn't much to look at. P.S. Not a self-promo, I'm booked out and not looking for more work.
* **Type of business:** ""Virtual assistance"" - basically, if someone needs an extra hand to do it in their business, I probably do it. My limitations are code/development and design. I am horrendous in those areas.
* **Business model:** People pay me a flat fee of $1000/month to be their virtual assistant for a flat fee of $600/month to write 4 pieces of content for them (email or blog only). *Note: I don't do hourly fees because I work quickly. I am not going to work for $15 because I did it in 1 hour when someone would do the same work in 2 hours and make $30?* When I break it down (I track my hours using Toggl) it's roughly $45-$100/hour per client, monthly.
* **Open since:** Officially? August 2019. When I started virtual assistance? 2010 - which leads me to the rest of this post.

# Tidbit about me for context:

* I'm in my super late 20's.
* Single mom, 2 young kids - one isn't in school yet.
* Clinically diagnosed schizo-bipolar, BPD, and PTSD - this is important because I believe this is why it took me so long to get here.
* College dropout with 1.4 GPA. (Criminal Justice)
* Only ""legitimate"" job was USMC, of which I only did 1 term as a glorified dispatcher.
* Based in the USA. I don't live in a huge city and rent for 3 bedrooms is $900 where I live, to give you context about my choices for pricing.

# Starting Expenses:

* MacBook Air: $800 (bought it on Black Friday in 2016, returned by original buyer)
* Mouse: $20
* iPhone 6s: $650 (bought it in 2016, completely paid off)
* Squarespace Domain: $20/year
* Squarespace Business hosting + SSL certificate: $216
* Logo: $29 (hired a friend to do it)

# How I Hit $5,000/Month + All The Mistakes Made:

I didn't really know what a virtual assistant was or how long I had been doing it. I was roughly 18-19 years old, homeless (couch surfing), and needed money fast.

I looked at Craigslist's ""odd jobs."" Found a job from a now popular porn site that paid people $35/hour with a $250 bonus, to label like 800 porn videos in 1 week. I was making about $1,000/week doing this but being young and naive, spent it all at once thinking that this money would always be there.

*Then they outsourced to India and every American lost their job.*

**Mistake #1: I put all my eggs in one basket.**

From here, I continued to make this mistake. I made a good amount off of Fiverr, only to get my account closed because a client complained about something I don't recall doing (I rather not call her a liar). If it's on r/WorkOnline and doesn't require a degree, I've probably been there, done that, and continued to put all my eggs in one basket until I burned myself out.

**Mistake #2: Lack of self-care/sleep because I wanted to ""grind/hustle"" = Burn out = Declining mental health = Poor sleep habits = Poor eating habits = Poor hygiene habits = Health problems = etc.**

This phase of my life was a blur, but a very important blur because here, I was trial and error-ing different things I could do. I was blogging. I was messing around on Twitter with tools like HootSuite and MeetEdgar. I made websites on Wordpress and Wix and Blogger. I took $5/hour r/slavelabour-style jobs because it's all I was qualified to do.

If I didn't know how to do it, I didn't let the client know. I Googled and spent hours on the forgotten corners of internet forums and Reddit, hoping to find the answer to a hopeless problem.

I didn't sleep much or slept too much. My mental health went ignored. I literally started hallucinating and having meltdowns, which eventually led to my divorce, which will be more relevant later on.

**Mistake #3: I widely underestimated what people were willing to throw money at.**

Eventually, I learned what a ""virtual assistant"" was and called myself that. I also learned that a lot of people will pay you to do simple things they can't be arsed to do themselves - like upload a blog post, write an email, or do customer support. Or label porn.

Think of a virtual assistant as a virtual ""nanny"" or ""nurse"" who does everything for the business/entrepreneur so the business/entrepreneur can focus on making money.

(You're probably wondering where I found my clients. Upwork. Craigslist. Seriously.)

By this time, I was making about $1,000/month - which is barely enough to live on. I apply for food stamps to eat, at this point.

I slogged like this for a few more years, until my ex-husband had a mid-life crisis. He kicked me and the kids out.

**Mistake #4: Being comfortable. Not having a savings/emergency fund.**

My credit score sucks due to poor money decisions (don't worry, I'm subscribed to r/personalfinance and r/leanfire now to learn money handling skills) so I couldn't take out a loan to move. My Discord friends and 3 IRL friends (I don't have family, it's just me) loaned me about $500 altogether. I told all of my clients what was happening - partially so they could find a replacement or expect me to go MIA.

To my surprise, ALL OF THEM, immediately asked, ""How can I help?"" One of my clients gave me a $500 advance on our retainer and contracted me to set up a Squarespace website for another $500. Another client put together a PDF of resources for single mothers and government assistance.

I spent every penny I made as a virtual assistant, on this move.

There is something life shaking about being homeless and alone (which I was when I started this journey). There's something terrifying about the idea of being homeless and alone - especially when children are involved.

*This is the turning point that lit a fire under my ass.*

I set a goal to hit $5,000/month by December 2019 - 3 virtual assistance clients at $1,000/month a pop and 4 writing clients at $600/month. I also take side projects that are non-retainer.

Problem? I was very fucking alone.

**Mistake #5: Underestimating the power of people. Being a dick. Thinking I knew better. Shitting on coaches and guru's that I've never met.**

Here was my strategy, since I don't have friends, ad spend money, or time:

* Think of all current clients and clients from the last 6 months who have money and never had issues paying me. Pitch them the $1000/month idea. (Only one, of 10, converted, BUT THAT'S 1/3 SECURED).
* Make Facebook account
* Join 20 Facebook groups per day. Filter them. Add the top 10 (engagement and where my potential clients are) pinned to shortcuts.
* Add 500 friends/day who are potential leads.
* Make a website with a landing page for my business.
* Make people laugh. (Yeah, seriously. Entrepreneurship is so stuffy and stuck up sometimes, I needed a way to catch people's attention).
* Help people and don't pitch. (Because it's 2019 and everyone is pitching and when you don't pitch, people wonder who the hell you are and look at your profile, where you can conveniently leave your URL)
* My flat fee is $1,000/month. I will not take a dollar less. It's $500 upfront to secure me and I do not work until the next 2 weeks ($500/biweekly) is paid in full. I cannot chase non-paying clients.

I don't have a ""page"" by the way. This is all my personal account. I did this religiously for 2 weeks and posted a lot of business-related memes. I shared stories about labeling porn. People laughed and told me they really liked my ""energy."" They felt safe.

I went into Facebook groups and answered peoples questions and calmed them down when they had business issues. ""My email marketing tool is not sending out my broadcasts"" ""I am not reaching over 10% open rate in my emails."" All those years of Googling and slogging away paid off.

Where do coaches and gurus come in? **They have an audience.** I learned that they are not necessarily going to make you rich but they are a pay to play model. I joined some girl-power group led by a guru ($15/month) and bought myself into her audience. I told her straight up, ""Look, I'm trying to book out and this is what I do. Here's my website."" She blasted my info to her audience. I ate a slice of humble pie and stopped doing the shit-on-coaches crap.

My funny memes? People *shared* them.

Every time someone offered ""free coaching calls"" I took them up on it. I wrote glowing reviews, which they SHARED. **For the last month, people in these circles constantly saw my name and face.** If these coaches and gurus with thousands of followers were vouching for me, I am trustworthy, and if I am trustworthy, my website is worth looking at.

The rest was a waiting game. If people emailed me, I emailed back within 6 hours. If they inquired about me on Facebook messenger, I messaged back the same day.

People booked calls with me and talked to me. I had to talk to a lot of people before someone finally said yes, but who the fuck cares. THEY SAID YES.

This weekend, I booked out. I had to decline two people this morning because I just don't have time for more clients. I put them on a waitlist. But now I've secured $5,000/month minimum on retainer clients and I'm building my waitlist.

Also, paid all my friends back.

But, this brings me to my latest mistake:

**Mistake #6: No source of passive income and capping income.**

I've capped myself at $5,000/month :( So... what the hell do I do now?

I'm going to create a source of passive income which I won't talk about here so it doesn't become a pitch. I'll attempt to scale it to $5,000/month. After that, I'm going to convert my virtual assistance clients to digital marketing clients and work on commission so my income ceiling is higher. I've never made more than $5,000/month so I don't know what I don't know and I intend to continue making mistakes along the way.

Also, this subreddit hates coaches, but the majority of my clients are coaches. Best part? **They have money.** I plan on hiring one who offered me a very valuable free coaching call a few weeks ago.

# TL;DR:

I spent a lot of time learning random skill sets and then learned people will hire me for the skill set. Spent years doubting myself and undercharging. Ex kicked me and the kids out. I panicked. Set up a website. Mass networked on Facebook. Did a shit-ton of free calls to get free business tips from guru's. Bought into low-entry groups for more visibility. Made people laugh. Did even more shit-tons of ""discovery calls"" for potential clients. Answered a lot of emails and inquiries. Asked. For. Help.

And there you have it. None of this was glamorous or sexy, and I took almost a decade to get to $5,000/month but every journey starts somewhere, right?

Hope this was helpful to *someone* out there. Have a good one.

# FAQ Edit:

Hey, wow, thanks for the response. My email, DM's, inbox, and the comment thread here is pretty flooded but I'll try to answer as many questions as possible in between my breaks.

**I want that dropshipping resource. Send it to me?**

Read this guide by 7FS: [https://files.convertkitcdnn.com/assets/documents/34674/2440142/350\_\_Niche\_2019\_-\_FINAL.pdf](https://files.convertkitcdnn.com/assets/documents/34674/2440142/350__Niche_2019_-_FINAL.pdf).

I do not endorse them and their customer reviews are garbage so hire them at your own risk. However, their strategy on researching luxury/high-ticket niches is solid. If you skip this step or fudge it (researching 2-3 niches instead of the recommended 50) and you're wondering why your store failed, well... there you go. Also covers how to work with suppliers and such.

**How do you manage the kids while being a single mom?**

I work with them instead of against them. My kids are monsters after 12pm (as most kids are due to being overstimulated and tired). I get up at 5am and get the bulk of my work done before 11am. My 1st grader is in school, 3 year old watches tv and eats breakfast (which I cook in bulk so I can microwave it quickly). By noon, I'm tired, my kids want my attention, and I can't slog through work if they need me so I do household chores, cook, spend time with them, during this time. They're in bed at 6:30pm and I spend the evening doing self-care, taking courses on Skillshare, reading, etc.

**Are you hiring/subcontracting? Are you taking mentees?**

Yes and no. First off, I only work with USA-based subcontractors and mentees because I can't begin to understand the cultural impact and obstacles that comes with being an overseas contractor. Second, I'm looking for a very specific type of subcontractor - they've already VA'd for several businesses and have an interest in problem-solving (a core skill every contractor needs). I'm currently not mentoring but would highly recommend:

* Check out your local SCORE for free mentors: [https://score.org/mentor-match](https://www.score.org/mentor-match)
* Getting an accountability buddy in r/accountabilitybuddies
* Work exchange with a coach. I did this a few times. I offered unpaid VA work in exchange for a coaching call. This also lead to paid clients in the past because coaches = big network/influence.

**Are you saying we should use your strategy ""shotgun"" method on Facebook?**

Absolutely not. You should determine where your audience is, figure out how they respond, and design your marketing strategy to put yourself on their radar. The Facebook strategy worked for me because it's specific to my target audience. You have to reverse engineer a strategy for your audience. This requires a lot of trial by fire, by the way. You probably won't figure it out the first dozen times you try. Remember, you're reading my TLDR. I didn't get into all the different crap I tried that didn't work (like trying to run a Facebook ad and paid $60 for a lead.)

**Do you have any recommended resources/books/guides?**

Sure.

* r/Stoicism subreddit. Getting my mind right was a huge stepping stone for me. Stop whining. Stop complaining. Stop making excuses. Stop keeling over when things suck. Stop idolizing people. Stop caring when people talk shit or praise you. Be in the moment, work, help other people succeed, rinse, repeat.
* Don't buy a course. Get Skillshare and learn what you need to learn for much cheaper: [https://www.skillshare.com/home](https://www.skillshare.com/home)
* Read. Get a subscription on Scribd: [https://www.scribd.com/](https://www.scribd.com/)
* Learn copywriting. It'll help you write emails, websites, content, sales pitches - it is the most crucial skill to being able to sell, in my opinion. My favorite resource for copywriting (if you're a designer, warning, you WILL throw up at the design): [https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/](https://kopywritingkourse.com/blog/) (You don't need to buy his course but if you do, he does ""tear downs"" which was really valuable to me.)

**Can you help me? Can you refer clients to me? Can you help me make money?**

Well, tell me what you've done to help yourself, first. If you message me but you don't know what type of work you want to do, what kind of clients you want to work with, or made a lot of attempts and failures already, you have to get your feet wet. I'm not saying that to be a dick, you only know what works and what doesn't by *doing it.* You also have to be able to define a measurable way to track your success/lack of. **If you've already jumped in the trenches and it's not working, sure, we can shoot some ideas back and forth**. If you're hoping I just hand you a strategy or trust a random Redditor with my referrals, I'm sorry, but that won't help you. There is a difference between being handed the answer key to a test and working hard to understand the material for an exam. One will build you a solid foundation, the other will sustain you for a week and then you'll be back to square one because you didn't learn anything.

566,3932zv,False,,258,Apple stole my product today. Please share so that the voice of independent developers is heard!,Entrepreneur,"UPDATE: after discussing with several well-informed people who contacted me through this post, we've found that there's nothing I can do as an independent developer. The patent I have pending for World View Wallpaper primarily covers my unique time dilation algorithm (where the position of the sun is matched from the captured photos to your current time using location and season). Assuming Apple doesn't use that same algorithm, the idea of showing pictures based on time alone is considered common knowledge. Well, at least I can now say that I made something Apple deemed worth highlighting in their keynote! Now that they have the same idea running through their heads... maybe we can get them to listen to us and add live wallpaper capabilities to iOS so that World View Wallpaper can live on as an iOS app?

---

My name is Todd Medema, inventor of World View Wallpaper, a Window/Mac/Android/Chrome app I developed while in school back in 2012. The app uses photographs captured over 24 hours as a method of telling time.

Today at WWDC, Apple announced a new ""Time Lapse"" watch face for the Apple Watch.

At first look, they appear to be very similar. Which is surprising, since Apple rejected my iOS app several times, stating that the app ""didn't provide enough value to users.""

I was a college student who wanted to create something that would make peoples' lives just a little more beautiful. After receiving positive feedback on the idea, I poured hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars into building the apps and capturing the photographs.

Apple appears to have taken my idea without giving me any credit. In fact, Apple has a history of stealing ideas from apps that they reject.

Please share this story on social media in hopes that Apple may hear the voice of a small, independent developer who has been wronged. While I'm pleased to see that so many people will now be able to enjoy the idea I've worked so hard for, Apple's handling of this violates the spirit of innovation in this country. That's something worth fighting for.

**Background**

Go down to --------------------- to skip intro


&nbsp;


My name is Josh Shogren and I am about to be a sophomore in College. I have been creating niche websites for the past year and a half, including selling a site for close to $12k. I currently have a portfolio of websites that make me hundreds of dollars each month and I continue to build new ones.


&nbsp;

Other Affiliate Site - [http://imgur.com/9frovuk](http://imgur.com/9frovuk)


Sold Site Proof - [http://imgur.com/1w8LAkZ](http://imgur.com/1w8LAkZ)


&nbsp;


My main area of expertise when it comes to websites is being able to rank them in Google. I utilize my private blog network (PBN) sites to rank most of my sites and in my opinion the best way to rank sites. That is if you know what you are doing. I think that investing in websites is going to be huge within 10 years and will be recognized as an actual investment strategy just as stocks, bonds and real estate are today. We are in the very early stages of websites and if you know what you are doing you can make a killing buying/selling websites.


&nbsp;


Or you can buy and hold websites and get an incredible return on your money, especially compared to the average 8% annual return on traditional investments. I am not going to go in depth into this topic but here is an example of an average return for a website:


&nbsp;


A website making $1,000 a month can be purchased for $20k based on the 20x the 3 month average profit. So let’s say we buy that website for $20k and we get $1k each month in profit. That ends up being 5% return on your money MONTHLY, or 60% YEARLY. Those are insane RIO and the crazy thing is this is very normal for websites.


&nbsp;


I have explained this to my parents for the past year or so and they always found it intriguing, but recently they have gotten serious about it after we had a long sit down talk about the potential of investing in websites. We decided that my parents would purchase the website with their money and I would run the website. We agreed on splitting the monthly earnings 50/50 and then when we well the website they get their initial investment back and then we split the leftover profits in half.


&nbsp;


Example, bought a website for $10k then sold for $16k. They would get their initial $10k back and then we would split the remaining $6k between us 50/50. 


&nbsp;


They gave me an initial budget of $10k-$15k to look for a website for them to invest in. A couple days later after we talked about this, my parents told some friends of theirs and they are willing to invest another $10k in websites as well.


&nbsp;


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&nbsp;


All in all, I have around a $20k-$25k budget to look for a website or websites to invest in with this money. This was about two weeks ago, I have made a website purchase since then. Read below.


&nbsp;


I ended up buying a website from Flippa that is making $500 a month from adsense. I bought the website for only $6k, which is deeply undervalued. A site making $500 a month should at least sell for $10k, so I got a steal of a deal! If I wanted to, I could hold onto the site for 3 months, make $500 a month and then sell it for $10k. I would make $4k profit + $1500 earnings = $5.5k profit in 3 months.


&nbsp;


However this is not my plan, my plan is to increase the monthly earnings and hold onto it for a while. Then sell it once I feel like I have maxed out the earning potential of the site. I will talk more about my future plans for this in a minute, but first I want to talk about why I liked this site so much(aside from the cheap price).


&nbsp;


**Diversified Traffic Sources**


This is huge. We are all aware of how easily Google can wipe a site completely off the grid in no time. That is why it is NOT smart to rely on only organic google traffic for your site, or only one traffic source for that matter.
The site I bought has diversified traffic sources, the breakdown is below:


&nbsp;


Social Traffic - 53%


&nbsp;



Direct Traffic - 25%


&nbsp;



Organic Traffic - 18%


&nbsp;



Referral Traffic - 4%


&nbsp;


Proof Thru 2 Days - [http://imgur.com/ES2EceB](http://imgur.com/ES2EceB)


&nbsp;


If one of those traffic sources gets wiped out for whatever reason, the site would still be fine and earn money. It might not earn as much money as before, but it would still make money and be able to be sold. The most important thing is that you can’t go from having a website that earns $500 a month to $0 overnight. Multiple traffic streams prevent this happening.


&nbsp;


**High Volume of Traffic**


The site get’s on average 1k-2k visitors each day fairly consistently, sometimes even more! That is a lot of traffic which makes testing out different monetization methods a lot easier and more efficient.


&nbsp;


Proof - [http://imgur.com/StNaAPx](http://imgur.com/StNaAPx)


&nbsp;


**Growing Organic Traffic**


I was given access to the previous owner’s Google Analytics account before I purchased the site and one of the best things I saw was that the organic traffic has increased each month for the past year. I don’t have access to their account anymore so I can’t show you firsthand. However, you can see the growth from Semrush in the image below:


&nbsp;


Semrush Traffic Growth - [http://imgur.com/DrGRD7N](http://imgur.com/DrGRD7N)


&nbsp;


Semrush does a good job showing the google organic traffic growth by tracking the number of keywords that are in the top 20 of Google. You can see that the amount of keywords that this site ranks for in the top 20 continue to grow month after month. This is a great sight to see. The reason for this continued to growth is because the previous owner writes 3 new articles a week and the site ranks for a TON of long tail keywords. 


&nbsp;


**Under Optimized Monetization Methods**


Google adsense is one of the easiest ways to monetize any website, but there are usually better ways to do it. Adsense also makes it very easy to use other monetization methods ALONG with adsense. For example, it is very easy to use Amazon and Adsense to monetize a site without affecting the original adsense earnings too drastically. The only source of income for this site is from adsense and I think there are better ways to make money from this website. I am thinking about trying Amazon Affiliate, other affiliate’s within the niche, selling ad space and selling my own physical product.


&nbsp;


I also think I can improve the adsense earnings because the previous owner had poor ad placement on the site. They didn’t have any ads within the content, which from my experience is one of the best earning ad placements you can choose. That alone should increase the earnings.


&nbsp;


One of the biggest areas where I think I can improve the sites earnings is from optimizing for mobile users. I noticed that the site only showed one ad when viewing the mobile version of the site, instead of the normal 3 ads when viewing on a desktop. This means that A LOT of money is being taken off the table by not optimizing for mobile users. This is especially true considering over 50% of the sites users are mobile. I think by changing this I can improve the earnings greatly.


&nbsp;


**Proven Track Record**


This site was created over a year ago and has increased traffic/earnings steadily since then. There has also only been one owner which is a good thing to see.


&nbsp;


**Relatively Safe Investment**


Since I am using other people’s money to buy this site I want to make sure the website I am buying is as safe as can be. This means that there are no major risks or red flags surrounding the site which could possibly wipe out the earnings and traffic.


Diversified traffic sources, proven track record, clean backlink profile and monetized by adsense all make this website investment very safe compared to normal websites that are purchased.


&nbsp;


**Goals**


I think that I can grow this site to earning $1k+ a month consistently and my plan is to hold it as long as there is still earning potential. Once I reach the peak of earnings I will think about selling it, this will be 9+ months down the road. For now, I will testing out different monetization methods and trying to increase the traffic to the site.


&nbsp;


**Future Plans**


Future plans for this site will be to add 2-3 new articles each week and keep growing the organic traffic month after month. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of long tail keywords that can be turned into articles for this site. These long tail keywords may only have 50 monthly searches but when you have 100 of them it starts to add up. That’s the plan for now. I also will NOT be building any sort of backlinks to this site, instead I will let it grow naturally!


&nbsp;


As for investing the rest of the money (~$10k - $20k), I will be searching Flippa and Empire Flippers everyday until I find a site that I want. I am not going to rush into buying any site and I will make sure that it is the perfect site before I purchase. I truly believe that investing in websites is the future and right now the market is ripe to make a killing. 


&nbsp;


If you all want, I can come back in a month and give you all an update on the progress of the site I bought as well as if I found any other sites to buy. if this is something that you all might like let me know in the comments.


Thank you for all for reading!

809,8pcytm,False,,63,The 3 Step Process To Find The Perfect Niche For You,Entrepreneur,"If you follow this specific process, it will be impossible for you to **not** have a niche selected by the end of this post. Now, bear in mind one thing: you have to actually **do** the exercises - reading them alone won't help you. But this process is designed so that the niche you pick will give you three things: satisfaction, have an impact on others and make you money.

The first thing I want to warn you is there's a specific mindset that you've got to approach niche selection with. If you don't have this mindset, you're going to waste weeks, months and even years doing the wrong thing.

But before we get in to that... If you want to watch over my shoulder as I go through this process on my computer then you can watch the [full video for free here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-UUtT_lG-g&t=1s). Perfect for visual/auditory learners.

#Mindset

First of all, you don't want to spend tonnes of tonnes of time ""researching"". In fact, 99% of your ""researching"" is actually just **procrastination**.

This post will give you everything you need to pick your niche; you don't need to read countless articles, **you need to start taking action**. If you dive into a niche and then after a couple months realize that there's a better one out there for you, then **that's fine** - you'll be able to __pivot__ to a new niche and bring all the skills that you learned in your old niche with you.
 
The very first niche I entered was ""Stoicism""... Yup, I talked about ancient philosophy. Unsurprisingly, that wasn't the best niche for me and I've now pivoted into the ""helping people become fulfilled by creating profitable online businesses"" niche. But the thing is, I would never have found this new niche if I hadn't **got started.**

Now, on the other camp is the people that don't do any research and just dive in and start ""following their passion"". Later in this post, I'll cover why you **don't** want to do that, and how ""following your passion"" is actually just 1/3 of the equation.

Now, let's get onto the physical techniques that you can use. You're going to need a pen and paper or at least a place to write down your thoughts as you go along this specific process.

#Step 1: Passion

You're going to want to do something that you enjoy doing. Not become of magic or some wishy-washy reason, but because a) without passion, there's no way you'll stick through the boring/hard parts and b) because it'll make the whole process a lot more satisfying.

So, how do you find all of your passions?

## 1a) Answer these questions.

Answer the following questions to **come up with a list of 10 (or so) areas that you are passionate about**.

- *What experiences have you had that you attach a lot of meaning to?*
- What area do you think you'd be happy spending years building a business, creating content etc?
- *What kind of things did you enjoy doing as a kid?*
- What kinds of things do you like learning about?
- *If you wanted to become the best in the world at something, what would you pick?*
- What types of things do friends, colleagues, or family usually seek your input for?
- *What is a problem that you'd love to fix?*
- If you didn't have to worry about money, what would you be doing?

Hopefully, these questions will get you started on thinking about your passions. Take a couple minutes now to think of any other passions that you missed after running through these questions.

##1b) Past Jobs

1. Write down every single job you've had in your whole life - from the paper round to your current job.
2. Now, next to each job, rate the job from a 1-10.
3. For each job, write your favorite part, and worst part of each job.

This will start you thinking about the **themes** of work that you enjoy

## 1c) Your Problems

Go back in time and try and visit all of the times that you had a serious **problem**, or all the problems you currently have.

The more serious the better.

**Here are some examples**:

- Did you use to have social anxiety? 
- *Do you wish you could find the perfect niche for you?*
- Do you wish you had a steady income?
- *Do you wish you had more time?*
- Do you wish you didn't grow up with argumentative parents?
- *Do you wish you were a little bit healthier?*

**Come up with a list of 10 or so problems** that you've been through or are currently going through.

What you need to understand is that your problems are probably the **same** problems that many other people are facing. A ""problem"" niche is just as powerful as a ""passion"" niche.

After you've come up with a list, draw a star next to any of the problems that fit **any** of these three points:

1. You've now solved this problem.
2. *You'd be interested in helping other people solve this problem.*
3. You are still going through this problem, but you'd be interested in documenting your journey in overcoming it.

Any problem that fits one of these criteria will make it valuable to your **People** (More on this later).

##1d) Find Themes

Now go over the first three action items and look for **similarities** or **""themes""**.

For most people, this is quite a difficult step but stick with it. You'll see them eventually I promise.

Do your best to **come up with 3-5 themes**, even if they are super faint and kind of abstract.

Great, you've now got a list of 3-5 'passions'. This is where most people stop their research. But I promise you, **this will lead to failure**. Passion is just 1/3 of the equation and if you don't consider all 3 Ps, **you will fail**. Period.

*Reminder: Step 1 was* **P** *assion*

#Step 2: People

It doesn't matter if you think that your business idea is the best, it's the people in the **market** that will control your success or failure.

Luckily, thanks to the internet, it's not easier than ever to see if people are interested in the kind of business you are thinking about. 

##2a) Amazon Kindle Bestsellers

If people are spending money on buying books in an area, this tells you two things: 

1. there are people interested in this topic
2. people are interested in paying (some) money to learn more about this topic.

These are both good signs.

Head on over to the * nonfiction Amazon Kindle Bestseller* list. If you are from outside of the US then go to the .com site because this has a more comprehensive list than all of the others.

First, look at the categories of books on the left hand side. Find the ones that most closesly link to the list of themes you came up with in **1D**.

But don't stop here - go deeper into the sub-niches. In fact, go as deep into the tree of niches as you can. When you're just starting out you want to place yourself in the smallest subniche possible. The smaller adn more targeted the niche - the lower barriers to entry.

Instead of talking about ""business and money"", go down into ""investments"" and even further into ""bonds"".

Once you get as deep as you can go into the niches you're interested in, scroll through the bestselling books and see what kind of topics they're on.

*Do you think you'd be able to create similar content or products as the books that people are interested in?*

##2b) Clickbank

Clickbank is an *affiliate marketplace*. If you can find an informational product that's selling well and is close to the niche you are researching then **this is a very good sign** as it shows people are **very** interested in this topic.

So, head on over to Clickbank.

Then scroll through the categories on the left-hand side. Make sure that, again, you don't go into the broad niches - instead, go into the sub niches. Once you have found the niche that most closely resembles your niche, click into it and then ""sort by popularity"".

Take a look at the products and see how well they are doing. Do this for every niche you are considering entering.

If you can imagine selling a similar product, this is a **very good** sign.

##2c) Google Ads

**If advertisers are buying ads in a niche, there's money to be made.**

Go to Google and type in a few searchers that you think the audience of that niche would search. For example, in the ""male weight loss using calisthenics"" niche, they may search ""how to lose stubborn belly fat"".

If, at the top of this Google search, there are adverts then you must view this as a good sign. Often times when I walk a client through this process they say ""oh no, there are competitors"" but this is a flawed way of thinking. Instead view it as: ""oh yes, other people are making money that means I can too!"".

*Reminder: Step 1 was* **P** *assion*

*Reminder: Step 2 was* **P** *eople*

#Step 3: Profit

Great news, we've pretty much already covered this P in the ""people section"". When you enter a new niche, you'll either be creating products, or selling othre people's products. 

By going through Amazon and Clickbank, we've now identified that there are both physical **and** information products that can be sold. But it's even better than that - you can become an affiliate to both Amazon and Clickbank, so you don't even need to create a product to get started!

#RoundUp

By now you have found a good niche for you. We've done what we said we would do! Great!

Now, in most posts like this one there's a call to action: buy my product, or sign up for my newsletter... 

But I don't want that from you. All I want is from you is to head on over to my profile and click that follow button.

That will put my posts into your feed whenever I post.

And over the next few days, I'll be walking you through the fundamentals of starting an online business. Just like this post, but on different topics.

The fundamentals, that every business needs. No ""shiny objects"". No pitches to my course.

If this sounds interesting to you, head on over to my profile and click that follow button.

#Final Word

After you've done that, I have one final P for you: PICK THE NICHE TODAY AND GET STARTED.

You've now done all you have to - the next step is to go into that niche! Start producing content, start building your business, start making money, start impacting people's lives, **just start.**

Even if you pick the wrong niche **that's okay. Most of the skills you learn in a niche can be carried over to all the other niches.**

Hit me up if you need any help - **I live to serve you.**

688,6hlqod,False,,39,"Don't wait for inspiration: quantity generates quality. Putting in the effort every day will give you the quality you want, in the end",Entrepreneur,"*The following bit is not mine, but it’s the best description of the reasoning that you need to put in the effort every day, to become better every day, instead of waiting for “inspiration” to hit. Here it is:*

“The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.

His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”.

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: **the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.**

It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”

30,6nn8w9,False,,490,PSA: PayPal will seize your money even after 9 years of business,Entrepreneur,"I really think this should be a sticky.

I've just had my entire PayPal balance held as a ""minimum reserve"", i.e., indefinitely, as well having a 15% 90-day rolling reserve added to anything new coming in.

This, after NINE uneventful years of using PayPal, under the assumption that their higher-than-normal fees are in compensation for the greater risk they bear with respect to fraud, international transactions, etc.  This is not just an issue for startups and high-risk business!

We've had zero cases of fraud in 9 years, and one accidental chargeback some 5 years ago.

For those who don't know what a reserve is, basically, PayPal takes your money and doesn't release it until 180 days after you close your account.  No interest, no warning, no explanation, good luck paying subcontractors in that time.

I've already removed them from my cart and invoicing system (switching to Stripe for now), but since this potential business risk isn't written in big bold letters on their website, then I really think it should be up here.

It's hard to take the fee comparison charts seriously when this operating risk isn't included in the list of ""features"":

- We offer a somewhat competitive 3.9% on transactions, and
- Maybe all of your money, if we feel like it, without warning, on a day of our choosing.  Yay.

Edit:
This is apparently a post people identify with.   I'm totally serious about making something like this sticky.  In terms of the potential operating risks faced by online startups, I really can't think of anything more universally applicable.  It's an existential threat for those who are just starting, and don't have the benefit of having monitored the forum for several months.

Edit 2: To forestall some further PayPal hatred, I want to make it clear that I marvel at the world that they've created.  They've enabled relationships between vendors across the globe that would otherwise have been impossible.  However, if you were to poll a random sampling of their merchants, I very much doubt that even 1% could identify sudden, unannounced, seizures of previously-released funds as within the realm of PayPal's general operating procedure.  Most of us think that PayPal implements risk mitigation on a per-transaction basis.  So, that's why the PSA, so that it doesn't come as a surprise.  I will continue to use PayPal for paying vendors, but I know some clients who I have to call at exactly 9 am to let them know of the risk and advise them to either pull out their funds or deposit an additional cushion -- once PayPal tells me what that cushion has to be.

728,8wl95v,False,,60,"I replaced the phone number on my website with a ""call back request"" button, and this is what I learned after 3 months",Entrepreneur,"Two months ago I made a post in r/Entrepreneur called ""I replaced my Phone Number with a ""Call Me Back"" button on my Ecommerce Store. This was the result:"" - linked here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/8brjty/i_replaced_my_phone_number_with_a_call_me_back/


over 1000 upvotes later I figured I should write a follow up to that piece. Full disclosure, one of the results of my first experiment with that button was to turn it into a [Shopify App called Raven Callback Request](https://apps.shopify.com/raven) (check the reviews to also see how our merchants are finding value through it) so that any merchant can do what I did with a few clicks of a button. Now we have almost 300 stores using the app and we've learned a tonne more about the button and how to use it better. 

Apart from the 5-10% increase in sales on my own store [Nadeef Bidets](https://getnadeef.com/products/muslim-shower-hand-bidet), this is what I learned:


**The MAJOR Learning**


This sounds obvious to us now, but it wasn't obvious to us when we first started; Online Commerce is all about earning the trust BEFORE the customer makes a purchase. If you think about how the world participated in commerce before the internet, it was either all in person, or the less widely used phone catalogues. The in-person retail store experience inherently earned trust for the merchant. They had a store (meaning they had enough business to pay for rent and were a part of their neighbourhood community), they had inventory (so you know you can walk out with the product you want), and they had people there to serve (to provide customer service, pre-sale service, and answer questions/concerns, and to advise). Purchasing through catalogues over the phone also had a similar signal because in order to be listed in catalogues merchants had to have enough of a legit business to make the investments, send our mailers, etc. And when you called and spoke to someone, you knew there was someone who could help you right away.


Enter the online sales channel; Now even a 12 year old could create a business online, dropshipping, etc, as a school project/joke/experiment, with no intention of fulfilling orders and make a sale. From the customers eyes, this is not the person they want to trust their business with if it isn't a well known brand. In other words, an online presences doesn't automatically earn trust. The first two issues about the physical retail store, and inventory on hand to touch and feel cannot be done online, but the 1-on-1 conversation with the merchant IS possible. We all carry phones with us, and it's even easier to be connected than it used to be. I found that when I had phone leads come in and I called back right away (earning trust in that they know we will be responsive to their needs) I had a surprisingly high conversion rate. We've had some merchants who literally have a 100% conversion rate to their Call Back Request leads. It just started blowing my mind how powerful the phone is as a sales channel, and how much it's being underestimated.  

---

**Benefits outside of the clear value of the 1-on-1 conversation over the phone:**



**Merchants started to experiment with the CTA on the button**, and instead of just writing ""call me back"" they could experiment with ""speak to the craftsman"" or ""book an appointment"" or ""request free consultation"" - this was SUPER cool to discover because it showed the high utility possible with the button when you let creative merchants run with it

**Getting better feedback straight from the customer**, asking how they found out about them, what they like/dislike about the product, and other valuable feedback. The best part is that the increase in sales from the feedback was far better than the direct conversions. For example I noticed so many people calling me had a question about hot/cold water mixers, and also about requesting installation. So I added both of those products and services to my business and sales went up even more (I can't attribute that to the button but I know it's there).

**Having the phone number saved** and on file to do follow-ups if the customer hasn't bought yet

**Better in terms of just creating the pre-filled draft order** over the phone and sending it to the customer to just simple confirm their purchase and credit card information

**Builds a great rapport with the customer**, customers feel more valued when a merchant calls back immediately - Immediate actions goes a long way in earning that trust upfront before asking for the trust from a customer in the form of a purchase

**Telemarketers cold calling is now down to virtually ZERO**

---

**1. High value goods**
The button works really well for stores that sell expensive products. This makes sense because think about it for yourself. If you had to spend several hundred or even a few thousand dollars on an item, how comfortable would you be giving that amount of money to someone you've never heard of, or ever spoken to? Trust us such a key factor because the larger the order value, the bigger the commitment and trust you're asking from your customer without really giving anything in return. Usually in offline business it's the other way around, the business/store clerk/etc earns the trust in the community first, shows the buyer the inventory on the shelves, etc, and then people know they can trust them with their business. But now online, businesses are expecting customers to trust them first before lifting a finger. The Call Back Button fixes this.


Examples of some high order value stores KILLING it with the Raven button (only from the past 2 months):
*24/7 Gold - will sell six-figures worth of golf training equipment very soon through Raven
*Divided.Style - sold five figures worth of pre-fabricated bathrooms
*Wren&Glory - sold five figures worth of custom painted jackets
*Shaggy Copper Skis - Went 3 for 3 selling Skis on the first day installing the app

---

**2. Technical Products**
The button also works for technical products. My own product is technical, and so I knew this would be the case. Things that require installation, assembly or DIY components. Also products that are technology focused like mechanics parts and supplies, tools, etc.


Examples of stores selling technical products:
*Nadeef Bidets - My own store selling hand-held bidets which requires installation
*West Coast Pals - Sells software licenses
*Attachment Kings - Sells parts for construction equipment
*Cloudponics - Sells DIY POTato grow tents 
*MeriMari - Sells furniture
*Harps/Mini Pocket Bikes/

---

**3. Business 2 Business sales**
Turns out many businesses prefer to do sales over the phone. They want to call their vendor and just place the order over the phone. I thought this makes sense because this is how I buy the shipping boxes and material for my Hand Held Bidet store. I call Uline and just place the order over the phone, since they have my info on file it's easy for them to do this as well. Turns out there are lots of businesses selling to businesses through Shopify, and they really like the app as well.


Examples of Business 2 Business stores using Raven successfully:
*Carry Out Supplies - Sells custom printed cups for frozen yogurt shops
*Geyser Water Filters - Sells water filtration systems to businesses
*Data Cart - Sells carts for medical equipment and instruments to hospitals
*Dr Delicacy - Sells hard to find delicacies to local restaurants

---

**4. Customized Products**
Customized products also do well over the phone because customers want to make sure the merchant is 100% clear on their request. 


Examples of custom product manufacturers doing well with Raven:
*House Design Builder - sells custom made house number signs
*Rollin Digital - sells custom designed CD covers
*North County Fire - sells fireplaces
*Allied Cycles - sells custom designed carbon fibre racing bicycles

223,gywrr3,False,Lessons Learned,109,1 year ago today since I quit my sales exec. job in central London and started my own business. Here are a few things I have learnt.,Entrepreneur,"Hey all, massive lurker around these parts thanks for the awesome content you all put out.

It is exactly one year today since I quit my sales job in London and started my own animation production agency with an old university friend. There have been tears, stress, late nights, guesswork, and confusion. 

I can safely say that I have learnt more in the last year than all of my previous working years combined, and I thought I would share some lessons I have learnt with you all. 

**Disclaimer:** We run a service-based business so a lot of what I am going to say won’t be relevant to product-based businesses. 

# Lesson 1: Don’t lower your price.

I can tell you that for every client that has responded to a quote with, ‘Our budget is X can you bring your price down to match it?’ has never proceeded with the project when we agreed. Not one. 

For the quotes that we said, ‘No sorry this is the price for your project’, 80% of the time they became a client anyway. 

What I have come to conclude is that businesses don’t actually want the cheapest provider. Lowering our quotes to match a client budget is a sign of weakness. It’s obvious we need the work. We lose some authority and control of the project. We devalue our work when we agree to lower our price. 

In my experience, standing firm on our pricing has resulted in a higher proposal conversion rate. Consumer psychology is a scary phenomenon.

# Lesson 2: It is okay to cut undesirable clients.

We had to cut a client who was asking for something completely different when the project began in comparison to what we quoted for. This client was rude to us, didn’t respect us and didn’t understand what it entails to create an animation. 

We cut ties with this client 50% of the way through and returned the money. It was liberating. Nobody deserves to be treated poorly or spoken to in a rude manner for no reason. Don’t let the money blind you from being in control of who you work with. Enjoy your work!!

# Lesson 3: Networking is powerful and still criminally underrated.

Due to the pandemic and lockdown, all networking events were cancelled and there is no sign at the moment of this type of social interaction returning. This is bad news. Networking has been so powerful for us to form relationships that blossom when you least expect it. 

This isn’t just powerful for sales. Networking is great for advice, finding mentors, forming partnerships and friendships, all of which contribute to the success of your business. 

Buying somebody a beer at a networking event on a Monday night is incredibly valuable!

# Lesson 4: Deliver more value than the client was expecting.

This doesn’t have to be extravagant. Even the smallest gesture can result in a happy client. Show people that you care.

# Lesson 5: Cliché Alert!!! - Don’t give up. 

I didn’t make a single penny for the first 6 months and then in the space of one week, we had two big contracts drop. Assume everything is going to be 10x harder than you thought it was. Expect luck not to go your way when you first begin. But never give up. Do things every day that you know will benefit your business in the long run. One day the bad luck will stop, someone will take a chance on you and then you are away. Momentum is a powerful force.

Those are just a few of the lessons I have learnt during my first year in business, if they can help just one person then I will be happy. Apologies to anyone who did not find this useful. For now, I will retreat to being a sub-lurker. Stay safe everybody and keep working!!

Jake",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/gywrr3/1_year_ago_today_since_i_quit_my_sales_exec_job/,852,"Networking is a waste of time. Its only for extroverted people who need to run their mouth 24/7 to feel good about themselves and scamers. 

No Normal person goes to a networking event to go buy people beer and form friendships. Like whats the point? The chances of someone worth while being at a conference is slim to none. 

Save your money, as you build your business, you'll meet people who are worth the time and effort. ",2020-06-08 10:21:25

I swear sometimes people are so rude and try to hide their methods. I even had someone tell me that digital marketing is oversaturated and I really wanted to beat my head into a brick wall. Anyone that starts a business has the ability to grow and be successful. It all comes down to the amount of work you are going to put in. Now when I say this I'm not saying put in 14 hours a day and grind an unhealthy amount of work. You'll burn yourself out. Stop listening to the gurus. What you'll be getting here is a real dose of energy and enlightenment.

Let's get to the part that everyone wants to read. How do you find clients? Now, this post is mostly for service-based business and you can use this for almost any type of business.

1. [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/) \- This awesome tool gets me to find the owner's email and I can email them directly. Just check out this screenshot where I looked for the Ex. Nike CEO: [https://gyazo.com/01956f7637ea12b94a6d6bd651ea2b61](https://gyazo.com/01956f7637ea12b94a6d6bd651ea2b61) \- A direct email to him and I now have a shot at getting some business. Remember to not SPAM the business owner. This is a powerful tool. *With great power comes great responsibility.*
2. [seoptimer.com](https://www.seoptimer.com/) \- This tool is also extremely useful and gives you white label ability to send reports under your company name. Please know SEO before you send reports to your potential customers. People will see right through your BS if you think you understand SEO and then ultimately fail within the first month. Actually know how to perform SEO before you use a tool like this.
3. [Mixmax.com](https://mixmax.com/) \- I love this tool and there are a billion out there but I like Mixmax. This tool shows me when people open my emails, download an attachment that I've sent (SEOptimer) and tracks how many times people open my emails. It's super strong with follow-ups, which as you know following up is everything in business. I remember reading somewhere you need to have 13+ interactions with a potential client before they actually sign up with you.
4. [https://d7leadfinder.com/](https://d7leadfinder.com/) \- A bonus tool - Now for you lazy people out there, oh who am I kidding. You smart genius people would use something like this that scrapes all businesses in specific niche's. This is a huge time saver but its kind of expensive and I know some of you are just starting out don't have $40 to spend per month to find leads through this. This gives you everything from the website, social media profiles, addresses, phone numbers, and emails - Power stuff here.

These 4 tools above have helped me time and time again and I still use this method to find work. Now the platforms I use to actually find work.

**Yelp** \- Now Yelp really annoys me with how they do business but still it's a huge platform and people are always paying for ads. Now I've stolen multiple clients from Yelp as yelp ads don't perform for them. People just pay it because its Yelp and they are a known brand and people automatically trust them. What I do first is hit up the people that are running ads because if they are running ads they can more than likely afford your type of service as well. So I go straight to the sponsored results and reach out: Ex. [https://gyazo.com/9e94bb4efd57c3c97c41a5767236122e](https://gyazo.com/9e94bb4efd57c3c97c41a5767236122e)

**Google** \- A google search is everything in 2020. A simple ""landscaping near me"" google search brings up an endless amount of people around your area. Ex. [https://gyazo.com/ce089e482db176f7ef481fa3cd31a2c5](https://gyazo.com/ce089e482db176f7ef481fa3cd31a2c5) \- I always go for the advertising business first and then I work my way down the list on the Google 3-pack area. This is extremely strong and easy to find potential clients.

Sound simple enough right? Wrong. Now here is the catch for all you people out there. This is what's going to separate you from this: [https://gyazo.com/b9c4a44a1521f5b4cc412e66994f9a52](https://gyazo.com/b9c4a44a1521f5b4cc412e66994f9a52) \- Please for the love of my sanity don't do this. You need to simply add value. If you are trying to grow a business or find a client I promise you that if you give out free value you'll get a return on it. Does this business have simple fixes that won't take much time? Reach out and let them know. Remember that people don't need your services. At least they don't think they do. You need to open their eyes and let them know that you are so valuable that they want your services. I've always been a fan of giving value. Stop your spamming crap and focus on the actual client that you want to work with.

Create a video audit for their business. I know this takes a butt load of time but if you did 10 audits a day I bet you anything a customer would reach out to you within the next month. (This applies to any service business on why this company needs your business)

At the end of the day if you put in 6-8 hours a day on your business and look for clients this way you'll be successful. There's no magic pill or secret formula and there's no guru course that's going to teach you how to get clients. The secret to it all is hard work, and being consistent. People get scared when you give them the answers. I bet my life that 99% of you are going to agree with the above statement and only a handful of you are going to execute on it. I hope this post inspires a few and I hope you guys work hard in 2020. No short cuts, no cheap routes. Be that good human being that I know you can be.

684,hjd55n,False,Young Entrepreneur,114,I’m so happy of what I have achieved so far (7000$+ in profits),Entrepreneur,"Hey!

Not long ago, I posted a little bit on each subreddit to get advice on how to start my little web dev business. I got a lot of help and some people telling me it would never work since I was  only 17. Well, it’s working pretty well so far.

At the beginning of June, I got a part time job at a retail store while working on my side business. My goal was to not work a “real job” and to be as independent as possible during the summer. I thought it would never work, but I surprised myself.

One month later, I have enough contracts to say goodbye to my job.

I have a 4000$ contract for à React component with a financial tech company, a 1800$ contract for a website linked to a CRM, a 750$ and a 500$ contract for classic websites for small business in my area. I also have other small contracts of less than 500$. 

I am very happy because just with the 4000$, it will be more than my whole summer with a full time job. Only downside: I must work 200h to get it. If I had known I would have all the other contracts, I would probably not have taken the 4000$. Well, it’s too late.

Most of these contracts happened by contacting the business directly and offering them my services. The only one where I got approached was via a real life contact who wanted me to work with him.

Anyway, I just want to tell to the young entrepreneur: even if it seems impossible, even if people tell you that you won’t be able, even if you believe you won’t be able to do it, keep trying. Before getting these contracts, I got constantly people telling me they weren’t interested at all. Interact with people, ask questions, get yourself out there. Even if it doesn’t work, you will have learnt how to deal with rejection.

On my part, I might try to get more than 10k$ this summer, just because why not. I don’t want to go higher since I would have to pay taxes.

If you have any other questions, let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/hjd55n/im_so_happy_of_what_i_have_achieved_so_far_7000/,495,"You seem like a great guy, I mean who the hell wants to spend their summer at a retail store. Now all you really need is to get someone to do some of that work for you, so you can lay on a hammock. Don't you want the money and not to do any of the work? I do copy writing for a living and i'm very respected, so my reputation is on the line here,  I want to work with you, I don't want to work at a retail store just like you. ",2020-07-01 16:04:36
549,7mo41b,False,,216,"Earning $4,000 a month from Adsense - but is this sustainable?",Entrepreneur,"Hi all,

For the past seven years, I’ve been monetising a successful niche using Google Adsense.

A quick background for budding entrepreneurs...

I used to read a lot about ‘making money online’ in the early 2000s. I followed the “content is king” mantra and founded several websites targeting a specific niche. Through a combination of hard work and luck these websites have grown - basic SEO and high-quality content that people want to read. The only advertising I paid for was to launch a Facebook page.

I currently get around 40,000 - 50,000 unique visitors a month with 85% of these organic from google.

Adsense brings in around $4000-5000 a month plus a bit extra from media.net

I’ve read a lot about diversifying from Adsense - but alternative advertising networks have never managed to beat it. Media.net are ok - but don’t achieve the same results. Our Adsense RPM is around $13 - 15. 

Affiliates never seemed to take off with my audience and having a global reach it was nightmare trying to geolocate everything.

I still work full time (40 hour week) because I’m worried about the temporary nature of this business - I’m at the mercy of Google, all it would take is to drop down a few search results and my revenue would tail away.

Also, the internet is changing and I wonder how long niche Adsense websites can survive.

I'm thinking about future proofing, I've tried to embrace social media and recently set up an e-mail list (1,000 subscribers in 7 days). 

Has anyone else found themselves in this position? 
How did you future proof your business?
Is there a future for Adsense?

286,247rbj,False,,253,hey this is my story of how i made around $30k,Entrepreneur,"So in sixth grade all of my friends had an iPod except for me. I was constantly looking online to find a used one for cheap. I finally bought one for just $100. When i got the iPod I realized now that I need a case. I remembered from when I was searching on eBay and Amazon for iPods I kept seeing bulk purchases of 10 or 12 at a time for iPod cases at around 10 bucks total. I ordered the pack of 10 for $1 a pc. My dad told me to keep a few colors to myself and sell the rest in school for $5 a pc. I sold out of them in about a week.

Everybody kept asking for cases for different devices all through 8th grade. I made about $2k in just 2 and a 1/2 years.

I kept the business through high school which was when I got my first iPhone. Ironically I crack my own phone with one the crappy eBay cases on it. When my mom saw the crack she said she wasn't paying for a replacement or to get it repaired. I went to a phone repair shop near my house and at the time it costed around 80 bucks to fix an iPhone 4s screen. I didn't want to pay that much for it, and I wanted to start repairing iPhones around that time anyway.

I googled and youtubed for hours before I ordered any parts. When I finally built up my confidence to take apart my iPhone (btw I was only 14 at this point) I ordered the parts and took it apart with the videos in front of me. After about an hour of slow and steady work, my iPhone worked just like new!

My classmate cracked his screen a day after his mom payed to get his repaired and came to me in school freaking out saying he needed me to fix his phone before his parents see the crack. I said I'll do it for $65. I stuck with that price for a while up until the summer. 

Instead of going to a travel camp that summer i was looking around for a small shop for rent. I found the perfect size store, in the perfect location for me. My dad told me that since i was saving him so much by not going to camp he would pay the first summers rent. I was catering to a fairly wealthy area at the jersey shore so business wasn't bad at all. I was averaging around 7 repairs a day making about $500-600 a day. I ran the shop by my self so all the money went straight to me.

After the summer i closed the shop and went back to school (15 years old at this point). I was pretty well known for repairs to the point where i would get 1-2 phones a night in my house for repairs. My dad helped out by putting signs up around the neighborhood that said ""PHONE REPAIRS CALL XXX-XXX-XXXX"". That helped bring in a lot more business during the year. This was all being done out of the house by now. 

I am now 16 years old and still going strong with this business. I just resigned the lease for the same shop this summer. And received a call from a guy that wants to buy 500+ of my damaged screens for a total of around $2k. I've been saving every penny so far so I can by myself a car when I turn 17. I'm extremely proud of myself of what I have done and where it has gotten me so far and I hope to keep exceeding with new ideas like this.

621,bra0v5,False,,194,"Is "".com"" still the best domain extension? I ran an experiment with 1,500 people to find out how different TLDs perform.",Entrepreneur,"I ran an experiment with 1,500 people to find out how they would react to eight popular domain extensions (top-level domains): .com, .net, .org, .biz, .us, .co, .blog, and .io.

Would there be large behavioral differences?

Do people still notice domain extensions at all?

You can see all the results, including illustrated charts with the rankings of all eight TLDs in the [**full results post and summary**](https://growthbadger.com/top-level-domains/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=k-share_entrepreneur).

Or if you don't mind missing out on some details, read on.

To find out the answers, I conducted this research using a tricky survey structure with three major parts:

**Part 1: Perceived trustworthiness.** I asked how trustworthy people would expect a site to be based purely on its URL, using the made-up brand “mattressrankings.\_\_” as the domain, with the blank filled in randomly with either .com, .net, .org, or one of the five other domain extensions I mentioned above. (I did *not* specifically draw people’s attention to the domain extensions.)

**Part 2: Palate cleanser.** The second part of the survey consisted of several unrelated questions designed to distract people and find out their demographics.

**Part 3: Memorability.** Now that they’d been distracted for a little while, in the last part of the survey I asked people to write the exact URL they saw at the beginning. (They were not able to go back to the original question to see it again.)

Here are some of the highlights I found:

* .com URLs are over 33% more memorable than URLs with other top-level domains.
* .com is the #1 most trusted TLD.
* When people misremember a URL, they’re 3.8 times more likely to assume it ends in .com than anything else.

In other words: yes, .com is still the best overall. But .co and .org come in quite close on some scores.

535,3orve3,False,,129,"If you think you have to enroll in night classes or get an MBA degree to improve your business knowledge, think again. 3 alternatives I've used to grow my business and land my dream job.",Entrepreneur,"When I began my eBay business back in 2011, I had a big “Oh crap,” moment as I realized my degree was in religion — not business. I had been fortunate to be able to hustle my way through college and graduate without any debt by dropshipping footwear, so committing to a 2nd five-figure degree wasn’t an attractive option.

Don’t get me wrong. My college experience was useful. And for those planning to run a big corporation, an MBA is very attractive on your resume (BTW, choose the right place to attend; the sad reality is the name matters more than your education).

My eBay biz ended when my suppliers cut me off and was without consistent work for 1.5 years. It sucked. But every time I considered going back to college, *no one* could demonstrate to me that these colleges and grad schools could really work.

**Here’s the problem:**

1. Profs plan their content out for the year. The world of entrepreneurship is too fast-paced to learn last year’s stuff.
2. Colleges are investing into buildings, not education. There’s [a great 5 minute Q&A with Mark Cuban and Guy Kawasaki on rethinking college](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgdNTzul27k).

Instead of going the traditional route, I poured myself into internet marketing, and landed my dream job w/a well-known internet marketer.

Here are a few effective ways I used to grow my business and land my dream job:

**Online Courses**

While this sounds counter to what I said above, online courses are great way to learn the fundamentals for free.

I’ve been out of the loop a bit here as I prefer blogs myself, but here’s an article I came across on [20 free online courses worth taking to become a better entrepreneur](https://www.maptive.com/20-free-online-business-courses-worth-taking-2016/).

**Blogs**

The good news: There’s a lot of information out there.

The bad news: There’s a lot of information out there.

For good and bad, we’ve all been given a voice to share.

What I did was started with a few blogs and asked myself, “If I followed this advice, how likely is it that I could repeat their success?”

Here are some business/marketing blogs I tend to frequent:

[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/) - Often seen as the “godfather of internet marketing.” Most influential marketers are influenced by his work. Offers some great pearls of wisdom that helped me learn the fundament principles of business and marketing.

**Business sites**

From Forbes, Entrepreneur, Business Insider, and Inc, their are many great places to choose from. You’ll find Forbes targeted more for larger companies, but there’s good stuff in there too. 

I’ve found Inc and Entrepreneur to be my two favorites (in that order).

In time, you may notice yourself gravitating to certain journalists as they cover certain topics. I started out just reading everything I could, then observing who I started reading.

Some of my favorite journalists:

1. [Larry Kim](http://www.inc.com/author/larry-kim), CTO/Founder of [WordStream](http://WordStream.com). Although I've not done much with PPC, Larry was my first ""virtual"" mentor through his writings on Inc.
2. [Sujan Patel](http://www.inc.com/author/sujan-patel)
3. [Murray Newlands](http://www.inc.com/author/murray-newlands). (Murray was a close 2nd to Larry).
4. [Neil Patel](http://www.inc.com/author/neil-patel)
5. [John Rampton](http://www.inc.com/author/john-rampton)

Believe it or not, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to available online learning. 

Learning from others who have been successful is essential to entrepreneurial success, so don’t let excuses hold you back! Put in the time to work on your skills and your business will flourish.

1. Thanks for the gold stranger!!! Wasn't expecting that at all.
2. As mentioned a few times in comments, this is not a replacement for an MBA or college. /u/floor-pi, /u/nwmba, /u/gaymondboofstad, thanks for making sure this gets clarified.

894,6pu5sc,False,Best Practices,76,10 biggest mistakes made by entrepreneurs when they pitch their company,Entrepreneur,"Hi Reddit!
Received a lot of positive feedback on an article I recently published on [30 pitch mistakes entrepreneurs make](http://www.pitchskills.com/30-pitch-mistakes-avoid-pitch-company/). Since this would become quite the list, I figured it would be nice to share the most important ones here. I Hope it will help you some day!

**1. They talk too long**
In general it’s better to have your pitch a little bit too short, than a little bit too long. After you're done pitching there will be time for questions and answers. This is where you can get into details.
The first goal of your pitch shouldn’t be to explain everything. Your first pitch should be about making the listener excited.


**2. They keep their hands in their pockets**
When you are pitching your company, you want people to think that you care about the subject. Right?
If you keep your hands in your pockets, this comes across as uninterested and makes you look bad.


**3. They never pause during their pitch**
If you want your listener to understand what you say, you should give him time to digest your words.
A well timed pause is one of the most effective methods to improve the quality of a pitch.


**4.  They use industry jargon**
Unless you are pitching to the number one industry expert, you should avoid using industry jargon. You might be familiar with your industry’s terminology, your listener likely isn’t.
Some entrepreneurs think it makes them seem like experts if they use industry jargon. Unfortunately for them that’s not the case. It makes you look silly and it will drive your listener elsewhere.


**5. They want to mention every detail**
It’s a good thing that you planned out everything for your company and that you’re very excited for it. Bravo!
However, that doesn’t mean your listener cares about every single detail of your company. Pitching the basic building blocks of your company is more effective and yields better results than discussing it from a to z.


**6. They didn’t practice before**
Too often you see entrepreneurs struggling to get their words out. Not only does this make you look unprepared, it also gives the impression that you aren’t confident about your company.
To deliver your pitch with flair, you should practice it at least 50 times.


**7. They didn’t research the competition**
A frequently asked question after you pitched is ‘who are your competitors?’. Whenever this questions arises you should have a list of competitors ready in your head. Additionally, you should be able to explain why you are different and how you are better than the competition.


**8. They talk features instead of benefits**
Many entrepreneurs feel like the technological features of their product are important to their listeners. This is a big mistake.
Instead of telling them how it works, you should focus on what it can do for them. An example:
Don’t say: *'The new iphone has a 1300:1 contrast ratio'*
Do say: *'The new iphone has a breath taking HD screen which you can use to watch the newest movies'*


**9. They don’t end with a call to action**
Let’s say you just did an amazing pitch and your listener got truly excited about your company or project. This is the time to ask your listener for a favor. This could be anything, ranging from:
* We are looking for an investment of 250k to invest in marketing.
