706,gb3ygh,False,Help,1,Can user programs directly access physical addresses?,computerscience,"I have a doubt regarding address binding in OS. I saw a statement that read ""User programs can never directly access physical addresses"". It can access physical addresses using logical addresses using MMU. 
I also saw that in compile-time and load-time binding, the logical address and physical address is the same. So, won't the user program be able to access or see the real physical address. When taking this case, isn't the above statement false?

Another doubt I have is :
The compiled code has the absolute address of physical memory in it. Doesn't that create a problem? I mean, the logical addresses itself is created to protect the data on the physical memory. If the compiled code has the absolute physical address, then the true meaning for using logical addresses is lost, right?

The programs themselves never see or even know any address translation is occurring. 

However, for some hardware - like certain microprocessors commonly used as Arduino targets without any significant OS that performs such memory address translations - the addresses a program references are exactly the same as the physical address. This is also true for certain data processing systems that must be certified for critical processing (think flight computers onboard a commercial airplane) so the chances of failure are as small as possible.

That means if you only have 1 core it takes 1600 minutes, if you have 100 it's 16 minutes.

>I processed 100 samples using 1 core -> 1600 minutes from above this means that processing 1 sample n 1 core takes 16 minutes

Formally:

    samples
    ------- = time
     cores

If you have more cores and same samples, it takes less time.

If you have more samples and same cores it takes more time.

If you want to speed up you either need to increase the core cunt or decrease the samples.

>How many cores/year does it equal to? This question does not make much sense

I am not sure how to understand this question. Do you mean: how many cores do you need if you want to process 100 samples in exactly one year?

>If i want to do 40000 samples in the same amount of time( just for the sake of the example) do I just multiply the cores week computed in (1) by 400 to get the required cores/year?

I assume the same amount of time refers to the 160 minutes you mentioned before in this case  cores / year does not make any sense at all.

No offence (I'm sure I'll get downvoted anyway) but if this type of question is troublesome for you then Computer Science might not be the right science for you.

When picking out a profession it is important to have an interest for the topic itself, regardless of whether you are managing people or not. If IT is something you're interested in, start learning and building stuff now. You don't need a company to do IT. 

IT Manager is not a professional field in itself, it is a job that more experienced IT professionals who happen to have a desire to coordinate other professionals tend to take on.

In IT you typically have two directions to go after being in an entry level role for a few years. You can double-down on technical expertise and become a 'tech lead'/'subject matter expert'/'senior engineer' or go down the management route.

If the people-skills aspect of being a manager is what appeals to you, consider exploring professions that allow you to lean into that passion, like HR, training, or social work.

If you you are interested in getting started with IT, a computer will be important. Contrary to what other people might say, at your age I do not think you should focus on a checklist of things you should learn. Learning that way will get boring and tire you out. What you need to do is get excited. Think about something you want to build: a website, a game, a blog. Start googling (e.g. how to make a simple website). Soon enough you will branch out organically into the different parts of IT. At this stage in your education, having fun and getting obsessed with trying to make an idea come to life is more powerful that any textbook. If you bump into a problem that needs math to solve, you can learn the math then (ask your math teacher to help you!). Learning math with the hope that it will somewhere down the line help with IT (but not know exactly how it will help) is a very demotivating way to learn. ",2020-04-28 18:53:32

What if the number is an odd number? For example, the binary representation of 9 is: 1011. When we shift the bits to the right once, we get 0101 which is 5 rather than 9/2 = 4.5.

When right shifting it you will get 011 (3 in base 10).
Right shifting 6 (110) will give you the same. 

That's because the least significant bit (the first one on the right) is 1 when the number is odd, 0 when even. Right shifting removes this number so an odd number N and the even number N-1 will give the same result when right shifting. ",2020-01-21 13:54:15

Quantum computing is an extremely interesting and popular topic. Even though it is still in its infancy, it promises to change the computing landscape and even usher another stage to our civilizational development. This is all due to an exponential increase in computing power that it will inevitably bring. It will make all of the tasks that previously took months and years to complete easily solvable within days, hours and even minutes. The wide spectrum of its potential applications ranges from medicine to finance. It will solve tasks that were previously unachievable and revolutionize every sphere where it is applied. The potential changes that it will bring being groundbreaking, to say the least. Recent achievements in quantum computing and their practical applications will be described in the paragraphs below.

First of all, it is important to understand the fundamentals of quantum computing in order to see how it differentiates from classical computing and how is it capable of exceeding it. Its basis lies in a completely new approach to computing and to matter itself. It draws on the principals of quantum physics and operates on a completely new worldview of the universe. The quantum bits, unlike classical bits that are either 1 or 0, combine both in themselves. Allowing them to simultaneously exist in multiple states at once. This allows for multiple computations to happen simultaneously and is generally known as superposition. The best example to illustrate it would be the widely-known Schrodinger’s cat, which is in two states at once.

To be sure that your RSA can't be cracked in the next years (not forever) by supercomputers you should use at least 1024 bits per prime, but if you can, 2048 better.

If you want to design purposely a system than can be cracked nor in seconds but also not in hours, it is very hard to determine. Because of the nature of RSA cracking 1 more bit doubles the average time, meaning that de difference between 20 bits and 30 bits is 1000 times longer.
For example, if 10 bits takes a minute, 20 bits will take 16 hours so fine-tuning so that it takes the amount of time you want even if it is not that specific, it is still hard.

The time will depend a lot on how fast is you cpu, what environment you are using and if you are using multiple threads.
My guess is that you won't be able to do more than 20 bit RSA cracking with a normal computer in less than 30 minutes, but again it highly depends.

You should just try it out, but don't set the bits on the upper bound and star lowering them, rather set the number of bits to 10 and increase them until you are satisfied with the time that it takes. ",2020-05-06 17:41:03

But while you're on Linux, you can freely poke in them as Windows isn't there to enforce its rules. Allowing you to mess with the contents of the NTFS drive like that would allow you to ruin a consistency and continuity everything is relying on, easily leading to blue screens of death when a driver or service finds something unexpected. Since it is basic software engineering policy not to trust the user, they simply don't allow you to fuck up.

795,hkxsfz,False,Advice,13,Study techniques for Computer Science/Software Engineering,computerscience," Hi guys,

I need help when it comes to studying Computer Science. I am a Software Engineering student but I am thinking of transferring to CS.

I do well in my internal assessments such as in assignments and practicals. I can understand the content too but when it comes to exams, I do really badly. It's easy to score well in internal assessments because I am tested on the content I learned a week a go and hence I have the content fresh in my memory.

The issue is when it comes to exams. Studying for exams become overwhelming because I need to go back and revise content from week 1 simply because I have forgotten the content. It seems I don't have a study routine I can stick to and I don't know what studying techniques I should use to study CS/SE.

I watched a video from the channel called ""Ali Abdaal"" which was about how his friend writes up a document filled with questions and his friend tries to answer the questions he came up with to test his understanding. His friend was studying medicine. And I thought this was a brilliant idea but I am not too sure if this is a good technique for CS/SE because CS/SE is not all about knowing answers and memorizing. CS/SE students have to apply.

I am not interested in anything like doing the pomodoro technique because I find the content I learn interesting and hence have motivation to learn. I am willing to study. I feel like what I need is a way to study and a way to keep all the content I learn in my head or anything that is helping you guys to score well in your studies.

I would love to hear some advice from CS/SE students who are doing very well with their studies and what you guys do to get those awesome grades. I have been getting crappy marks because of exams and I hate it so much.

Thanks guys for your time. Appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hkxsfz/study_techniques_for_computer_sciencesoftware/,2,"Computer science is like math or physics - you study theory but you also need to solve as many problems as possible (in compsci this involves writing code at some point, if necessary, but you can also just write solutions in pseudo-code to show that you understand how to do it).

Anki can help you a lot to study the theory. For example, you are taking a class in Operating systems - there is some theory involved, use flash cards or Anki to retain that information. The class will also have a practical component (hopefully), where you can solve problems and write code.

If you are a geek, you can set up Emacs to write the Anki cards in it and then ""upload"" them bulk to your running Anki instance. You can use ""snippets"" in Emacs to make writing the cards easier and almost automated. The advantage of this and associated org-mode is that you can mix latex, figures etc. into the cards.

If you are not used to solving problems and have never taken courses where you had to do so (and got tested doing so), you need to up your game and start doing it. Some sciences (like biology or geography) or humanities (like history, languages etc.) do not involve this approach and instead, rely on memorizing things and being tested on that or writing essays. If that's ALL you are used to, you may have issues going forward in your schooling. Cheers, hope this helps. ",2020-07-04 05:02:26

917,glt8s2,False,Advice,2,What should I have learned by this point in my CS career?,computerscience,"I just finished my second year of my bachelor's in computer science. So far, I've only taken 5 CS related classes (the other ones being math requirements and general Ed's). So far I've taken Intro to CS, where they taught me about the parts of a computer, the history of computers, and an intro to logic circuits, Boolean algebra, binary operations and pseudocode. Then I took Principles of CS I, which was basically a C++ course and the last thing we learned was classes and inheritance. Next, I took Principles II, which was the same as Principles I, except that it was C# this time, and we got into object oriented programming. I also took Object Oriented using Java, which was the same as the previous two but using Java. Finally, I took discrete math, and towards the end of that class, we were studying trees, and in one particular example our professor mentioned something about search algorithms, and that we should've been familiarized with those since the majority of us were taking Principles II at the same time as discrete math. The thing is that we never studied such thing in Principles II, so I don't know if my math teacher was wrong, or if our other professor didn't teach us what he should've been teaching us. He was somewhat of a substitute teacher for the last two semesters since the original CS professor retired, and they didn't have enough time to find a replacement. Is this all that I should know at this point? Or am I falling behind because of my professor?

TLDR: Basically I've only learned some C++, C# and Java programming and discrete math at the end of my second year studying CS.

12,h9w9wa,False,General,8,Productive Summer Plan,computerscience,"Hey guys,

My name is Danyal Imran and I am a computer scientist who's currently pursuing MBA. I have 3+ years of professional experience, and during my professional tenure, a lot of the people I knew were excited on how I approach and solve problems. I've received many awards for my performance, and was a also between an HR battle when I decided to switch my job (because React over Angular any day).

This pandemic has given me an amazing opportunity, and finally I have decided to start my own YouTube channel (Trust me, I am all for quality content that's going to help y'all in the long run). I am quiet dedicated because I love this field, so I expect you to see the following courses in the next 2 months:

**101 - Programming Fundamental**: This course will focus on problem solving and logic building using C programming language (Yes, C language, because it teaches you how to think, and this is the main problem that I see people facing. Many people don't realize that programming is actually solving problems rather than learning the latest hit programming language.. Trust me, programming languages are very similar and its not hard to learn them)

**102 - Object Oriented Programming**: This course will focus on the OOP paradigm on how to properly structure and code your problems. Here the complexity of the problem is going to be quiet big, and you can code actual real life problem but without a GUI (Maybe an intro to Swing for GUI if Java? idk that yet). The course will either use C++, C#, or Java (haven't decided that yet)

**103 - Data Structures**: So far you know how to think about a problem and solve it. Now you're going to think about how to handle data i.e. storage, read, write, sort, etc. You'll amazed to learn what a data structure can do to make a program fun faster. I will also dive into a language's built in data structure so that you know what a language provides and how you'll be saving your time.

**104 - Design & Analysis of Algorithms**: Finally, we reach at a course that talks about writing efficient code, yes efficient i.e. the best possible solution for a problem. If you are good with Algorithms, you can easily ace top 100 tech company coding interviews because this differentiates a good coder from a great coder.

These courses will include (and are not limited to): Theoretic & Practical Lectures, Assignments (Solved & Unsolved), Projects, Links to Coding Websites, Links to Exciting Articles, and many more

These courses are generally for people starting out their journey in Computer Science, or people who have problems in solving tasks (telling computers what and how to do it). Once you complete these 4 courses, you can then plan your career in any field (Mobile, Gaming, Web, etc.), because this is what it takes to be a programmer.

The first course should be out 2 weeks from now.

If I am done with the aforementioned courses, the following courses are in my future plans:

105 - Databases (SQL & NoSQL)

201 - Web Development (Front-end: React, Back-end: Node)

301 - Artificial Intelligence

302 - Data Science

401 - Cloud Computing",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/h9w9wa/productive_summer_plan/,12,That's a lot of planning!

When considering internal vs external drives, does this remain the same?

I’m in the financial industry, we encrypt laptop drives and auto-comb networked storage drives for PII and move it to an encrypted file server. We also deal with encryption at the file level depending on what it is, on those same encrypted drives. Just slows down IO is all. Absolutely fine to encrypt an external, in fact you can buy purpose built encrypted externals and USB.

Edit: pasted the course components on here

 

**Component 01 – Computer Systems**  
This component will introduce students to the internal workings of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the exchange of data and will also look at software development, data types and legal and ethical issues. It will also offer the opportunity for students to analyse and design algorithms, and to study different types of software together with the methodologies that are used to develop them. This component involves advanced mathematics, including the representation and normalisation of floating-point numbers, the simplification of Boolean expressions, the use of two’s complement to represent numbers in binary, and using rules to derive or simplify Boolean expressions.

**Component 02 – Algorithms and Programming**  
This component will incorporate and build on the knowledge and understanding gained in component 01. In addition, you will study:

* What is meant by computational thinking
* The benefits of applying computational thinking to solving a wide variety of problems
* The principles of solving problems by computational methods
* Using algorithms to describe problems
* Analysing a problem by identifying its component parts

This component focuses heavily on the reading and writing of complex algorithms including Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm and the A\* algorithm. Again, Mathematics is a feature of this unit, including the use of Big-O notation to assess the complexity, in terms of time and space, of an algorithm.

**Component 03 – Programming Project**  
Students will be expected to analyse, design, develop, test, evaluate and document a program written in C# using the Unity development environment. The underlying approach to the project is to apply the principles of computational thinking to a practical coding problem. Students are expected to apply appropriate principles from an agile development approach to the project development. This project is independent, meaning students will need to debug their program and spend time focused on the development of a complex piece of software.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ggigti/trying_to_get_a_head_start_on_my_alevel_course/,1,"Definitely just dive in.

I consulted with my sister—who's a software engineering major—and she suggested that ""positive"" might not be the best choice, but I definitely want to convey the idea that this message means ""yes"" or ""go"" or something. We came up with ""single affirmative binary value,"" but thought it sounded a little pretentious.

But I can already tell you that distributed is mainly used by the majority of big compagnie (Oracle, Google ect) because it is definitely more efficient and it scales a lot better with huge data.

There are multiple reasons distributed is the viable solution:
- you can distribute the data around strategic location, so if the main server is in USA but one of the yt video is viral in France, it would be a lot better to keep it on a European server.
- having everything on one server forces is not viable when you have million of user, the network on the server side will quickly become a bottleneck. Having multiples server allows to split the connections on different location and not surcharge a the server bandwidth.
- if the task is heavy and can be parallelized you can multiply the processing speed by the number of servers you have (kind of). This can work for huge database, example if you search for all people named ""Bob"". Server 1 could search for Bob on the first half of the data and server 2 on the second half.

This is over simplified and in practice distributed servers is way more complicated and behave way differently for every application, but I hope I was clear enough and that I didn't say anything wrong. ",2020-06-06 09:03:13

916,g37c3c,False,Advice,7,Having Doubts About My Computer Science Degree,computerscience,"Since high school my(19, Second Year) plan was to go to school to double major in Computer Science (CS) and Musical Theatre(MT). Two different fields I know but hear me out.

I first started with just to major in CS since I was intrested in computers; built my first pc at age 13 but wasn't that familiar with software. My family always said things along the line of ""Hey you'll make good money."" or ""You'll get a good job if you stick with it."" Then thorugh a series of events I joined the theatre department in HS and I fell in love with it. Ended up doing my first musical outside the school and from there I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.

I wanted to major in MT in college, parents said that I could so long I got a degree in CS also to back it up or to fall back on. I agreed, devised a plan that I would get my degree, work as a Web Developer scheduling my own time and going out for auditions for productions after graduation. That or going to graduate school for theatre while working web development.

Fast forward to college, my first two semesters were spent i gen-eds, getting pre-reqs done for CS and taking Theatre and Dance courses, (eventually picked up a Dance minor as i grew to love it also).

My abilities in MT grew expenetially while I waited on CS courses, fast forward to last semester and I took my first CS course Introduction to Python and did decently in it; struggled but I understood it. It helped that I had a really good professor to boot.

This semester however, I am taking Introduction to Object Oriented Design with a professor who, while nice, isn't a great teacher at all (Sitting at a 1 on Rate My Profesor). Took her session of the class as I had a mandatory class with MT in a time period with arguably a better proffessor. She instructed us in BlueJ instead of Eclipse as she found it to be easier, but its not the greatest enviornment. In class lectures are slow and would drag on, content itself was difficult to understand, and the assignments feel exsessive.

I could get by before with the information provided in class. Now since COVID-19 and classes being online, the class has become way worse. We'll meet as a class for roughly half-hour and the professor won't go over the subject matter for the week. Instead she goes over assignments that are due for the week and if you have a question she can answer it. Leaving to read the text book for going over the subject matter. I feel like I'm teaching myself here and barely understanding it. I want to ask a question but I feel as if i don't know enough to even know what I'm asking. I'll go through the whole chapter, taking notes on everything covered and still not understand it. When I get stuck on our weekly labs, I end up getting frustrated and going to stack overflow to find the exact same assignments and how they solved it.

I feel liek a fraud. I've lost motivation for the class and the major itself, I want to drop it or maybe change to a minor. I feel if I'm struggling in something that should be basic, then how can I be successful at all down the line? The major has also been taking time away from my Musical Theatre Studies and vice versa. I feel like I'm half-assing both at this point and filled with constant doubt in both areas. My work ethic and enthusium my freshman year was so much higher compared to now. The past week I've even had night terrors about this. Running around my campus in an endless loop because I left my backpack somewhere. Last night, I had one where I decided to go back to HS in order to relearn basic stuff becuase I didn't feel good enough.

I still want to stick to my plan but is it at all realistic? Should I choose what I love doing and soley focus and knowing I'll make it work? Or should I stick with CS the notion that I'll be financially secure even if I'll struggle to find a job that'll take someone like me.

edit: Well, looks like I have alot of thinking to do, thank you all!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/g37c3c/having_doubts_about_my_computer_science_degree/,7,"I went to acting school, got a BFA in drama. Now I'm getting my masters in CS.

Personally, I love CS because it makes sense to me. I got out of theatre because it doesn't make sense. Not talking about the classroom - there was always catharsis and profound meaning there. But out in the world that's a lot harder to find.

I have tons of friends who couldn't live without their theatre lives, and that's great. But there is a myth that in order to be a ""successful artist"" you have to kill yourself for your art - that's the only thing you can do. In fact, whether or not you like it, you will *have* to do something else to make a living. There just isn't money in art. ...You know, until you're famous. Spoiler alert: you won't be. You have to be ok with that.

So my suggestion: if you love your art, don't give it up. If you enjoy CS, let that be your survival job. If you hate CS, find something else to survive on.

Either love your work or allow your work to enable what you love. Both are valid paths in life. Just be realistic about the world waiting for you with an art degree.

(Sorry I can't help with your struggles in CS classes. But being in art school and surrounded by this do or die ethos was so toxic. Don't get sucked into the myths.) ",2020-04-17 18:14:14

I am looking to implement a multiple producer single consumer (MPSC) circular buffer in c++. I was wandering if I can implement a more generic case of Multiple Producer Multiple Consumer (MPMC) circular buffer that could also be used for specific case of MPSC. Will using a MPMC circular buffer create a large overhead for MPSC case, that can be avoided if I was to instead implement a MPSC circular buffer?

If anyone has any experience with this or knows of some resources that I can use, I would be grateful if you could share some insight. 

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hfx307/multiple_producer_single_consumer_circular_buffer/,2,"This appears to be a synchronization problem. You need to ensure that only one producer writes to the buffer at the same time. Therefore you need to ensure that the function that adds value to the buffer and moves current pointer to the next is atomic (meaning it always either finishes or doesn't start at all and is not interrupted).

My suggestion is to generate references and save them into buffer because copying value might create too much latency and causes a massive backlog.

So that's all about creating a buffer. Now to a single consumer. You're rightfully wondering whether singe consumer is going to be enough to keep the buffer from overflowing and I think we either do not have enough information or it is only possible to learn that by actually trying.

212,gz81p3,False,Discussion,7,Tracking Politician’s Records on Propositions of and Votes for Bills,computerscience,"(Posting for a friend)

Hello all,

 

We are a group of computer science students that can’t protest for different reasons (for instance, I live with someone who is immunocompromised and so can’t risk contracting coronavirus).

 

We have been donating to some organizations, signing petitions, and educating ourselves about systemic racism in the US. However, we want to use our expertise to do more.

 

Here, we present an idea and ask Reddit to help us determine if it’s useful and its potential flaws. We emphasize that we just want to help, so if you know of something we could do that could help more, please let us know.

 

 

**The Idea**

 

We want to find bills and acts that support ending police brutality (and perhaps divide these bills into different categories, such as the 10 categories defined [here](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/solutions#solutionsoverview) ) and display the voting records of house representatives and senators on those bills.

We could make this data open-source and provide visualizations for the data, allowing other websites to use it as they see fit.

 

Hopefully, this could better inform voters about what real action politicians have taken in support of the BLM movement.

 

We could do this in the following steps:

1.         Aggregate voting data for house representatives and senators in a JSON file and post publicly on Github

2.         Have humans look over bills and try to determine if they support one of the 10 causes given in the link above. (This would be subjective, so we would need to be careful; we know some legal experts willing to lend help, though). Create a list of bills and acts for each cause.

3.         Using the JSON data and the lists of bills and acts, create some visualizations or tables that make it easy to see which politicans voted for which bills and to what degree they support ending police brutality.

**Potential Issues**

 

Any data we obtain from Step 2 would have to be treated with extreme caution given: A) the subjectivity of determining whether or not a bill supports a cause and B) that voting for a bill which supports one issue does not imply that the voter cares about that issue (they may have voted for the bill because of another issue, and may feel indifferent about or oppose the issue in question)

In my experience, the way that they taught the classes and concepts were all in different coding languages- every semester we learned a new language, from C to C++ to OCaml to Java and so on. I feel like I was just trying to cram and keep up with classes, which caused me to lack the depth in each language since I was just trying to pass the classes (stacking like 4 CS classes each semester) so I could graduate on time. The lack of depth hits hard when I'm faced with simple tasks like creating a simple program to do \_\_\_ or coding challenges that are open ended.

All the projects that I've done is through my classes- no internship, no side projects- and the projects that I've done have mostly been really small ones with a lot of help and backbone code provided to the students. The projects also lacked application to the real world and were simply stuff that taught us like algorithms and operating system concepts.

DO: Format your code. Make it readable so you can understand it when looking back at it. Some IDE’s can do this for you, but some can’t. 

DO: Use functions. A way to write code once and use it multiple times, every time your program calls that function.

DO: Use a programming language based on its intended paradigm.

DO NOT: Please don’t make your code messy. I regret every piece of messy code I’ve ever made for this simple reason: I can’t look back at it and retrace my steps. I can’t look at it and know what it even does. And that just defeats the purpose, doesn’t it? If the only way to find out what it does is to run it, you’re doing something wrong. 

DO NOT: Name your functions “function1”, “function2” and “function3”. Eventually you’ll have to look for the function that does X, and check every single function for if it does X. It’s a terrible process. Name your functions by what they do. “makeNewPizza”, “convertPizzaToHamburger” and “eatTheHamburger”.

I'm really just doing this as a personal project to improve my skills, and really just because I want to see if I can do it.

I would love to hear different opinions about what you think should or should not be incorporated in different programming languages. If someone leaves a comment saying that 'X' is awful, and no language should ever use it, but you think that 'X' is lovely and is quite useful, please, reply to their comment *respectfully* and give your opinion on the subject.

Here are a few things I think I would like to see incorporated in more languages (and maybe I will try to incorporate them in my own language):

* Unary '+' operator. Similar to the unary '-' operator, which just negates a number (like -2). But this operator would efficiently return the absolute value of negative numbers (but no regard to the efficiency of returning the absolute value of already positive numbers). 
* Range of numbers (such as 0..9 would be integers from 0 to 9). One possible application of this could be in switch statements (like case 0..9: for instance). See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-range-switch-case-cc/).
* Identity operator. Essentially the '===' in JavaScript, which compares the value as well as the type. See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Equality_operators).
* Varargs. Functions with a variable amount of arguments. Such as in Java. See [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-arguments-varargs-in-java/).

Each player must outwit their opponent and make a path with their coloured tiles, either yellow or blue, to connect the two opposite sides of the 18-squared tile board. The first to create a pathway that reaches the other side is the winner! each player starts with 30 small tiles that are three squares long, one medium tile that is four squares long and one long tile that is five squares in length. To begin the blue player places one tile of their choice anywhere on the board. The yellow player then places a tile anywhere on the board and this continues until one player creates a pathway connecting their opposite sides of the board and is crowned the winner! players can start as many new paths as they want to, a new tile does not have to touch earlier tiles that have been placed.

Initially, I was thinking if there's a shared key, it can always be intercepted. So for this reason, instead I tried using RSA, where two clients share their public keys with each other upon connection. When messages are sent, public keys are used to encrypt the message. Messages are then decrypted using he private key.

Now my concern is, can this really be classified as end to end encryption? If not, what would be a better approach. Now that I have the above done, I'm thinking if there's a shared key involved, we can share it using the RSA methodology above (?).",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gn4t4r/what_encryption_would_be_good_in_order_to/,7,"Theres no way of assuring true end-to-end encryption, that involves masking your IP and using browsers that dont record anything and other endpoint stuff that your average user wont be using. There are so many data handoffs at this point that most of the encryption is done by default over the networks

If you’re talking about encrypting the data you’re transferring within your code, then you should look to the standard libraries encryption tools. You needed to be more specific about what technologies you are working with, and especially which part of the handoff you are trying to encrypt. If its something along the lines of a python/java web app, then you should be looking into the native encryption libraries.

That being said, Im not really sure what your post is getting at since you’re throwing around a lot of buzzwords. Most likely you’ll just do an initial handshake followed up by secured handoffs.

&#x200B;

Currently, data governance teams attempt to apply manual control at various points to control the consistency and quality of the data. The introduction of Data Version Control (DVC) version tracking would allow data governance and engineering teams to engineer the data together, filing bugs against data versions, applying quality control checks to the data compilers, etc.

Platforms like [Palantir Foundry](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) already treat the management of data in much the same way as versioning of code. Within data versioning platforms datasets can be versioned, branched, acted upon by versioned code to create new data sets. This enables data driven testing, where the data itself is tested in much the same way as that the code that modifies it.

The only difference here is that FIRRTL IR represents synchronous, digital circuits and LLVM IR represents programs.

Very, very high level view: when you start with C, the clang front end is converting this to LLVM IR. The LLVM IR is then transformed, optimized, and lowered in the middle end. Finally, a back end converts the LLVM IR to machine code. This canonical 3-stage compiler is super nice because it lets you abstract away shared infrastructure (if you build a new CPU instruction set architecture, e.g., RISC-V, you only need a new backend; if you develop a new programming language you only need a new front end) and it lets users hack on the compilation process by writing new transforms that get injected into the middle end.

With this in mind, Chisel is the front-end, the FIRRTL compiler is the middle end, and the FIRRTL compiler's Verilog emitter is the back end. ",2020-05-23 19:52:59

Learn about what causes a web browser to reflow and repaint, and try not to do it. Also, try to have as few CSS rules as possible and don't make rules with long hierarchies. Re-usable?

Efficient HTML? Lazy loading images could help with page load time, but that's more of a javascript thing. Slow HTML will likely come from interactions between CSS + HTML or JS + HTML.

I have a confused mess of **imprecise** computer knowledge. So I have to burden you to interpret what I will say below.

**What I know, or I think I understand:**

* If you call for OS's service to read a file from disk or print a text on the screen then your program will be OS dependent. Programming languages really make those tasks deceptively simple.
* If you are writing in a compiled programming languages (like C, C++) you have limited the compiled exe to the compiler's OS already.

**What I am not entirely sure, and what I am asking:**

when I use a compiled language, the compiler will turn my code into binary assemblies. Those binary assemblies should be just CPU instructions. As long as my code doesn't use any API or ABI that invoke OS routines, my binary file should just run on all x86 CPUs? I imagine binary assemblies are just whole bunch of ""load register A from memory location B, and add to register C"", they are not OS specific.

Unless there is some mandatory boiler plate code specific to OS, added by the compiler, that requests CPU's core/threads and memory allocation from the OS.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gjth61/question_can_i_write_an_exe_program_to_run_on_all/,1,"Yes and no. No, in that a lack of 'import os' does not mean that you aren't using the os. Even starting a process (like the one your code runs in) is an operating system function. Storage is managed by the operating system. Memory management in modern systems is done by the operating system.

Even the compiled formats themselves differ - ELF on Linux, PE/COFF on Windows, Mach-O on MacOS, and a host of other formats that are either historical or simply used by uncommon platforms.

The typical approach to all this is to build for each platform the scaffolding required to run programs. This means you'll generate a Windows build, a Linux build, a MacOS build, and builds for any other platforms you want to target.

For interpreted (or interpretable) languages like Python, that will also mean that you can create operating system-specific builds of the interpreter. 'apt install python3' will install a different binary from 'brew install python', or from 'choco install python'. This does, however, mean that the different python runtimes can execute the same python scripts.

Another approach would be to throw out the operating system altogether. There are two approaches to this - the first is to bundle your application with a stripped-down operating system. There are a number of projects out there to help you build these, but you do need to put in more thought than just choosing a target platform. You can read up on Unikernels to follow this path deeper. Note that supporting actual hardware with this approach can be painful.

The second approach is even more minimal - to write your application to directly drive the hardware. That is, your application doesn't just add AX to BX (though it does to that at some point), you are actually controlling physical hardware states directly from your own code. If your goal is to run everywhere, though, you're likely to die of old age before you finish handling all of the hardware your program will see, so I can't really recommend this approach.

So yes in that it is theoretically possible to target the x86 hardware directly, no in that it is generally not a feasible option. ",2020-05-14 19:43:27

The switch mechanism uses very little power and enables the fast transfer of information between a wearable device and another kind of technology capable of receiving the data. The researchers say they were challenged by the fact that the chip in the wearable device needs to differentiate between the real Wi-Fi signal and the reflection from the background.

I'm a CS student and I've read recently Mark Weiser's paper. He talks mainly about ubiquitous computing. I loved the paper btw.

I want to discuss some concepts that he talks about. I know that it's a paper from 1997 but still, it's a good one. 

Please, read the paper here:

[https://www.ics.uci.edu/\~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~corps/phaseii/Weiser-Computer21stCentury-SciAm.pdf)

It's really worth, and it's just 8 pages long. 

Now you've read it. Let's talk :)

So, IoT is the ubiquitous computing that he was talking about, right? At first, I thought of cellphones, but those still have 'a demanding focus of attention', the screen. But IoT, those are devices that we do not *see,* I see a coffee machine not a computer, I see a better fridge, a better clock, a better oven. Not computers. Those *disappeared*.

He talked about pads or tabs. We can say that these are today's smartphones and tablets, right? And the boards, we may think of them as today's smart TVs, but a big screen is just not that popular. But today smartphones, smart TVs and tablets are still not a form of ubiquitous computing so... quite similar but not exactly what he thought.

I think that the network that Mark describes here is already invented:

>Present technologies would require a mobile device to have three different network connections: tiny range wireless, long range wireless, and very high speed wired. A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented.

4G. 5G. If I misunderstood let me know. 

Here's the final paragraph of the paper: 

>There is more information available at our fingertips during a walk in the woods than in any computer system, yet people find a walk among trees relaxing and computers frustrating. Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.

I think that this is yet to happen. And that will always be like that because technologies evolve so fast that the majority of society just can't catch up. 

Maybe ubiquitous computing is not even possible. It's just a utopic concept. And trying to get to that utopic place where computers vanished into the background will make great things happen, even if we never get there. 

Or maybe ubiquitous computing isn't good at all. What do you think?

I'm amazed by how he talks about things that we see today, before those things ever existed! 

Any insight from the paper, please comment :)

I find C# on the other hand easier to migrate on code level because of it being a compiled language. Not much is going to change on the syntax. However if there are deprecated codes, it is easy to find because the compiler will find them for you and it saves a lot of time. ",2019-11-14 19:12:08

Retaining information requires constant exposure to that information. There’s a reason you don’t remember the things you learned in high school, just like your parents, and that’s because you aren’t using the information frequently enough. You have to tell your brain that this piece of info is important, and you want it to stick. That usually comes most naturally with routine exposure. 

For CS, routine exposure is easy. Just code something—anything!

You’re right though; it is a lot of information to take in, especially when moving at a fast pace. This is where you learn to prioritize the key concepts: you can always google how to declare an array in java in an instant, but it’s a lot harder to reteach yourself what an array is.

The success of a film is usually measured through its box-office revenue or through the opinion of professional critics; such measures, however, may be influenced by external factors, such as advertisement or trends, and are not able to capture the impact of a film over time. Thanks to the recent availability of data on references among movies, some researchers have started to use citations patterns as an alternative method for ranking movies. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method for films based on the network of references among movies, calculated by combining four well known centrality indexes: in-degree, closeness, harmonic and PageRank. Our objective is to measure the success of a movie by accounting how much it has influenced other movies produced after its release, from both the artistic and the economic point of view. We apply our method on a subset of the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) citation network consisting of around 47,000 international movies, and we derive a list of films that can be considered milestones in the history of cinema. For each movie we also collect data on its year of release, genres and countries of production, to analyze trends and patterns in the film industry according to such features. We also collect data on 20,000 directors and almost 400,000 performers (actors and actresses), and we use the network of references and our score of movies for evaluating their career, and for ranking them. Since the IMDb dataset we employ is highly biased toward European and North American movies and personalities, our findings can be considered relevant principally for Western culture.

Let me introduce a little about myself. I'm an A level graduates and now I'm going to study a degree in computer science. Why I want to study computer science? Some people would say its going to get you a ""future"" job, or you can get "" 6 figure"" salary, or "" I don't know what to study so I study  CS"" . Yeah, all of these seem to be correct but I am neither one of them. I am not feeling that I'm better or smtg, in fact, its just that I rarely hear this reason from who study CS. I study CS simply because I really love the satisfaction of solving complex problems and spending hours thinking logic  of that  algorithm, just that simple. I never enjoy this kind of satisfaction in any of other subject area before. When I was junior in primary and high school, everyone sees that engineering, lawyer, accountant and doctors are good job, but, this just leaving me behind not knowing what to do. I follow everyone to study in science stream during high schl( bio math add math phys and chemistry are main subjects) in order to have more options in the future. Looking back, I was always choosing a safest choice. (being a student in Asia country, somehow we are expected to be good in everything)

Eventually I've graduated from my uni after struggling and Studying stuff I don't really like for years. And I've got an average result at my schl(A+, As, Bs) that allow me to study A level afterwards. The first dya I've got into A level, the very first class of CS, I've no idea what CS is, I choose CS SIMPLY because I don't know what to study at that moment. The first term I've got an C in my exam, I started to wonder if it's correct for me. All people around me typing at a GOD LEVEL speed which I still need to look for the key before I can type it. However, With days and nights staring at stackoverflow and youtube channels I manage to get a not exceptional, but I consider a decent grade for A level with 89 marks after all.

To be honest, I think I study CS simply becuz it's like a fun game for me. In Asia, everyone is so focus on the career prospects and how much we can earn in the future. Whatever I've learned in A level was just a very basic level of python programming and introduction. Now, I've chosen a not famous uni to study CS instead of A qs Ranking top 15 Uni to study smtg that I'm less interested in. I seems to be irresponsible for myself, my family and everyone supported me. 

I am looking for suggestions, great opinions from yall. Just let me know what you think about my situation, or what you would like suggest me as I still have 3 months to sharpen my tech skills before I get into uni.

I'm neither a genius nor a smart guy, I don't even know whether I'm suitable to study CS or not. I choose it as I ""feel"" so much better when I study it. It simply require less memorization and more logic thinking. So yeah, let me know what you think.

181,94mmoi,False,General,8,What are the physical components of software?,computerscience,"Up until recently, I believed that ""software"" was nothing more than a level of abstraction describing the output of a computer's hardware, and that every tiny little detail - every speck of light, every bit of movement - all of these things are individual electrical impulses connected via their own dedicated circuits. In other words, stored ""bits of information"" on computer registers are best thought of as electric energy. Does that makes any sense?

Then I read a sentence from a related [Wikibooks article](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/CIE/Computer_systems,_communications_and_software/Components_of_a_computer_system_and_modes_of_use/Types_of_software) that threw me for a loop:

>*""Software components of a computer system have no physical presence, they are stored in digital form within computer memory.""*

What does that mean? Was I wrong in my initial assumption? Do electric charges themselves retain large chunks of information?

See, to me this is important because until the very recent past, I believed that being a programmer was more or less the same thing as being a computer scientist, insofar as what you need to know before pursuing a career in software development. For example, my understanding was that if you want to become involved in the development of video games, you *need* to know every last minutae of how computers work - how electric current is transferred via millions of transistors and logic gates, how these are represented on-screen, etc. You need to know the architecture of your game's graphics engine, you need to be 100% fluent in programming languages (i.e. never needing to look anything up - you know off by heart what to type, and *where* to type it), and so on and so forth. It shocked me to learn that programmers oftentimes don't even fully grasp how computers work at the absolute lowest levels of abstraction. Shouldn't they?

Am I misunderstanding something here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/94mmoi/what_are_the_physical_components_of_software/,4,"I'm having a bit of trouble understanding your main point of confusion. I don't know what ""every speck of light, every bit of movement"" means. Are you talking about simulations of light and movement, as in video games?

>Do electric charges themselves retain large chunks of information?

In a digital computer, each electrical charge retains exactly 1 bit of information. More precisely, each location where a charge may or may not be, retains 1 bit. It takes many bits together to retain a ""large chunk of information.""

When the same computer runs two different programs (at different times), the hardware is ""exactly the same"". The difference is which wires, or registers, are ""on"" or ""off"" (contain a charge or not). Software describes this aspect of reality -- the state of the bits. Hardware describes how the bits are wired together, and doesn't typically change during program execution. ",2018-08-04 21:32:16

Find a tutorial on the basics. Then find a project and start smashing some keys.

If you have a specific goal (coding a game, or an OS), choose a language suitable for it and learn that.

If you want to learn coding and problem solving in general:  

Start by using Python to get a feel for coding. Its a great beginner language because

* Easy, readable syntax
* Built-in BigInt support
* Dynamic Memory Allocation
* Extensive Libraries 

Almost every function you are gonna use has been implemented, so you can focus on using them rather than trying to implement them.

After you feel comfortable coding, move on to a more restrictive language, like Java. BigInt and Dynamic Memory Allocation don't come by default, so you have to do some calculations beforehand in terms of memory usage (or just use the library functions).


By this point you will have enough experience to know what to do next. 

^(After that move onto C, and learn about pointers. C is even more restrictive than Java because it also doesn't have BigInt or Dynamic Memory Allocation, but on top of that, no Bounds Checking or Garbage Collection.)

731,fqfaqe,False,Help,3,Can someone let me know if my understanding of amortized run time in a dynamic array list is correct?,computerscience,"Am I right in my understanding for amortized time for insertion in a dynamic array list? (dynamic means create a copy double its size and copy existing elements to new one WHEN we reach the current size limit). Please validate my explanation/understanding.

If we insert X elements into an array of initial size 0, it will perform the heavy operation (double size then copy) only at insertion number 1,2,4,8,16,..,X where each operation costs a function of X f1(X), f2(X), etc. I'll explain why they each cost a function of X below.

all other insertion operations like 3,5,6,7,9,10,11, etc is O(1).

the function of X which I mentioned above is because f1(X) + f2(X) +..+ fi(X) = 2X. where i is the number of heavy insertions. Proof: if you reverse 1,2,4,8..X, and sum it, you get X+X/2+X/4+..+1 = 2X.

Hence, total execution time is O(2X+j.O(1)) where j is the number of easy operations. (3,5,6,7, etc) **<-- THIS is the part I want to verify if my understanding is right or not**

therefore, total time is O(2X) = O(X)

but since we are looking for the time of only inserting one element, it is O(X) / X = O(1)

hence amortized time is O(1)

Last question: why is it called amortized? Where did I amortize anything?

Thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fqfaqe/can_someone_let_me_know_if_my_understanding_of/,2,"The reason we use amortized analysis as in your case is when the operation is *costly* but only at certain (and less frequent) situations. 

The ""insertion"" operation*cost* into the dynamic array, when the current array size (x) is a power of 2 would be x+1. In other situations it would be merely just 1 operation, as we need to just insert an element at the end of the array (this array has space). 

Now according to the method, we need to find the average number of operations that is required for inserting ""x"" number of elements. 

The method is straight forward.

x th insertion     1  |   2   |   3    | 4 |  5   | 6 | 7 | 8 |  9   |               

Number              1 | 1+1 | 2+1 | 1 | 4+1| 1 | 1 | 1 | 8+1|
Of operations


So total number of operations for x insertions would be 1 + (1+1)+ (2+1) + 1 + (4 +1)+ 1 + 1+ 1+(8+1)+1... i.e. x + (2^0 + 2^1 +  2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 +...2^k)

Where k = floor (logx base2)

i.e. x + 2^(k+1) -1       ( sum of gp series)
i.e. x + 2*2^k -1
i.e. x + 2x -1
i.e. 3x -1
 
This is total number of operations needed for x insertions. For average number of instructions, it is (3x-1)/x ~ 3x/x = 3.

So on an average 3 instructions for insertion operation. According to big oh notation, it is just constant i.e. O(1).

The mistake you are doing is, you are applying big oh notation while calculating the number of operations itself, which is wrong. Big-oh notation is for the order of growth of functions. 

So calculate the average number of operations and see how many steps (operations) it requires. Those average number of steps will be in terms of your input x. This itself is your function. You can't just apply big-oh where and when as you like it. ",2020-03-28 07:04:42

About two weeks ago, there was a substitute in for my Calculus teacher. He began talking to me about college and what I wanted to study. I said I was very interested in CS and programming. 

He says to me, “CS is a very difficult major. I don’t know many females who make it through all four years.”

I was dumbfounded. I did not say another word, but I wish I would have. How could you say that to an aspiring student? I would love to have another chance to chew this guy out. 

I knew I wanted to be a CS major since freshman year, and I’m not going to let some misogynistic loser tell me that I don’t have a good chance succeeding in my dream because of my gender. 


For some more context, this guy graduated with a mechanical engineering degree. I don’t know how he has any room to talk about the difficulty of CS.

You should start with some HTML, do the basic layout, page structure, all that good stuff.

485,d4zuy1,False,Article,7,How to create General ai,computerscience,"There is alot to talk about especialy about programming i tried to make it as simple as possible by avoiding it,this is easiest solution i know.I could write a book about it but dont have much time left so I would never finish it.U can read more on twitter jure cvitanovic on facebook these are blog posts.

Reasoning

Reasoning is tricky cause ai doesnt know shit for sure if it doesnt have input and calculations without input are cruical for decision making,especialy priority.U have to draw radiuses min max if u want precision on translation(movement)pathfinding with weights is good but u need to divide and conquer cause u cant run pathfinding on large area and u have to run it a lot of times regulary especialy on new input or output.Interest can help determine probability cloud in an area but u have to account for new events and baits.Bait can be predicted when something is out of interest of living beings double bait when time for objective on ""better solution"" is to good for robot and bad for humans(based on location for example).Distraction bait when u calculate what opponent doesnt want u to do and bait takes ""realistic time"" or longer and times differentiate between cloud of probability for thing they dont want robot to do and bait.

Its important to establish interest and how it manifests itself.For example if u avoid killing people u avoid translating things into their body or excessive input on their bodies in different ways.

Excessive input can be calculated as things done by people(or other beings) that hurt (input of unusual movement for example)them but dont happen inside simulation.

Past is important factor here cause even if thing is translated near(projectile) past can determine intention.

Interest can be simple like love,survival ( like sub can be need to belong ,power ,money ,health)

Love can also be part of survival but design of spreeding genes doesnt help u survive but your kids.So its important factor even if it increases health.Health can be linked to increased perfomance for calculations.

i could list alot of situations but the point is that u have to generalize a bit then based on micro actions u feine things u dont understand.Scientific thinking which takes separate thread or processor deals with thing not logical by simulations where u have to question certain things and define new one with as little attributes as u can cause ure just have a bloating mess.

For no input red data on electronic devices about certain things like people u go with geographic data based on accumulation of things of interest or u can skip and avoid it in calculations if u dont have any.

if u include it in calculations u screw up the systemcause u get to many error in decision making (this might be less obvious).

Priorities are very important in reasoning cause they can decide success or failure.U generaly want to avoid more risky decisions but its unaviodable cause ai doesnt know everything.U need to caclulate things on a fly for redecisions (adjustments),giving up on a desicion(part of an objective single or many depends how u program it)is generaly bad idea unless the effect is negative (bait).U usualy want to adjust and avoid switching to alternatives especialy to late cause u have different stats(location effects on body etc) and things generaly need to be precalculated which could falls into adjustment category.Time is an factor but bigger factor is conflict of interest,effect of threat can be actualy calculated without any data on it based on ""logic"" of simulation.

Data from that can be established and fed into database.For example experiencing an explosion,purpose of actions(translating circular object when interest is harm at low speed could potentially be harmles unless there is uncertainty of possible chemical reaction and act on ""doing"" something with the object to avoid self harm or object being activated based on movement time or enviroment attributes)can help u determine the goal of decision or simply decision of other living being or effect of an simulation(robot running from lava cause of heat as a thread aswell reduced visibility large amount of mass and etc-u run simulation of impact on a fly to determine effect).

Priorities are such as time,distance(difficulty lots of conflict),other beings in area and enviroment simulations all can be generalized into other and expanded by calculations if u do them with uncertanty based on very primitive rules and not expand those more when calculating,depends how u want to do it. 

Ai input

Its separated by physics simulation and prediction of living beings since they dont obide laws.

Living things have more iregular shape,structure of bones is relevant to be calculated and can be determined by shading of skin or if with clothes by running cloth simulation,calculating shape of body then determining where bone lie based on ""uplifting"".For all that u need to determine the shape of body ull gonna calculate.Double camera (like eyes) help alot in that prediction otherwise u have to rely more on movement.Beings tend to have rigged surface noisy texture prolongated(depends on a being) based on shape of a being.Math for simulation is already there it will be wrong to a degree cause of hardware so u ll gonna have mistakes but with time those mistakes show so if u recalculate

the decision making of output shouldnt be to bad if u think mistakes would ""grow"".Structure of being also has to be determined cause some dont rely on bones but have shell or bone less structure.

Visual input is probably the hardest.

Other input may be sound,transfer of data via electromechanical waves(option of hacking or sniffing)

thermal data(bad at distance but can help in close encounters) .

This would belong to reasoning but it s worth saying that all data not made logical by simulations is produced or is human.Things produced by humans tend to have purpose linked to interests,strange textures that dont make sense when time is a factor(cause maintenence-sign of human activity nearby in time scale) .Things made by human are not alive cause they still run by simulation just illogical to exist ""normaly"".

Other input could be vibrations like explosion but its kinda nonsense cause u can blow input device and still confirm such event via visual sound or thermal.

Dust(smoke) as a problem in determining beings can be removed on delta time with simulation.

Things on camera such as dust become obvious very quickly since they stay relativly same position during movement and distance calculations are ""wrong"" for it.

Misconceptions about agi.

Robots dont know things for sure there is probability of mistake when predicting living beings

and what they do if u dont have input.There is lack of precision in simulations cause of hardware

but u can tune that how u like to a degree.

robots dont have to be ruthless it all dpends who writes politics for action which are there to limit

stuff like skynet happening ,or something u dont want which is spoken alot in safety of ai.

robots need to be a generalist and to reduce having to many of them which would increase cost and

all have their vulnerabilities they need to have a shape of a human or to some degree depends

what is their basis of movement what materials they are made of and etc.

robots can be destroyed by high powered weapons explosives missiles since they cant act perfectly since they dont know everything and estimation has to be decided they can fall into traps or destroyed at distance by humans they are not invincible.

if they have to act fast the have to rely on fast decision making which i called instinct which can be wrong.so if u make one thats the tricky part.u have to decide stuff like priorities and radiuses of actions and interest.

robots dont evolve 20000 years in a week they ""prefer"" to do things cause thinking takes time and has high probability of ending nowhere to its more effective to just act.

robots can build other robots either from scratch or by having blueprints and copying code.

so being an ai engineer doenst make u special or a god.

u cant build robots solely with machine learning even if program can learn anything cause then it cant understand things ,u cant run infinite simulations on life especialy since its changing and same situation may never occur again.Even if u generalize some things its still far to little weights to be effective,if u generalize to much then u have useless shit.

I had an assignment about air transportation and I had to create an efficient schedule for an airline connecting 4 cities. we solved that manually. I was wondering if I could solve this using graph theory.

The problem statement in short:

An airline has 3 identical Aircrafts(AC1, AC2, AC3). This airline connects 4 cities (BOM, KLH, IXG, PNQ).

There need to be 4 flights for each pair of cities. for example, 4 flights for BOM-KLH, 4 flights from KLH-BOM (directed graph) etc..  time taken for going from each city to every other city is given as a matrix.

Create an efficient schedule for this airline to complete all the flights considering the following constrains:

1. There should not be more than one aircraft present (landed) at an airport at a time
2. each aircraft needs to visit BOM at least once and stay there for 2 hours for maintenance. (Ignore this constrain for now)
3. Each aircraft needs 30 min of time to prepare for next flight after landing (turnaround time)
4. All the flights should be completed in a time window of 48 hours.

Meaning of efficient schedule: A schedule is efficient when the aircrafts spend less time on ground (idle time) and spend more time in air in total (not more than the flight time in each flight). minimizing idle time will benefit the airline as the airline can pack more flights in given window and less airport charges.

Any advice as to what I can do to help with this worry?",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gskokq/not_feeling_confident_in_my_coding_skills/,17,"First off, you're likely suffering from what is commonly known as 'imposter syndrome', recognize that it's a pretty common thing, a feeling of inadequacy.  Understand you're not alone in feeling that way and I \*believe\* anyone who isn't a narcissist at some time feels this way.

Secondly, understand that this career, nor any career, is a good fit for everyone.  If you love this discipline than a betting man will bet on your success.  CS is hard....full-stop.  A good curriculum should be challenging because the industry is as well.  Only you can know if this is your path, but I feel that if you can look past the difficulty and still see enjoyment then it's simply a matter of 'sweat currency', work harder/smarter at it.

I've always loved CS and I often say I have no regrets, but that's a bit of an overstatement.  One evening after struggling endlessly on a particular course I found myself in my car on the edge of dropping out of school, driving south to find a completely different life.  After about 2 hours, \~120 miles I gathered my thoughts, cooled down, and returned to the library for 'round 99'.  Some people say that you measure the worth of something by the value of sacrifices you make for it.  Those long hours of study have given me a lifelong gift of a rewarding career and while I reflect on that 'one night about to give it all up' I'm glad I kept on struggling.  Things got easier for me, trust they will get easier for you if you're willing to put in the work and you love the discipline. ",2020-05-29 02:59:22

187,8eeme9,False,General,12,Why can’t computers use analog signals (as opposed to I/O) to make values that are more than what’s capable with Binary?,computerscience,"Okay, I’m not a computer science major or professional, so forgive me if this is an obvious question, but why can’t we use analog type technologies in computer chips that would make them able to hold more values than I/O

What if computers could use different signals, and for simplicities sake we’ll use  voltage, to make even more values per digit. This would require something akin to a voltmeter to distinguish values so it’s probably size-wise not practical but it’s an easy example. It can be anything.

For example, the current Binary system converts ON and OFF signals to numeric values:

OFF = 0
ON (~5v) = 1

An hybrid Analog voltage based system:

OFF = 0
1v = 1
2v = 2
3v = 3
4v = 4
5v = 5
6v = 6
7v = 7
8v = 8
9v = 9

Again I know adding a voltmeter to a computer chip would make it large and cumbersome but this is just theoretical now. There are probably better ways, like wavelength, etc.

Analog signals can hold a range of signals. For example my headphones (analog) contain only two wires, thus two signals. But with only those two signals I can hear the entire range of notes. This wouldn’t be possible with only I/O signals.

And while sensors like that are probably mostly a matter of size, remember that some of the old computers like the Mark 1 were enormous.

My voltage may be a dumb example, but I just did it to keep things simple. Let’s take a chip that uses fibreoptics for example. The human eye is able to distinguish almost infinite different colors based on the lights wavelength:

https://imgur.com/gallery/ICe7MQK

Imagine a computer that used fiberoptics instead of I/O electricity. Light is significantly faster and can hold almost infinite values. Not just 1 and 0. Depending on the length of the light wave could be set to represent different values.

So back to my example of a 1-10 voltage based computer, we could make logic gates that could add these voltages together making an analog adder gate. So

1st digit: 1-10
2nd digit 11-100

5v+7v=5 in digit 1, 7in digit 2=75

In binary you need almost 7 bits to get up to the number 100. With an analog system you need just 2.

And Currently a digital 4 “bit” system can only hold numbers between 1-10, whereas a system like this could hold up to 10,000!

[2][2][2][2]
[8][4][2][1] (4 bits holds 1-10)
With an added hat But with 10 values it becomes:
[10][10][10][10]
[1000-10000][100-1000][10-100][1-10] (4bits holds 1-10000)

A 64 bit analog hybrid system could hold 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 values, which is a disgusting number who’s computing power is billions of times faster than anyone could ever need.

the 16 bit processor in a Super Nintendo from 1991 could run about as fast as the computers we use today. A Nintendo 64 could be run servers.

Anyway, can a computer science expert comment on whether this is feasible or not or if there’s anything I’m missing or neglecting? 

This may be impossible or impractical but if it IS possible, it would make computers more powerful by several orders of magnitude.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8eeme9/why_cant_computers_use_analog_signals_as_opposed/,2,"I'm certainly no expert, but just my thoughts:

Instead of utilizing the 9v supply into a decimal system, I think minimizing the voltage supply on a binary system would be more ideal. Not sure of specifics, but I think some very precise binary systems can operate near 1v for HIGH and essentially 0v for LOW, but as the separation from different logic levels gets smaller, noise becomes a larger factor.

Yeah, that's software engineering. That's the reason why so many companies lean into extensive testing.

You're right on track. I would tell interviewers ""This is my first job so I don't have a good metrics scale to measure my knowledge, but I haven't found a problem yet, that I couldn't solve with a bit of research. ""Using your resources"" is a golden phrase to use in interviews. 

Yes you are learning things. It took me a while to realize this, but every one knows a lot about a little. What I mean is, when you struggle with something, research it, find an answer and then apply it, you won't forget how you did it. Sure, you may forget language syntax or whatever, but you'll know how to solve the problem. When some one comes by and asks you for help on the same issue, you'll have advice to give right? That's you learning. The more times you struggle and Google stuff, the more you learn.

Software Engineering, programming, coding, whatever you want to call it, it isn't comprehensive. No one knows all of it. Let me give you an example. I'm the new guy on my team. Not only am I fresh out of college and need to learn how software is developed in the real world, I have to learn my company's products, design process, etc. I feel dumb literally everyday. Then last Tuesday there is this big ""Out of memory"" issue. Everyone scrambled and tried to figure out what server could sacrifice some memory to this process that was failing (data processing). I stepped up and told them that the heap memory wasn't full, rather the old generation ratio wasn't large enough. That if we adjust the NewRatio Java opts variable, the process should complete just fine. Seasoned engineers looked at me like I was a genius when my solution worked. Am I a genius? Hell no. I just so happened to write a research paper on Java garbage collection in my last semester of school. Out of the hundreds of things I don't know everyday, I did know this one thing.

When people say that getting into programming requires you to accept that you will spend the rest of your life learning, they aren't joking. If you aren't busy learning what's already out there, you'll be busy learning all the new technology that has yet to come out. ",2019-08-26 01:43:38

[Half Adder Logical Design](https://preview.redd.it/jtxk5240kn831.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d59d5a17724840c65070bdb9027d3c7166e272)

The truth table is as follows:

|A|B|Sum|Carry|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|0|
|0|1|1|0|
|1|1|0|1|

&#x200B;

Now, we can create our next component by building on top of our existing design for the half adders. We're going to create a full adder. Our design that's in place is:

[Full Adder Logical Design](https://preview.redd.it/9mxhup2oln831.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be9355af66a2cc611c30ca2babc7cdee1a4930c)

Now again, if we draw the truth table:

|A|B|Carry In|Sum|Carry Out|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|0|
|1|0|0|1|0|
|0|1|0|1|0|
|1|1|0|0|1|
|0|0|1|1|0|
|1|0|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|0|1|
|1|1|1|1|1|

This truth table is a little bit bigger but what I want to draw your attention to is the sum of A, B and the carry input. They're encoded into the 2 bit binary at the output. i.e. the last row, 1+1+1 = 3, or in binary 11. Which is what we can see between the sum and carry outputs.

However, we're currently only supporting addition with this full adder so we want to be capable of subtracting numbers with this system too. So in order to do this we can use a system called 2's complement, this however means that we're in a signed space. For this project I'll be using an 8-bit signed space.

2s complement works by inverting all of the bits and then adding 2. So if we have 3 (00000011) and we want -3 we invert all the bits (11111100) and add 1 (11111101) which is the binary that will denote -3 in our signed space. Another note to take is because we're using a signed space we can't take into account an extra bit within our output. i.e. if we were working strictly with addition and not an 8-bit signed space then 11111111+11111111 could be outputted as 111111110 with a 9 bit number. However this doesn't make sense with our signed space as in 2s completement 11111111 is -1 therefore -1+-1 = -2 which is true if we ignore the overflow bit we've introduced. i.e. 11111110 instead of 111111110. My point is it doesn't make sense to include the overflow bit in your calculations if you're using 2s complementary numbers.

Now, let's incorporate this into our full adder. We essentially want to introduce a condition that will allow us to differentiate between addition and subtraction of numbers. When this condition is true we want to invert one of the inputs.

&#x200B;

|Condition|Output|
|:-|:-|
|False|A+B|
|True|A-B|

So we can upgrade our Full adder to be the following:

&#x200B;

[Full Adder\/Subtractor](https://preview.redd.it/t1db8cugon831.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=85b2091432dcca702c40fbf47be93509ae26804f)

The XOR gate on the input of B handles inverting the value of the bit when our condition is true. If look at the truth table of this operation:

&#x200B;

|B|Condition|B ⊕ Condition|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|
|0|1|1|
|1|1|0|

Now what you can see is when the condition is true the value of the XOR operation is opposite of whatever B is. So this will invert our value of B when trying to do subtraction, and when the condition is false it'll have no influence on the value meaning standard addition will be carried out.

Now we can build a full 8 bit chain of our full adder/subtractor circuits.

&#x200B;

[8 bit adder\/subtractor](https://preview.redd.it/havl5hxkqn831.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb8098302cca0151cf9eba26971c7d4c18beec2e)

So, everything is setup now and notice how the condition is fed into the carry input at the top, this is what introduces the +1 that's required for our 2s complement. Now the schematic is done and we can demonstrate some values with it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just realised I never offered an explanation on how to calculate the value of a negative. The most significant bit is a negative of its value, so in our case of 8 bit our most significant bit has a value of -128 and then you just work out the value as if it's normal binary whilst taking into account the negative. i.e. 10000001 is -128 + 1 or -127.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/c9s1pk/adding_and_subtracting_with_logic_designs_in/,19,"Yes very helpful.

712,g580ro,False,Help,3,Complexity classes for decision vs general problems,computerscience,"The threads below distinguish between **optimization** vs **decision** problems (e.g the classes  **NPO** and **PO vs NP** and **P**)

* [Optimization version of decision problems](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/943/116761)
* [“NP-complete” optimization problems](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/989/325)

The way the posts and answers are written, I get the impression that **many** problems such as **enumeration**, **counting**, and **search** problems can be framed as **optimization problems** even if they are **NOT** necessarily formulated as [mathematical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) problems (i.e. finding a solution to  an explicit objective function).

Take achine learning for example, one can and often casts **decisions** and **search** problems in ML as minimizing some form of e.g. expected loss, e.g  **minimizing regret** of making ""a mistake"" (e.g. **decision problems** in complexity theory could be framed that way), or e.g. minimizing any other form of expected error. This formulation is ubiquitous in ML.

What does this say about the general **reducibility** of many problems to **optimization** or **search problems**? 

Beyond ML, one could imagine doing the same for these problems:

* Count all [hamiltonian cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) in a graph
* Find the [nth Fibonacci term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)
* Find the [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of a set of numbers
* Enumerate the subsets for which [3SUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3SUM) answers ""Yes""
* etc.

In other words, given how often we do this in ML, can one always ***easily*** reframe or *reduce* non-optimization problems to optimization problems using a loss function? e.g. argmin𝑥 𝑓 (𝑥) where 𝑓 is a measure of error defined for the solution space of the desired problem? Or is that reduction **not** always *easy*, or maybe not always feasible?

More ambitiously, how does the ***family*** of complexity classes (and their associated types of reductions and definitions) for **search**, **enumeration** and **counting** relate to the family of **optimization** problems?

Multiply that by 6 since we’re dealing with hexadecimal values (7 if you include the ‘#’ character), and now we have a string of almost 3,000,000 characters representing an image.

It is the study of computing and computing systems (including artificial intelligence). It includes the architecture and internals of computers, Operating Systems, networks, and the Internet because that gives one extra insight into computing solutions that can be applied elsewhere. A person with a CS degree might have a job writing code to process and summarize data, then analyzing the results to find patterns that lead to further development of software and/or systems that solve some problem or implement some application. A CS person might write code that gets inserted into non-computer hardware that need to be controlled or managed (such as GPS devices, printers, cars, farm equipment, telecom switches, robotic devices, graphics cards in a PC, etc) which we collectively call embedded systems. A CS person might work for a gaming company to develop games, but that may require additional art, graphics, and gaming background. A CS person might be hired to work primarily with databases or information systems (such as with insurance companies). A CS person might work on various parts of a website (front end and/or backend). Ones first job may involve quality assessment, preparing/analyzing data, or making cosmetic changes to a website, but one can look for promotions or movement within to other jobs. If CS is a minor or 2nd major then doors of opportunity can open up in non-tech areas too—at least it may result in getting an interview that the person without any CS doesn’t get.

Having CS in the mix might make you more attractive going into medicine, nursing, healthcare, business, pharmaceutical, law, criminal justice,  or social work. A recruiter might simply want to grant an interview to hear your story— seeing strong CS credentials and wondering why an interest in a different industry. Always remember that coding or programming often is people oriented because you are creating something to help or entertain people. It is not computer-centric. A person often invents a computer solution to do something that he/she is bored doing the existing slow, tedious, or uninteresting way.

The lowest is machine code. 1's and 0's whose meaning is dictated by the instruction set. And the highest level is something like html or java. I recommend starting at high-level and going down.

16,hresk4,False,General,1,csrankings.org is biased. We need a better research based ranking website for CS.,computerscience,"Many of you know the importance of university rankings while applying to a grad school, especially if you are an international student. I am an international student and I relied upon [csrankings.org](https://csrankings.org) to shortlist the universities based on the research. I always thought this website was well maintained and could be trusted. However, a recent incident has changed my opinion.

Being a beneficiary of the website, I was personally motivated to keep it upto date to help new international students applying to grad schools. I noticed there were many missing faculties in the AI field at McGill University and thought I would submit a pull request. To my surprise the pull request was denied by the repo owner citing that a particular faculty was not a full-time employed at the university (the policy was to exclude faculty who are <75% at the University). In this case, I personally know the faculty and I told the owner that the faculty was a full-time employee and is in a tenure track. I also told him that they supervise newly admitted students (MS and PhD). But then came a big surprise. The repo owner told me that the faculty is a head at an industrial lab and hence only way to verify if that person is >75% at the university is to check their financial records.

This reply made me upset because:

* The website essentially gets updated at the discretion of one person. He chooses to ignore a particular pull request (PR) citing some policy of the website. However, there are many other faculties on the website who are part-time researchers / head at some research labs (I can speak for many AI faculties in this case). There is no way to get their names removed because one can't produce the faculties' financial records to prove that they are correct.
* Many so called policies are not mentioned on the website but the owner brings them up while submitting a PR. In my opinion these policies should be put on the website so that the students who look at the website are not being misled.
* The owner doesn't accept ECE faculties who supervise students admitted to CS because they don't fit the policy. However FAQ page of the website mentions the following statement:

>As mentioned above, tenure-track faculty who can advise PhD students in CS can be included regardless of their home department. The primary audience of CSRankings is prospective graduate students who are seeking a postgraduate degree in Computer Science.

But when I asked him about this, the person mentioned that the faculty of ECE has to be listed on the CS website. However, in a later part of the conversation, he says 

>websites are generally lagging indicators at best

You can find the entire conversation during [here](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings/pull/2723#pullrequestreview-448465670). I find it hard to accept the fact that the website I trusted the most is actually faulty.

I hope there was a better research ranking website that is unbiased, give a good indicator of whether a faculty supervises a PhD or MS students (irrespective of the % spent at the university) and where the policies are applied to all the universities and faculties. In fact, the website should have a better policies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/hresk4/csrankingsorg_is_biased_we_need_a_better_research/,0,Ranking things that vary along so many axes is a fundamentally flawed approach to begin with.

I am using a grid like graph where i one after another add some edges. So the graph has about the same amount of edges and vertices and has no weight's nor is it directed. Before i add a new edge i want to check the distance between the 2 vertices i am Connecting and later decide on that result whether or not i want to add this Edge.

It could be paying off since it's a ""grid-like"" graph and the paths can only get shorter when you only add edges. But it's still gonna be *O(N)* which you can't beat. ",2020-01-30 09:15:48

156,b5qglq,False,General,3,When and why do we use subnet mask?,computerscience,I was told subnet and masking is like using a mask in spray painting. But I guess that makes sense but when would you use it and why?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/b5qglq/when_and_why_do_we_use_subnet_mask/,9,"As the name implies, it creates sub-networks. All of your computers might be on one big physical network but you can logically divide them into smaller sub-networks that can then be firewalled off or whatever makes sense for operational or security reasons. Put important data in a special protected subnet away from your office machines that browse the internet for example. Makes sure computers in one subnet can't talk to ones in another subnet. It keeps things separated.

A mask is what enables you to tell if a specific computer is on a specific subnet. Computers are identified on the network by IP address (ok technically a MAC address too but let's focus on the IP layer which is where subnetting comes in). Often you see an IP address written as something like 192.168.42.1. but that's the human friendly decimal representation: the ""real"" IP address is in binary, sequence of 1s and 0s. In IPv4 (still the dominant network protocol I think but IPv6 is growing) the IP address is 32 bits so that means 32 1s and 0s are used to give a computer a unique ""name"". Usually the 32 bits are split into 4 8-bit groups called ""octets"" that are when written in decimal. That's why you see 192.168.42.1, each number between dots represents 8 bits so all together is 32 bits.

So how do you make a subnet? Well it makes sense to group IP addresses together based on some of the 1s and 0s being in common. Sort of like having a family name, you and family members like share the same family name but have a different person name (John Doe, Jane Doe are both in the Doe family but have different first names to tell them apart on paper).

So your subnet is kind of like a family name, all the computers on that subnet share the same ""name"" which in the case of binary means they share the same sequence of 0s and 1s at the beginning of their name.

The mask is therefore the thing that tells you which of the 32 bits is the ""family"" name (subnet, like Doe) and which are the first name (computer name on network, like John). The way it does this is that you write out all 32 bits of the IP but you put a 1 in every spot where that bit is part of the family subnet name and a 0 where that bit is part of the computer name. 32 is a lot to type out so let's use an example of an 8 bit IP address. If the first 5 bits are the family subnet name, then the last 3 bits must be the computer name. So the subnet mask is 5 1s representing the subnet + 3 0s representing the computer name = 11111000. If you wrote the binary into decimal, you'd get 248 so you might see the subnet mask written as 248... To make it a little more human readable but really it's the bits that are important.

It's become a lot more common to use CIDR notation instead or writing masks. CIDR is just writing the number of bits that are used for the subnet name, so in our example above of an 8 bit IP address with a 5 bit subnet name, then you'd write the subnet mask in CIDR as just /5. Slash, with number of bits, and you're done.

You could have /8, or /16 or /24 or /27 or whatever you want as a subnet mask. What's the difference between them? Well the bigger the subnet number, the more bits are used for the subnet, which means you can lots more unique subnet names. But there's less bits for unique computer names so you can have less computers on that network. So you need to pick a good subnet mask that allows you to have enough networks to do what you need while allowing enough bits for computer names to accommodate the number of computers that need to be on that subnet. It can be tough to estimate that especially in a rapidly growing company so that takes some thought and experience to get right.

Hope that helps! ",2019-03-26 14:36:24

In fact, there's an algorithm that can compute this in O(log b) time. From what I understand, you split b into its powers of two, and then compute the product of a raised to those powers, taking the mod whenever possible to avoid integer overflow.

For example, take a = 10 and b = 29. You can split 10^(29) into 10^((1\*1 + 0\*2 + 1\*4 + 1\*8 + 1\*16)) = 10^(1) \* 10^(4) \* 10^(8) \* 10^(16), and keep a running variable that keeps track of the current element to be multiplied, making sure to take the mod of it whenever it is updated. Since only log b elements are being multiplied together, this algorithm is O(log b).

Your code and the dependencies shared by Git, and data  —  through cloud storage (AWS S3, GCP) in a single DVC environment. It clearly helps to manage a big fraction of DevOps issues in daily data scientist routines:

1. Pull all kinds of necessary data from a variety of sources.

2. Extract, transform, and load the data.

3. Facilitate continuous machine learning and decision-making.

4. Share your algorithms and data.

Another DVC feature is ability to support multiple technology stacks. Whether you prefer R or Python-based implementations for industrial data products, DVC will be able to support the pipeline properly.

And recently I watched a video at youtube.I find it inspiring.

>If you,and I,and everything around us is the result of computational information.It stands for reason that the information can be modified and manipulated to an endless extent.We would be nothing more than puppets in a theatre.Maybe the simulation begins seconds ago and we only think it’s been 13.9 billion years because the in formation is artificially included upon its creation.Maybe the universe is really very tiny and all distant celestial bodies are simplistic renditions to create the illusion of enormity,Maybe **nothing physically exists until we observe its existence**.Perhaps **detail and complexity is added when it’s needed instead of being constant and absolute**.(Source:Youtube)

So I have been thinking if it is possible for us to simulate a world on our own.(Yeah,that is right,I have been thinking about creating our own simulation.)

I reckon there are some problems.And I think that is why It sounds too science fiction.Here are some of the problems:

1.We don’t know how to connect our consciousness to the computer and interact with a program yet.

2.It is difficult to simulate a whole a world.Because the amount of computation is too large.

3.We don’t know the exact physics law of our world yet,which makes it impossible for us to program.

Well,I reckon there are ways to solve all these problems:

1.As I mentioned above.”Maybe nothing physically exists until we observe its existence.Perhaps detail and complexity is added when it’s needed instead of being constant and absolute.”That means that it is not necessary for us to simulate the whole world!We just simulate what the guy connected to the computer sees.And we definitely don’t need to simulate from of atoms and moleculars.The purpose of this simulation is just make the one connected to the computer program believe he or she is in a real world instead of just a simulation!By means of using particular arithmetic,it is possible for us to make the simulationsimulation seems as if it is real!(At least the one who is connected to the program assumes so!)

2.With the development of our technology,I believe it is possible for us to develop such technology in the future to connect our consciousness to the computer.As far as I am concerned,there have been companies working at it.(Elon Musk?)

3.Being in that simulation means that we need to interact with not only objects in the simulation but also people.I think it is a bit of difficult to simulate people.Maybe in the future AI will be able to simulate people of different characters randomly.And when we interact with them we may be able to see no difference between them and a real person.

Some key tech we currently have that I think will make drones more deadly and advanced. 

-Machine learning AI that can fly autonomously without collision, or learn through flight simulators. (skydio drones)

-GPS systems to create a realtime map of the drone’s location at all times, set patrol areas for the drone to comb. 

-Facial recognition to remember every person it has ever seen and their last known location over gps. 

-High definition IR cameras to record previous flights, spot targets miles away, seek or pursue targets based on clothing, color, appearance

-Fast computer CPU to create a realtime 3 dimensional map of the world around it as it flies

Abstract

General-purpose computers have become ubiquitous and important for everyday life, but they are difficult for people with paralysis to use. Specialized software and personalized input devices can improve access, but often provide only limited functionality. In this study, three research participants with tetraplegia who had multielectrode arrays implanted in motor cortex as part of the BrainGate2 clinical trial used an intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) to control an unmodified commercial tablet computer. Neural activity was decoded in real time as a point-and-click wireless Bluetooth mouse, allowing participants to use common and recreational applications (web browsing, email, chatting, playing music on a piano application, sending text messages, etc.). Two of the participants also used the iBCI to “chat” with each other in real time. This study demonstrates, for the first time, high-performance iBCI control of an unmodified, commercially available, general-purpose mobile computing device by people with tetraplegia.

875,gshvas,False,Advice,4,Questions about going back to school for a BSc/ MS in Comp. Science for a Non-CS Major,computerscience," 

TLDR : A 2020 grad with a degree in neuroscience and philosophy wants to know more about going back to school for a second comp sci degree. The questions are in **BOLD.**

Hi guys,

I recently graduated (Spring 2020 - a couple of weeks ago) with a BSc in Neurobiology & Philosophy (double major) from a state university. At the moment, I am planning on going to medical school and am taking about two or so gap years. This is quite ignorant of me, but I realized how hard it is to find a well-paying job or at least one that just doesn't have grunt work with just a neurobiology degree, if one doesn't go to graduate school. There are also job out there for people with biology degree and those that have research experience (me being one of them) - but those are normally super competitive due to the sheer number of biology -related graduates, and with COVID-19, most research departments have hiring freezes/ cutting costs. I can definitely get a job with a philosophy degree (I was surprised to find that out as well), and am currently looking but it would not be ideal as it would not get me closer to my goal - of getting more clinical hours and patient exposure.

Additionally, I did not have a backup plan coming out of college and did not realize early enough that even if I were to do everything right in terms of strengthening my application during my gap years, there is a pretty high chance I might not get into medical school - in my first, second, and even my third round. I know of people that have better stats than mine, and are overall excellent, well-rounded candidates that should make it, but still haven't gotten in after their second try. Therefore, I would like a backup plan in case that happens to me. In addition, this might seem pessimistic of me, but I also want a safety net - in case, 1 in a millionth chance, I don't like being a doctor. I am simply trying to be as practical as I can be and not waste time and money.

I am thinking that during my gap years, during which I am aiming to find a *clinical* job (Right now) that would expose me to doctor-patient interactions, and where I can work directly with patients, I should get a second degree in Computer Science\*\*. As of currently, I am trying to find ***any*** job, but that's irrelevant to this. These are the questions I have for you guys:

1. **Is this the right subreddit to post this? or should I post elsewhere?**
2. **Should I get a BSc or a MS in Comp Sci?** : I looked through most of subreddits related to Comp. Sci and found there to be conflicting opinions, somewhat dated. I'd rather skip the undergraduate requirements, but I do not want to skip the core classes given how fundamental they seem. TBH, I was quite confused myself per the different programs and requirements from different universities and what was better or worse in each of the programs. I figured I should ask people in the industry. **Which programs would you guys recommend for someone like me? The cost should be the last factor.**
3. **How much times does it normally/on average take?** Given that I will be working, I would like it to be part-time. Would the degree (BSc/MS) be completed in two-years or so?
4. I am looking for the positions of Software Developer/Systems Analyst/Engineer/ Machine Learning and AI - given my background in Neuroscience - T**herefore, what are the absolute requirement as for courses I should look for in a program given these positions?**
5. I know there are online programs for non-CS majors - ideally I would like to go to a physical class/university - although I realize how it might not be feasible given how long this COVID-19 pandemic might go to, **but any thoughts/opinions on these online programs? Should I stay away from any of them? Any outstanding programs that would fit my schedule?**

I wrote down the stages to the best of my ability but need help understanding what happens right after the TCP handshake and right before the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Please help:

*Session Start/TCP Handshake*

1.Client begins a session with Server by initiating a TCP handshake.

*Assymetric Encryption for TCP Session*

2.Server and Client negotiate back-and-forth and agree upon a mutually supported encryption protocol for the TCP session.

**At this point, post-protocol-negotiation, it is unclear to me how their session is initially being encrypted. I used Wireshark to try and capture the Client or Server sending over their public key or something but couldn't see anything. Regardless, please explain this stage if you can.**

*Client and Server negotiate a shared secret key for this session using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm in order to establish a symmetric-key encrypted session.*

3.Client and Server begin process of producing temporary key pairs, using 1. Shared prime number 2. Encryption generator (typically AES) 3. Private prime number (as private key).

4.Client and Server use these three to each generate their own public key that can be derived from their own private key.

5.Client and Server each share their generated public key with each other.

6.Client and Server each use their own private key, the other's public key and their original shared prime number to generate the same secret key.

7.Client and Server use this key as their shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt all future communication on this session.

*At this stage, Client and Server have successfully established a symmetric-key-encrypted session without having needed to send the secret key over insecure channels.*

Surely the exact opposite is true?  As something becomes more disordered, 
the number of bits of information needed to describe it increases – “information grows”. 

To find structure we need to throw away information. A common simple example is 
summarising a large number of observations in a sample with a single number, by 
calculating the sample mean. The reason we calculate the sample mean is 
fundamentally that the entropy of the mean is lower than the total entropy of the 
original set of  observations.  Throwing away information (aka entropy) is what living 
things need to do both to preserve their own biological structure and also as part of 
trying to discern structure in their overly information-rich environment.

Its true that there is something that is hard to grow and preserve against the tendency 
to increasing disorder, but wouldn't it be better to find a different name for it 
than “information” ? That term is already commonly used to quantify something quite 
different - the relatively disorderly raw material from which order is excavated.  ",2015-07-28 23:22:16

It will use text, video, and interactive randomly generated exercises. So there will be video of me explaining and solving problems, with accompanying text in the web page. Then there will be a place to click for an automatically, randomly generated exercise. You can click to get as many as you want.


I know basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a bit of compliers and interpreters. I think with a medium amount of struggle I can build a JS parser to build and read expressions.


The material will span algebra, geometry, calculus, discrete math, physics, etc. Lots of different kinds of rendering is needed. Ultimately this will expand to very advanced subjects like measure theory and quantum mechanics. So you can imagine what goes into automatically and randomly generating both algebra expressions and geometry diagrams, and then more. It's going to have to use something like LaTeX, Geogebra, maybe both, maybe something else.


I've been handling the text with MathJax, but that can't do geometry diagrams. I could generate the diagrams in a separate software, but then that can't be embedded in the page so the user can generate them on-demand. I started looking at LaTeX.js but the diagrams don't render as expected and there's minimal documentation of this. The code is open source but I'm not proficient enough to be able to understand it. 


Now I'm willing to spend years studying CS to figure this out. In fact I'm currently studying computer architecture and will soon study operating systems and network science.

Make a website which just has text for now (like a blog). Even that will take a while if you are planning to build a custom CMS (content management system). Then add a way to embed YouTube videos (easier than hosting your own videos; you can always set uploaded videos as unlisted). Then add MCQ quiz feature with questions in image format and options to choose from. Keep the exercise building manual for now.

You will have to figure out authentication and authorisation as well for this. All this can be done via React/Vue and Node.js. You will have to use a content host too (S3, DigitalOcean spaces, etc)

All of this alone is going to take a lot of time but the good thing is that you can verify your product market fit while building this. Get continuous feedback from your users and build what they want rather than building something really complex and realising no one wants to use it.

Once you have a basic platform ready, you can then build cool features such as automatic exercise generation without getting overwhelmed. You may want to read this [paper](https://yangjiera.github.io/works/icwsm2018.pdf) on this. ",2020-03-26 21:17:08

I don’t think that’s what you mean and there is much more to it than just some base library packages that contain functions. 

Just like any language there is an R way of solving problems and once you get the feel for that you’ll write better code but you really ought to understand a lot of concepts about the language to effectively use it. For starters one should learn about all the base objects used in the language and the three most common OOP systems in R (S3,S4 and R5). Then you might want to choose a data structure library you like and learn how that community uses those tools. One of the most popular library collections is the tidyverse. After that learning some functional programming concepts would be helpful and naturally that requires understanding R environments. If you’ve mastered those things you can use R to do a lot. 

I know quite a few PhD statisticians (R is more statistics leaning btw) that don’t make any of their own objects and seem to use a small subset of what R is capable of. However, they often have sprawling code bases that are hard to manage and they rewrite the same code a lot.

Can you guys try to explain it in a ELI5 fashion?,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bur0vx/p_vs_np_and_np_hardness_and_np_completeness/,11,"P does not necessarily mean that you can find a solution quickly, it just means that the amount of time to solve the problem only grows at most a constant exponent of your input.  For given input n the solution will take O(n\^k) time as opposed to O(k\^n)

The P stands for Polynomial

The N in NP means non deterministic, it does not mean Not P.

Compare for a data set that goes from 2 to 100 items.  As n grows the NP solution time grows horrifically fast.

P     2\^5, 10\^5, 100\^5 vs

NP  2\^5, 2\^10, 2\^100

All problems that are P are NP in that P is a subset of NP.  Think P = Polynomial time, NP = non deterministic Polynomial time.  One of the aspects of NP problems is you can verify a solution in polynomial time.  If a problem has a polynomial time solution then verifying the solution can be done worst case polynomial time.

For example assume I have an algorithm that finds all the prime numbers from 1 .. n and it has a run time of O(n\^k).  If the number 534,343,534,343,534,343 is  in the range 1..n I can guarantee to test if it is prime within polynomial time.  Worst case I can just use the algorithm I used to find all the primes which I know is bound by O(n\^k).  This is why all P problems are a subset of NP problems.

You could create a 2/3 bit adder using a few transistors.

I am studying Computer Engineering. I have had one internship through put school so far as a Software Engineer and did not have a postive experience.

300,gf44d6,False,Discussion,1,How to estimate how many random characters a computer can generate per second?,computerscience,"Hello fellow smart people (I am not one)

I don't work in the computer science branch, so maybe this question is a dumb one.

Is there any way to figure out, how many random letters (characters) a computer (or a processing node for that matter) can generate per second knowing the FLOPS-count? 

To be precise, let's take the Titan Supercomputer as the example:  
18'688x16 Cores (Opteron 6274) at 2.2 GHz (2200000000 cycles per second, right?)  
18'688xTesla K20X GPU (3.9 TFLOPs in float)

This results, as Wiki states, in 18 petaFLOPS (benchmarked)  


Is the generation of random characters a one-cycle operation or not?

Thanks for all replies and stay healthy out there :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/gf44d6/how_to_estimate_how_many_random_characters_a/,0,"generation of a random number is the application of a formula repeatedly starting from a seed. there is a  math expression that generates the next number in the sequence from the previous number. it will be evaluated by the ALU in the form of a sequence of assembly level instructions (each one doing a minimal task like moving a number into a register or adding two registers together).

i dont know about super computers but in a personal computer (x86 architecture) the time required by an instruction in measured using the number of memory reads and writes required to finish the actions since they are the most expensive operations. each one of them takes 3 to 4 cycles.

thus knowing a bit about the target machine's instruction set and architecture and the math expression used in the number generator u could possibly calculate the number of cycles required to generate 1 number, then the number of numbers generated in 1 sec. but this is for each core. u could multiply by the number of cores if just separate threads are run each doing the same thing.
