She always uses the classroom's markers which are pretty shitty, so she ends up throwing at least one out every class. 

Some classes ago I joked with her saying she needed her own markers, she had a good laugh and said she agreed with me. She still didn't get markers. 

My mom is also a Prof and she has a lot of markers still inside their boxes, and I was thinking of offering her one of those.

236,gxp2fs,False,,118,Is there any point for me to try to continue college with a 0.80 GPA? Is there even any possibility?,college,"To put it simply, my college career is completely screwed up. Over the last four years, I’ve taken four semesters of college (2 semesters in physical classes and a 2 semesters of online classes). Somehow, for no good reason other than lack of interest/drive to do the work, I’ve managed to fail nearly every single class I have attempted. At it’s lowest, my gpa was a 0.39. I took 3 classes online last summer in which I managed to achieve 2 Bs and an F. That brought my GPA up to 0.80 and I haven’t given it another run since. 

This is a very different picture than my academic profile in high school: 3.8 GPA, highest SAT score, National Merit Scholar, etc. Needless to say, I lost any and all scholarships I had.

I wish I had a better reason for why I’ve done so horribly in college. My father died shortly after I graduated high school, so I used that as an excuse in the mandatory meetings I had to have with advisors due to being on academic probation. But while that was definitely a very sad experience, I can’t honestly say I felt any depression or sadness that was impacting my desire to do school work.

The only real reason is that I have been spending my time working on other things, but I know this isn’t a solid justification as I know plenty of people who have excelled in college while working on other business and/or creative ventures on the side.

Now, as I watch all the people from my high school class graduating and getting their degrees, I can’t help but wonder if I should give another pass at this or throw in the towel. I haven’t officially thought of myself as a “college dropout” yet, but I also don’t have any concrete plans of returning.

Currently, I’m running a small video production company, learning a few instruments and DAW software in hopes of finding success (and skill lol) as a musician, and studying/practicing screenwriting with aspirations to write for (and one day create/executive produce) television shows. 

While I like to think I’m confident that I can realize my dreams without college, there are times where I can’t help but wonder if I need to give it another shot, just in case. I also feel like I’ve been socially cut off from people in my age group these last few years and worry that it’s negatively impacting my ability to make social connections that could be beneficial in my fields of interest. I’m an introvert so it can be difficult for me to actively place myself in social situations at times. College seems like a bit of an easier way to accomplish this. 

But then I think about how much of a waste of money and potentially time it could be and go back to square one.

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, I guess I just felt like ranting but also would be interested to hear other people’s perspective on if it is even worth trying to go back with my GPA where it is. If you actually read all of this I appreciate you!!

TL;DR: College GPA after 4 semesters is a 0.8. Is it even worth trying anymore?


Edit: WOW, this in-my-feelings rant got way more attention than I expected! I appreciate all of the responses, advice, words of inspiration, and reality checks. 

To everyone who suggested I pick up a trade - luckily I’ve managed to make a decently lucrative gig out of the video production thing so far. Had a full time job as video production specialist (ironically for a school district) for a couple of years that I recently quit in favor of doing my production company full time, so I’ve been fortunate enough to at least have that for the time being as an income source while I work on my other passions. 

If I went back to college now, it would likely be the same story. I will focus these next few years on trying on putting my time, money, and energy into the things I’m truly committed to and reassess college a few years down the line.

471,dengsv,False,,64,Failing my classes and confused about my major/future,college,"I am currently a second year student at a California community college. I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.

So this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don’t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I’m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. 

I don’t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that’s my parents’ money. I’m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won’t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don’t think I can do. Any advice will help, I’m extremely stressed right now.

Edit* let me add that i know its a very stressful situation. I was in three semesters that i failed and dropped classes till i dropped out. I kept trying and trying but it didnt work out. I know all about the stress youre going through. Be honest with yourself because you will know whether youre giving 100% effort or not. If youre not giving 100% then its hard to justify it.

587,9nwzjg,False,,35,Professor is accusing me of cheating off another student I've never spoken to. Wtf do I do? Online class.,college,"

EDIT: 
The other student took my discussion board post and used it for their essay. I used my own post for the essay, just added fluff to it. This is why it got flagged as word for word. Hopefully he changes my grade, since I can't control what another student takes from discussion boards that are visible for all. 




----OP-----


I checked my grade on an essay yesterday, it was a 0 and had a comment from the professor ""did you cheat off of x or did x cheat off of you?"" I didn't recognize the name, so I replied asking what they meant, I only used one source for my work and it was the text book given, and I quoted every source. 

Then I looked through the students names and realized x is another student in the online class with me, I've never even replied to one of their comments on a discussion board. 

I emailed the professor again explaining that I don't know the student, and would like to see their work to compare. 

Professor replied with my essay and highlighted a part that was ""almost word for word"" from the other students. And said ""this is not a coincidence""

This guy obviously is not going to believe me, but I know the truth. The other student knows the truth. What can I do to get this figured out? I can't fail this class. I don't want to be accused of something I did not do, especially when it's plagiarism. 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9nwzjg/professor_is_accusing_me_of_cheating_off_another/,440,"Your best bet is to try to prove that it's your work, not the other students. Helping him to see that you posted this onto what I assume is a class discussion board before any of these essays were turned in will likely help your case.

In either case, the professor *should* have given you both zeroes if he/she was unable to determine who plagiarized. That's the fairest approach to this if they can't pin down who copied the other's work. It's basically in the school of ""either you copied person X or you helped person X cheat"", both of which could be considered violations of academic integrity.

Hope the prof. hears your argument and is willing to give you your points.  ",2018-10-13 20:29:51

The email only gave me their first name and their phone number, so I can't look them up on Facebook. When I was living in a dorm I lived with a good female friend of mine, so having 3 complete strangers be my roommate is a little scary. Luckily I got my top choice of room and floor preference, and I have my own bathroom. We also each have deadbolts on our bedrooms doors in addition to the front door of the apartment.

If I call and ask to be switched to a new apartment with different roommates, it's likely I won't get the room or floor I want, which is really important to me. Because of this I think I want to stick it out and stay with these roommates, because at least I'll have a nice room to myself.

Absolutely not a scam, and a legitament business. The major difference between Vector and something like Vemma is that with Vector you sell the product and get commission. Vemma you get paid for advertising and recruitment. With vector, you directly sell Cutco Cutlery to the customer instead of having them in the store. 

Let's clear up some misconceptions:

1. You do not pay for your set anymore.  That practice stopped about 6ish years ago. When you paid for your set it was yours. Now the knives are yours and you can buy them from your manager if you'd like, return the set when you're done, or have your manager get charged for them

2. You make money via sales OR per demo. You make 15-18 per demo or commission,  whichever is more at the end of the week.

3. It's a great product with a great warrenty. That being said it is difficult to sell them, mainly because of sticker shock. Shits expensive, yo.

4. You don't get paid for training, but since you're an independent contractor so they don't have to. It's shitty but it's only a day or two but can be done online in a few hours (dont recomend). They do feed you during training which was cool

5. When you get through tier 1 and 2 of your recs, thats when it gets really hard. Tier 1 is friends/family. Tier 2 are their friends/family

I learned a lot about sales at Vector, but it's definetly not for everyone. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them. I worked there from March 13-July 13. I stopped because i wasn't making enough money. But because I didn't make money doesn't mean it's a scam. It's sales, sometimes you make money, sometimes you dont.

Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn’t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I’m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it’s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren’t my cup of tea and I’m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. 

I was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I’m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I’m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it’s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I’m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. 
	
I guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?

Edit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo

So I have done research, I’m okay with the average annual income and I know that it’ll be tough to start out with but it’s that way for almost everyone so I’m expecting it. I’ve been looking into internships, however as far as I’ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I’m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. 

I’m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they’d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that’s a sort of double hit. 

Overall, I’m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.

Edit2: I don’t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. 

As someone mentioned, a degree isn’t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like “you’d actually make money in stem” is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won’t be easy either way, and I’m not in school to have fun, I’m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I’m already feeling burn out and miserable I don’t want to waste all that time and money.

I’m a pre med student and I very unexpectedly got pregnant. i use protection with my boyfriend but i guess the condom must’ve ripped. i grew up in a very pro life household and it’s stuck in my head that it’s morally wrong to get an abortion. i’m fine with other people taking that route and i was going to do it myself but i just can not do it. it hurts me so much. 
i’m about a month along and i’ve decided to let nature take its course and if it’ll be a miscarriage then that’s the way it’s supposed to be. 

i will be a sophomore when the baby is due. my family and my boyfriend’s family is very supportive and will help out. my grandma wants to move close to us just to be able to help us out so we can still continue with school. i’m planning to take a semester off or do online classes when the baby is due. do you guys think that having a kid will affect my chances of getting into medical school? will they see me any differently? thank you so much for the help. this has been a very rough couple of days for me.

EDIT: i appreciate all the support! it definitely has made more comfortable. i luckily went through a rough childhood to build up my maturity. my mom had cancer and i was the only one able to take care of her, had to skip a lot of high school and i still graduated with a 3.5 GPA all honors and AP classes. overall i missed 70 days sophomore year, almost 50 days junior year and  about 40 senior year. i genuinely believe i have the work ethic but i’m still nervous because i completely understand the responsibility. i’m very lucky to have two families and boyfriend that are willing to help with anything i need.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/f5u8b0/im_pregnant/,1289,Pog ,2020-02-18 16:21:20
759,c99ogt,False,,116,my parents don’t support my major,college,"it’s not official yet but i want to change my major to psychology. as of right now i’m a biology major and i hate it- it’s nothing but science courses and biological electives. it’s also more geared for pre-med students, which isn’t me. 

i’m passionate about psychology, i’m better at it, i enjoy the writing as i read a lot and pride myself in having good writing skills. im pre-physicians assistant regardless of what my major is, so isn’t that all the more reason to major in something i actually enjoy? also, if for some reason i change my mind about the PA track (which i’m considering), i would be interested in getting my masters in something psych related. my parents hate this idea because it means more schooling and more money to spend but i’m going to be stuck with student loan debt regardless, so why not go ahead and get my masters? 

also, my parents don’t understand no matter how many times i tell them that i can major in anything i want and still be pre-PA. i’ve had to explain this so many times to them and it’s like they get amnesia or something, and i have to tell them again. a few months ago when i decided i wanted to change my major and explained to them that i would still aim for PA school, they were supportive. 

and finally, i think my parents want me to major in something like biology because they care about how i look to other people. this is actually the reason i’m writing this post- we were talking to a neighbor and i told them my situation, and once i went back inside my mom blew up in my face telling me i’m wasting my time majoring in psych and that i’ll be working a dead-end job i don’t like. i had to explain to her that i’m still PA and like i said before, she doesn’t understand what the fuck i mean when i tell her i can major in just about anything and still go to PA school. also my neighbor was asking me questions about school and my dad started answering questions for me. it makes me so mad because i can tell they have some plan for me that they don’t want. i’ve ranted to my advisor about this more than once and she tells me every time to do what i want. what do i do in this situation? also how do i deal with my parents?

edit: 1) i am aware that what i said about debt is stupid and that i do not want more debt than less debt. 2) i am aware that a psychology BA is one of the most useless degrees i can get, which is why if i go through with psych i would go to grad school.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/c99ogt/my_parents_dont_support_my_major/,322,"Disclaimer.

Last semester I spoke to him 3 times about his hygiene and how he smells. The first and second time I made sure to be very polite and not to hurt his feelings. He said he’d “take care of it” and just bought candles and febreez. The problem is his shower and laundry habits, which are essentially nonexistent. 

The third time I spoke to him I was really pissed off with him. I told him it was atrocious and I made him do his laundry, change his sheets, and shower. It was better for a week or two. 

Everyday I wake up and leave to brush my teeth. When I get back, there’s this overwhelming smell of a mix between feet, Asshole, and BO. I am sick of it. He’s lucky I don’t have a girlfriend anymore or else I would be a lot less patient.

I bummed around for a while, struggling to find jobs during the recession, and then I decided to enlist. No regrets! Now I'm set up with the post-9/11 GI bill, and ready to pursue a Bachelor's in education. I'm registered for the fall semester and classes are only a few weeks away from starting. I'm first generation for my family, and ridiculously exited. But anxious. 

I honestly just don't really know what to expect. I graduated high school 11 years ago, but got crap grades because I often neglected homework. I never had to study for tests as a teen, I'd always been a good tester and cruised right through. My military job was very technical, and I had to learn to actually study in order to perform well. I've heard that college is more study-heavy than homework-heavy, I've heard from some that's it's harder than HS and from others that it's easier. I've been told that you're sort of teaching yourself. 

Can anyone maybe describe how an average lecture goes? Amounts of homework? What the heck is assigned reading about? I know they won't hold my hand, but can I approach a professor if I'm having trouble understanding something? Should I bring my laptop, or a tablet, and why? WHY ARE BOOKS SO EXPENSIVE?!

598,cf8s7p,False,,148,I'm an Adjunct Professor and We're Preparing to Go on Strike,college,"Posting this because I figure it's useful for students to understand how their universities function and because I'd like to know how students would respond if their professors went on strike.

First some background for people who don't know how the adjunct thing operates; you can skip ahead if you're familiar.

Adjuncts are faculty members who work part-time for the university and are typically paid very little, around $3000-5000 a semester for a 3 credit course. There's two main varieties of adjuncts. The first are the Industry Adjuncts -- these are people who've had substantive careers outside academia and are returning to share their expertise. The second are Career Adjuncts -- these are people who want to be professors and start teaching right out of grad school. Industry Adjuncts are typically well off financially from their previous jobs, many are in retirement, and they get paid more for their classes (some getting more than $10,000). This post is about Career Adjuncts -- the people who grind out a living working multiple jobs at once and are hoping they'll eventually get a full time teaching job, even if it's not tenure track. Most of the adjuncts you'll encounter are the Career Adjuncts, they're the ones teaching the 100 level courses and are nearly half the faculty at some universities.

My current pay rate is just over $4,000 per course. So, if I wanted to earn a moderately decent salary of $48,000/yr (with zero benefits!) I'd need to teach 12 classes. A standard full-time teaching load for a professor with no committee or research responsibilities is 6 per year (usually 3 Fall, 3 Spring, what we call a 3/3 load). My university caps each adjunct at only 3 courses per year; if we want to teach more, we have to find other universities to work at.

The head of my department recently decided that adjuncts would no longer be given preference in hiring for full time positions, so being able to use the job as a bridge to a full time teaching career is no longer an option. The department also recently hired so many new adjuncts that it's now difficult for us to even get 3 courses a year and most are going to be limited to a 1/1 load.

We're going to soon be renegotiating our contract with the university, and the university has been adamant about not increasing our salaries (we do get pay bumps, but it's equivalent to a 2% raise, so basically just matches inflation).

Technically, we're not allowed to strike under our current contract. But, the contract says absolutely nothing about what our actual teaching responsibilities are. If the university is unwilling to budge on pay, then we're looking at putting our job expectations on the table. Here's what it would look like:

If a normal work week is 40 hours, and a normal full time load for a semester is 3 courses, then each course is roughly 13:20 per week. Based on our low pay rate though, the university is entitled to only half that: 6 hours, 50 minutes per week per course. Keep in mind that 2:30 of that is already classroom time, with some extra going to getting to class a bit early to set up, and staying late a few minutes to talk to students. That leaves about 4 hours left for office hours, lesson planning, answering student e-mails, writing assignments, grading papers, etc. There's also often faculty meetings which will take up about 1:30 every few weeks.

I teach a small, writing intensive class with about 20 students. If I want to return essays in a timely manner (we're urged to do it within 1 week), I can spend a full 12 minutes on each individual essay, and that's if I do *nothing* but grade outside of class (no lesson planning, nothing). Normally an 8-10 page paper will take me about 45 minutes to grade, and 10-12 takes about an hour. But, if the university refuses to purchase that service, they may pay for my 12 minute essay analysis which consists of a quick read of the paper, marking any obvious grammatical errors, circling the relevant sections on the grading rubric, and writing a sentence or two in response. This is the course where we're supposed to be teaching you how to write academic essays, and I have to seriously consider eliminating essay writing from my curriculum.

Since we can't strike, our alternative is to provide a bare minimum education.

If you're a student, this should piss you off quite a bit. My university charges about $1,400 per credit hour, so each student is paying $4,200 to be there, and combined the class has a sticker price of $84,000. I see about 5% of that. Realistically, after scholarships, my students are maybe paying $50,000 total, but I still get less than 10% of that.

The sad truth is that you do *not* get what you pay for. You pay the university, and the you get what the university pays for, and the university is a cheap bastard. In order for the situation to get better for adjuncts, we're going to need students to be much more aware of how little of their tuition goes to pay for their education. Also your parents (they're really the university's target audience).

Now just to head off a couple responses I know this is likely to draw:

""If you don't like it, why not just work somewhere else?"" Because I want to teach college students. Getting a job teaching, any job teaching, including shitty adjunct ones, is tough. But that aside, *someone* has to teach the class, and if it's not me, it'll be someone else in the exact same situation. Changing the personnel doesn't change the conditions.

""Why are you taking it out on the students?"" I'm not. I have a menu of services I offer, and the university may decide which they are willing to pay for. It's the university deciding to only pay for a bare bones education while charging top dollar. ...Also, I'm completely willing to take a couple picnic blankets out to the quad to hold lessons and give feedback on essays there on my own time. I'm just going to make sure everyone is crystal clear on what education the university is providing and what education I am providing beyond that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cf8s7p/im_an_adjunct_professor_and_were_preparing_to_go/,435,[deleted] ,2019-07-19 15:16:06

You're probably a couple weeks into the semester and you may be falling into the early semester trap. You find yourself in a period of time thinking ""Wow, I have no homework this weekend"" or ""Once I turn this in on Wednesday I'm free."" 

It's an illusion. In reality, you have more work to do; it's just not due until later.

Spend your free days getting started on that work. Even if just for a few hours. Don't have any more days of non-productivity. And by working, I mean really working. Not just staring at a textbook to kill an hour or going to class like you should already be doing, but actually spending Friday making headway on an assignment that's not due until next Wednesday, or getting caught up in a class where you know you're behind.

I give this advice for 3 reasons. 

\#1, A lot of college students (including myself for many years) miss points on assignments because they underestimate how much time it will take to complete. That's the dumbest reason ever to lose points. You're just hurting yourself for no reason.

\#2, Most students' schedules have a natural ebb and flow: crazy amounts of stress before deadlines, and free time elsewhere. It's not balanced nor healthy. It's the reason some students can't take the pressure when it really builds up. Delegate your work more evenly and you'll still have the ability to take time off and relax, just with less stress hanging over your head.

\#3, It builds discipline. You have to teach yourself to work even when you don't want to. That's the difference between discipline and motivation. Motivation is nice, but it won't last you all year long. Discipline will.

My Study Tips as a 4.0 Senior in College

Hey guys so I wanted to make a post that I hope will help some of you with how to maximize studying efficiency and increase your chance at getting straight A’s in med school pre reqs and college in general.

Study tip 1: Prioritize Classes, each class and individual professor has a level of difficulty and importance to your overall college career. Prioritize classes with high importance (pre reqs and major requirements) over other less important classes. Additionally, prioritize classes that appear more difficult over those that are less difficult.

Study tip 2: Balance your schedule with 1-3 difficult classes and 1-2 moderate to easy classes. This will help you not get too overwhelmed.

Study tip 3: For clases which are heavy on memorization, space out studying the two weeks before a test one hour each day. As the exam approaches, study for longer stretches of time the week before, reviewing sections of material. The three days before an exam do a Meta Review of all material, three consecutive days. This will maximize information retention and give you both the nitty gritty details and the overall picture. As you do the meta review try and explain concepts to yourself in your head. 
Note: I only use this study technique for very difficult or important classes as it is somewhat labor intensive and takes up a bit of time. 

Study tip 4: Go to class, oftentimes a profesor will point out things they want you to pay close attention to or that they think is important, remember you are not only taking X course, you are taking X course with your specific professor.... simply knowing the material is not enough, you must also know what your professor wants of you.

Study tip 5: Use rate my professor.
When possible use rate my profesor to find professors that have positive reviews. Sometimes bad professors are unavoidable, but don’t make your life any harder than it is by getting someone who doesn’t know how to teach to their strengths.

Study tip 6: Form a study group and take turns attempting to teach each other sections of the material. Teaching a subject is the best way to learn it, I have used this technique to great effect with my fellow study partners. I also found this very helpful for concept heavy classes such as organic chemistry and parts of Biochemistry.

Study tip 7: Be proactive, do not wait until the last minute to turn in an assignment, turn it in days or weeks before if possible. Last minute deadlines can cause unnecessary stress and can be annoying if something else comes up. Do yourself a favor and don’t procrastinate.

Study tip 8: Utilize your time efficiently. If you find that you spend a lot of time on your phone or watching TV at a certain time of the day, utilize this time to instead go over some material or get some EC’s, Research, etc. done. This will give you more time to be productive during the day. Additionally, try and give the appropriate amount of time during the week to classes you find difficult and less time to those you find easy or do well in. Do not spend too much time on classes that you don’t need to.

Study tip 9: OVER-PREPARE for the first test. You don’t know how hard a class really is until you are tested on the material. Over study for the first test so that you do well in it. After this point you should have a slight grasp on your abilities and can make a judgement as to how much time is appropriate to get the grade you want on the next test. 

Study tip 10: Go to office hours, these times are invaluable as you can get one on one instruction with either your TAs or Professors. Not only is this good for getting them to know you and perhaps writing good recommendation letters, but it can also give you a leg up in knowing what material they’ll likely test you on or what they want you to focus on. Remember, like I said, you are not only taking X class you are taking X class with a specific professor. The professor is a huge component in the success you may have in a class. Knowing your professor and what they expect from you is an invaluable piece of information.

Study tip 11: For math and physics classes do NOT simply read slides. This will not help. You MUST do practice problems in order to get familiar with the material. There is no other way to learn math other than practice.

Study tip 12: If you do not understand a concept ask for help from your professor or try and find the answer utilizing resources such as your textbook, online databases, or YouTube/Reddit.

Study tip 13: The night before a big exam, go over the information in your head. I don’t know how this works for me but it just does, somehow I manage to capture very specific information while doing this. It might not work for everyone but go ahead and give it a shot and see if it works.

Study tip 14: Study in the library, there will be less distractions and you will feel more productive.

Study tip 15: DO NOT do all nighters, they are the byproduct of under preparation . There is never a reason to do one.

Study tip 16: Look at homework as a learning opportunity not simply an assignment. I can’t even count the times that homework questions have appeared in an altered form within my exams. 

Study tip 17: don’t be afraid of utilizing free tutoring services from your institution.

Study tip 18: Finally, as a last piece of advice, don’t place so much validation or importance on a three digit number. Yes it is important, but ones mental and physical health comes first. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, give your head a break. You are not defined by a three digit number. Do the best you can and you’ll go far.

Why are you here? Why didn’t you write any papers? What would better motivate you?


Edit: was not expecting this large of a response!

All I want to say is, thanks. I understand college is hard. It was for me at times. Very much so. I’ve been through the mental health ringer, health events, family crises, and had it derail school. I failed classes, hit academic probation, but eventually bounced back and am now a professor. 

It’s not perfect, but I do encourage you to reach out to your profs when things go south. Some are more receptive than others. I generally accommodate these things. The counseling/mental health centers and academic advisers can sometimes be helpful advocates too. The earlier you reach out the better. 

Also, if you have ideas, let me know what we can do better. I hate knowing students are flying under the radar with this, when I’m more than willing to help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eal8ly/not_judging_i_just_need_to_know_why_would_someone/,1423,. ,2019-12-14 15:47:54

College just doesn't feel like ""school"" anymore, but more a means to get a degree and then get a job from it. Yes, I love my major and I am very excited to get a career in it, but I also feel like most of what I am learning will end up being useless for whatever job I end up in. My internship this summer has shown me that's the case as of right now.

I don't go to college anymore to learn and understand things, because so much more emphasis is put on short-term understanding for a grade rather than long-term understanding and application for a career. Its just frustrating and disheartening in a way. There are definitely parts of attending university that I find really rewarding and great like social circles and the ability to pursue whatever you want in life, but at its core it should be about education, and it doesn't feel like it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cerv84/does_anyone_else_feel_like_college_is_a_means_to/,1399,"No, although I feel like this perspective is becoming more common and I believe its partway responsible for an increase in anxiety and depression amongst college students. 

>long-term understanding and application for a career.

This is what I'm talking about. College, specifically non-technical/professional/vocational college, have NEVER been abut long-term understanding and career application. Because there is no such thing as long-term understanding in careers unless you are in research! Business and the nature of jobs change to rapidly and randomly that you can't learn long term stuff in a single class. Long term learnings come from your ability to look between all the different classes you take and draw connections between them to create a system of relationships and learning that you can successfully navigate in the future to solve new unique problems.

All y'all need to do with orientation is:

1. Grin and bear it. I know it's stupid. There are a bunch of people in charge who have no idea what a good time looks like. Many of them are parents with kids 7 years younger than you, and they seem to think what their 11 year old finds fun is a good idea for you. Sound like what you experienced today? They do all this to make the main purpose (unsuccessfully) more palatable:

2. Get what you need out of it. Walk around with your group and get acquainted with where you will be spending the next few years of your life. Ask questions when you can if you have them (and you should). Ask how long it takes to get from your first class to your second class on the other side of campus. Ask about what you need to know about parking your first few weeks (it will be terrible). Get familiar with how the rooms feel. Are they cold? Bring a hoodie your first day. Are they burning up? Still bring a hoodie, they may crank the AC. Ask the hours at the gym. If they don't mention a campus app, ask about it. 

3. Everyone was there today for #2. You are as likely to make awesome friends during orientation as you are in the line at a  Starbucks you visited once. It's possible, but unlikely. People are too focused on #2 and being forced to do #1. Time for interactions will come soon. ",2019-07-26 01:30:51

 I'm 22 and about start uni (again). I've been struggling lately with feeling as though I'm ""a step behind."" I'll graduate by the time I'm 24-25. Given the time of year it is, I've been seeing so many pictures of people graduating who are my age or just slightly older and it's been getting to me. I've had some very cool life experiences during the past few years so I don't regret not taking the more traditional path but it makes me self-conscious sometimes to see all my friends graduating while I'm just starting school back up. So, what age did you guys graduate at (undergrad)? Anybody in a similar situation? 

Also, how many people who either are around my age (or when you were in your early 20s) know/knew what it is you wanted to do with your life? Some people seem to know exactly what it is they want to do, and sometimes talking with those kinds of people makes me feel like I have should have already figured that out by now.

\*extra time on exams

\*a note-taker

\*recordings of lectures

\*reduced weight on public speaking assignments (because of the stutter)

&#x200B;

I have a professor who has completely refused to accommodate this. No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because ""your notes should be your own"". No recordings of lectures because ""I don't want to be put on Youtube"". No reduced weight on public speaking because ""your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack"". 

&#x200B;

So, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter.

* Can you drop the class? - No it's too late
* Will the grade be curved? - Not according to the syllabus
* Its just a C! get over it - I can't accept anything lower than a B or it will tank my gpa
* How would getting a D help? - If I get a D I will be allowed to retake the class for a better grade
* Just accept the C. - I need a specific gpa for my graduate program which I can achieve if I retake this class and get a B

Upon viewing the apartment, they informed me about it and made a whole fuss about downplaying it, telling me ""ooh its only a little bit and at night, to sleep better"". I don't smoke weed, tobacco or anything else, don't drink or do drugs, but I agreed to this because they generally seemed nice and, as a foreign student, I didn't have many other options. I also get my own room so I figured I'd always have some smoke-free space behind the door if I needed.

One and a half months after moving in, I can say that, even if I don't really know what is considered ""a little bit"" among smokers, it's pretty much frustrating to me; they don't mind doing it in the shared space, during any part of the day if they feel like it, or if they have some friends over (of which I am almost never informed in advance). They also light up these aromatic sticks and do not seem to think that these strong smells could be a bad thing for anyone in the vicinity. They almost never smoke in their room, and if they did, it wouldn't make much difference since it's not technically separated by a proper wall (it's like a big balcony over common area). Usually I think of myself as having a weak sense of smell, but this shit is messing with my work badly.

735,c9lyml,False,,21,The school I was set to transfer to this fall canceled my offer of admission,college,"As mentioned in the title, I was finally going to transfer to a four year this fall after spending 3 years at a CC in California. If you guys aren't familiar with how CC to four year transfer works, you need to have completed a minimum of 60 IGETC units to be able to transfer.

Spring 2019 was supposed to be my last semester, however something really bad happened to me during the last two weeks of classes. I was sent to the ER with really bad pains in my feet and hands, turns out I was diagnosed with a highly contagious disease and prevented me from going anywhere. Because of this I reached out to all my professors right away to make arrangements on what I could do in regards to me being unable to set foot on campus to take my finals. Luckily I was was able to work something out with 2 out of 3 of my professors and passed both of those. However, my bio professor never got back to me, even after countless emails and phone calls to his office. Long story short: he gave me an F and I was scared shitless so I reached out to my new college ASAP.

&#x200B;

I informed them about the whole situation and asked what I needed to do so that my admission offer would stay in tact. The told me to contact them right away with unofficial transcripts and a letter of explanation. I explained the whole situation with the medical problem and unresponsive professor. Even after all that they said because of the missing credits from the bio class, they have to cancel my offer of admission. Ever since then I've honestly been really down and can feel my depression coming back despite my efforts of staying positive.

&#x200B;

So I reached out to the dean of natural sciences at my CC and basically snitched on my professor for not responding to students and for giving me an inaccurate grade because of my medical situation. An administrative assistant got back to me and informed me that because of the 4th of July they won't get back to me until Monday but she told me that she informed the dean right away to get a hold of this professor to see if they could change the status of the class to incomplete or get a grade change for me.

&#x200B;

Now my question is, has this happened to anyone before? If so what happened in your situation? If I got a grade change and contacted the university, could they reinstate my offer of admission? Because I honestly don't want to wait another year and reapply to universities all over again. As a first-gen, my family is all really psyched for me to be finally going to a university and so am I. But if I don't end up going to university this fall, I'll have to wait a whole year and I really don't want to waste anymore time. Please offer my any advice, because I'm deadass terrified.

&#x200B;

Edit: Professor never responded, dean & department sided with him. I am now waiting a whole year to be able to transfer, thanks to this stupid professor.

Edit: He didn't respond or seem to care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ekfbwy/should_i_tell_my_professor_im_homeless/,829,"In general, you do not want to tell people you're homeless just to elicit sympathy.

If you have specific needs, then you might want to discuss it with your professor. For example, let's say your professor normally assigns homework Tuesday evening and expects it done Wednesday morning. You could go to them and explain that your only access to computers is during daylight hours at the library, so the schedule doesn't work for you - for example, if you could get the homework early, you'd be willing to turn it early.

However, 'homelessness' isn't really a disability he can accommodate. While homelessness does cause stress, it doesn't inherently interfere with your studies. Indeed, a fair number of homeless people specifically go back to school because it's something useful they can do to reconnect into society while still being homeless.

Also, you mentioned using your savings. If you're homeless, you should also certainly qualify for Pell Grants and subsidized loans. While this can impose certain requirements on the rate at which you take classes, you should maximize your use of these sources before you raid your other funds. ",2020-01-05 16:41:08

I have classes I like and I feel like I'm doing my work and I'm not stressed academically. I also have a good friend group at school. However, I just feel like I lost a piece of myself since coming to college?

I was very passionate about certain things before college, but my passion has almost completely went away. I don't have a problem motivating myself to do my work and I finish them on time, but when I don't feel passionate? I just do the work to do it and I don't feel like I'm getting at better or anything. I also struggle getting the drive and energy to do hobbies. I either just lie in bed or chill with friends when I'm not doing hw, which isn't bad, but I feel like I should also be taking care of my hobbies since it was something I cared so much about before. Not sure if that makes sense, but its been on my mind a lot.

Edit: I didn't expect this to get this many comments and I appreciate what was said. I think despite my great friend group I feel like I'm not ready to spill these emotions about my lack of sense of self to them. And it would feel weird talking to friends from high school, despite still being very close, because they are so far away and doing such different things. I only have my boyfriend who I went to high school with and a close RA on campus to talk to about these problems I feel. I think being over a 1000 miles away from home magnified this disconnect I feel with my home and life before college. My hobbies are also related to the arts which I feel like are taken less seriously.

76,fh6l6f,False,,92,Some tips for online classes,college,"I saw a lot of stuff on r/college lately from students who have not taken online classes before. Since I teach both online and face-to-face (and have for some time) I thought I'd share some of the tips (and other considerations) with regard to online classes.

Tips:

1. First and foremost, it is WAY easier to skip the work when it's online. I plan on having asynchronous lectures for my switch over to online, but even for those faculty hosting live lectures, it will be much tougher to focus. Try to set up an environment where you can stay focused. Wear actual clothes, get your coffee, act like you would if you were in a face-to-face class so your brain doesn't try to switch into ""relax"" mode on you. Try to watch the videos/lectures around the same time your class would have met since you are already in the routine for it.

2. Take notes like you would in a regular class. Again, when it's online (especially recorded) it might feel silly to take notes. But notes help you learn, face-to-face or otherwise.

3. PARTICIPATE! You will not get to hear other students' questions as much (if at all, depending on the format). There is not really an easy way to do discussions so the more you make an effort to participate, the more everyone will get out of it. If you have questions on the material, for the love of God make sure you ask them because no one else is going to ask them for you as often happens in traditional classes.

4. Exams are probably going to be different. You might get a prof that just throws the multiple choice exam online, but most are aware that it is so easy to cheat online that they will format online exams differently. You will see lots more randomization of questions, question order, and answer choice order. You might see online proctor services like Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor that literally lock you out of everything but the exam and then record you taking it via webcam. You might end up getting an open book exam that is much more difficult.

5. Usually, you'd be in class about 2.5 hours a week and (hopefully) studying and doing some assignments on top of that. You should keep with that pattern. Assume it'll take you ~2.5 hours just to go through all the learning content. I think a lot of students just erase the class time from their brain and try to just rush through everything, which would not be possible in a face-to-face. This is another way that setting up a ""class time"" for yourself can really help.

6. Editing to add this one: Every prof is going to do this differently. Some might livestream lectures, some might record them, some might not lecture at all. It is really important you keep an eye on your emails, check your notification settings on Canvas/Blackboard/whatever, and get comfortable with 4 or 5 slightly different versions of this.

The best way I can sum this up is that in a traditional class you are often or at least often can get away with being a passive consumer of the content. In an online class you have to be more of an active participant in your own learning. 

Other considerations:

1. Many--MANY--of your professors hate teaching online and have no idea how to do it right. They have never had to before. It is not as simple or easy as it might seem to design a good online learning experience and many faculty have no experience with it and no time to learn. We are all dealing with this change, so try to be patient the best you can. 

2. Be open-minded. I teach a topic that can be put online pretty easily, but I have no clue how you would put a chem lab or an acting class online. And neither do a lot of faculty. This will be testing the creativity of many professors. Every course has learning objectives you are expected to be assessed on, and they will have to find a way to do that.

3. Technical issues are going to be rampant, both because of the pressure put on the learning management systems and because of instructor incompetence + poor user interfaces. Don't start stuff at the last minute. It's not a good idea in general but you run the risk of technical issues preventing you from finishing. Your professors are not tech support either and chances are they have no clue what's wrong. You should probably contact your campus tech support folks for help, not your professor, unless you're sure it's something wrong on their end.

4. Editing to add: Everything is going to be just fine. It's going to be weird. It's going to be an adjustment. But ultimately if you pay attention to your profs and keep up with the work this will just have been an inconvenience in the end.

504,fo82p4,False,,53,Fake Honor Society Scams PSA and how to get REVENGE,college," Hello everyone, welcome to my Ted Talk. Today I want to educate you on fake scholarship/honor society scams and how we can get back at them for preying on college students. I have been getting letters from honor societies praising me with very generic statements that could apply to nearly every college student. (“This is a rare honor! Only 10% of first and second-year students nationwide have been invited to participate.”) Lies. If they have your information, you will get an invitation. These societies list their “exclusive resources”, like eligibility for more than $1 MILLION in college scholarships, expanding your network, growing leadership skills, making a difference in the world (?) and SO MUCH MORE! All of these “exclusive opportunities” can be found for free by clicking around the internet for a few minutes or accessing free resources from your school or joining student organizations. And of course, they offer the ability to put their society on your resume for future employers or grad school admissions to see. I can’t vouch for them for how these look on a resume, but if I was the one reviewing it, I wouldn’t take it to be a positive thing. 

These scams are meant to manipulate college students into paying their membership fees (usually upwards of $90). If they send out 50 letters to students for $50 and just one of them sends the membership fee back in the enclosed envelope, they are making an easy $40 profit off of an already struggling college student. It’s so morally corrupt, and I hope you agree with me when I say that we should fight back.

If you feel confident enough, pack whatever papers you can fit back inside the envelope and leave it out for your mail carrier to take. This will force them to pay the extra fee for the extra weight you added. Remove any evidence of your identity from the envelope or the papers you stick back into it. Some letters have “personalized codes” for their websites to log into, make sure you don’t send those back. There isn’t much they could do to get back at you, but don’t let them know who you are anyway. Do not tape the business reply card onto a bigger package, brick, etc. or they will be treated as nonmailable and will not be sent. Make sure everything you add can fit into the provided reply mail envelope to ensure they will pay the cost of the extra weight. I typically can fit up to 5 ounces in a small reply envelope and up to 9 ounces in a long envelope. Even if you don’t stick 5 ounces in there, if you simply send them back the materials they sent you, they will be paying twice as much for your denial of their invitation. If 10 out of the 50 people they send a letter to do this, they will be making much less profit and will find it less worthwhile to scam college students out of their money. 

More information on that:

I hope this helped you, and if it did, consider sending a fat envelope back to the next fake scammer honor society that sends a letter to you. If you have anything to add to this or experiences you can share, feel free to contribute in the comments. 

TLDR; If you get a letter in the mail from an honor society, look up their name to see if they are a scam before sending back any registration fee.

Unless if you are working, try not to schedule your classes all on the same days, especially your first year. The reason being is you're gonna wanna skip, and when you do skip you'll find yourself skipping ALL the courses. Scheduling two courses a day gives you an even flow for college with breaks in between. 
2. Understand how your classes work and how YOU work. Some classes mark participation points and can take a heavy toll on your grade. Other classes don't count participation but offer a lot of material. Use these to your advantage and make sure when you skip classes you know the repercussions. 
3. You're gonna be tempted to eat at the dining hall everyday and drink all the soda from the soda fountain, but pace yourself. Its not healthy to live on soft drinks and pizza. GET A MINI FRIDGE. PUT SOME SALADS IN IT. BUY FUCKING WATER. 
4. Toilet paper is a necessity you won't think about until you run out of it. In the even that you do run out and don't have cash to spare most dorms have a public bathroom in their lobby and usually are accessible at all times. It's a pain in the ass but a good contingency plan 
5. If you're doing horrible in your classes: communicate with your professors early on. Don't just drop the class or continue to flunk. Usually professors understand that some students are going to have a hard time pacing themselves and are willing to work with you if you reach out to them early on. 
6. If you are in the middle of the semester and you feel like you're going to fail a class, speak with you academic adviser and see if you can take it pass/fail. Usually you need a legitimate reason for this (disability, sickness, financial troubles), but showing your academic adviser that you're serious about your goals will make them more willing to help you
7. Remember not everyone has the stereotypical college experience as you see in movies and TV, and that not every college experience is the same. Personally I had to take breaks in between semesters, transfer my courses to a different university, change majors a few times, take part time courses, take summer courses, work part time and go to school full time, and work full time and go to school full time. College should be taken at your own pace based on YOUR needs. If you can't afford it, its okay to take a break and work to save up the money. If you realize you aren't in the right path, its OK to change majors.

I’m going to a private school in the south that’s largely composed of rich white people, so the culture here is obviously a certain way. I’m not blaming anyone for there being a lack of diversity on campus but I grew up in a decent sized city close to the small town where my college is located and was raised in public school around people from many different backgrounds. I went to an elementary school next door to an apartment complex for first-generation immigrants, so all my life I’ve been around people of different colors, religions, and financial backgrounds. Here it feels like everyone’s a clone of each other. And I can’t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus. I do volunteer work for an organization that largely serves underprivileged kids and families who tend to live in ethnic or largely African-American neighborhoods so I’ll have a chance to be in that atmosphere at times, but I just feel uncomfortable and swarmed by people who are exactly alike here.

402,bd128e,False,,136,Does anyone else feel like some students make college a lot harder than it really is?,college,"*So before I go further into this post, college can be super challenging and different schools/majors require a different workload.  I understand that college can legitimately be the hardest time of your life.  This purpose of this post is not to attack or single anyone out.  I suffer from several different learning disabilities and have experienced some of the challenges that many students face.*

In high school, I was a C student at best, and honestly, it was touch and go if I would even attend university.  After hearing many horror stories from older students I entered my freshman year terrified. I thought for sure I would fail every class, but I actually found it to be super easy. For the last four semesters, I have faced some challenging times but nothing on the level that other students complain about. I hear these stories about students staying all night for multiple nights during the week, or stories about students having total meltdowns during dead week and I get a bit puzzled. Like I said above these are all very real valid things that occur on college campuses, but I personally feel like some students make it a bit harder for themselves than it has to be. From my experience, I have noticed that even at my (and a lot of my classmates who I have discussed this with)  worst if we apply ourselves most assignments are very manageable. I feel like the elitist stigma we currently have regarding college creates a lot of unneeded anxiety for new students. Throughout high school, we are constantly trained to succeed at standardized tests that require you to over think.  I think this conditioning is extremely dangerous, and that for a large percentage of students overthinking is actually a bigger enemy to their education than even the most challenging of courses. I made a 19 on my ACT and finished high school with a 2.7-ish. I now have a 3.5 in college, and I feel like not being prepped for standardized testing has actually helped me.  My question here is do any of you agree or have similar experiences?  It has been very hard for me to find students who can relate to my experience.

Edit: I think a lot of the negative comments just read the title and nothing else. I want to state once again that elements of college can be overwhelming and challenging. Struggles and break downs are ALL valid.

If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.

I'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.

I immediately emailed my professor asking why I received this grade, a week later he responded that I never handed in the final!

It was a written take home final, I drove all the way to school and turned it in personally to him in his office on the due date, per his instructions. I bet if they checked the cameras they’d see me walking to his office, as I remember the day and time I was there. 

I emailed him back saying I was there and handed it to him personally. And followed up with an attachment of my exam. Honestly this is why all professors should utilize online submission 🙄

226,gft0ne,False,,261,13 minute finals,college,"Hey all. I seriously need feedback on this. For 2 of my classes with the same professor, our finals worth 40% of our grade will be online. 13 minutes, that's it. You don't get to see every single problem in one go - you can only see them as you take the exam (so you do question 1, then question 2, etc). So if you trip up on #1, you can't spend more time thinking. IDK how anyone can even \*think\* per question. There's 10 questions. They're multiple choice, true/false but half the questions are paragraphs long based on the midterm of the same format. (Not exaggerating, I saved the exam when I got my instant grade, and the ""10 questions"" were more than 3 pages single-spaced.) Prof. said finals is same thing so I'm going to be presumptuous and say we'll have paragraphs long questions on the 13-minute finals as well.

Is this even rational? When I took the midterm, I was 2 minutes in when my internet was \*\*\*\*\*\*\* up and then I lost 4 minutes to the exam. BAM, I failed the exam because I couldn't even get to question 5. How was I supposed to think through any of the questions when I have 4 minutes to do a bunch of other questions? The midterm average among 80 students was a 30/100. The professor \*graciously\* said our midterm can be worth nothing and our finals worth 40%, depending on how well we do. (Originally each was worth 20%.) Well, the finals is the same format, and I'm annoyed. I am more scared about my internet disconnecting than me not knowing the answer. I literally don't even want to start the exam because my internet hasn't been stable for the past 60 days, just like every other American. I can't even sit through a 50-minute Zoom without disconnecting every minute. What's up with this professor? I've raised this issue with her before, she either misinterpreted me or was a d\*\*\* and said, ""I can't just accommodate you or else I'll have to accommodate everyone else."" I'm baffled because I'm positive out of her 160 students total (in both classes), there's at least 50 of us going through hell.

Please let me know what you think - I'm seconds away from raising this to higher ups but I want some rationalization of why a final worth 40% with 10 questions only allows 13 minutes. If we could see all the questions at once, I would say it's a little bit ""better"" b/c we can do what we know and think about the hard ones last. But that's not the case. I don't even know how any of this is feasible when this reddit post absolutely undermines other factors of my life tht are f\*\*\*\*\* up such as having to be home 24/7 with an abusive family. This is ridiculous. Someone enlighten me. Let me know if you're confused on why I am complaining b/c I am thoroughly annoyed with my school and don't know how to write, talk, w/e. This is the 1,000,001th time I've complained in the last 60 days.

edit 5/19: thank you for everyone's comments! Wanted to say that I scored above the curve for both finals, so I should still be getting my A's at the end of all this. No - the 13 minutes never got changed. The finals did become 20% rather than 40% though. President, 2 deans, 4 chairs - nothing was done.

602,f3txef,False,Global,95,Academic Dishonesty - Somewhat a cultural thing?,college,"This is inspired by a post from like 9 hours ago, in which some people voiced the opinion, that studying with the same test bank (which includes the answers) that the professor gets all their quiz and exam questions from, would be considered cheating/academic dishonesty.

I am very careful when it comes to plagiarism, checking everything a thousand times to make sure I cited everything correctly and didn't for some dumb reason forget a footnote somewhere. So, I would generally consider myself (academically) an honest person.


However, I've used exams from a prior year to help me study for upcoming exams (they're available through student unions), some of those were almost identical to those I had to take - which in two cases I had actually been given a heads up for by older students.

I had an oral exam and right after leaving the examination I jotted down all the questions I could remember having been asked and forwarded those to my friends who have to take the same exam (and to another girl who asked me to).

I had to take a test later than everyone else in class because of a stay abroad and a friend of mine send me an approximate overview of the questions in the test. Those were the same questions I got, two months later. I had, before going abroad, even offered my professor to take the test before I would leave and he responded that he'd rather have one person in class knowing all the questions beforehand than having everyone else know.

So, apparently in my country or at least at my university it seems pretty standard to profit off of other students sharing their knowledge and professors being too lazy to change up the questions. Even professors obviously know about it. It's not considered academically dishonest here.

Is it different for you in whatever country you're going to university? Would any/all of my examples be considered academically dishonest?

She never goes to class and doesn’t have a car or job so she is in the room 24/7 almost. She is not paying the school any money because FAFSA denied her since she failed last semester and is failing this one. It makes me so upset she is here. I am a nursing student and I work up to 35 hours a week as a nurse’s assistant. I have lots of late nights and early mornings and sometimes I do not sleep for over 24 hours because I work two part time jobs. My sleep is so important to me. She is constantly going in and out of the room from 10pm - 4 am. She has had multiple boys over in the room without warning me and I feel very uncomfortable because they come in at 2 am when I’m asleep and I get woken up by them. I often sleep in a nightshirt and I can’t even get up to go to the bathroom because I don’t want the guy to see my in my nightshirt, maybe I am just bashful I don’t know. She sleeps with the TV very loud on after I asked her to turn it down and I physically went over and turned it down because she’s not even watching it I thought she was asleep. She often leaves the door unlocked and does not take her keys and asks me to leave it unlocked.

Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how “gracious” he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general.

If not shut down, they will do it to another prof and the whole atmosphere at the college becomes negative and students think complaining and pressuring get results they want. It can cross over into outright bullying and harassment of profs very quickly. The prof should not need to put up with such pressure from students. It’s fair and wise for the prof to expose the baselessness of the whining. You are not coddled in college.

277,dmke0r,False,,69,Am I crazy for thinking my roommate's behavior is unacceptable?,college,"*Please read the whole story if you can, but if not there is a TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you*


I go to a small Liberal Arts College in the US, and I was born and raised in the US. My roommate is an international student from literally the opposite side of the globe, and this is his first time in the US. We've been in school for just over 2 months now, and some things he does has started to get on my nerves. I understand a lot of the complaints I will layout seem egregious, or even ridiculous, but I have the mindset that no I will go to great lengths not to inconvenience others and I wish to be treated in at least a similar manner. 

For example, he will often play music or watch videos from his speakers when he has not only earbuds but headphones as well. My headphones aren't great, and I can often hear whatever he is listening too unless I put my own pair on and even then it's not enough. I rarely use speakers, and only ever when the room is vacant. I do this to ensure that others in whichever room I am in, whether it's my dorm or a public location, aren't forced to listen to what I want or cover their ears. 

That entire thing is more of an irritant than anything else, and while there are a few other things he does that cause annoyance (not showering often, not cleaning his half of the room, never doing the trash etc.), I recognize that no-one is going to be perfect and there are certainly much worse behaviors a room-mate could partake in. To deal with much of this, I have begun to do the majority of my studying in vacant classrooms. Furthermore, I almost never come back to the dorm unless absolutely necessary. I'm more of an academic in the sense that I really care about my scholarly work and grades, while he has admitted to me that he really has no goal in college. This establishes that we have fundamentally different objectives in college. 

However, the activity that I have suffered from the most recently seems to cross the line in my opinion, and I'm looking for feedback as my thinking may not be entirely coherent after only 6 hours of sleep in the last 60 hours. I have issues falling asleep (no diagnosis but I reckon I could get it if I discussed it with doctor and psychologist). He has friends from his home country that he enjoys to play online games with, and voice chats with them while he plays. I have no issue with this, a matter of fact I often do myself when I have spare time and my own room (similar train of thought to playing music/videos through speakers with other people around). He does this in our dorm room, which I personally don't enjoy but can tolerate to a degree. There are two major caveats though to this; the first of those being he will play late into the night consistently. The other is that he mostly plays FPS games, and not to stereotype but he often verbally expresses his frustration and sometimes very loudly. 

Storytime (Whoever comments ""Storytime"" first I will guild as a reward for reading this far. Seriously, thank you for reading): This week I had 2 midterms. The first of them was yesterday, and the second was today. The night prior to the first, he wasn't voice chatting but was playing an FPS game. At about 11:30p I turn off the lights as per usual on weeknights, and prior to this, I let him know about my midterms and that I would need to get sleep. He plays with his back to my bed, so the screen is facing me and practically blinds me, so I have to sleep on my left side which is difficult as I am used to the right (idk why, I just am). Not a big deal in itself, but the monitor lights up the wall to my left so there is practically nothing dark in the room unless I cover myself in the blanket, which makes it harder to breathe but at least it's dark. Furthermore, he plays with KBM (Keyboard and Mouse) and while his keyboard is supposedly ""silent"", it's not even close and I can hear it clear as day even when I cover my ears with multiple pillows under the aforementioned blanket. I even had tried putting on my headphones with noise-canceling with nothing playing, and turning my fan on max for white noise and I can still hear not only that, but the rapid clicking of the mouse as well. The cherry on top being when he gets frustrated, he often will speak about as loud as if I was trying to talk to someone across a crowded lunch table. Perhaps not for you dear reader, but for me, it is impossible to sleep when someone shouts various things like ""gay little f** stop camping with the (insert weapon here)!"" or ""That's right you little s***head.""
After asking him to quiet down a little at around 1am (I had been lying in bed on my left side, my blanket and 2 pillows over my ears for an hour and a half at this point) I was miraculously able to fall asleep at around 1:30am or so and get about 5 hours of sleep, along with 15mg of Melatonin. 

Yesterday, after my first midterm, I reminded him that I have my next midterm the following day and again will be going to bed at 11:30p. This time though, in addition to everything he did the previous night, he started voice-chatting his friend and playing games at 9p or so and continued it into the night. At around 12:30a I asked him to quiet down and he said ""Ok"" (He was almost shouting it was so loud). Yet he continues to voice chat, and I cannot fall asleep. I finally muster the courage at around **2:30a** and tell him ""Hey _____, it's literally 2:30a and I have a midterm in just over 5 hours. I am unable to get any sleep right now due to how loud that game is, can you please stop talking?"" I knew the clicking and typing would be somewhat loud, but better than the noise from speaking at least. He said ""Ok"" and **continued to play the game for another 45 minutes**. At the end of his call (I still can't sleep), he told his friend he was going to ""turn off the game because I am inconveniencing my roommate"" which I thought was passive aggressive but I was so tired idek. Either way, it was around 3:30a by the time the laptop and call were shutdown, and the room went dark. 

I slowly, without him noticing, stick my head outside of the oven that is under my blanket to enjoy the dark room when all of a sudden it lights up again! He literally pulled out his phone and started to listen to videos ***through the fucking speakers***. I lose it, because I know there's not a chance I'll fall asleep. I get up without saying a word, put on normal clothes, grab my alarm clock and blanket along with backpack with school supplies, and walk to the class where my midterm is going to be in about 4 hours from that time. I arrive in about 15 mins, and probably fall asleep around 5:30a on the hard-tile floor right next to the door to the classroom.

I've read other stories online, and to me this seems to cross a line. I understand that I'm not the only one living in the room and that I need to be empathetic to his wishes as well, but I absolutely need my sleep before a midterm and I feel as if it's non-negotiable. His lack of support or understanding to me seems entirely apathetic, perhaps even failing to understand why sleep is so important to me before a test (again, he has admitted he doesn't care much at all for academia). I have considered that since he and I were both raised in very different areas that perhaps the customs we were ingrained with are contrasted heavily, and I really want to see the good side of him and ensure that my mind isn't just making him a scapegoat here for my personal issues, hence this thread. If you read this far, thank you so very much and I hope this was somewhat entertaining. All I ask for is advice or just your opinion on the matter. Am I absolutely crazy? Again, only a few hours of sleep in the last 60 hours and I don't function well on low sleep, so if I'm bats*** crazy right now just give it to me straight.

**TL;DR- Roommate partakes in activities late into the night that prevent me from sleeping, and last night continued to do so after I asked him to be quiet multiple times. As a result I walked across campus around 5a to sleep outside the class I had a midterm at 8a. Am I crazy for thinking his behavior is unacceptable?**

Edit: 2 of you said the magic word at the same time, and since I'm too tired to find out who did first you both get gold. Thank you for reading!

Edit 2: 25 minute nap and rip inbox. Thank you very much for all the comments, it means a lot and I read each of them. I have decided to purchase some triple-flange silicone earplugs and a sleep mask, and will have a talk with roommate when he gets back tonight and tell him that after 11:30p on school-nights or unless agreed upon, lights are out in the room and any games will be played outside. If he doesn't agree, or fails to adhere, I'll go to the RA and post an update asking for more advice. Once again, thank you for all the replies it means the world to me.

This is my first class of senior year methodology. Should I go in halfway through the 3-hour class? 

So far I'm thinking: 
I already emailed the teacher as soon as I woke up.Hopefully if I get there before/if the class gets a break I'll talk to the teacher then.




Edit: Thank you for the input everyone!! I stood awkwardly around the half-open door (trying to gauge if I there was a seat in the back I could slip into before entering). The teacher saw me and decided to let everyone out on 5-minute break. I went in and talked to her and she was super nice about it. I don't know if I'll get attendance credit but the information from the first day was worth going late.

695,6xhwtg,False,,629,PSA: The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opens October 1! Post all FAFSA questions here!,college,"The FAFSA for the 2018-2019 school year opened on October 1, 2017. If you plan to attend college during the 2018-2019 school year, you should submit a FAFSA if you are [eligible](https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm) to do so.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If mom/dad has already created an FSA ID (for older siblings), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, 2016 tax information, any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the [FAFSA](https://fafsa.gov/)!
If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Post your questions about the FAFSA only on this thread, so as to avoid clogging the sub with posts. I work in financial aid and I will be happy to help.

**Please reference [last year's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/54mjwp/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20172018_school_year_opens/) before posting-- your question may have been addressed there.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/6xhwtg/psa_the_fafsa_for_the_20182019_school_year_opens/,360,Wish I could get it again but now I make too much so I have to pay for half of my things out of pocket. 😒 ,2017-09-01 22:17:45

I know it’s weird but I’m just trying to know how college people think haha. Thank you!

EDIT** These comments are great, haha thank you all, it makes me feel much better. I grew up feeling left out so I used to try to get nicer clothes because the kids would often “check” or “roast” each other when they wore something that wasn’t Raulph Lauren or those types of shirts. I ended up liking Gap’s quality more than some of those high brands though but I just tried to fit in. I’m glad I’m hearing I can be myself in college, that’s what I’ve been looking for :)

I thought I’d post an update since 1) a lot of y’all said I should, 2) a lot of y’all offered up some advice, and thanks for that!

I ended up going with the mug/candy suggestion. I wish I had taken a picture of the gift before I gave it to him (pretty standard though, a green Christmas mug that I filled with a hot chocolate thing and a handful of loose, wrapped chocolates). I spent well over 30 minutes standing in TJ Maxx trying to decide on which mug to get him (because I’m dumb and indecisive), but I found one that said something about the North Pole or some shit and was a good size to fit treats in.

I also included a little card, basically just saying how much I appreciated his enthusiasm and friendliness, especially since being a student can be really rough sometimes. I didn’t write *too* much because I didn’t wanna pour my heart out and write some long thing about my mental health and the fact this semester has been unbearably hard at times, so I basically just left it at “thanks for being cheerful and making it easier” or whatnot. 

He seemed super delighted and thanked me like a thousand times. I promised I’d continue to stop in next semester and just... thanks y’all. I can be a really anxious person and I overthink things a lot (i.e. spending an ungodly amount of time looking at mugs) and if y’all hadn’t been so encouraging and helpful on my original post, I probably would’ve been too nervous to get and give him a gift.

Thought it'd be nice to consolidate them somewhere. The below list is fairly close to chronological order. I suspect that the shutdowns announced on Monday have essentially forced a lot of colleges' hands into shutting down: any school that hasn't announced a shutdown by the end of today will just look bad. Here's the list of schools so far that have cancelled classes in some major capacity:

Vacate dorms means the school has asked all students to move out of dorms. Extended means the school had originally announced cancellations, but added more dates or restrictions following it.

I've seen tons of reviews that say things like ""this professor's class was really easy but I learned nothing"" or ""this professor's class was really hard but they were very helpful and got me through it"". Of course there are some dumb reviews (mostly from people that just complain about having to do work) but those can be ignored. In my opinion, it's not that hard to tell whether a review is worth taking into consideration or not.

834,881dll,False,,11,The study strategy I used to succeed in Grad school,college,"A recent grad student, I used the following technique to learn fast and study much more effectively. I wanted to share this strategy with others who are going into exam season :)

The Feynman technique was developed by Richard Feynman, a Nobel prize-winning physicist known as the great explainer. The Feynman technique is a mental model that allows average people with little knowledge in a subject to understand it quickly and retain their newly acquired knowledge. Richard Feynman was not born a genius or even with a higher than average IQ and in fact he was quoted saying “I was just a normal person who studied hard”. While Richard as an individual was average, his ability to clearly explain difficult and complex topics was far beyond average. This learning technique was the foundation for his greatness and something you should learn if you want to become more efficient when gaining knowledge.

In this article, I will explain the Feynman technique, which you can use to:

• Understand ideas that you don’t really “get”
• Remember ideas that you can understand but forget on tests
• Minimize your study time by learning and mastering information in less than 20 minutes and retaining this information for years to come!

Now, let’s look at the four steps of the Feynman Technique:

► Pick a topic and start studying
The first step in this technique is to pick a topic and begin to write down everything you know about the topic. As you continue your studies, you must add the new pieces of knowledge to your page and eventually you will begin to have a good listing of all the ideas that relate to your topic of interest.

► Pretend to teach your topic
It has been said that you don’t really understand a topic until you can teach it. Teaching the material you are trying to learn has two benefits. Firstly, it forces you to simplify the ideas you are trying to comprehend since you cannot relay the concepts to another person word for word. Secondly, when you attempt to relay the newly learned information to another individual you are better able to gauge your level of understanding and find holes in your comprehension. If you do find weaknesses in your understanding you can then move onto step number 3.

► Improve your areas of weakness
Identifying weaknesses in your comprehension is essential to mastering a subject. While teaching the material, jot down your areas of weakness and refer back to your materials to fill in the gaps. Once you have reviewed your shortfalls you can then take another attempt at teaching them until they become engrained in your mind.

► Simply and analogize
To move along your mastering of the new subject, you should be trying to simplify the content you are learning. The more you can distill complex concepts, the easier it will be for you to keep the ideas straight in your mind. Furthermore, if you can keep things simple, you will have an easier time explaining the topic to others as they will lack the insight that you’ve amassed over time. This simplification step allows you to retain the information in the long term as the content will not weigh as heavy in your mind as you will have it understood at the most refined level avoiding the annoyance of learning material only to forget it days later.

448,g9nycy,False,USA,46,Professor not answering any emails for over a month,college,"I’m in an audit class where 30% of the grade was a group project. Ever since quarantine started I’ve been trying to get my group mates to work on this project but my messages have been met with silence. Even before, one of them contributed nothing at all. So I desperately need my professor to assign an alternative solo project. One of my friends is in the exact same boat, MIA and unresponsive group mates. He said he’s been emailing the professor for 5 weeks now and to let him know if she ever replies to me. 

I first emailed her April 15, explaining my situation. But of course, I did not receive a reply.  I went on blackboard and left a message for her in the discussion board where i saw another student telling her to check her emails. Then i checked my syllabus and realized she had another email. So I emailed her at that address on April 23. On that same day I decided to also email the chair of the department who’s also a professor of mine this semester. The next day the chair replies and says he was just in a meeting with her and that he knows she’s okay so he’s going to forward my email to her. Still no reply. 

She even uploaded an “attendance” to blackboard and I filled it out telling her to contact me back. She sent out an announcement saying she’s been taking online classes to learn how to teach online for the past 2 weeks and that she’s going to hopefully get back to what we’ve been emailing her about soon. There’s 3 weeks left of the semester. I really don’t know why she felt like she needed to learn how to teach. We don’t have any live lessons with her because she “hates the way she sounds on camera” so she uploads random notes every 2-3 weeks and we’re supposed to learn that way. 

I’ve been so stressed and anxious because this is my last semester and I’m about to fail a class because my professor won’t reply to her emails and assign an alternative solo project. Last night I drafted another email wherein i included my first 2 emails with time stamp and I sent it to both of her addresses and copied the chair of the department and the dean of the business school. The chair replied saying “I’m rying to get in contact with her...” 

I really don’t know what to do anymore and what can be done if i do fail this course. I’m at my wits end and is starting to wonder if I should call a lawyer in case of the worst possible scenario...

Please let me know if you guys have experienced anything similar and what I should do. Thank you :(

EDIT: so copying the dean of the business school really did wonders for me.

Two other students in my class even commented on it to me, so they've noticed it too (although they find it funny).  I am the only student he calls on (when I don't have my hand raised) and he seems to take joy in humiliating me when I don't know the answer (in a lighthearted way, but it's still embarrassing)

I lost eligibility for financial aid but they let me do a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal (SAP) which is basically like a probation to regain elgibiltiy:I had to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.0 and pass 75% of the attempted units.

But I ended up not passing the probation. Last Fall 2019 I took 12 units (7 classes) and didn't pass 2 classes (4 units failed). Depression got worse during that time, abusive family situation got worse, my therapist quit and I was stuck with intern therapists that didn't help much, and the new meds I was taking had severe drowsiness side effects and I was hella tired all the time. But it's still on me and I fucked up bad.

This means I'm going to lose my future financial aid and if I want to continue college for another 2 years to be a music teacher, I'm gonna have to pay $3500 semester tuition out of pocket in monthly payments. I couldn't work in 2019 because I didn't have the mental energy to do so and do school full time unlike previous years where I did work part time and do school. I have no fucking idea how I'm gonna be able to manage to work 20 hours a week to pay $700 of tuition a month and attend school at least part time if I couldn't even do school by itself. My dad who was the income earner of the family recently got kidney dialysis and is currently trying to get disability coverage but for now cannot help with those payments. My grandma who's the owner of the house I live in can't help with money either.

I haven't got any notifcation from the financial aid office yet so I'm going there in person today or tomorrow to see what my options are. I can try asking my assistant dean for help but she probably can't do much and I'm also ashamed to ask for her help after telling her early in the Fall semester that I was confident I could pass all this only to end up eating my words as things got worse.

I feel hopeless, and that there is nothing I can do about it, and I can't drop out of college if I want to become a music teacher. I'm absolutely devastated.

TLDR: failed my probationary semester because severe depression/ptsd and now will lose all my financial aid and don't know how I'm going to pay off semester tuition if I want to continue school for another 2 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/eltgxx/i_need_help_figuring_what_to_do_after_failing_my/,294,"Look into the possibility of having ADHD.

793,8cxa29,False,,48,Does anybody else feel like they are suffocating trying to live in a dorm with another person?,college,"I’m basically 500% done with it. Everytime I’m doing something I want to do alone my roommate walks in. Honestly always at the worst times. My blood pressure literally rises when she comes in the room because she stresses me out. She is very high energy and squeals and giggles a lot and sometimes handling that early in the morning or any other part of the day is hard. She’s also an international student so she doesn’t leave for breaks/weekends. Every waking day is spent with her. 

I like to be alone the majority of the time and dorm life has taken that away from me and put someone I can barely tolerate in its place. I don’t want to be mean to my roommate or anything, and I try to keep it nice and peaceful bc my logic for being annoyed with her is based solely on the fact that she exists. I can’t get away. It’s not escapable and it drives me crazy. I will just be relaxing in the room totally at peace and then she comes in and there goes that. I don’t want her to think I’m leaving the room because of her but when she comes back I have to get out or I’ll go crazy. Phew I just need my peacefulness back and I don’t know how to get it.

I need at least a full week to recharge from having to be around her all the time, and going home doesn’t count because that’s not exactly a vacation either.

150,cug62h,False,USA,86,A Former Student’s Top Tips for College,college,"As a recent graduate and with many people starting college on Monday, I thought I would pass on some tips that helped me throughout my studies. These are some tips I really haven’t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. 

1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. 

I would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. 

2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. 

Put in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. 

3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. 

I didn’t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. 

4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. 

Right before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board 

5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. 

Over the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. 


I hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!


Edit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn’t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.

So here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network.

Whereas the instruction sheet told to do it in Y way. Mind you that we have done experiments in way that are not given in instruction sheets before.

**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered ""top"" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an ""in"" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. 

**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive.

Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, ""yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out."" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.

**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. 

**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.

**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. 

**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. 

 TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the ""real college experience"" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

249,fpyhag,False,USA,197,Coronavirus stimulus does not necessarily exclude college students. You might be able to get money.,college,"I have no legal background at all, but there is a lot of misconceptions going around about the package. That being said, even there is a chance that what I'm saying is incorrect, and if presented with new, correct, information, it will be edited.


**EDIT:** Same info, but more clarifications available at /r/taxes

https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/fq71lw/stimulus_check_faqs_3272020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

**EDIT 2:** For those who are rightfully claimed as dependents, age 17-24, your parents will NOT receive a $500 bonus as you might expect. I urge you to email your senators and representatives, so this does not happen again in the future. I have personally emailed Jim Banks, Todd Young, and my representative in Indiana. Go on their websites, and use their contact forms. Reps and their office will actually read your email (this is their job and it helps their votes). You might think your one email or vote doesn't matter, but it does. It is better to do something than nothing in this scenario.

You may be able to benefit from the stimulus package depending on how you're supposed to file. There are many different news sources outlining the requirements. The absolute best way find out specific requirements would be to wade through the hundreds of pages the bill contains. I have tried, but failed to understand it.

As of now, the New York Times's FAQ has good answers: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html
What is in the bill, is not a partisan issue. Please check multiple sources for the best information. My hope is that people who qualify for the money, will be able to get it, as I personally qualify as a independent filing college student.



**Bill Highlights From NYT**

""**How large would the payments be?**

Most adults would get $1,200, although some would get less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment would be an additional $500.""

**Comment**: This actually does exclude certain college students who are filed as dependents, as your parents won't receive an extra $500. It is under the assumption if your parents provide you with more than 50% of your finances, they will bail you out.

""**Do college students get anything?**

Not if anyone claims them as a dependent on a tax return. Usually, students under age 24 are dependents in the eyes of the taxing authorities **if a parent pays for at least half of their expenses.**""

**Comment:** If your parents do not pay for at least half of your expenses/aid you with financial needs, do not allow them to claim you as a dependent. It is a very common practice for parents to claim you as a dependent, even when they should not. It is my understanding that some parents who do not provide financially for their children will do this so they can get much more money. Doing so is tax fraud. 

The net gain of them for them claiming you as a dependent through tax credit is often much higher than you would get by filing independently. So, if you have a good relationship with your parents, and they support you, do not file as independent. 

You ay also able to change filing statuses from previous years. FAFSA usually considers you as a dependent in terms of financial aid even if you file as independent with the IRS. This does not disqualify you as long as you file independent with the IRS. For example, I am estranged from my parent, file independent with the IRS, but I still have to submit my parent's taxes for FAFSA.

""**What year’s income should I be looking at?**

2019, if you haven’t prepared a tax return yet, you can use your 2018 return. 

**Comment**: Many sources say 2019 first, and then 2018 if you don't have a 2019.

""**What if my recent income made me ineligible, but I anticipate being eligible because of a loss of income in 2020? Do I get a payment?**

The bill does not help people in that circumstance now, but you may benefit once you file your 2020 taxes. That’s because the payment is technically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year. So it will depend on how much you earn.""

**Comment**: This may be useful info for students who graduated in 2019 and work full-time. Unfortunately, you won't get the check now, but at least you still get it.

But remember to acknowledge how lucky you are to be able to go to college to forward your thinking. The fact that so many of our generation go to college may seem bleak for job security, but remember how amazing it is that we are moving towards an educated society! 

I think back to every day people in the 1800's. There's a meme about a doctor telling someone they have ghost in their blood and to do cocaine. I know it's a joke, but that probably would have made sense to the average every day Joe in that time period. But the forwarding and plethora of educated people has eliminated many of these false understandings. (ex. What causes illness and how to cure it. Technological advancements, etc.)

Education also opens doors. I've met a few special individuals. One of which started out as just a poor black kid from a village in Africa. Through a Christian organization sponsoring him he was able to grow up healthy and educated, and eventually got to go to college. He ended up getting his masters in engineering. Now that poor village black kid makes a lot more money than I probably will and he used that money to help his family village and the Christian organization.

Just remember to pay thanks to the people who give us the privilege to go to college. Try to not take it for granted.

24,h8z2u5,False,USA,485,Stop looking down on people for their choice of major,college," I am tired of people telling me that my major is ""useless"" and that I'll never use it in the real world if I don't go to grad school. I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something ""useless"" or ""easy"" or ""low-paying"" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.

1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the ""useless"" majors have that you could never dream of.
2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others ""wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?"" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can ""just do."" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.
3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.
4. Just because you think your major is ""hard"" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are ""easy."" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called ""easy"" majors.
5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because ""it's going to get me money"" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.
6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.

In conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money.

675,9xxamb,False,USA,106,How do I deal with my envy of the “party life?”,college,"So I’m a freshman and my year’s going pretty well so far, but I’m kind of wondering if I’m following the right path.

I look around at the fraternities and sororities and I see others partying every weekend. There’s also the big football game day where everyone is a fan. I’m torn: on one hand, I know that I dislike just about everything about these things. On the other hand, it seems like everyone else is having more fun than me.

As a bit of background, I’m a kind of introverted person, and have usually made only a few close friends. In high school and now, I hold myself to a pretty strict focus on schoolwork and prefer organized activities to just like “hanging out.” I have never drank or done drugs, and have no desire to do so. I’m not really a spectator sports fan and I also (maybe critically) don’t use Snapchat. Like messaging is fine, but I think snap streaks are stupid, although everyone else seems to network with it.

So basically, I have good reasons to not get involved with partying or anything like that, but I can’t help but feel a little jealous of everyone else who seems to be having more fun. I talk to other kids who seem pretty chill, and hearing them talk about partying and drinking is intriguing to me because it’s such a foreign concept that I’ve never even considered. I still have no desire to drink, Snapchat, “get wasted,” or whatever, but most of the kids my age seem to connect with each other at parties and stuff where that happens.

Bluntly, I’m interested in social action besides the nerds: I’m throughly a nerd and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I’d like to connect with other people too and try different things without getting involved with stupid or illegal activities. I know FOMO but like I do feel like that sometimes. Can anyone else give me any advice? Suggestions? Relatable issue?

Meanwhile I've worked my ass off to get two C's and one B in my 3 pre-calculus classes (business major here on quarter system at my community college, have to take calculus next). I understand the material, and I'm not the WORST test taker, I go to office hours, but math just doesn't come naturally to me. I hate being called ""lazy"" for not acing math. I work hard, I have all A's and B's except for my math classes.

Here's my question:

I took piano lessons for YEARS as a kid (parents forced me to) and I was never a natural at it. I sucked at reading music notes (especially quickly), I struggled with understanding the measure and beats and all that (never understood the difference between 6/8, 3/4, etc.), it took me weeks to play a song with only a few mistakes. *I had NO rhythm.* I was never told that I was ""lazy"" or ""practicing wrong"", people just told me that music wasn't for me.

Why isn't it the same way with math?

edit: Got it. Got your DMs calling me lazy, stupid, etc. I get it, I'm an idiot.

I'm so frustrated. My brother, a software engineer, has said ""I suck at writing/English"" forever, nobody batted an eye. My parents love him, yet hate me.

People say they suck at history, writing, philosophy, drawing, acting, dancing, music... nobody cares. With math? Suddenly, I'm not working hard enough?

But that's not really the case. I would feel fine spending more money if I knew the intrinsic value and return on investment is good on whatever item I am purchasing. As a college freshman who lives in NYC (where everything costs more than usual), I'm trying to become more financially literate and a more frugal person.

I try to eat in my school's cafeteria as much as possible (meal plan). If I do decide to go out to eat, the appetizers are much cheaper than main meals. I would also pay for these meals with a credit card that has 5% cash-back rewards. I also have a stainless steel water bottle that I refill (it saves me roughly \~$100 on plastic water bottles).

I keep the majority of my cash invested in the stock market so that it grows over time. But since it's invested, it's a little harder to get access to it. Therefore, I keep just enough money in my checking account (where my cash is more accessible) just in case I need to make a purchase. My bank rounds up each debit card purchase to the nearest dollar and stores the extra change into a savings account that earns interest on it. I also have a high-yield Roth IRA that I contribute to $100 to every month :)

I'm currently becoming a better student academically so that I can apply for scholarships, grants and other types of financial rewards to help with college tuition (it's roughly \~$10k/year at the school I attend). I currently have subsidized loans, grants and scholarships to aid with college tuition.

To give some idea of how I was raised, my parents (who are now divorced) were lower-middle class when I was a kid. I've learned a lot of lessons on how money works and how I should view it. Over time, one parent climbed the ladder and is now financially very stable and is living comfortably. My other parent is now what society would consider ""middle class"". ",2020-02-09 15:51:04

There is so much reading, there's a whole youtube series of videos to watch that shes done for the ""attendance phrase of the week"",  like 2 different sites to monitor for grades and assignment in addition to the college's, she never responds to emails even about my grades.. it really sucks I'm only 2 semesters from graduating. I tried meeting her in person and emailing her for help but the sessions were ""others have reached out but we will make adjustments."" One of those professors that clearly knows everything, but it's up to you to learn on your own.. whats the point in enrolling then? Exams are meant to ""trick"" you.

Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. 

Fast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now.

346,flvpf0,False,,75,Reflecting on my University years thanks to the Corona Pandemic,college,"I'm in my final year of University, I was just about to write my papers but due to the whole Corona situation school has been closed indefinitely. As I was packing my things getting ready to leave tomorrow I started thinking of the time I've spent in school and one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I didn't make any effort to socialize and get to know people (especially girls).

I didn't have fun or go to parties I just buried my head in my books for four years, before I consoled myself with the fact that these University years are temporary and it's worth sacrificing them for a brighter future. But then it occurred to me ""isn't everything in a way temporary"", there's no time or period in our lives that last forever, life itself doesn't last forever we're just left with memories and the older one gets the faster the years go by.

Then I fantasize about becoming this rich famous person and as a result those who rejected me or treated me badly will regret their actions.Then I realized no one would really give a fuck, sure they will probably tell their friends they knew me but outside of that I will rarely come up in their mind and they will live their lives normally. 

To make things worse I will never be in this kind of environment again with such a high density of young beautiful women I can easily talk to because outside of University it will get harder to meet and talk to new people. It will take some painful and deliberate effort to meet someone and one would probably have to compromise on their standards too because it will feel like you're racing against the clock.

It's not all bad though I'm on a 3.8 CGPA and I have some decent job offers waiting for me when I'm done with University. But I feel like no matter how successful I get in life it won't make up for the fact that I've missed out on so much in my University years. I also fear that going forward most relationships will be transactional as to what can I gain from this person. In personal relationships too in the sense that I'll probably be vetted whether I have a stable income before my personality comes into question. 

I'm not trying to make a point here, I'm not even sure of half of the things I've said, I'm just sad and confused. I have never really had any real life experience or had any sort of fun per say, I've always just been focused on school right from a young age living a sheltered life and I was hoping I could fix that in University but I'm almost done now. I'm scared of what's waiting for me out there. I honestly don't think I'm ready ..fuck I don't know.

Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/flvpf0/reflecting_on_my_university_years_thanks_to_the/,710,"Not the exact same, but kinda similar. I graduated about a year and change ago so take this with a grain of salt but... I get where you're coming from OP. I did clubs, i met friends, i did a lot. But, even then, i spent a lot of it holed up in my room alone, or regretting not doing things.

My advice? I guess, as hard as it may be, be happy for the experiences you have. If you look back at it and keep regretting it, you'll go crazy (iv'e gone slightly crazy). At the end of the day, college is just another part of your life, for better or worse. I think the main lesson learned is live your life fuller. You realize now how yes academics is important but a social life, parties (if youre into them) boyfriend/girlfriends, friends, just hanging out with friends are SO important and what you'll remember when you look back. Dont neglect work or studies, but if anything, put relationships first imo. Also, i saw someone mention doing a ""victory lap"" of an extra semester. Financially, it may be tough, and idk if i can recommend it. But, if you have the funds/are ok with it, i'd say go for it. You do only have these things (college) once. Once it's over, that book is shut.

TLDR: don't waste it, live your life fully, focus on work and studies but make (imo) a bigger focus on relationships and memories. ",2020-03-20 14:14:49

&#x200B;

I have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit.  As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.

&#x200B;

I know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.

&#x200B;

I just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling?

780,5pw4uw,False,,23,Unusually practical guide for college (xpost from /r/applyingtocollege),college,"Hi everyone -- I'm a current college admissions counselor and I posted this on /r/applyingtocollege and was told that this subreddit would probably make use of it as well. So I hope they're right and that this does in some way improve your college life. Because of the nature of that sub it's geared slightly toward newer students, but I'm sure that people currently attending can get something out of it as well.

Here is my ""unusually practical guide for college."" It is arranged in no order at all and was completely improvised this evening. I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that.

770,gv8psc,False,,49,I (19F) no longer wish to study abroad due to a multitude of reasons and want to pursue my dream of studying Psychology at home. My mom and dad feel as if they've failed as parents.,college,"So, I've finished my first year at Uni abroad (King's College London Digital Culture BA if anyone's interested) and have now realized that I don't feel happy or proud of myself in the slightest. It's not that the subject I'm studying is uninteresting or overly complicated; I simply don't feel drawn to it and, because it's so abstract and 'new', I can't see myself pursuing it professionally in the long run. Aside from that, being away from my home country and my loved ones has made me feel the most lost and depressed that I've ever felt, and it has heightened my anxiety issues as well as my eating disorder tendencies.

To give you a bit of background, I have always been the so-called 'perfect' child. Was always kind of a nerd, quiet and studious, got consistently good grades and was constantly told that studying abroad was undoubtedly the only path for me to evolve and grow into a successful and fulfilled person. This became especially prevalent once my parents discovered that my little brother (10) is mildly autistic, which happened when I was 11. From that point on, I always knew that I had to be perfect, I had to make everyone in my family proud. Even though what my family was telling me were essentially huge compliments and encouragements, for me, that translated into so much pressure that I never actually sat and asked myself what I wanted to do, what I envisioned for myself. I've never felt like I excelled at anything in particular academically, but was always encouraged into this creative side of academia because I have a way with words and enjoyed writing short stories, articles and occasionally poetry. I say 'enjoyed' because as you may have already guessed, this hobby of mine turned into something of a chore due to my parents' pressure into doing it. However, I've always known that I'm a huge people person and that I have a complex understanding of people's emotions and reasonings, being able to see beyond the surface and actually helping my friends overcome certain feelings and events. I've always felt as if this was my greatest quality.

These past few weeks I've had time to put things in perspective and I tried to analyze both pros and cons of pursuing this college versus staying home and starting Psychology in September. Given that I've always hid my true feelings from my parents fearing that I would disappoint them, I've had an incredibly difficult time even admitting it to myself that I'm not happy or thriving in my current situation.

Yesterday morning I finally gathered the courage to tell my parents about everything I've been experiencing, from the complete misery of being abroad to my intention of starting Psych at college in my home country. The conversation immediately started off on the wrong foot because my mother, without even trying to listen to what I had to say, got extremely angry and told me that I'm giving up on my dream in order to stay home with my boyfriend of one year (19M) because I fear him breaking up with me, and then telling me that she doesn't think I'm capable of making a decision without thinking about him as the primary factor of influence. Naturally, I was extremely hurt and offended; not only because it felt incredibly belittling, but because she didn't even give me a chance to speak and explain myself. She eventually apologized for this, but I will never forget it and I will surely keep in mind to never, ever tell my future child anything like it. Once I got the chance to tell them everything I've gone through, as well as the fact that I've always felt pressured to be a certain way and achieve the best academic results and performances, they told me that they feel as if they've failed as parents, because they didn't allow me to grow into who I wanted to be or educate me on how to make my own decisions. My mother (who has had issues with depression and has a tendency to be overly dramatic and feel as if everyone's blaming her for everything) said that I was blaming her for my depression, proceeded to have a crying fit and actually fainted. As you can imagine, the conversation ended there.

Currently, everyone's a lot more calm. We've decided that I will spend this summer weighing the pros and cons of each solution, while applying for the second year of student loans as well as applying for Psych here, so that at the end of August I can have both options available and decide what I want to do. I already feel like I'm making the right steps to finally feeling happy and content within myself and having my own dreams and plans as the no. 1 priority, but my parents are (understandably) still quite shocked and skeptical. However, my mom actually suggested that I visit a psychologist friend's office today and learn about how it works, which is an opportunity I'm very grateful for and excited about. I can feel that they both would rather I finish my degree at KCL still, but they seem to have this impression that getting a King's College diploma is hugely prestigious and opens a million doors for the future. Maybe they're right, but I don't want to achieve that at the risk of hating myself forever for not choosing my own happiness. My life here is actually what I want; why would I leave it, knowing that I'm miserable in London?

I hope that they'll eventually come around, but I'm still scared that they'll always feel like I'm a failure or that this is a cop-out. Making them proud is still super important to me, but for the first time in my life I want to put myself first. How do I make them understand that this has been my dream all along and how can I help them overcome the shock and this initial feeling of failing as parents? So far, the only people who've shown me complete, unconditional support (and actually said that they were proud of me) are my boyfriend and my best friend.

Thank you so much for reading and I'm looking forward to hearing your advice :) 

TL;DR I want to quit my college abroad and start studying a completely different subject at home, both because my life abroad is miserable and because the subject I'm currently studying is more my parents' dream rather than my own.

If you didn't talk, you wouldn't earn points for group projects, participation, etc.-- and it would be seen as very odd. Many classes will assign group projects that have to be completed outside of class as well, so students end up meeting in the evenings or whatever.

When I was a student I made friends in my dorm and in classes. At smaller schools (where classes are usually <20) it's commonplace for people to make connections in class since they are working together often. At big schools (classes of 50-500+) it's of course much easier to just sit in back and ignore everyone. But if you never talk to anyone, what do you do if you have to miss class for some reason? Just go without notes? Faculty at my school just say ""Talk to a classmate to see what you missed"" if you were sick or had a conflict. ",2019-05-06 01:22:35

408,f0jb5n,False,USA,5,Locked Out of Dorm Building for 5 Weeks Running,college,"I recently went back to college for some postbacc work and decided to live in the dorms as I never had that experience in my undergrad time. 

Week 1: They told me when I signed up for the dorm, that the system for making ID cards was down and would be back up in a week. As a result, I would not be able to enter or leave the dorm building outside of business hours until the ID system was back up. Ok, seems like that should be something to be fixed faster, but whatever, I don't plan on being out late or super early. 

Week 2: ID card system is back up, I received an ID but they failed to tell me that the system to give people access to my dorm building was down. Maybe one week more until it's up. In the meantime, your Dean has ordered you a mechanical key for the side doors.

Week 3: I run into my Dean, he's surprised the key hasn't been made yet and puts in another request. Housing extends the time for the proxy access system to be back up to two weeks. 

Week 5: Still no key. Door lock timers are horribly timed, 5pm - 10am I cannot leave nor enter the building, and Friday at 12pm till Monday at 10am I am unable to exit or leave. I'm cooped up or locked out entirely on weekends. Housing keeps making excuses, the system won't be working until Spring quarter now, maybe later. Facilities has failed to make a key for four weeks, I've called everyday and asked in person multiple times when the issue will be resolved and they say they can't even find requests. 

Beginning Week 6 (Present): I'm not sure what to do now, I've been getting along, waiting for friends to get out to let me in and out (every entrance is electronically keyed for entry and exit). I've personally spoken with the Housing Director twice, two different Deans multiple times, and the Facilities Managers and not a single person is able to help resolve this problem. 

It snowed recently and was unable to get into my dorm when the door timer switched early and was left outside, no jacket in the snow for 30 minutes with some groceries while waiting for a housing staff to let me in. 

The first couple weeks I could understand the problem and I can spend a couple weekends cooped up, but it's halfway through the quarter and it's frankly getting irritating. 

I've talked to so many people that are literally at the top of the food chain and don't know who else to go to now. Any advice on what steps to take next?

If a company wants you to pay ""onboarding fees"" or wants you to ""invest"" in their products that you are supposed to sell, run away!

Unfortunately, many of us are increasingly desperate for opportunities and lots of scumbags (especially MLMs) are going to try to take advantage of us. If you have no other career-relevant plans for the summer, you are much better off taking summer classes, reaching out to local businesses and offering your services as a remote intern, doing an independent research project, or building a portfolio. Don't get scammed.

Full-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering.

141,hsgk9k,False,,158,"My professor rejected my three-week-long, 32 page, capstone project topic, and told me to restart with 12 hours to spare.",college,"We were assigned a three-week capstone project, in which we are supposed to write in-depth about a local problem. I picked the topic of fake news, specifically regarding  [https://crescentcitytimes.com/](https://crescentcitytimes.com/). If you read the homepage, and maybe like one or two articles you will understand how this is a problem in my community. They write racist news, use clickbait, and spread propaganda.

So my professor tells me my topic is too broad, so I break it down into specific terms and ideas, and apply it to this news source. I even created an interview with someone who was the subject of their fake news.

My professor at this point seems more determined to be correct than to truly understand my goal and tells me I can have an extension but I need to start a new project. Several of the other problems in the community are specifically forbidden, so he tells me to write about my work.

I tell my professor that I, and many other students, are unemployed and our workplaces are permanently shutdown. He tells me that is not a suitable topic either since I no longer work there.

At this point, I've already finished writing a 32-page research project, with five peer-reviewed journals as sources, three government statements, four personal interviews, and a handful of disproven articles to point to. Any scholar would know this isn't something you can just complete in twelve hours.

Even with an extension, truth be told I do not view it as my fault that my topic was rejected. If my professor had graded my assignments sooner, I could've switched topics before completing all this work.

TLDR: My professor didn't grade three weeks worth of capstone work until two days before the final project was due, and is rejecting my final project with 12 hours to spare. This professor was assigned to me due to the overflow of students in the class I signed up for. I do not want to redo the project. I am angry.

So my question is, should I turn in my project knowing full well it will be graded poorly and drop my grade by up to 20%? Do I play along? It's too late to withdraw.

428,am3mp6,False,,42,Can you ask a professor to talk to a student who keeps interrupting class?,college,"In one of my classes, there is a woman I will call Jane. Jane is in her 60s and is attending classes at my university through a program that allows seniors to take courses for free, basically for fun (they can’t earn a degree through this program). It has been my experience that these students tend to be more talkative and less aware of classroom etiquette, which is understandable because they haven’t been in school in a long time. It has never been a problem for me in any other classes. 

Jane is different. She interrupts constantly. Our professor is laid back, he tells lots of jokes and anecdotes and allows open discussion. But she cuts into literally almost every sentence he says, she interrupts other students when they are talking, she completely derails conversations with her own unrelated stories or questions. She makes inappropriate jokes while the professor is trying to teach. She “whispers” very loudly to the students around her during lectures. She’s not being malicious, she just doesn’t seem to understand when it’s not appropriate for her to be talking - she thinks she’s the class clown making everyone laugh with her outbursts and jokes but they usually just make everyone annoyed and uncomfortable (for example, she makes many jokes about finding the young black men in our class to be really hot every time they talk - she’s an old white woman). She’s very disruptive and the class is moving at a snail’s pace mainly due to her interruptions, but shockingly the professor has done nothing other than shoot her annoyed looks from time to time. 

Sorry for the long background, but my question is, would it be wrong for me to ask him to talk to her? She’s not just annoying me, she’s actually hurting our ability to learn in this class. Other students have been complaining about the same things. I’m not saying she shouldn’t be allowed to join discussions or ask questions, I just want him to ask her to tone it down or be more considerate about how much class time she takes up/allowing other students to talk.

The 2020-2021 FAFSA will open October 1, 2019.

First time? Here's what you need to do:

1. Create an [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. This is your legal, electronic signature. You cannot submit the FAFSA without one. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use that one.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

I feel like others can learn from the comments that written emails can be read a lot of different ways and the importance of being clear and concise in the first email.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bgv0o2/were_my_questions_really_that_stupid/,336,"Hi I'm ""professor aged"" (older by a generation, or a gen and a half, than most college students), so here's my take. I think the word perplexed started off the miscommunication. It can be read as rather snarky or challenging (mom to teen ""I'm perplexed why you would walk to school in the rain without an umbrella"" or ""I'm perplexed why you said your homework was done, but then I see a blank page on your desk"").

Also I think the usage of perplexed typically places the confusion it implies with the situation itself, not the person trying to interpret it (the mom isn't really confused about the umbrella/rain, she is questioning the judgement of her son who would go out in the rain like that; the article the student read was *perplexing* not because she didn't understand it, but because the article *itself* was written poorly and was confusing). So, your stating that you were perplexed by the assignment implied that this is happening because it is a bad assignment, and that you are questioning why the professor would give students such (poor, inferior, etc.) work to do. Therefore, it was seen as disrespectful that you a student questioned or demanded justification regarding a professor's assignment.

Try saying sometime ""I find that perplexing"" to someone you care about regarding something they have done, and see if it does not come off as offensive. See?

I know everyone always tells college students to reach out to your professors, that it will work in your favor, but this shows that is not always the case.

Next time, it would be better, if you email a professor, to berate yourself at the beginning of your request for help, to be sure you sound humble and do not sound like you are challenging the professor's authority (I would not give that advice to everyone, but I think in your case, you need it, as maybe communication is not a strong suite of yours). Apologize at least once, and say thank you many times in your email. Also, very clearly state from the get go that it is *you* who does not understand, and perhaps give a reason why you are lacking (as opposed to blaming Prof for a bad assignment).

If you are a freshman or sophomore or new transfer (or part of a special bridge program for veterans or URM or 1st Gen student), identify yourself as such, to make clear to the professor that you are new to college (or this college) and they should not assume you to know everything. Further benefit, this gains their sympathy (,you need to play the game).  

Last, of course, try to use the internet and YouTube tutorials FiRST to figure stuff out on your own! Don't ask dumb questions.  Don't ask for help when it is obvious you could solve it yourself. And yes, there are dumb questions, despite what nice people always say. So maybe just figure it out and don't ask the professor at all

Here's a sample email (version 1, where you plan to go to office hours):

""Dear Prof. ___,

I'm am Joe Shmoe, a freshman student in your ___ class. I'm having a bit of a hard time with the wiki page assignment. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I've never had to make a wiki page before. We didn't do anything like that at my old (high) school (community college)  . 

I've already watched two ""How to Make a Wiki page"" tutorials, but I'm worried I still don't quiet get it. I'm planning on coming to your next office hours on Wednesday at 3pm for more help with my Wiki page. I just wanted to give you some notice, so you would know what I am hoping to get help with. Thank you so much.

Again, I'm so sorry I am not already familiar with creating wiki pages. Thanks in advance for being able to help me.  I really enjoy your class, and have learned so much already!

Kindly,
Joe Shmoe""


Here another example (not going to office hours):

Dear Prof. ___,

I'm am Joe Shmoe, a freshman student in your ___ class. I'm having a bit of a hard time with the wiki page assignment. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I've never had to make a wiki page before. We didn't do anything like that at my old (high) (community college) school. 

I've already watched two ""How to Make a Wiki page"" tutorials, but I'm worried I still don't quiet get it. I'm so sorry this is not coming easily to me.

Is it possible you could email me some pointers or resources for making wiki pages? Or, if you know of an on campus resource for help with things like this, I'd really appreciate it if you could point me in that direction. I could also come by your office of that works better.

I'm so sorry to bother you with this. I was hoping to figure the wiki page thing out on my own, but I'm struggling. Thank you again so much for any help you can provide. I really appreciate it 

I really enjoy your class, and have learned so much already.

Sincerely,
Joe Shmoe""


LASTLY: I think you are probably WAY better at face to face communication than over email. Maybe avoid emailing professor's and instead just show up at office hours. 

Remember, he or she is a professor of _____, not wiki. He/She would love to have students email questions about economic theories (econ prof), math proofs (math prof), inequities in education (teaching college prof), Renaissance poetry (English Lit Prof)...but wiki pages....? These people dedicate their lives to a very niche area of knowledge, and they are passionate about their subject matter. Your professor was perhaps really excited to see an email from from a student (as opposed to all the bureaucratic emails that get in the workplace)...and then to see your question had nothing to do with the content of the class, but just how to make a wiki page? Might have been a let down.

I wish you luck with the rest of your studies.  I hope some of my advice might help you to make improved connections with your professors in the future. ",2019-04-24 14:05:20
272,99trgi,False,,144,How to Make Friends in College/Will I make Friends in College?,college,"So the influx of posts started kind of early this year. The most common topic that has ever been on our subreddit surrounds making friends in college. I wrote up this little guide in hopes it will help some of you. If anyone else has suggestions- please leave them down in the comments below. 


**All posts related to making friends in college will be removed**

Instead- redirect users here or if you have a question post it here. 

**Where did the Back to School Megathread go?**

Is it still [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/92qjfg/back_to_school_megathread/) but I unstickied it because I think this thread is more important. I will add automod config to try to redirect users to this thread if they make posts about making friends and hope it will help much more with subreddit management

**FAQ About Friends in College**


**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**

Okay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!

* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation 

* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. 

* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say ""Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from"" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. 

* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people

**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**

Not to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. 

The main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. 

Also try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! 

**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** 

There are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: 

* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!

* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of ""hiking"" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. 
In any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! 


* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. 

* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like ""Oh hey aren't you in Accounting 101?"". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!


* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). 


* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!

**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** 

Of course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. 

**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**
No, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!

**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**

No. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have 4 years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!

**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** 

No. 

Like I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. 


**Still having trouble making friends?**


**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The 4 years fly by quick. 


**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**


*Yes*: 

* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people 

* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. 

* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those 2 friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. 


* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you 

* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. 





I was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!).

447,ba54ng,False,USA,159,Weed use among students makes me incompatible,college,"This is a problem I've been dealing with for a while now. Although weed was common in highschool, it seems like every single person on campus smokes weed or takes some form of THC. While I've smoked weed before, I disassociate really badly and it isn't a good experience. So I don't smoke, and don't plan on it

Unfortunately, weed culture makes up a lot of what people do socially. This leads to me being an outlier, and being really different from most students. I've struggled to find friends or dates where it doesn't end up with them trying to get high.

At my school, a lot of teaching is done by part-time adjunct professors.  They are not industry professionals looking to teach the next generation of engineers, but mostly people working this job and applying for tenured track positions.  




A lot of the teaching is pretty generic, from information you can easily google, and read right off the powerpoint.  My largest criticism is that none of the professors try connecting the material to modern research, so the entire course feels like reading a bunch of wikipedia articles.

Plenty of time to figure out what you’re doing, don’t need to worry about that yet. Chances are it’ll find you before you need to find it.

Find yourself. Do this by realizing how the world calls you, and thus realizing your values. Try to learn about God, and why it must exist. If you don’t know it must exist, your definition of God is incorrect and/or underdeveloped. Sufficiently defined, questioning “does God exist?” will be even more redundant than the question “do I exist?”. Pantheism is a good starting point.

The above two will help with your depression, probably.

Find hobbies that you enjoy. Best way to do that is to try a bunch of things you may or may not enjoy, and a few things you’re almost certain you won’t enjoy. 

Don’t worry about society or people. Again, they are secondary. First and foremost, develop your self and personality.

690,ev6t97,False,Europe,62,[Italy] Am I too stupid for University?,college,"You must get this a lot, but I'm afraid I might be wasting my parents' money for no good reason... I'll give you as much info as possible because I really do think that I might be walking the wrong path. 

My timeline: I started off as a curious toddler who liked science, read a lot and enjoyed life. 
In middle school, I got into a ""love story"" that distracted me from my studies and I found myself less and less interested in studying; when my parents found out and we were torn apart, I skipped another year of studying because of the Lovesick Spoiled Kid's Depression™. 
In high school, I was diligent throughout the first three years and then got depressed (always tired, couldn't get out of bed, couldn't think clearly, very forgetful and suicidal). I barely got out of there but I wasn't in a great mental state; actually I kept getting worse. 
I dragged myself to University, passed the (VERY easy) test for Anthropology and here I am.

But I can't focus on studying and when I can, I don't understand a thing and forget the sentences I read in no time. I find myself going through a couple of pages for hours and I KNOW it's just not how it's supposed to go for someone who has the capacity of getting a degree. 
I can't afford going to a therapist so I'm not going to get any better and I feel like I get worse every day. 

On the other hand, I don't want to go back home because I can't stand my family and it makes my life worse to have them around (they insult me often and, even though they're right, this just makes me want to kill myself more which is inconvenient because I don't have the courage to do it) and going to University was my excuse to get away from here. What can I do? I might be able to get a job here but I'm not sure... Should I try saving some money and then decide whether to drop out or not? I don't know what to do, even now that I wrote this I feel myself drifting off to sleep... I got 10 hours of sleep last night. Maybe if I did some low effort job like a cashier it would be easier to deal with the sleepiness/concentration problems?




EDIT: thank you everyone for your suggestions, I think I'll go get tested for ADHD as soon as I can... I will see what to do from then. (Probably see if the meds work and eventually go to therapy when I can afford it, or try my luck with a public therapist)

I honestly think I'm interested in Anthropology. So much in me has changed ever since I started this uni, even though I'm struggling so much... My other interest was med school but I think Anthropology appeases my thirst for knowledge of other perspectives and overall it seems like it could be more rewarding in the long run. It's also coherent with my interest in my regional folklore and I know that if I succeed in understanding the methods that are proposed in this course then I'll be prepared to understand our folklore better and, hopefully, contribute to its preservation. My only worries were with truly being too stupid for it...

34,bli2wf,False,USA,504,Someone got caught cheating on their final today.,college,"So today during one of my finals, I hear the teacher ask this one guy what he's doing.

Teacher was serious and got the jacket. A phone with presumably answers on it was found. Teacher immediately says ""shut down your computer and leave. You just failed my class"". 

He's already a notoriously hard teacher and has a heavy Chinese accent, so the class was extremely difficult to begin with. But now this student has spent an entire semester, all to be kicked out on his LAST day in class. 

Be careful guys and don't cheat. This was an eye opener. Usually teachers have been lenient and when someone gets caught they just either get a warning or point reduction. But seeing that made my heart drop. It's not worth failing the class and possibly getting expelled!!

Do you guys have any cheating stories that either you yourself did (hypothetically of course), or did someone in any of your classes ever get caught cheating? What happened?

Edit: when I say ""be careful guys and don't cheat"" I'm not saying be careful *while* cheating. I'm saying be careful to make sure you don't even accidentally glance at a neighbors paper, or pull out your phone just to check how much time you have left etc. I've seen people wrongly accused of cheating before due to a stupid mistake like that. So that's what I mean by be careful. Sorry for lack of clarification.

Edit2: yes my school does expel students caught. But it's up to the teacher to report it to the dean. If it's a major class they typically do. If it's an elective they usually just give an F. My school isn't ""lenient"". Idk if he got expelled or not. But that teachers about to be fired for being a horrible teacher, so I doubt he even wants to report anything to the dean.

454,bbzxxa,False,USA,121,UNCOMMON college tips for continuing students and incoming freshman/transfer,college,"So I know there are a lot of post that give tips about college, academically and socially. A decent amount of those post mention a lot of the same tips/advice. After almost getting done with my junior year of college I thought I shared some tips that I don’t see on here often and just stuff to expect that most people wouldn’t(applies mainly for incoming freshman or CC transfers to uni). If any of you have any tips that aren’t super common, ex; joining clubs, studying, don’t skip class, etc., definitely comment to help out others.

1. Making a legit calendar or journal that you plan to follow saves so much stress in the long run. I see people with planners a lot but they mainly just use it to write down as a  “what to do” when ever they plan to do assignments, studying, etc., If you actually sit plan specific date and time for certain things college will go very smooth. This helps me mainly because I work and am a dj outside of college. My schedule gets crazy and I used to stress but immediately when I started doing the date and time process, things got so less stressful.

2. It’s okay to say “fuck it” a few weekends of the semester and just enjoy life rather than studying or doing college work. This may seem like bad advice but everything is good in moderation. Sometimes you just wanna say screw it and lounge around all weekend or go hang with your friends all weekend. As long as you don’t have a midterm or a major exam early in the next week, I think it’s okay and healthy to have this mentality here and there.

3. Greek life is not what everyone thinks it is.... this one is pretty common and everyone really does have their own personal experiences with fraternities/sororities so I’ll just say that Greek life for me personally was a drama oriented waste of my time. I’m not gonna sit here and say their is no benefits of Greek life because there definitely is.

4. This is the main reason I actually made this post but for all of us who didn’t have the “best” high school/past experiences, people end up talking about high school a lot more than you think they would. After being a looser, burnout, Loner type of kid, I was really excited about college because people make it seem like none of that stuff matters. Well when I got to my uni, it was not how I imagined. People talk about high school a lot but it’s mainly because thats their past and they don’t know what else to talk about and you can’t really blame them. People used to tell me “this is just a early college thing”, it’s not I’m friends with tons of upper level undergrad and even grad students that are always bringing up the good ole days. I am left out of many conversations because of this but at this point, I don’t really care anymore because that’s just life. It does suck but you have to get over it at some point.

So that’s it but definitely comment if you have any other tips or experiences that aren’t posted on this sub often. Also feed back would be great especially on 4",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/bbzxxa/uncommon_college_tips_for_continuing_students_and/,573,"3. Is a pretty stupid tip btw.

117,gnfv1w,False,USA,90,Tips on how to raise your GPA as an average student,college,"I technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of 3.55. I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of 2.98, it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.

This sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.

&#x200B;

1. ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.
2. ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop 5-8% points to score an A.
3. Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)
4. ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***
5. ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.
6. ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.
7. ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!

**edit:** I have another HORRIBLE professor story I wanted to add in.  I was taking a probability class over summer last year and also working on campus.  I ended up reporting my boss for sexual harassment and my department did an investigation and found enough stuff on his PC to warrant him being immediately fired and banned from campus.  The same day they fired him, he was found dead by suicide.  I had a lot of issues handling this, emotionally, and the Dean of Students and campus counseling came to my aid to support me through it.  I was very grateful towards them.  The same week this happened, I had a midterm in my probability class.  The dean personally spoke to my teacher to ask him to be mindful of my circumstances and give me extra time to prepare for the test and to take it later in the week.  He refused, told me to not be lazy and to ""hire a tutor if the class is so hard for you"" and gave me a list of tutors starting off at $50/hr.  I didn't need help studying, I just needed more time and considering I quit my job after what happened, I definitely didn't have $50/hr to throw at anyone anyway..... I ended up getting a C+ in the class and therapy, no thanks to how much of an asshole the teacher was.  I've since told all my fellow math students to not take any classes from him because he has no sympathy for students and he wasn't even a good teacher to begin with.

**worst**: I took a CS - based discrete math course, and the teacher for that was the fucking worst. It was a large class (auditorium-sizes class), and so the teacher had a teaching assistant. It became pretty clear early on that she had no like or respect for students and I’m pretty sure she was only teaching because she had to, but she was more interested in her research work. She often rushed lecture, she refused to slow down for anyone that asked (and would openly mock them for asking), and she was very unforgiving with grades. As in, if a problem was a multi-parter with parts (a) to (d) and you partially got (c) incorrect, the entire problem would be marked zero.  At the first midterm, she started the test by saying she put some common mathematic formulas on the back of the exams for “all the morons in the room who never bothered to learn basic math”. I left that test, reported her to the CS department, and dropped the class. 

**best**: On the flip side, the next semester, I took a math-based discrete math course from a strict but very fair mathematician who was very knowledgeable and had a good way to help students understand difficult concepts in more basic terms. I had to work my ass off in that class, but I learned so much and I really respect the teacher.

I ended up switching majors from cs to math/stats, partially as a result of these two teachers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cx286v/whats_the_worst_professor_youve_ever_had_whats/,510,[deleted] ,2019-08-29 15:12:23

580,bjvcwa,False,,49,I got a 4.0 while taking 20 credits and didn’t hate my life. Here’s how.,college," 

This is a story about how this spring semester, I got straight A’s in 20 credits worth of classes while also working part time, volunteering, securing a summer internship, trying not to neglect my relationships, exercising daily, and getting 8 hours of sleep. 

&#x200B;

Not trying to “flex” \*hello fellow kids\*, but I see a lot of people asking for advice, especially new students, wondering if their credit load will overwhelm them.  I hope this helps someone.  \*\*\*TDLR at the bottom\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**A Brief History:**

I am a 25 yo female who just finished my “Junior” year of undergrad. “Junior” because it was my fourth year of college and I have a ton of credits, but I still have a full academic year before I graduate. After high school, I dragged ass and essentially failed out after two years of an unrelated degree (art), took three years off, then went back two years ago for my current degree.

When I left school, I was absolutely convinced that I was dropping out of college, not taking a break. I had anxiety attacks before attending class, felt extremely lost, could barely pay attention in lecture, and struggled with substance abuse. I finished my last semester with a semester GPA of 1.9 and a total GPA of 2.5. Yikes. 

In high school, I was one of those “gifted” but burnt out kids. My teachers always said I was smart, but it was such a shame that I refused *apply* myself. After taking a break from school and doing some soul searching, I decided: I’m a fucking adult, I’m going back to college, for real this time. I’m going to apply my goddamn self. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**About my degree:**

I’m studying public health. To me, my degree is the perfect mix of “hard science” classes and humanities classes. I take classes in the realm of microbiology, A&P, epidemiology, anthropology, sociology, and ethics. The mix of memorization-style studying and critical thinking, writing essays and discussion style work makes it so that I’m never bored. (I go to a large state school in the northwest U.S. if that matters to you). 

This is the part where someone butts in and says you could never do this with a STEM degree. Sure. Probably not. I’m not saying that every person regardless of major should take my advice, just trying to share what I have learned. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Decision:**

I do a little mental checklist before I assemble a semester’s worth of classes (because advisors are useless- you already *know*). This particular semester, it just somehow worked out that I wasn’t going to be taking any classes that required large amounts of difficult studying. I don’t mean work, but *studying.* That is not to say that I didn’t do any work. I still had shit to do. Readings to skim, essays to write, research to do, the works. But I didn’t really *study*, which takes up a lot more abstract time than *doing.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My Classes:** 

I took 4 three credit courses and 2 four credit courses. All but two of my courses were 400 level classes with a significant amount of work. (If you’re curious: 3 credit 200 level medical anthropology and a 3 credit 100 level earth science class- my last core requirement)

I like to breakdown my classes at the beginning of the semester based on how difficult I deem them to be. You can usually figure this out by the first couple weeks of class, or after the first graded assignment. How much work will this require time-wise and brain-power-wise, and how big of a hardass grader is the prof? THIS is a big deal. Once I figured this out, college seemed so much more like a game. I would highly recommend doing this, you can reassess throughout the semester and as you learn more about your own grade in the class. I typically write my courses on a sticky note in order of priority and slap it in my planner. Speaking of which:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Planner set up:**

I need a paper planner. It’s absolutely non-negotiable. I could not survive college without one, and you shouldn’t try to. I bring it everywhere. I’ve tried bullet journaling, keeping a to-do list in a notebook, google calendar- none of them compare to the ease of use and accuracy of a paper planner. A typical week in mine looks like [this!](https://imgur.com/a/r5qhd0i)

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the semester, I write the time every class takes place in my weekly spread A4 Target planner. Then, I go through the syllabus and enter every single thing next to when it is due. For each week of the semester, I have two sticky notes on the page. I do this because inevitably things get moved around. In my photo, you can see that the smaller yellow note is for readings, and the large pink one is my ongoing to-do list. The readings being separate is important because otherwise everything gets clogged up, and I can see at a glance what I need to read (or skim, or pretend to have read). I organize my to-do list by class, and have a section for “life”. The first thing I do every morning is look at my planner, and it’s one of the last things I look at before I go to bed. As soon as I sit down in class, I open it up. When making plans with a friend, I open it up. I can’t overstate this enough. Get a planner and use the shit out of it. 

&#x200B;

**Work:** 

I had the unique situation of not having to work that much this semester. I received a federal grant that paid for most of my tuition, scholarships paid for the rest, and my family helps me out with part of my living expenses. This is obviously not everyone’s reality.

The last three semesters, I have worked up to 30 hours each week, and it really is fucking hard. Working takes up a lot of your time and energy, and I wouldn’t recommend working while taking this heavy of a course load. 

That being said, I did still work. I like working. I like having money, I like the structure and I like having something productive besides school to do. In the past, I was an assistant teacher at a private preschool. This semester, I was lucky enough to be able to substitute teach at least one 6 hour shift each week because of my school schedule (Fridays off, Thursdays half off). I also babysat a couple of nights each week pretty consistently. This ended up being about 10-15 hours a week of work- an easy couple hundred bucks in my pocket for rent and nights out. The best part about this situation is that if I was really swamped, I could just completely opt out of work or not schedule anything. When I wasn’t busy with school, I could put in a 20 hour workweek. It put me in control.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Volunteering:**

I taught adaptive skiing on Sundays. I ski with an 8-year-old girl with Down syndrome, and it is exhausting, but rewarding. Our days consisted of me chasing after her, singing songs, managing tantrums, and hoisting her up off the snow. I laughed a lot. Despite thinking that I might over-stretch myself at the beginning, this experience was additive to my life. I felt refreshed, motivated, and happy because I had this kind of volunteering in my schedule. I include this not to brag, but to recommend some type of meaningful volunteering or work if you can. If you think you’re too busy to do good things in the world, you’re not. Promise. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Relationships:**

You know the triangle. Choose one: sleep, get A’s, or have a social life.

Here’s the thing. I’m 25. Sort-of non-traditional, but I’m still in my twenties. I still have friends who like to go out, still go to shows, stay up too late, etc. But, my friends are also adults. None of my friends who are nurses, teachers, or baristas want to go out until midnight on a Thursday anymore. None of my non-student friends are free in the middle of the day to go fuck around or distract me. When I tell my friends I can’t come out because I’m studying, they’re not giving me shit for it. 

I still made a point to set aside time on Saturday’s to spend time with my friends. Typically we would ski, go out for coffee, or make each other breakfast.  

Another factor in this realm is my boyfriend. Boyfriend works 9-5, so my motivation to not do any schoolwork after dinner was intensified in order to hang out with my person. Boyfriend makes me dinner on nights that I have class until 8pm. Boyfriend gets toilet paper at the store because I’m stuck in the library.  Boyfriend wakes me up with coffee telling me he is proud of me. Can you tell that my love language is acts of service?

I’m not telling you to ignore your friends if they’re distracting and get a partner who does stuff for you, but to consider which relationships in your life are additive and which are less so. It’s fine to have fun and make memories; you’re in college. But if you say yes to every single opportunity, you will find yourself out of balance.

My point here with relationships is this: make sure the people who love you know what is going on with you. Let them know that you want to hang out, but you’re reaching for your goals.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Work Ethic:**

For me, relying on motivation alone has never helped me. I need to “hack” my environment in order to do what I need to do. 

I woke up at 6:30 every single day, including weekends. On weekdays, I would arrive on campus around 7:45 and either go to class or go to the library. The quiet floor or the law library are clutch. No coffee shops, no cafeteria, no house. If there is any ambient noise or people having conversations around me, I cannot function. I am there to do work and focus. If you’re only half-working, you’re spending twice the amount of time on work. I straight up didn’t have the time to only half-work.

In a typical day, I will sit down at a desk, open up my planner and my laptop, decide which item on my to-do list is the perfect combination of “finishability” and time-urgency.  My phone is on grey-scale and I deleted my social media apps this January and haven't looked back. I listen to 432 Hz white noise music in noise-cancelling earbuds. 

&#x200B;

I’m very bad at time. My brain does not conceptualize it passing. I wear a watch religiously, and set timers for everything- Otherwise I get sucked into the hyper-focus wormhole. I set a ten minute timer to get set up and decide what to do, otherwise I will agonize about what the “perfect” thing to do is. Then, I set a timer for 30 minutes, and lean into whatever I have decided to do. After this, I take a break, walk around, take my earbuds out, get some water or coffee, but do not turn my phone back on. And repeat. Before I know it, my work is done or it is time to go to class.

&#x200B;

If I don’t have anything to do, but it is still “work” time, I will research grad programs, apply for internships, go to professors office hours, or read about work that people I admire do. This paid off in the end of the semester, as a professor casually mentioned that I would get along well with another professor in a different department. I meet up with Prof #2, she was impressed that I had already read about her work and offered me a paid summer internship. 

&#x200B;

**Exercise:** 

Exercise is another non-negotiable in my life. I have border-collie level energy. I need to exercise. If I’m feeling overwhelmed, tired, or stuck, a run almost always helps. I lift weights 4 days a week, my routine usually takes about an hour. I either Nordic or downhill ski with my friends on Saturdays, volunteer on Sundays, and have two hours of yoga a week built into my schedule. No exercise = poor sleep = too tired to workout = eat like crap = I can’t focus= I get overwhelmed= whole system falls apart. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What I did that actually helped me succeed.** 

* Campus library is my “office” from 8-5 every single weekday. 
* Paper planner is your BIBLE.
* Delete social media. Turn off your phone. Really.
* Work in chunks. For my brain, 30 minutes with a timer and then a small break is ideal. 
* Prioritize, prioritize prioritize. You’re going to have to bullshit some assignments and toil over others. Make your efforts count.
* If you don’t think you have any school work to do at any given time, you’re wrong. You can always work ahead. 
* Habits trump motivation every time. Motivation wanes, but if you’re in the groove, you’re way less likely to fall behind. 
* Never. Ever. Ever. Skip. Class. 
* This seems obvious, but do every single assignment and every single extra credit opportunity, no matter how minuscule or annoying. 
* Support system. Tell your friends & family what you’re trying to achieve and let them know how they can *help* you.
* Don’t forget to feed yourself and exercise.
* Set aside intentional time for non-school. Ideally a full day on the weekend. 
* Say no. Say NO. Explain yourself, be kind, but say fucking no. 
* Nobody is productive every single hour of every day. It’s ok. Perfect is truly the enemy of the good. 
* Have an end goal. Visualize walking at graduation. See your GPA climb.
* If you’re a non-traditional age considering going back to school- do it. School is infinitely easier with an adult brain, adult friends, and adult priorities. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, if you fucked up this semester, its ok. It really is. I’ve been there. My sophomore year, I ended the spring semester with one D, two Cs, an F and a W. It doesn’t feel good. Just remember that it doesn’t say anything about your worth as a person. Beating yourself up about it isn't going to help in the long run. You are not forever the person who fucked up, and you can use what you did wrong to learn and grow and change. 

Also, remember that succeeding and trying your best doesn’t have to be miserable. You can still enjoy the things that bring meaning to your life while trying to do something difficult.

601,cofn34,False,,60,Having your bf/gf stay the night in your dorm,college,"Hello! I’m about to start my sophomore year of college. Last year, I spent a year commuting to a community college so I still lived at home. This year, I’ve transferred to a university and my boyfriend is also going to the same school. It’s a public university so there isn’t any religious restrictions. I wanted to ask if having your SO stay the night in your dorm is a good thing to do. I actually have a single room and so does he so neither of us have to deal with a roommate. I’m assuming that it won’t be a problem since there isn’t any gender restrictive rules set in either of our dorms. Like I asked, I just want to know if it’s really worth it or is it a waste of time and energy?

Thank everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/cofn34/having_your_bfgf_stay_the_night_in_your_dorm/,428,"\>  is it a waste of time and energy? 

This is actually sort of baffling. Whatever do you mean? If it's a waste of time/energy to be with your SO anywhere, why are you with them at all?  Now if you're asking ""Could it be a distraction that might negatively impact my academic progress?"" the answer is yes, if the relationship becomes the center of your life to the point that you aren't attending classes and doing your homework, but that can happen regardless of where you sleep at night. Another question might be ""Will it be possible to set boundaries if there are no rules around our time together?"" That has nothing to do with dorm life really, but everything to do with your relationship: if you feel like you need/want to maintain some private space/time for yourself, then that's something you need to work out with your partner-- nobody is going to do it for you.

Single rooms are great for people in relationships as they eliminate the need to negotiate with roommates- you can stay over and do as you wish, when you wish. But it's also the case that many young couples struggle to delineate and maintain boundaries in relationships due to lack of experience and maturity...being able to stay together 24/7, have sex without interruption, and enjoy the intimacy that goes with that is wonderful. But it can also quickly become overwhelming, especially to those with no experience managing expectations/boundaries as adults, and that can hurt the relationship as well as your interactions with others. I'd simply recommend that you and your SO have a direct conversation about expectations up front-- who will be staying where which nights, what happens when one of you has another priority (school, work, friends, sleep, etc.), how you will interact with others, and how you will both communicate that you *don't* want to ""spend the night"" when the time for that arises.

I suggest play some online multiplayer games, join some sort of club like sports club or gym because those are the places where you will find people with some energy who like making new friends.. 

PS : I have lot of friends rn and had more friends then I ever dreamed off, but the truth is when you get older you filter out useless friends who talk to you when they need you, yes that is the type of people you will find in this modern era.

231,anbv6u,False,USA,79,... How does college work?,college,"Perhaps this is better suited for /r/NoStupidQuestions , because seeing my peers all seemingly knowing exactly what they're doing has me terrified.

I'm a high school student, in my second semester of my junior year. I have a few universities in mind, but.... I just don't know what I'm doing, and it's leaving me very unsettled and insecure.

Once I apply for college, how do student loans work? Do I take multiple student loans for multiple years? Do I take one big student loan? When do I search for / apply for scholarships? I'm planning on getting a Master's degree (computer science). Is there a separate loan for that?

Once I finish my bachelor's degree and start working on a Master's, do I work at a job concurrently as I study for my Master's? Is a Master's like a bachelor's, where you go to classes (mostly) every day, or is it something different? Is my notion of how a bachelor's degree is obtained even correct?

Back to student loans, when do you have to start paying? What happens if you miss a payment?

This last Saturday night/Sunday morning, quite a few students decided to host an unsanctioned party outside of Greenville for Homecoming. Long story short, a shooter shows up with a target in mind and kills/injures 14-16 people (I dont know the specifics). 

The whole school felt super dark that Monday, and most students just turned up absent. However, I was just glad to get back into the groove of things and take my mind off the situation. Well, Monday night, the school said that Monday absences would be excused and classes would be mandatorily canceled Tuesday and Wednesday.

I dont have any assignments to do, people to talk to, or events to attend that could take my mind off everything. Now Im left sulking in my dorm, thinking about it. Its 4 on Wednesday now, and its still the only thing on my mind. Any suggestions to make it through tomorrow?




EDIT: So Ive been reading the comments, and I just have to say, thanks for all the suggestions and support. I do have a few things to note.

At the moment, its cold, gloomy, and wet outside, so swimming is off the table. I did go for a walk, but the cold made it hard to relax. I decided to snap a few photos of the empty campus, and Ill likely be posting them later this week.

Hanging with friends isn't really an option. Most of the time, Ill ask to grab a coffee or eat lunch after class, but I dont have anyones number.

My plans for today is probably to practice my drawing, play OuterWorlds, head to this Halloween thing at 5, and read my Churchill book until I fall asleep. Tomorrow, classes are back up, so Ill definitely see if I can catch a cup with someone.

Again, thank you all for the suggestions and support. I expected this to get lost in new, but I'm glad it didn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dp43kr/college_cancelled_classes_after_a_shooting_and/,735,Learn CPR and hide under the mattress. ,2019-10-30 08:58:24
