923,9fc5m7,False,,33,"I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?",careerguidance,"**Backstory:** I started my career about 2 years ago in a junior IT position, and a salary to match. Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over. I thought about ""correcting"" the letter, but I'm sure they will call to verify, and then I'm really screwed (with both companies).

I'm not going to do that again for sure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9fc5m7/i_lied_and_it_got_me_in_a_stupid_career_pickle/,61,Personally I would just take a screenshot of the email and Photoshop the number. ,2018-09-12 21:57:16

Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?",careerguidance,"We always hear stuff like ""follow your dreams!"" and the best recipe for successful wealth is ""pick something you love so much an make a career out of it!"".

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job? 

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

There's no shame in getting yourself financially stable. I think the myth of ""if you want it bad enough you'll fight for it!"" While well-meaning, can be dangerously misleading and unrealistic.

879,ej81vz,False,,19,"Do I actually hate my job, or does everybody feel this way?",careerguidance,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile!

I’m an engineer working for a consumer products company. This is my first job out of college, I’ve been here for 2 years.

On paper, I feel like I should love my job. I make great money, have a lot of autonomy to take on and lead many different types of projects, work reasonable hours, and live in a decent mid-sized city. My work is low stress and has a lot of flexibility, my current boss is a little absent but otherwise we get along fine.

This all said, the reality is that I find myself DREADING work every single day. I can’t make myself care about my projects anymore, which is shocking from somebody who has been an ambitious workaholic their entire life. I end up crying in the bathroom an embarrassing amount. I feel like I’m losing my drive by the day.

To try to articulate what I don’t like in my job:
- I love working on teams, closely with people. The culture of my group doesn’t facilitate this, we work very isolated from each other.
- I don’t care about the final products I work on. I always envisioned myself “making a difference in the world”, and it’s hard to see how that’s true in CPG.
- I don’t feel challenged like I did in undergrad, much of my work is paper pushing or hunting down other people to make sure their work is getting done.

However, these are all normal complaints! None of these should be reasons to feel as miserable as I am! Right??! Or maybe they are?

So, Reddit, I’m looking to hear how others feel about their work / felt about their first jobs. I’m starting to look for a new role within the company, but hesitant to start looking for positions externally quite yet because I’m stuck wondering: is the grass just greener on the outside? Is this simply what work feels like for everyone, and I need to suck it up and appreciate what I have?

Since it was the recession, companies were not actively recruiting much on campus.  It kind of seemed like an extension of high school since no one had concrete plans for their careers.  Formal internship programs with companies did not seem to be common back then, it was all unpaid crappy internships.  I was doing premed, graduated, and worked very low paying jobs in my field (biochemistry) while applying to med school.



I eventually ended up in software development at a large tech company after doing cloud/data related work.  I was doing this while getting my MS in CS and after getting sick of waiting 9 months to hear yes/no after a med school interview.


Most of my friends from college have similar stories.  We all aimlessly worked years before breaking into a good career path.

I wanted to learn something tangible, something where I could work with my hands. Electrician, Plumber, etc. and not something which requires a degree or less hands-on work. Something where there's pretty much always SOME kind of demand for that skill (though I know there's no such thing as an industry invulnerable to recession).

I looked into learning to be an electrician in my area, but it seems impossible to learn and be certified just on the nights or weekends - these things require a pretty much full time commitment through shadowing and apprenticeship.

I guess, how do you guys decide what you are going to do in any given day, or in regards to your job.

Is this common?",careerguidance,"I am a remote contractor and was contacted by a headhunter with an opportunity at a local firm. I interviewed, they liked me, and made me a job offer. Offer good, but not good enough - about a $10k income drop plus a 30 minute commute and all the other unknowns that come with a new job.
Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”
What offer?
Turns out they had sent an offer letter that day. So he gives me the verbal, and it is ok, but doesn’t make me giddy, and I say, “thanks, I’ll look it over.”
It’s Friday. Takes them a while to get me a benefit premium breakdown. Insurance costs lower, but numbers don’t add up, I still have a $10k deficit. I like working remotely, in an earlier time zone, in my PJs. So I call the hiring manager and tell him it is a soft no, and he says, “well if you change your mind we have a lot if hiring to do.”
Headhunter emails me saying, “what happened? I specifically told you to contact me if the numbers were off. We have a significant amount of money earmarked for this situation. I guess I’ll never understand.”
So three things struck me:
1) the assumption that it was the money (well, TBH I made the mistake(?) of telling them what I was making, so she knew there was a gap)
2) this “significant amount of money” was never mentioned until after the fact
3) the “I guess I’ll never understand” makes me think this same scenario has played out at least once (and probably several times) before.

56,frbgyf,False,,84,Do others around the age of 30 struggle with career direction?,careerguidance,"I am approaching 30. Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it.

It's not a binary.  You can make $50k and date more.  You can make time for a hobby, for a passion, to diet, to do whatever you want to do.

I’ve concluded that it’s not helping me grow other than being more efficient in auditing and overall my drive is the large amount of work I have, not passion for what I do. Then I reflected on how I feel outside of work and basically I feel unfulfilled and am only happy when I’m on vacation/weekends. This brings me to my question, how does one find a career that gets them fired up and ready to go in the morning? I’m sick of having my motivation stem from ‘needing’ to do something rather than ‘wanting’ to do it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

996,evb9b0,False,,14,Did you eventually realize a lot of people don’t know what their doing when it comes to a career?,careerguidance,"I’ve been kicking myself a lot lately. I left my first post college job after a year and a half, and if I’d only known then what I known now, I never would have left.

A lot of things happened last year and I was constantly comparing myself to my peers I graduated with. Everyone else seemed to find their dream job and things were moving along. Since the job I had wasn’t my “dream” job I was constantly looking for ways to get out of it.

The job I quit to go to was a very bad choice but at that time I thought I needed to do something different. I’m not joking when I say that job was terrible and I quit after a week. I got lucky that another company offered me a role the same week and I started shortly after. I’ve been at my newest job for about 4 months and I’ve still been regretting my decision. This job isn’t as bad as the last but it has its issues (poor management, lack of training, lack of benefits). Instead of having an actual role or career path, I’m just an office admin.

I wish I would have just went back to my old job after I quit my last after a week. I tried job searching again but I wasn’t liking any of the jobs in my area. I briefly considered becoming a teacher and took steps to get a teaching certificate but I realized I would not be a good fit dealing with kids all day. I went on multiple interviews and for jobs I thought I had a good chance with I was passed along with no interview offer. I was tried of the rejection and answering bs interview questions and bureaucracy, I missed my old company.

I sucked up my pride at the beginning of this month and asked my old boss from my first company if I could come back to work. She offered me my old job back and I am
going through the rehire process now. 

I felt embarrassed and besides from my immediate family knows I’m changing jobs  again and going back to my first company.

It was yesterday when I was scrolling through Facebook that I saw two separate people I graduated with posting about starting new jobs that were a complete 180 than what they started out doing. 

The first one was a girl who’d been with the same company almost 3 years if you count her internship experience. She’s now quit and working as a full time substitute teacher. The other was a guy who moved out of state after graduation and seemed to be a successful sales rep who moved back home. Initially he was going through the process to become a teacher but has now accepted a job as a vet tech at an animal hospital. 

It finally made me realize that a lot of people also have trouble deciding on a career, and especially in your early 20s you’ll make a lot of big decisions, regret some, benefit from others, etc. I’m feeling a little less ashamed at starting back at the same company but I know it’s whats best for me at the moment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/evb9b0/did_you_eventually_realize_a_lot_of_people_dont/,54,"You are not alone.

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice. That said, I’m just concerned about my possible 2 year gap.

I am at a small (<30 people) company. For the sake of this, let's say I'm a ""Financial Analyst II."" I started as a Jr Financial analyst. In the short 2 years, I have gotten several significant pay bumps, got positive praise, etc. I am doing fairly serious work for someone that's 25. Worth noting that from the start, I never planned to spend my whole career here. 

Outside of some minor gripes that could happen anywhere, my company is pretty awesome. My pay package is awesome. The working hours aren't terrible. And it means something that the higher ups have specifically made a focus of ensuring I get taken care of.

At the same time, I just feel totally checked out as of late. I can't really find the motivation to be *truly* interested in my job this point. I don't feel like I'm learning any new tangible skills. I don't really feel like I'm getting any mentorship for what I want to do. None of the people around me are really on the same career 'track' I'd like to be on. Plus, a lot of the processes in my small company just feel very ""Mickey Mouse.""

I'm hesitant to up and leave. Since my job is fairly good, and my particular industry is pretty niche, good opportunities don't come up all the time. I would consider going back for an advanced degree, but it would likely not get me higher pay than I'm getting right now. And the other option is going into a 'professional services' job in consulting or finance (I should be qualified), but I'd be going in fairly entry level, and likely getting paid a bit less for way more stress.

I have a degree in food science and work in food industries in quality assurance. Food is interesting, but this kind of work is not. It's tedious and routine, I need to change shifts from morning to evening and back every couple weeks, which really affects my sleep schedule, the pay isn't all that great either, and to be honest, I don't even like science that much in the first place. At least not tedious work like this. 90% of graduates end up doing this kind of work. I figured, if I better change to something while I'm young now or I'll end up stuck doing this forever.

* I think I would enjoy doing a creative sort of job. Anything that allows me to ""create"" something would satisfy me I think. However, the last two points are far more important to me. If there is no such job that can satisfy all three, then the last two would do fine if possible.

* I hate the idea of being controlled by your job to move to where you find work, so I would like a mobile job that can be done working from home, or anywhere else. I assume, working on something that involves a computer, or at least a job that is fine with you being anywhere as long as you are able to connect with the employer through phone or computer.

* Lastly, a decent pay, or something that can work up to a decent pay. I was lead to believe that creative jobs don't pay well in school, which was what led me into going into the sciences.

Female, in case it matters, which I suspect it does, sadly. I'm fairly ugly. I'm not severely physically deformed or such, but I'm just plain old ugly; huge round droopy nose, sunken in eyes a little too close together, Dwayne's syndrome so one of my eyes doesn't turn outward all the way which leads to a head tilt to compensate, almost no distinction between my chin and my neck, Rosacea means I always look as red as if it'd just run a marathon at all times, gangly and bony. I've worked in programming all of my adult life and generally haven't had to interact with people face to face which helps. On the phone, I have good rapport with end users; fortunately my voice isn't too bad. About a year ago I got transferred to a new office in a new position under a new boss due to some company mergers and such.

I was recently passed up for a promotion in favor of a coworker I trained, whom I was still training at the time of the interview, who has become my supervisor. The two of us were the only ones who applied. She's wholly competent and also has former supervisory experience in another field whereas I have only ever done programming. I'm not displeased with her as a supervisor, nor do I think she is undeserving, even though I'd obviously have preferred the position myself. But I asked what I did wrong in the interview and my boss said it was a fine interview but that I lacked certain soft skills, and lamented it was her fault for never giving me training on expected manners and hygiene.

I shower daily, I use deodorant, I brush twice a day and usually do a mouthwash rinse at lunch so I can't imagine I smell too bad. I wear typical khakis and collared unpatterned shirts, so I'm certain I'm dressed appropriately even if not femininely or stylishly. I've had several performance reviews, none of which have ever had any criticisms whatsoever. Three in a row of just ""keep doing what you're doing."" I've requested and gotten pay raises from past supervisors as I've made contributions and the like.

I interviewed for a promotion (same job, different title = more pay situation) and got it. I've interviewed for this two times prior and hadn't gotten it, and this was the first time my boss was not on the interview panel, but my (new) supervisor was. Last interview for it was a month prior, so no major changes in my qualifications or achievements. A part of me suspected this was not a coincidence that my boss was not on the deciding panel for the first time when I got it, but I get my pay raise, so I'm happy.

Due to COVID-19, we have limited staff in the physical office. I go in twice a week to handle database matters which can't be done remotely due to requiring a direct network connection rather than VPN. My supervisor is also there on one of those days. She had said yesterday that our boss demanded my ID badge photo be changed, because mine was ""unacceptable."" The badge photos are generally taken by a staff member whose entire job is to assure it's an acceptable photo. It's been acceptable this long. It's about two years old, but I've never heard of anyone getting a new picture; there are people in the office who are 60+ who have their ID badge with a photo from when they were hired in their 30s.

The HR processing team is not physically in the office, so my supervisor has to take the photo with her phone. We do that first thing in the morning and get back to work. She comes over a few hours later and says the boss didn't like it, that I must smile ""better."" My mouth is uneven and my teeth are crooked. My entire face is off center. I repeat, I'm not a pretty girl. Trying to force an even smile looks very awkward and more like a cringe than a smile. Sure enough, this one is shot down, too. The boss tells my supervisor I must wear my hair a certain way in the picture (my standard hair style is just straight down flat, nothing special or weird). We have to reshoot three times, each time my supervisor thinking it looks fine, before the boss will accept a picture.

All I can assume is that my boss just doesn't like my face. Are there any other suggestions for me besides ""try to look better"" ?

I'm okay with being ugly, but if I take particular pains to try to look pretty it becomes depressing because it's impossible, or because it would be great effort, money and discomfort just trying to look normal rather than ugly. In an age where everybody has self esteem issues and depression and anxiety, I'm quite mentally hardy, I'm physically fit, I do triathlons as a hobby, I'm successful in a career that requires a certain degree of intelligence, I volunteer at an animal shelter and feel a general sense of connection to my community and purpose and all that; I like myself when I don't have to try too hard to be something I'm not: pretty.

How can I make a realistic plan?",careerguidance,"Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.

Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.

However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to ""make sure we work as a team"". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.

As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.

I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?

I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as ""this is life"", ""most people have to deal with this to get by financially"" and ""you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route"", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.

Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier.

841,egcnqr,False,,44,Should I take a better paying job or be a “team player”?,careerguidance,"Throwaway to keep this off my main.

I (26F) have been working full time for a non-profit for 1.5 years.  

A few details about this job:

-pay is about $1,500 less annually than a living wage for a single adult in my city.  I have to work another (better paying) job part time to make ends meet/have any quality of life.  HOWEVER, we are getting a pay increase

-this position has had an extreme amount of turnover in the past few years. It’s on a small team which was being hired from scratch when I got there, because the previous team all quit within a few months.  More have quit since then

-the managers who have overseen all this turnover have been the same. It’s a small department, but my team works closely with our manager and her boss.  

-These two supervisors have very different management styles.  My direct supervisor (let’s call her Kim) is extremely lax, and likes to leave policies in gray areas.  Overall, I like Kim as a person, but this has been frustrating to work under since Kim’s boss, we’ll call her Kath, has extremely specific expectations of her staff.  Kath also really likes to stick to chain of command, thereby relying entirely on Kim to communicate Kath’s expectations to my team (which Kim doesn’t really like to do).

Anyway, this environment has led to an extreme amount of stress in my life and I decided, after a few months of escalating nonsense, to look for other employment options.  This current position also requires me to do some intense physical work, and my health has been declining rapidly since I started working here.

I’m now pretty far along in the process of interviewing for a much higher paying position at the company I currently work for part time.  The only problem is, Kim just announced that she will be leaving her position, meaning I would leave my teammates (who I care about and don’t want to inconvenience) scrambling to cover for both me and Kim should I leave. 

I’m also planning on moving away from this city, and both of these jobs, in the next year. 

So, should I take this new, better job for a few months, or stick it out at this miserable one so as not to hurt my team?

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries.

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

637,bpblae,False,,50,Quit job and want to change career. What steps should I take?,careerguidance,"Hi all

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear.

171,c6k93y,False,,51,How do you succeed in business as a shy/introverted person?,careerguidance,"So far the biggest thing holding me back in business is being shy. I can typically turn on the charm when I have to, like for a client or for an interview. But I’m more of a quiet reserved person. 

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention. So then I end up thinking of questions I don’t really need to ask just to appease them by asking *something* and they point this out as a negative also.

547,avpim5,False,,29,"Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?",careerguidance,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/avpim5/left_banking_job_on_bad_terms_after_6_years_and/,108,"I hope you don't mind this off topic response.

My off time is mine. Learn to put boundaries or else you will spend 8 months trying to get back on your feet again after you burn out. I survived my burn out and I hope you don't get to experience what I have been through. Never again. 

2) My second lesson is learn to delegate. If you can't do it on your own, bitch about it until they give you someone to help you out or give that task to someone else. It might sound desperate or at times unprofessional, but your health comes first. Never forget that.

Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f3nfcv/how_damaging_is_it_for_me_to_leave_a_new_job_to/,95,QQ: would staying at a job for 2 months look bad at a resume? ,2020-02-14 05:17:06

Shitty or illegal?",careerguidance,"I'm currently working as assistant director and a position opened up for a director spot in another department. In order to apply, I had to tell my direct supervisor (my director) that I was interested in the position. So I did. He told me that he thought that I'd be an awesome fit for that position, that he would recommend me, that he'd fully support me going for that role, and that he wasn't interested in the position for himself. 

I applied for the position before the closing date (along with submitting an updated resume and portfolio), came into the office from paternity leave and interviewed for the position (2 weeks ago), and just submitted an assessment (spent about 35 hours putting it together) for the position today.

My director pulled me aside just before i submitted my assessment to tell me that he wanted to apply for the same position and that he wanted to ""clear the air"" around it and ""may the best man win"".  Along with that he told me that he had pitched a new position above the one that we are applying for and got rejected and that was one of the reasons he was now applying. He also said that he had been given the same assessment task.

A few other things really got me pissed even more:

* The deadline to apply was 3 weeks ago.
* I'm not sure if he had to actually apply and interview before being given the assessment but it sounds like he didn't.

Most managers at large companies are not idiots, they understand some employees are underpaid or can be paid more, it does not really mean I will hold it against you if you stayed, in fact you may get more concessions for loyalty (moving to a group you want, taking on more responsibilities, growth, remote etc). I understand concerns about reprisal, but depending on the industry/state you work in this is actually very dangerous for the company as it leads to expensive and hard to win lawsuits.

578,a4rmzg,False,,80,Just landed a job earning $140k/year. I don't have a college degree. Should I go back to school and finish?,careerguidance,"I have been working in the tech industry for about 10 years and have worked my way up through a few different software engineer positions. I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for.

My mom wants to go back to school - she is 42, she's been a stay at home mom/housewife for over 20 years. No college degree. She's likely divorcing my dad in a few years...and will need to have a career/income/life of her own.

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it.

533,dy5a25,False,,55,"Possible ""Scarlet Letter"" on my profile?",careerguidance,"Hello,

Some quick background - took a job in 10/18 that I immediately knew was a mistake from my first day. Been pretty miserable since with the role and BIG company, and at about the 6-month mark a lot of my applications were getting serious consideration, and since I work in a semi-specialized function that is suddenly in demand it seemed just a matter of time till I got a new gig.

Fast forward to June of this year - I interview with a BIG company from June-Sept, 2-hour personality test, 2 convos with Hiring Manager, talk to VP, fly out to the office, and then don't get the job.Ok - was shocked after multiple conversations with the Hiring Manager but I guess something happened in that final interview.

Then another company comes along. Interview with them from August - October and go through 8 rounds and don't get that gig. This included a Hiring Manager who knew a lot of my contacts well and told me on the phone I came highly regarded, etc, etc. and she wanted me on the team. Call from the recruiter - ""sorry""

Another I just heard back from (which i really wanted and took 8 weeks!) did 7 rounds, interviewed with Hiring Manager twice, including 2nd interview where we were vibing and she was talking about me in the role in present tense and 3 people from the team, including the last one who ""I would be working closely with""

Now none of these have done a background check- but I did get a job in 10/18 so I should be good there (nothing has happened to me legally or otherwise). Google search is pretty standard, but I feel like I would be vetted out earlier if there was something negative I'm not seeing.

Im confused why I am getting so close every time - the HM is loving me, interviews go well, follow-up emails, and then suddenly it's like sorry after months of interviews. Not even getting to the negotiation stage. What am I missing?

**UPDATE**

After asking for feedback ...” as I strive to improve my interview skills, whether that was a piece of experience that was lacking or a misstep I made in the interview process, or perhaps a way I can better present myself in future interviews.”

I received this:

“The hiring team enjoyed meeting with you! The candidate selected had more closely aligned experience to the role.”

Which leaves much to be desired. The role asked for 3 years of experience in the field, I have 7... etc.

Pretty much from right after my start date I was told that I’d be working in autopsy for the foreseeable future and getting training in the investigation division when time allows (time very rarely allows). 

Everybody at my office seems to think there’s nothing weird or wrong about being hired for one job, and then having to do the duties of another. I’m getting paid more than an autopsy assistant would, but the reason I was so excited about this job is that it was a way for me to stop doing autopsies! They’re super interesting, but they’re physically and emotionally exhausting and I’m just tired of it. 

I’ve been applying to other positions, but there aren’t a lot of open death investigator positions around. When I have gotten to interview, the lack (I have done some, but I have to take overtime shifts to do them) of actual investigations I’ve done is a real detriment. 

I’m just exhausted with the situation I’m in and I want to leave. I have applications out for other agencies for similar positions but now I’m worried about the same situation happening... is there really any way to ensure i get to perform the functions for the job title I’m hired for when every job description now has the ‘other duties as assigned’ line thrown in? 

Also if anyone has any helpful ideas of different ways I can take my career, I’d be really grateful for your input.

* Ultrasound / Pharmacy /Blood Technician / Dental Hygienist / Massage Therapist would be great but they all **require 2+years of school** which is too much time/money.
* Something like bartending would be good, but it isn't a legitimate 1 year college program so you cant get a study permit for it

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end.

I’m 23 (will be 24 when I graduate) and I’ve worked at a small local business that curates and sells business casual higher end clothes for 5 years now.

My official job title is “Director of Sales” and I have that title on my company business cards/emails/etc. This is obviously a rather inflated title, however I thought that with my last raise I would get a title that would look better on a job resume in the future. Last spring I was invited by the owners to attended an award ceremony with them because we were voted the best clothing store in the area (even beating places like Nordstrom!).


As for my duties consist of the following: 

-   assist with customers (all sales duties, it’s a small shop)

-   research new brands for the store to begin carrying

-   fully process new shipments (sign for, create, add photos, decide MSRP, etc.) 

-   write up descriptions for individual inventory item / website brand landing pages 

-   add new items to our online store 

-   create displays for in store advertising 

-   and social media advertising  

-   occasionally email customers and suppliers who with inquiries about products or orders

-   on my off days I will work online researching brands, or visiting other local clothing stores to check out their inventory in person- taking notes on brands that could fit well in our store.

I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal.

Upon graduating, she applied to a school close to the city we live in, and did not make it in. This was apparently normal for this school, and a few people she knew that had been accepted told her to get some part-time experience in the field, and apply again the next year. This is exactly what she did and the second go round she got all the way to a second interview and crushed it. Thought for sure she had it this time, but, no. They told her the average gpa in that application year was the highest in history and they strictly stick to the higher pool. They spoke so highly of her, and begged her to apply again the following year. 

Well life happened, and bills need to be paid, so she really needed to land a decent paying job. She applied for a certain rental car company position and got it. Pay is decent, benefits and vacation are killer, but the hours and work atmosphere have taken a beating on her. Truthfully, she has hit the point where she hates her job. She will randomly apply to other jobs, and has received many offers, but the pay/benefits are exceptionally bad in comparison to her current job. She wants out bad enough that a pay hit is ok, but the offers received have been laughably bad. This really kills her motivation to keep pushing, and I truly don’t know what to do to help. I’ve told her to just quit to clear her mind and relax and it’ll happen, but she won’t do it. I constantly search for job openings in hope I can find something good, but she normally shoots down the ones I find. 

I have a good career and have been excelling and it partly makes me feel guilty how it’s worked out for me. I want her to have the feeling of self worth in her job that I know she yearns for, but I don’t know how to give it to her. She’s the love of my life, and I want nothing more than to see her happy. Her current day to day has really beaten her down. I really want to help her, but I can’t seem to find the right angle on it or what exactly I can even do to truly help her. 

I’m seeking guidance on what I can do to help without pushing her too much.  Good career options with her current degree are hard to come by and openings are few and far between. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

How did you go about it?,careerguidance,"So, I’ve always been interested in many things, which made it hard for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I’ve tried both the natural and the social sciences, but eventually went for a BA in English. After all, I loved writing and reading.

After about three years of working, I just realized that writing for a living just isn’t for me. Now, I want to go back to one of my first loves—environment and the natural world. 

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

- I’m currently taking some online courses on the subject to see if I’d really be interested in them, as well as to narrow down my interests. I’m not planning to look for jobs until next year, so I have a lot of time! (Keeping my writing job for now.)
- Once the pandemic dies down, I do plan on volunteering on an environmental advocacy org. It’s a little intimidating because I’ve never done this before, but I do want to have hands-on experience (and network while I’m at it).
- I don’t plan going straight back to school! I really want to have some related experience in the field before I do and be really sure I like the subject. I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
- I know I did say I started to “hate” writing, but I also know that it’s my most marketable skill right now. The positions I’m targeting are definitely writing-related. If this pans out, maybe I’d end up sticking with it, who knows.
- I’m doing content writing right now, which has been really soul-sucking for me. Plus, I’ve also stopped doing creative writing, which was my major and something I thought I’d want to do for the rest of my life. (Hence, the “I hate writing” bit.)

I’ve been at this company for about 2.5 years, but my heart has never been in it. I took the job for the money. I moved from client-side back to consulting.


Though I’ve been looking for a new role elsewhere since I started the job, (and gotten a few offers over this duration), I liked my coworkers and wanted to give it an honest try.  TBH, it wasn’t going so badly. 


Then at the start of 2019, there was a leadership change both at CEO level, and Regional Director (RD) for my geography.  It’s been a massive cultural shift, especially in our region where the new RD was brought in from a competitor with a very different business approach.  It’s a very poor cultural alignment. 


Now there is lots of alienation among the existing leadership cohort as new RD brings in his team from his past company. Of course these new joiners all have a similar cultural approach.  It’s getting pretty toxic all around as several of us know we are being setup to exit the business. 


I’m not immune.  My role is being redefined under this new regime. RD no longer wants me in a region-wide team leadership and oversight role, he just wants me to focus on my city, hands on with projects. It’s great that I won’t have to travel so much, but it feels like a demotion, not the next step to long term success.


HQ (on another continent) loves my work so far and has offered me additional equity in the company. I have great support back there and my overall salary situation is fantastic. As the new RD seems to be pushing me out the door, the award of equity feels like a mind-f**k.


I’m eager to move on, but golden handcuffs are tough to shake off.  I need to do the best I can where I am at until I find another landing spot. 


So what to say in the goal setting?  I’m totally unengaged, disinterested, and resentful. 


I know playing it too candidly isn’t the right thing, even though my line manager is equally disaffected by the organisational transformation that surrounds us. 


Any suggestions on how to do this dance would be appreciated.

Third, what about personal development? Think of your next job, and a skill that you'd need on the job there that you have yet to possess/perfect.

858,bnojli,False,,45,Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,careerguidance,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

351,go32r2,False,,122,Unhappy with my degree | How to move out of copywriting / advertising ?,careerguidance,"I’m about to turn 26 and I’m tired of feeling unmotivated and directionless.

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

He started verbally listing all the things I was doing wrong, the stupidest one being that I always played with my hair while working.

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

I said ""what news?"" and he told me there was a request to disable my computer access because boss was going to fire me. This followed a couple of months of deteriorating conditions on the job, and on this day I had actually gone in early to talk to him about how things were going. [Twilight Zone theme]

I had already received a meeting request that morning from boss for like 10am so I was already thinking in terms of how the next few hours should go. After he went back to hold his 9am daily meeting, I gathered up all my stuff and walked out the front door. A few hours later I got a voicemail from him saying ""You missed a meeting, so I'm going to have to let you go.""

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

579,a2lzzv,False,,89,What in the world can I do with two LibArts degrees besides burn them for warmth?,careerguidance,"tl;dr version: I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I was unprepared and I panicked. I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.

I'll likely just do the presentation begrudgingly. I had a mini presentation that went well today which has given me some better feelings towards it.

However, I don't think people should be pushed to do what they don't want to do and they should create their own goals with their managers, not have things foisted upon them. Allowing people to grow at their own pace within their own bounds is crucial for authentic, healthy development.

Also there's a difference between being encouraged and being carelessly pushed.

Thanks to the nice people who commented!

It pretty much says it in the title.

I have manageable but very present social anxiety and despite this have taken on more and more team and client presentations over the past year. Now my boss is pushing me to do a company-wide presentation as a challenge. I haven't revealed that I have anxiety but I identified that I was proud of my group leadership in my performance review which is why I think I'm getting this 'push'. 

Frankly, I'm too anxious to. Already have lost sleep over the idea. It's too much of a jump too soon. I should add that this presentation has nothing to do with my day to day job and my boss isn't asking this of any other team member.

853,8x4cxi,False,,16,How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,careerguidance,"This is going to be a long read, and I apologize for it.  I've written this over 4 days and have tried to explain my situation as best as I can.  (It still seems to be a book, and I'm sorry about that.)

I graduated from college (BS, Economics) from a well-known mid-atlantic university in 1999. I was young, and I didn’t have a lot of direction. I wound up taking a job in Healthcare as an entry-level pharmacy technician, which was completely unrelated to my major. Initially, I had planned to stay there a year, two tops. By that time, I would figure out what I wanted to do and I’d start my destiny. But that’s not really how life works. I got very comfortable. I knew there was little to no upward mobility, but that was OK. The job was close to my home, my boss was friendly, the work was easy, and the hours were great. The pay wasn’t as high as I’d like, but for a recent college grad, living back at home, the money was just fine to both help my parents with bills and save some cash.

A few years after my hire date, I decided to continue working there while doing something I always wanted to do. I wanted to run my own company. I had/have solid IT skills. I was “that guy” that everyone went to in order to fix computer problems. Family, friends, and even at work I became the unofficial IT guy.  (With that added responsibility did come increased pay.)  I decided to monetize that, and I used my experience and knowledge to start an IT company. I went from 4 clients to over 1,100 (about 82&#37; of those repeats) and wound up running a very successful IT company for over a decade. I was young, I was able to work my 9-5, see clients till 9 or 10PM, work till 4AM in my basement repairing machines, and then get 3 hours of sleep to go back to my day job. I did this for about a decade, working most weekends from ages 24-35. Finally burning out, along with the industry changing, I closed the company when the disparity between income and expenses was getting too close. My wife and I also started our family, and raising kids and working 20 hours a day was not feasible for my own health or for being a parent.

I developed a good source of income from my computer company on-top of the “ok” income from the 9-5. I was able to start two 529’s. My children’s college will essentially be funded even if I never earn another dollar. I was also able to create a decent high five-figure nest egg which I have invested and don’t intent to touch.

19 years later, while I have moved up a little to Senior Lead Pharmacy Technician, the company has gone through several changes in ownership, and is now owned by a big company that you would definitely know.  I'm overpaid in the industry due to the length of time I've been there.  I’ve declined recent promotions because the local leadership is very poor, and the income increase for those positions is widely out of touch with the increase in responsibilities. Those positions would very likely kill me.  Very recently, many of my coworkers have resigned which has in some cases tripled the work the remaining people have to do which has presented not only unsafe situations for patients, but has induced a health-scare for me as a result of being overworked. My blood pressure skyrocketed the other day to unsafe levels, and it was completely work-induced. I don’t want to die at a desk in a job that I have come to hate.  I've come to the awakening that my departure is overdue.

I’m now 43 years old. I’m more or less in the same job I started in when I was 25. The roles have changed, the pay has increased, the responsibilities have increased. I need to find a new job, but I’m completely lost. I haven’t been on an interview in 19 years. I know how to write a resume, and I updated mine about 2 years ago in preparation for a move. I’m very well respected at my job, but they are suspicious as to why I don’t want the promotions. I am their lead performer in terms of branch metrics, as laid out by the company’s expectations. I simply no longer want to work under this atmosphere of the current leadership because it’s impacting my health. I’m at the point where I’m mentally OK with resigning before finding something else, but I know that is not a smart move. It is time for me to put my big guy pants on, and get out into the world and do something better to support my wife and kids.

**Here is my problem**: I don’t know what I can offer someone.  Not to get caught up in the buzzwords, but I’m reliable, dependable, honest, both public and private. I show up to work during snow storms of any amount, and I work really well with coworkers - I'm well respected by my peers, and I have become an ""unofficial leader"" among them.  I am a team player, and I’m not there to see only myself excel. I am good with computers, and I have 20 years of really solid customer service skills that I use to make even the most unhappy customer a happy one. A lot of that comes from working in healthcare; these people are sick and have little to no guidance other than me. More of that skill comes from when I ran my company. It was only me; I did sales, cold calls, marketing, advertising, on-site repairs, workshop repairs, customer service, billing, all of the financials, and when something went wrong, I had to be there to take the hit, accept responsibility and make the situation right for the customer.  I wore all of the hats.

Even with all of the above, I feel like I still don’t know what I can offer someone, and I have no idea what industry would be mutually beneficial based upon my skill set(s).

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know that this is a very general question, but even resources where I could go to find out where I might fit in would be helpful.   For my own health, I have to step out of acute healthcare. My IT skills have waned a little bit, and I’m definitely not up on the newest and greatest. I have no certifications, not even A+ back in the day. I just knew how to talk to people, I could fix things, and keep people happy. I could work the magic, and it worked out for everyone.

I just feel really lost, and it is my own fault. I’m just looking for help.  I'm not opposed to any industry, just not acute healthcare.  My heart (and body) are no longer in it.

330,efwhmo,False,,119,"I'm a manager and I don't know why but working for just profit feels wrong, can you help me out?",careerguidance,"I have tried to conceptualize wtf is wrong with my situation, but I don't really know. I think at the core of it is that as a manager I am consistently told I should be doing what brings the most profit for the business, but yet I feel like sometimes doing what is most profitable is also being a dick to my employees. Exploiting them as much as possible is the most profitable for the company.

I feel like my boss is not a person who seeks to pay people for the work they put in. He seeks to avoid giving raises as long as possible until his hand is forced, which is shitty because its basically him trying to exploit you as much as possible for as cheap of pay as possible EVEN when he recognizes value.

So my problem is two fold:

1. My perspective makes me feel like my boss relatively takes advantage of labor surplus to exploit workers for pay. We are being paid way less than him yet take on nearly just as much stress for our work. He takes trips to europe constantly.

2. The system of competing companies encourages us to under pay everyone in order to have the most future investment. Future value at the cost of current people and their happiness in their lives. How is that fair to the people of today?

I'm being pressured to ask for a higher quality of work from my employees when I already think they are underpaid and that they won't get raises even if they do more. How can I sit there and tell them to do more when they already seem underpaid to me? Hell minimum wage buys so little. The thing is, capitalism seems to be a big game of who can skeet their workers hardest. On the one hand, my current owner of the company I manage for makes too much and does too little. Frankly it is not good for a company to overpay anyone because long term profits go down from a lack of investment. How is it that every company can underpay all of their employees and that be whats best? 

Like these kinds of things don't even make sense to me in a moral sense. How can it be moral for us all to be underpaid? I'm just so confused when I think about business. How is it that my employees lives blow and yet I am still being asked to ask more of them?? Someone please explain that too me. I sit in my room trying to conceptualize it all and it feels like every time I think about it I'm just getting lost. Like I cant even sort it all out because none of it makes any sense. Why is our society this way?? If my workers are being underpaid in my opinion, yet globally others are willing to do the work for less, than I need to be getting more out of them. Yet they are already miserable. I am asking them to be more miserable. It is miserable.

How is it that my boss can take home a big fat stack of cash and that be fair? I just don't get it. How can bezos be paid 100000 per hour and it be fair? His work could not POSSIBLY be THAT stressful. Talent is being made happy and yet we are claiming that by paying talent it is intrinsically worth it to us. It's worth it to overpay Bezos because we get our value back? How could that be possible?

I can't even freaking figure out if my employees are overpaid or underpaid because they are miserable and life sucks on minimum wage in the US, yet people across the globe are willing to do their job for drastically less because they have never known better. It just makes no sense. How can my employees be broke nearly 24/7 and yet I need to be asking them to do more work than what they are doing?

I want to help people. I don't want to live a happier life than anyone else, but I don't know how to evaluate what is fair I guess. I have noticed how if you give people an inch they take a mile. They always accept handouts because many are not in it to be fair, they are in it for themselves. They don't give back when someone is too generous. But in order for me to not be too generous, I need to be putting a dollar amount on their work and idk how in my workplace because I dont think the work is worth it for the pay, but apparently it is? It's just I get confused. I'm trying to get fight some sort of unfairness I seem to perceive in the world and the people who have so little but I can't pinpoint what the unfairness is exactly.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/axwty0/i_cry_in_the_office_bathroom_everydqy_what_can_i/,87,"Hey man, first things first, I'm sorry you're going through this kind of anguish. Your coworkers are basically exiling you out of the group. And something triggered this change in group behavior. You need to figure out what it was.

Nobody would like being forced into social isolation. However if it gets to the point where it's making you cry everyday and you dread work, that's a red flag against yourself. Did a similar situation ever happen to you during your childhood, like in school or something? And was your reaction the same as now ? You might be a person that is high in agreeableness, maybe you're a very sensitive person.

And that's not a nice thing to be in the average workplace. Like at all. 

The workplace can be very socially intense, there's always an underlying atmosphere of friction and competitiveness. You really don't want to give off the impression that you're too nice and agreeable, too harmless, too emotional, not having the courage to confront people. Or else people will just step over you. I suspect that's what's going on here.

Maybe that girl you mentioned is a polar opposite of you personality-wise. And as a consequence she maybe hates you and has no respect for you and somehow communicated that sentiment to the group and the other co-workers resonated with it. Why would they lie to you over tea or lunch ? Maybe they think you're too soft, maybe they're talking behind your back about how lame you are and how you're probably crying in the bathroom every day. This is just my suspicion, but you tell whether that can be true or not.

Bottom line is that you need to stand up for yourself, and not accept that people lie to your face about not going to tea while you know they are doing so behind your back (make sure you're 100% sure though!). Not accept that they just ignore you by saying they're too busy, which is a total BS excuse btw, don't accept that. If you do, it's over, you're invisible, you don't matter, you're annoying, why bother inviting you? You gotta have some presence, don't be non-confrontational, show that you're not a pushover.

Whatever you do, don't just run runaway to another working environment. Your coworkers will get the last laugh and if you get to a new workplace then it might be the same thing all over again. Or worse.

Whatever you do, wipe away your tears. You allowed yourself to let other people's behavior towards you hurt you. Address the vulnerability and reclaim your emotional stability. Being socially ostracized hurts but maybe you are a part of the problem. Of course the behavior of your coworkers is straight up ""middle-school clique"" childish but hey some people are just immature / just as insecure as you and they will follow the group like sheeps.

Hope some of this helps, I used to be very shy, sensitive, agreeable, but now I'm not a pushover anymore and I don't accept shit from anyone. I encourage you to hold yourself to a fair standard ",2019-03-06 09:08:56

* *Step away from the computer.* Take some time to rejuvenate by doing something you enjoy, whether it's baking, gardening, playing music...take a break.
* *Network.* I know it doesn't always sound like the most fun, but networking gives you an excuse to dress up and get out of the house. There's an added bonus potential of meeting someone who could connect you with your next job opportunity.
* *Celebrate all of your successes.* If you landed an interview but didn't ultimately get the job, that still means your materials were awesome enough to get you an interview. Likewise, if you set a goal to send out 10 applications per week, and you reach your goal, celebrate! Remembering to take pride in the small victories can help keep you moving. 
* *Post positive reminders.* Use phone notes, sticky notes, a whiteboard \- whatever method will grab your attention \- and inundate yourself with positive messages. Try posting inspirational quotes, short\-term goals, or pictures of loved ones to keep you motivated.

I have had a crazy few years. I studied Psychology at University after being really passionate about it during A-Levels.

I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated.

I've been feeling a lack of motivation at work for months now. I'm not too sure of the reason, but I think I know part of it. Which is, my skill level is way higher than most of my teammates. I always help them, but it's not my job to be educating them about everything, this is stuff they should've learned from their experience. Instead, I find myself constantly having to help people with their tasks, on a near daily basis. This is draining me. I feel like maybe this gap in the skill set is playing a major role in my lack of motivation, since if I'm being honest, I constantly feel like I'm being dragged down. My own progression at work has been really slow for a while.

I really don't know what I should do. Is it simply time to leave the job? Should I just tell my boss that the team needs some professional training? But then again, I don't want my team to think I think they suck. I don't think they do, I just honestly think that their skill level should be higher considering the amount of experience they have. I personally have about the same amount of experience as they do, so I can't find an explanation for the skill gap. Another possibility I'm dreading is that this could be a sign of depression. Could that also be a possibility or does it sound just absurd?

682,c3hcfz,False,,30,How do you approach applying for new positions after getting fired?,careerguidance,"Crossposting this to several subs so I can reach the widest audience possible. Reddit, I need some advice.

&#x200B;

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a ""don't give a shit"" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 ""maybe you should just show up to work on time"" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

&#x200B;

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that ""don't give a shit"" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c3hcfz/how_do_you_approach_applying_for_new_positions/,89,"You don't need to tell them that you were fired for excessive tardiness, because this wasn't the REAL reason you were fired. Look at it this way:

In your words, you were in a ""don't give a shit"" attitude, so you *wanted* to leave. Your tardiness was just a surface manifestation of something deeper—*not being valued by the company.* So instead of up and quitting, you essentially got them to fire you by showing up late. I'm sure you're not the type of person who is incapable of showing up on time. After all, you were in a senior level position.

So, the true reason you and the company parted ways was a difference in what you valued. Sure, on paper they fired you, but the true reason was that you and the company had different values.

Now when it comes to discussing this with potential employers, it's important to present it in an amicable way. Something like you ""outgrew the position"" or are just looking to be challenged further. Personally, if someone had ""drama"" at their last position I'm very suspect as they're bound to repeat history. If you need to use a reference from your last job, it's important you communicate why you left as well, so they understand.

That being said, it's important that you analyze what happened in your last position so it doesn't happen again. I would ask yourself ""How was I complicit in creating the conditions at my last job that I said I didn't want?"" I'm sure the company had some fault as they weren't paying you enough, but it's important to see what part *you* played in not getting payed enough, or not being valued. ",2019-06-21 22:18:20

110,hpbm4b,False,"Cleveland, OH",110,Is it morally wrong to choose a career that doesn't work to solve the world's most severe problems?,careerguidance,"I'm 22 and just graduated college. Naturally, I'm focusing on establishing a career. I've always been interested in the concept of work. Ever since the end of high school, I've thought a lot about why people work and how to have a fulfilling career. This is easily the aspect of my life which I seem to value most, although this value comes from a sense of duty/social obligation rather than my own interest. So there's this question that's been bugging me for awhile.

As I explore different career paths people are pursuing, I can't help but notice that so many of them seem to be kind of... worthless. I make this statement with a lot of skepticism because I don't want to be judgmental with so little information. It's just that I notice so many problems happening in the world: hunger, disease, mental illness, violent crime, oppression, war, poor education, accidents, etc. However, few of these issues are directly effecting me. I live a comfortable life of abundance, security, and all the pleasures one could ask for. Some of this is a result of my own doing, as I enjoy rewards I have earned, but far more of it is just a result of circumstance. I was born in the USA, I'm intelligent, I'm able-bodied, I have a close family, I had access to relatively good education, to name a few of my blessings. But I earned none of this. I don't feel guilty for winning the lottery of circumstance, but I do feel guilty for not helping those who didn't. So here's my question: **is it morally wrong to pursue a career that primarily serves or benefits those on the higher end of the quality of life scale instead of dedicating one's life to solve the world's more severe problems?**

I realize that it's difficult to measure the value produced by, say, a film studio. What if someone is inspired by a movie and decides to travel to a third world country and build a school? But still, it seems that a film studio is just a bunch of people spending time, money, and energy playing with cameras and lights, like a game, when there's people in the world who don't have food. How about another example, a marketing firm that works with fashion brands to sell more expensive sunglasses? I mean seriously? You're working day in and day out to push pieces of plastic people wear on their face so they're a little more comfortable seeing outside? While people are dying of infections diseases because they don't have sanitation infrastructure? Or how about a business accountant? Crunching numbers to make sure you're getting the best tax return so that you can pay your dividends to shareholders so they can buy a new set of golf clubs to hit balls around on huge grass fields where homeless people would be kicked out for sleeping because they have nowhere else to go? I know my perspective is limited and ill informed, but there is truth to the basic concept: people spend resources solving comparatively minor problems when there are very serious issues affecting others in the world.

**What do you think about this? Is it morally wrong to not try to solve the world's biggest problems, if you have the ability to do so? If so, how might we change this about the world? How do we motivate people to create value where is more needed?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hpbm4b/is_it_morally_wrong_to_choose_a_career_that/,276,"You’re 22 - there’s a lot of world and a lot of opportunity out there. Now is your chance to do something you’re passionate about, something exciting.  That may mean helping others, or it may mean another path.  

First you need to keep your lights on, food on your table, and to not be a burden yourself, on the public dole.  If you pursued a marginal value degree, think about what you might need to do to monetize it. Consider risk, and manage it - don’t run from it or run towards it.  Be smart. 

The greatest benefit to others will be when you have the time, resources and energy to put towards things that matter to you personally.  The bleeding heart, eating cat food and earning minimum wage, bless them for doing so, might not be the right path for everyone.  

And capitalism and creating “value” of different types isn’t the evil that the leftists would try to indoctrinate you into thinking. I agree with the sentiment of movie production or fashion.  But people, even the socialists who want to own more of people’s’ labor for supposed betterment, like that stuff. Entertainment, storytelling, fashion, these aren’t modern things - they’re ages old. They’re human nature. The fact that there’s so much money in that vs other greater challenges is indeed sad, but it’s humanity’s making, and it’s not going to change.  Best you can do is vote with your wallet and route your resources when you have them, elsewhere.

However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason.

ps: by ""architect"" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term ""architect"". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them ""architect"" or ""engineer"" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say ""he is the licensed architect"". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

765,binfaf,False,,21,"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?",careerguidance,"I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience. The ""dead wood"", by comparison, seem to know they are on to a good thing and try not to rock the boat.

I unlocked it and on the screen was an email between my boss, his manager and the HR rep about how my time there is limited and originally they were going to let me go last week but the new hire was on vacation. The language in the email was pretty insulting tbh as I have a medical condition that involves a compromised immune system, so I get sick about once per month for a day or two, and they were calling me a 'pussy' and a 'punk' for calling in sick so frequently. Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me? Personally I hate this job so it might be a blessing in disguise but it's hard to find a decent paying job out here with my job experience (or lack thereof).

I have about $100k in student loans that I am already aggressively paying down, but getting to a net worth of $0 is going to take about 3 years. 

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay. 

**I want to work but there doesn't seem to be any worthwhile work to be done.** I am a bored, soulless desk sitter waiting for 6.

158,hrptg7,False,Portugal (Europe),37,I have made a huge mistake and switched to a new company mid-pandemic. I hate it. What should I do?,careerguidance,"A few months ago I was contacted by a head hunter for a job with a much higher salary in a very prominente company, better benefits and lots of flexibility.  
At this point, I was employed for 2,5 years in a fairly good company, which had its problems, but I could deal with them. They didn't pay very well, though, but I had lots of flexibility, a great team and super interesting projects.  
At the same time I was contacted by this head hunter, I was going through the selection process to my dream job and I had made it until the last phase where it was just me or another person.    
So, I had 2 very good opportunities on the table: my dream job and the other job which was better. I decided it was safe to quit.  
As you may imagine, I was not selected for my dream job. So I was left with a very good job offer, which was ok for me. I took it and here I am, 2 months later.  
My mistake was that I was so convinced I was going to get the dream job that I didn't pay attention to the signs in my interactions with my current employer that this was bad, nor did I dedicate any effort to get to know a bit more of the company.   
This new company is absolutely the worst. They literally lied in the interviews about the company’s working culture, their stance about flexibility and even about some aspects of my contract.  
I got in the company in the middle of a HUGE crisis where I immediately took a ton of responsibility and I felt it would not be correct for my colleagues if I quit during my experience period and leave them with all of this by themselves. 2 of them are really great, one of them actually quit last week. The company has a huge turnover, as you can imagine.  
I am finding out more and more horrific things about this company every day. My boss is a hypocrite, liar, has no empathy, treats women poorly, and everything revolves around him and how brilliant he is. Overall a sick narcissist. Last year alone, 2 people had burnouts and 1 had a stroke after working 4 days without sleeping.  
I worked 2 national holidays and 1 full weekend, plus a million extra hours for an event, which I would not do in a normal situation, but everything was very badly managed and if I didn’t, nothing would work. The day after the event I was told we could take one day off (which is not enough either way), so I took it, but apparently it just meant that instead of arriving at 9:30 I could arrive at 10:00. And this is not even a joke or me exaggerating.  
I’m not going to rant anymore, but many other very horrible things have happened and I honestly don’t know what to do. There should be an economic crisis coming up and I’m not sure I can just quit without anything lined-up. I don’t want to be unemployed when it hits. I have applied to 3 jobs so far that I’m waiting for an answer. 1 of them with people I know and who really appreciate my job, another one for a position that I’m 100% qualified, and another one that actually I will not take at all even if I’m selected because it is not very interesting. In addition, I have a volunteer project writing articles in my area for a think tank and I would like to take a programming bootcamp.  
I was absolutely naïve and I didn’t even make an effort to try to research about them, I know this is my fault. I never thought this was ever a possible scenario. But I just feel that coming here every day is doing a number on my mental health. I absolutely HATE being here and I’m actually scared that they can screw up my career if I stay longer. I’ve heard stories.  
Should I just quit? Should I suck it up and train my resilience skills?

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *""Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?""*

I have been working in a hospital for 5 years in an allied health career. I’m extremely organized and self-sufficient. When there are workflow changes, or new software additions I always learn quickly and coworkers come to me for help. I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration?

595,ctakj5,False,,41,Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.,careerguidance,"About a year ago, I left a terrible job. I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* ""HIGH turnover.""
* ""Terrible work culture.""
* ""Unrealistic expectations.""
* ""Stifling company culture adds to low morale."" 
* ""Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work.""
* ""Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded.""
*  ""You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees.""

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months?

I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

&#x200B;

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

999,cd1qan,False,,44,"Help! Any advice for me? Nearly 40, looking to start over.",careerguidance,"Hello, reddit.  I'm here looking for as many people's opinions as I can get, and hopefully even some specific advice as to what I should do with my life.  I'll be 39 years old next month (seems like I was 25 yesterday), and it's time for me to make a big change.  My problem is, I have never had many interests that were a driving force or a passion in terms of career, and I have never had any particular skillset that is advanced enough to consider unique or particularly desirable to employers.  

A summarized description of my work history up to this point is as follows:

I started working at a very young age, and have always been a valued employee at any job I've ever had.  At around 21 years old I started working off the books running a coffee truck route in New York (where I currently reside).  I made a large amount of money doing that, but I was young, foolish, and of the mindset that the money train would never stop, so I spent wildly. Eventually, the business began to deteriorate due to many factors outside of my control, but it basically began a decline into obsolescence due to an industry wide refusal to change and adapt with the times.  I continued this job for 13 years.  That's 13 years of working completely off the books, without benefits or any form of retirement investments, as well as several years at the end which were rough enough financially to wipe out anything I had in savings at the time.  During those last years I did decide to go to college however, and I pursued a bachelors in psychology.  I naively took loans out every semester, and never graduated.  In fact I dropped out with just one course left to complete my degree program.  My current job, which I've had since the end of my stint as a coffee truck driver, is in the marine transportation industry.  I got the job, with no background in the field, via the recommendation of a friend.  The job pays very well for someone without a degree (over 100k), and I've managed to learn quite a bit in the 4 years I've been here.  My problem is, I don't like it, and I feel it's not going to last.  Not going to last for several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that the company may actually fold within the coming year due to an astoundingly bad couple of years marred with incidents and loss of business.  I should also mention that my time here doesn't really qualify me for work in the same field with different companies, because it's very specific to this particular company.  In addition, the pay for comparable jobs at similar companies pay about half of what I'm making now.   I'm trying to come up with a ""what next"" plan and I'm really struggling.


I feel I'm a very competent person, and I don't feel limited by my ability to learn any new job/skill.  But I'm almost 40.  I need a job that pays well, and that I'm interested in enough to want to stay for good.  I would also ideally like to find a job which allows me the flexibility to travel (I've held jobs for my entire life that have been extremely inflexible in terms of taking days off), but I understand that I can't make that priority number one.  I should mention that although I am swimming in student debt, I would consider going back to school (for no longer than 2 years), if the resulting potential job paid well enough for me to live comfortably and pay off my debt.  As I've said, my interests are varied and I do feel confident that I could learn most anything, but if it means anything at all I've always been incredibly fascinated by insects, traveling, plants and animals. I am also open to moving almost anywhere, including out of the country if that's what it takes.

Go see a financial advisor, or debt consolidator. You need to stop the leak before you drown. 

I suspect one of the reasons you're trying to find a new career is you're probably so unhappy and stressed out by your financial situation that you think some perfect job is going to come fix everything, but that's simply not the case.

I've worked in the film industry (couldn't stand it because my personality doesn't fit the ego and status driven culture), a small business in trading (I liked the autonomy but had no passion for selling merchandise), teaching (love working with children and I'm great at it but it gets exhausting), government (struggled with the bureaucracy but enjoyed the easy pace), animation production (being a small cog in a giant system made me depressed).  

I'm smart and hard-working so I generally succeed in whatever I do.  But I find that I always get tired of a job after a year or two and move on to something different.  I recently quit my animation job and thought that I wanted to pursue stand-up comedy professionally.  I do have a knack for it: performing, writing and comedy.  But after a few months of performing as an amateur, I now think this is something I'd like to pursue as a hobby and not an occupation.  

I recently took a Jackson Vocational Interest Survey and my top 3 interests are 1. social science, 2. professional advising and 3. performing arts.  

I'm now thinking that I'd like to work for a non-profit that helps youths.  I've always found it fulfilling to help youths to develop themselves and achieve their goals (mainly because this is what I wish I had when I was younger.) I'm hoping that if I pursue this line of work for income and pursue stand-up as a hobby that I'll be fulfilled spiritually, financially and creatively.  But I'm scared that even this I'll get tired of after a year or two and end up where I am now.

Are there other people like me?  Is my problem that I just haven't found a line of work that works for me - the assumption being that there is a ""right fit"" for everyone?

905,cv9hmx,False,,25,How do you turn down a promotion?,careerguidance,"For background, I have a masters in counseling, am a published author of 4 research studies in professional journals, I have more than 15 years of experience in mental health, most of which are as a therapist. Several times throughout my career, I was on the path to licensure and invariably, my job responsibilities would change (eg: management) and the offer to support it would be forgotten (and unnecessary for the new responsibilities). 

Recently, my position of a year as a therapist became team leader and came again with the promise of having someone at my workplace (who was qualified) supervise me so that I accumulate the hours for licensure. Again, it fell through and I’m not willing or interested in licensure. In my field, it means little in terms of money and a significant amount of additional work. I’ve tried to get out of this field for years but have resigned myself to sitting right where I am, with flexibility, freedom and time to work on side jobs (eg: freelance writing). I Meade $39k a year and was already told that with licensure, they would increase that $500. No thanks.

Sorry this is long. Anyway, my supervisor is now dangling another carrot, telling me that they intend to make me a manager in the near future. I guess if I were at the beginning of my career it might be enticing but I can’t think of anything I’d rather do less. I’m a great worker, fantastic documentarian, supportive and encouraging of my staff and willing to work above and beyond 40 hours every week (I’m salaried, so it’s irrelevant). Bottom line is I don’t want the position, at all. I also don’t want to lose the position I have, so I don’t want to insult the offer. I’m as busy as I want to be and they already get a bargain in the quality of my work. We get health insurance and no vision or dental or retirement. They haven’t in 30+ years and have no intention to do so, so we have to purchase/invest on our own. 

How do I turn down a management position without insulting the organization? I’d love to tell them the true reasons why I don’t want it but I won’t.

776,a06016,False,,44,"I’m a 29 yo flight attendant. If you were in my shoes, would you tough it out and keep flying until you can retire or start over? What else would you transition into?",careerguidance,"Growing up I was a typical straight A student/cheerleader/overachiever who never really put much thought into what I wanted to be when I grew up. I did what everyone else was doing and went to college where I gained a bachelors of science with a 3.5 gpa. I initially thought I wanted to go to pharmacy school but changed my mind after finishing the prerequisites & working a couple years as a full time pharmacy technician. At that age I wasn’t motivated by money (I am now) and felt like I would be bored to death performing quality control on medications everyday. Soooo it was a NO for me. Instead of quitting altogether, 3 years in, I made the decision to at least finish what I’d started and spend my 4th year putting my credits towards a biology degree. (Full disclosure, Low scores on the PCAT exam & HIGH stress levels trying to study and balance life played a role in this choice...) Fast forward to today, I cannot see myself going back to school to do anything else in the healthcare industry. Just watching shows like greys anatomy or botched and the thought of more student loans make me VERY nauseous. 


Prior to college and since graduating, I’ve had various roles in hospitality/customer service: cooking, hosting, catering, serving, bottle service/bartending, etc and have been lucky enough to keep a position as a flight attendant for the past 6 years. 
In the beginning, it was GREAT! I traveled the world and never really saw it as “work” but for the past almost 3 years, that’s changed drastically & I’ve had a daily internal struggle over what else I can do with my life. The actual job itself is EASY but the lack of sleep = constant jet lag, living out of a suitcase, time alone/away from loved ones, and just having to be personable all the time is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m depressed and I know it’s because of my current lifestyle. I used to just enjoy my time alone at home on days off but I’ve become such an introvert that I barely want to leave the house/hotel rooms or talk to anyone now at all unless I HAVE to. Im never rude to passengers and have a perfect attendance record, but when I work with so many bubbly personalities and see people who genuinely want to go above and beyond inflight, it just confirms even more that this role isn’t for me anymore. I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and care more about consistency, stability, & work/life balance or just bored with life in general and need to stick with something that will stimulate my mind. I wish I had some sort of passion I could be pursuing in my down time, but I don’t. I thought about teaching and became a substitute for a year but couldn’t see it as a long term career either. I’m afraid I have already become complacent like many of my colleagues who’ve been flying an average of 20-40 years yet have the same complaints I do. With everything being seniority based, they say things get better with time but I’m not convinced. Also I barely use my flight benefits so they aren’t a factor keeping me “stuck” 


I STAY on indeed & the career section of so many companies & apply for jobs constantly but I’m also constantly rejected for positions I’m qualified to do (flight attendant supervisor, recruiter, instructor, anything hotel related etc) and I don’t have the experience or education required for anything outside this field paying a decent salary ($60k +). My degree is pretty much useless other than the fact that it shows I’m “smart” but clearly not smart enough to figure out a better life path. Anyone I’ve ever confided in has said “you’ll figure it out eventually” but like I said, it’s been years and I still haven’t found my calling. I’m grateful for the paycheck/benefits and understand that many ppl do not ENJOY their jobs but my job has become my entire life and I’m no longer enjoying much of it at all.

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever.

My complaint is that the machines I run have anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours to complete one part; usually it's about one hour. I work a 10 hour shift.

Then they CALL me - to tell me I was rejected, as if one rejection wasn’t enough. The HR person said the feedback was really good, but they just went with someone else. And that I’d be considered for other jobs there. So, I said thanks for letting me know and moved on.

Is this normal? Or does it mean nothing? I know normally I just get email rejections, so the standard “your resume will be kept on file” means nothing. But it felt weird for her to tell me that on the phone, if it was just a formality.

Now, there are some problems that surfaced (that I wasn't aware of during my time there).

I got a new job and I am excited. But talking to this old coworker is making me feel anxious and scared and making me feel all the things I used to feel back then, like hating myself and feeling like I am not able to do anything right.

I have a couple of months of rent saved up , will be starting school next week (video editing and production) at a local community college (very low cost) and already have a part time job lined up at a local restaurant.

However, as happy as I am to be pursuing something I’ve always wanted to do and chase after my dreams. The “logical” side of my brain which chooses the money is going nuts. Mind you, there is no way I will go back to Logistics, I’ve grown to hate the job and the repetitiveness of it. I worked at one of the best logistics companies in the world with great benefits an awesome team and good pay. None of this was enough as I simply no longer had any interest in it. I was basically dragging myself out of bed every morning and had become anxiety ridden and depressed feeling as if I was just slowly rotting in my cubicle.

I am actually excited for the restaurant job even though it will only pay a fraction of my old job because its something different . But I know I want to make more money than I did before. Not to mention, I will need a steady income to buy equipment and build my media company as I grow my skills.

Again, lots of people have asked why I didnt stay at my old job amd went to school at the same time. With 55+ hours of work a week and my hate towards the job it was just not possible. I wanted out . So going back to that is simply not an option . If rather struggle with part times until I find something else than go back to it.

With that said. I am 31 now and have been working since age 17. Ive been a delivery driver, warehouse supervisor, got a BA in Psychology, have some experience in sales and worked as a logistics coordinator for the last 7 years.

Nonetheless, right now I dont have kids a mortgage or any debt. But my savings aren’t huge either just enough to get by for about 4-5 months plus whatever I make on the part time.

Ive looked into e-commerce and drop-shipping since I have extensive experience with imports from Asia and Europe due to my work in logistics. However, that industry really seems like a gamble and I dont have money to spare/throw away in hopes of getting lucky.

I do speak spanish fluently and have no trouble befriended and talking to people so there’s that as well.

If it were me though, knowing what I know now, i'd get back into your field with an actual exit plan, instead of just quitting and hoping something strikes you.

474,eq8dfj,False,,54,Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?,careerguidance," 

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be ""the occasional day of 8 hour screen time,"" but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.

What the question is trying to ask is, say you have two jobs, A and B. And let's say they both pay the same, let's say $60K just for argument's sake. If you have two offers, you'll take the job that seems to have the best work, obviously.

But let's say B pays $65K. Do you automatically take B? Or do you take A if the work is clearly better? What if it's $70K? $80K? $100K?

The 'correct' answer - and by 'correct' I mean actually correct and not just 'interview correct' - is that you prefer the better job \_unless\_ the pay for that job is clearly not market, i.e., you're being taken advantage of.

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

I didn't pass probation. It was an economist position. I'm new to the workforce, been working since graduation for ~11 months.

I feel some of it was my fault, but some of it was not. I did my best, and thought i was doing well. I could do things that others there couldn't do. I met deadlines (where they were given to me). I learnt R on the job, and in a month i could write complex geospatial analyses in R to help with evidence-building to work out effective consumer choice.

But around 3 months into the job it looks like (and only on the last day did i realise) management was assembling evidence to boot me out. A report was drafted and the managers agreed i should not pass probation.

Comments made to me were:

* Couldn't get a piece of R  work done on time (the code was done by another team member and malfunctioning. Worse still, another team member left it half done and didn't touch it for a month. I was effectively blamed for that.)
* Didn't understand a concept around a productivity measure (i did, but the data i relied on another organisation to give it to me was never there - so i tried alternative measures which didn't make sense)
* Inability to let things go (true - i kept thinking someone had a problem with me so i made sure i didn't do something wrong by accident)
* Asked too many questions (could have told me to stop, and would have)
* Attention to detail lacking sometimes (in the cases they raised, they said it was ""fine""...ugh)

Some things said of me wasn't really true, so i think a part of it was that i didn't click with the team (esp. the managers).

But i don't care about blaming people. I care about making sure this never happens again. How do i reflect on this?

I have interviews lined up, and i'm actually in close contention for one position (they didn't get this employer's reference and accepted the reason i gave - which technically is not a lie). 

How can i be sure if i get a similar position, i don't fuck it up? I can't bear giving up on an economist career (at least for a while) after this failure, but is being an economist even right for me?

I'm in my 4th year of doing software implementations and I hate it. I've worked for 3 different companies so far, switching because I always thought that I hated my job because of the companies that I worked for, but I've recently come to the conclusion that it's not the company, but more the actual type of work/industry that I just don't jive well with. I hate it because -

1. I'm overworked. I know this is a problem for a lot of people, but I really value work/life balance and I always end up working \~60 hours a week because there is just so much work to do all the time. I'm always overwhelmed. 
2. I don't care. I'm not passionate about implementing software solutions for large companies to help them save money on software purchases in the long run. When things get hard it's difficult to convince myself it's worth it because what I do doesn't matter to me. 
3.  It doesn't feel real. Working virtually via monitors and phones means the work that I'm doing doesn't feel tangible. I'm not out in the real world providing value in a physical way, which is discouraging. I'm working from home (which is kind of nice) and rarely ever seeing people in real life and all of the solutions I build are on customer servers that I never see the benefits from after I'm done with the project.
4. I constantly get shit on. Software is complicated and things break and/or need to be customized all the time. Clients hate this and even when it's not my fault at all I'm always the guy to get blamed first. This is taxing on me and drives my stress levels through the roof, which I truly believe is causing some real problems with my physical and mental health at this point. I'm constantly under a lot of pressure and project managers are constantly all over me to get work done faster, even when it's unrealistic. 

I chose this career path mainly because there is so much opportunity in the field and it's pretty lucrative (I make around $90k right now). Now I'm realizing that even if I was paid 50% more I still wouldn't want to do this anymore. It's time to figure out what to do next, but that's where things get complicated. I'm interested in a lot of fields, but of course each field has it's own issues and I'm trying to figure out what would work well for me. Some of the topics I'm interested in include -

1. Aviation. I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a kid and tried to go to flight school when I was 19, but I failed the medical exam for an issue that I've been dealing with since then so I might not be able to pass the exam now either (chronic kidney stones)
2. Construction. I've helped build 2 houses before over the course of 2 years and I really enjoyed it. I don't want to do anything too back breaking as I get older though. I would really like to flip houses or be a construction manager or something someday, just not sure how to do either of these without a lot of capital or experience at this point. 
3. Small business ownership. My dad owns a small business and it's worked out really well for him. I've always been interested in entrepreneurship, but taking the leap has always seemed too risky for me because I have student loan and medical debt, and also I'm not sure what kind of business to start (especially without any real startup capital). 

A couple of other important factors to consider in my decision making process here are the facts that my girlfriend, who I plan to marry, is a 3rd year medical student so we will likely be moving in a little under two years for her residency. Also I have 2 bachelor's degrees in business (Information Systems and International Business) which I still have about $20k of debt for. I also love travelling and being outdoors a whole lot. I like helping people and animals and hate corporate america with all of it's politics, bureaucracy, conference calls etc. I'm also a pretty good people person, even though what I do now is very technical I'm better at the business side of my job than I am at the technical side. 

Again I'm sorry for the novel of a post, I'm just really down in the dumps and trying to figure out what change to make in my life and I really feel like I need some 3rd party perspective on what might be a good direction to head in.

439,cd6hno,False,,76,"35 y/o, $500K~ net worth, Senior Manager in tech... but no degree and having a hard time advancing further. Is an online BA + MBA worth it at my age, or should I invest in other ways?",careerguidance,"**TL:DR is in the title.**

35 years old, attended college for 5-6 years but never finished a degree. About 15-20 hours away, but haven't enrolled anywhere since 2008-09.

Ran a small business for a while, had other jobs, then in 2011 got into a niche online streaming industry very early and had success. Eventually became a founding member (but not an owner) of a start-up company in Silicon Valley that was later acquired by a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in the world. That happened four years.

Since that time, have worked my way up internally to Senior Manager ($160-170K), was on track for Director by end of this year ($200-220K), but unfortunately a new boss was hired from the East Coast and he and I are no simpatico. No demotion, but was involuntarily reassigned to a smaller role, managing 20% of the people I used to, all remote. It's time to go.

Due to my background and experience in what it still a relatively niche part of the industry, expected to be able to make a non-lateral move relatively easily. Was very wrong. No callbacks at all for Director+ level positions, only Senior Manager level positions. Have gone deep into the process in a few, but no offer yet but expecting one next week... but it'll be for a Senior Manager position with only a modest (10-20% pay increase). Have become convinced this is the result of a lack of a degree, especially an MBA, which those who were eventually hired into the best positions I sought had in common.

Currently engaged to be married next year and living together, household income of around $260K in the Bay Area, around $400K in stock and $100K in other investments tucked away. We're comfortable and stable.

Here's the question: At my age, does it make sense to sell about $150K in stock for me to complete an online degree at my former university (they offer Reagent Bachelor of Arts degrees (RBA) specifically for people in my situation) and then enroll at a top 10 online MBA school (most likely USC)? Or would I be better off letting that money grow, using it to fund other FIRE oriented projects, etc? Are online MBA's worth it? Or am I misguided in believing they're the big difference maker in breaking through to Director+ level?

Long term goal is to bank away $2MM minimum, $4MM optimum to retire as early as possible. How I get there doesn't matter to me.

769,dgoduj,False,,57,What can I do with my psychology degree?,careerguidance,"Hi all. 

I am a 23 year old about to graduate with my bachelors degree in psychology this December. I am posting here today because I am lost on what doors this degree opens for me. I went into college almost straight out of high school with no idea what I wanted to do. I went because that’s what I was expected to do. I told myself I’d figure out a career later. My entire time in college, I have also worked part-time jobs, ranging from food service to my current retail gig. Working and my full class schedule took up most of my time, and so I never explored my interests beyond the courses required for my degree. I did not volunteer or join clubs, I worked and got good grades. 

I have spent time looking for full time jobs I could get with my degree, and the ones that pay what I need to support myself all want experience of some sort. Currently, my parents are pressuring me to apply to law school and go from there. I’m not 100% sold on the idea of being a lawyer. I guess I’m just looking for advice on routes I can take with just a bachelors degree and customer service experience.

I'm pretty bad at human interaction. I'm an introvert, awkward and distant, and I always have trouble putting on the professional client-facing face that my coworkers do. I ended up in digital marketing and 2 years in, there's not much people interaction but as my career progresses I know there will be (i.e. company expands or if I join another company). I'm also losing interest in my current digital marketing role. So I'm not really looking forward to how my career progresses. 

I'm rethinking the path I'm on. I'm 27 (med school drop out, got lost a bit) which I feel is already too old to rethink things(I guess I'm comparing to my peers) but I really want to enjoy what I do. **Money** is a huge factor and I would like to reach a good salary fast.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy. 

About me: 27f, I like research, being pedantic about little things (lol), environmental conservation, science, art, how the universe works, and the theoretical side of marketing. School subject faves were biology and physics, but I never dabbled in commerce so I don't know if I would have liked it. Since leaving my bad experience in med school, I've stayed away from science.

Everyone I have ever spoken to has only had good things to say about my boss. Including people that do not work at the company now but worked for him before. But after working for him a while, I finally know his real nature. He is a really nice guy and very personable, but he looks out only for himself. He is quick to place blame on others, especially those he manages, and does not share proper credit with his team when things go well. He does not stick up for his team and does not share opportunities for growth- instead he keeps those opportunities for himself and keeps them secret. He does not adequately thank his team for their hard work and basically wants to make sure that he is seen as the ""rockstar"" of the group while the rest of us are his little minions.

Although the salary I was brought in at was competitive for the duties the old job description entailed, my new “title” and responsibilities can command quite a bit higher (30% or more) should I shop around.

The way I see it, I have 3 obstacles that I can’t think of ways around:

1) The raise I’m looking for would require a corporate paygrade promotion also (I believe). I honestly would feel awkward even asking for that number

2) My performance review is at least another 3 months away and my employer does not really have a very clear policy on how raises and promotions will work. Especially since a colleague of mine (who has been working with the employer for 10 yrs) mentioned that when she asked for a raise, she only mentioned her intentions to our direct supervisor and then spoke directly to the department head for her raise.

3) Timing. We had just finished Phase 1 (where I contributed quite a bit especially since my direct supervisor was on maternity and I handled part of her work then) a pretty long term three phase project, however an audit is beginning soon and won’t end for another month. All “raise/promotion” asking advice seem to revolve around finding the right time to ask which given how many projects are down the line, is difficult for me to pick out.

Normally I wouldn’t think this would be a problem, but the friend I helped interview for the same position as my new title might officially begin by October and I’m worried that with his closer to market salary, there might not be room in the budget for them to give me the raise I want (this fear may or may not be unfounded, I actually don’t know what it looks like from the other side).

I've been with this non profit organization for the last 2 years. I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.

Today:

I was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title. This means that, in addition to (most of) my current duties, I will be doing payroll, assisting in human resources, accounts payable, direct support for management, overseeing office supply inventory, answering all incoming phone calls, overseeing our incoming and outgoing mail, responding to our info@ emails, and be the contact person for all office staff for sick days and time off requests.

I asked what the new pay was going to be. I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.

I asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told "" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.  We don't have any other positions open. ""

I have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out.

It's gotten to the point where she can't even hold a pencil. I help around the house a lot but she works so much hands on labor that it's terrible. She's working 6 days a week at 2 jobs. Those being a ""chef"" at a local gas station (not really a real chef. She just makes eggs, pancakes, and stuff) and a cleaning lady. She's usually working around 8-12 hours a day counting both jobs and the day she has off, she babysitts my 2 year old nephew. We don't have a lot of money. Our family's income is below 30,000 and I don't want her to stress more when my sister and I leave since there's gonna be more manual labor around the house. I'm about to be a senior come September and my sister's gonna be a freshman too. So I was wondering if there's ANY decent careers she might be able to pursue that'd be cheap and that could possibly work with her schedule? I know it's a long shot, I'm just desperate for her. She's always wanted to be a vet since she loves animals (more than anybody I know), she loves learning about crime, is really into medical stuff, loves helping children and the mentally disabled (since her nephew has autism), and even loves tattooing (she was a tattoo teacher at a VoTech school before the arthritis.)

I had interview today that was just... odd. First off, I arrived early, they arrived 15 mins late without any apology. The manager interviewing me was **extremely awkward, wouldn’t make eye contact and kept shuffling around in his chair. At first I thought he was just shy, but as the interview went on they just went rapid fire through the questions, either cutting me off mid sentence or leaving long awkward pauses that I felt like I had to try and fill. 

I wasn’t asked anything about myself, just very dry and corporate sounding questions, which is really odd for a support role.  

When I asked questions at the end about supporting clients, the manager actually said “they’re only supposed to stay for 2 years but we’ve had some people for 10 or 11. You can’t exactly empower people with mental health problems, know what I mean? They can’t do shit for themselves”. I was gobsmacked - I didn’t know whether he was trying to catch me out or if this was some weird interview technique or what, but I was so appalled I was shocked into silence.

What can I do?,careerguidance,"I'll summarize my educational background as succinctly as I can. I got a bachelor's in neuroscience, and a master's in biotechnology. This was with the goal of getting into medical school, which did not happen. After a year of trying to get a job after the master's program, I got into a doctoral program for biochemistry. Due to a variety of factors, including the program director bungling up my qualifying exams, I quit the program after 3 years.

Since then, I haven't been able to find a decent job. My master's program director said I should command a job at least $20/hour, which has been proven to be a bald-faced lie or moronic oversight. I hadn't had a full-time job until this year, and only one paying that rate for two months. After leaving the doctoral program, I worked for 1 year at a grocery store, and 6 months at an overnight veterinary diagnostic lab. I've been at my current job for 2 months now, as a research assistant at a university. Despite promises, it offers no clear way up or any substantial pay increase whatsoever.

Now, here's where I'm having difficulty. I want to switch to a different career, but I have a few obstacles.

The first is money. I still have to pay off student loans, and I have no desire to go into even more debt for a pricey program that doesn't even guarantee a job afterwards. I already did that with my master's, and I have spent now more than 2 years job hunting for scraps. I'm not forestalling my life further playing this rigamorale in order to pay off loan shark, bloated debts.

The second is job hunting itself. The whole process is a joke, compounded by so-called professionals who give contradicting advice on how to write resumes, apply to these job boards, and whatever else. My university's career counselor is a quack with no idea what he's doing. Recruiting agencies like Aerotek either find me nothing or ignore me entirely. Networking events have netted me nothing. I have no idea where to go to get a career plan in place. Moreover, am I being ignored because I'm seen as inexperienced? A job hopper? I shouldn't be, considering I've had at least 3 years experience doing research, and my other jobs, while short, had to be taken or else I couldn't eat.

**Long story short**, I want out of my career field of research to find a decent paying job with some growth but I cannot afford more schooling (I'm still paying of my master's, thank you very much).  I have no idea how to navigate the fog of confusion and contradiction that is job hunting either. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. I'm nearly 30, and I'm scared stiff that I've pigeonholed myself into a dead-end career path that I can't escape from.

Fiancé: 32
Psycho bitch: mid-late 30s

Recently my boyfriend/FI popped the question after a year together! We work at the same company but he’s in a different office an hour away. 

About a week after that I got a work email at 3AM from some bitch (PB) in his office. Claimed they’d been dating for 5 years, he’s the father of her 9 y/o daughter, how could I sleep at night destroying a family, I don’t need a husband when I have a good job, and if I could get a white man why did I need to “take a good Black man.” She threatened to go to my supervisor that I was “fraternizing at work”. 

I emailed her back, “Don’t ever contact me again; and do your career a favor and keep made-up personal drama off your work server.” 

Both FI & several friends at his office confirmed FI’s story - he took her out once 5 years ago for workday lunch while PB was going through a divorce.  (I knew this before we got together) Also a friend sent me some screenshots of FB - PB and her daughter are the whitest people ever. Turns out the little girl’s dad knows my parents and is a good guy.  

In other words PB built a lot up in her mind & people have been working to make her understand it’s not true; they were never in a relationship. 

I went to PB’s supervisor; she got written up & had to attend sensitivity training or something. 

My supervisor wasn’t delighted that I was dating someone at the company, especially since FI and I (and 150-some others) roll up to the same VP. He said that going to the supervisor was unnecessary and that I needed to “hide (my) disdain for single moms better.”  He was unable to provide specifics. 

I just learned that the other night PB went on some bender and sent out a bunch of unhinged messages to coworkers about me ruining her and her daughters life before attempting suicide (in front of the girl). I’m horrified she got to that point, but also furious she brought my name into it.

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

I will try and summarize my opinion based on everyone's responses in this comment.

**SE Freelancing:** I love this idea, but is it realistic to do in a developing country, and if anyone has experience with it please let me know

**Teaching abroad:** Teaching abroad does sound nice, but it eliminates the benefit of being able to have my own freedom to vacation. The other major downside is the pay, because one great thing of working in the US is the currency exchange in other countries.

**Startups:** This is one of my favorite ideas and I have never thought of doing this yet, I love the idea of being part of something small and making it grow. Dealing with the business behind it does excite me. This idea is really giving me passion to code and enjoy my studies again. Even if it the company does fail or go under I will still be able to get back on my feet fairly easy due to Software Engineers being needed.The one downside and the thing that makes me feel selfish for saying, is that I wouldn't be able to to just pickup and leave to another country when I wanted to.

I didn't fully mention the importance of leaving to a developing country. I want to live in one not only because I love the simplistic lifestyle, but I also because the money I would make here in the US goes much further. In a country such as Guatemala a 10k salary would be more than enough for a person to live comfortably and plane tickets are fairly inexpensive too. I feel that it is almost a loophole in life to use it as an economic advantage. I might get a little sting for saying something a bit selfish, but I've met many people from such countries that would travel to the USA to work then send money back home to their families then return after they had saved enough.

1. You get talked down to and shouted by rich people almost everyday, which is incredibly frustrating especially when you're from a poor background.
2. The business in general is very discriminatory. They only hire white, attractive people (usually females) for customer facing work. Whereas anyone of colour - or anyone who doesn't fit into this category is hidden away - which is something I hate being a part of.
3. The company's customer care is incredibly poor. You essentially have to ask for contributions from the customers if something goes wrong which is very awkward and you get a lot of abuse for it. The business is only about money and it is glaringly obvious. I do realise this is what business is all about. However, I am not money orientated and is draining me to the core.

So here's some information for you in case you're willing to point me in some useful directions. Thanks in advance for reading and thinking about a stranger's troubles and foibles.

I have a foreign degree in economics but I don't remember any of the coursework and I'm not good at it anyway. I wasn't good at economic theory and belief systems back then either. Plus I had little to no idea about what to do during exams because the questions made little sense to me. I was far better at understanding business and some finance concepts from a few of the classes I had to take. I grasped them intuitively much better than my classmates who did well at economics.

I haven't worked in 16 years. I'm afraid I will not be getting into the how and why of how this transpired. Please rest assured however that there is no incarceration or any other type of untoward/illegal/immoral/scandalous issue involved whatsoever.

What I have been doing - as and when I could - is taking many for-credit courses online at community colleges and a local 4 year college. I've been taking them as a non-degree seeking student. These classes have been in business and law, as well as in art and design. I have also taken non-college non-credit classes in art. I have excelled at all these classes.

My past jobs, before the 16 year period of unemployment, involved customer service and low-level admin work. I realized that I have a peculiar talent for observation of customer behavior and a strong curiosity about its patterns, going so far as to conduct little sensory experiments to see what customers responded to. I also found myself fixing hold-ups in customer service and employee performance with little basic solutions such as a flow-chart, behind the counter for the cashiers, that described types of glitches that the ancient cash machine would throw at us while checking out a customer and how to work around those glitches. 

Ideally, if I had the money and time that I needed, I would be studying human perception and sensory processing, and applying it toward usability, UI/UX work, interaction design, service design, customer experience design etc. But alas, I do not have that time and/or money :/ I am curious about studying these fields in Germany though given its free education and the quality of German design. But since I have no idea how to get there, it remains a total fantasy at this point.

What I can do as proven by the coursework I've excelled at:

- Write a fairly decent essay

- Analyze a given situation fairly decently

- Grasp legal concepts and apply them to scenarios (while being unable to memorize - please see section below)

- Understand at least fairly well how the fields of business and law work with each other

- Understand visual composition 

- Convey visual information

- Take on complicated topics in business, science and design and find a way to synthesize them and produce a fairly decent design product
 
This semester I will be learning how to write a business plan.

What I CANNOT do:

- Drive

- Stand for longer than 30 minutes. Walking is totally fine.

- Lift heavy objects

- Do math calculations quickly or in my head

- Memorize a ton of stuff and recall it quickly

- Speak Spanish - which in my town at least is a definite requirement for any and all menial jobs and even many white-collar low-level jobs

CAVEATS:

- The law classes have NOT been from any law school and I'm NOT working towards a JD or any paralegal certification. (Should I?) They're from community colleges.

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in design software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc. 

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in commonly used office software like MS Office.

If you've read thus far, here are some questions:

- Ideally I would have a remote/online part-time job.  What fields would such jobs fall under? What skills do such jobs often require?

- What should I learn in the short term so I have basic job skills for a white-collar job? 

(I'm not seeking white-collar out of classism or snobbery, please see 'What I CANNOT do section' above)

- What should I aim for in the long term so that I can build career skills while I work a part-time job?

- What kind of job should I be looking for while I build larger, long-term career skills?

- Do you have any pointers on what type of career I should go for?

664,9rcfqo,False,,53,Should I Quit My Steady Job In Order To Focus On My Mental Health While I Look For Something Better?,careerguidance,"Basically trying to make a long story short, in March I quit a job that put me in a very toxic and unhealthy work environment publicly, and took the first job offered to me in order to get out of the spotlight of 8 months of 24/7 harassment. Now, 8 months later I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, anxiety has completely stripped me of my appetite to the point where I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last two months. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach because I dread my job. I hate what I do, I don’t care about either industry my job falls in, I am given zero resources from my superiors, with unreasonable expectations. I don’t have a background in this industry. I am so utterly lost. Working home alone stuck to myself all day doesn’t help either.  

For the past two and a half months, the only thought in my brain has been “just quit.” As far as I see it, having no job can’t possibly be worse than this horrible anxiety and depression I feel every day. I don’t have the energy to pursue other work full force, I don’t have the energy to pursue anything creative that would make me happy.  I suppose it would be a bit different if I had officemates to commiserate with, or if I had a partner coming home every night, but the fact is I don’t. I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m afraid that “this is it” for the rest of my life without seeing a way out. And if “this is it” I can be honest and say this is not a life I can survive in much longer.  

I guess what I’m asking is, how irresponsible and stupid would it be to just quit without something solid lined up already? I’ve 7 months of living expenses saved (although I would HATE to deplete my entire savings), and I have a few freelance gigs I’m already working on (nothing that comes remotely close to my current salary, but I wouldn’t go immediately to zero income). 

Quitting would allow me to have the bandwidth to a) search for another secure job I’d be happier with, and b) expand my hustle for freelance work. I guess also c) pursue personal creative things I don’t have time/energy for now.  

I’ve been setting up meeting after meeting after meeting with different companies in my industry, but no one is hiring right now. I’ve learned I have a fabulous reputation, but there just aren’t any openings. But I can’t just wait around. Something in my immediate future needs to change drastically if I’m to keep surviving as I’m just so miserable and unhappy right now.    


Am I being dumb for seriously considering quitting?

How have you dealt with it?,careerguidance,"First off I just want to say I am very fortunate, and I am very grateful for still having a job. I don't want to give up because I was given this opportunity so I better make the most of it. Any advice on how to move onward and upward when you're feeling survivors guilt and imposterish, would be very helpful.

The company I work for was just cut exactly in half. In a small company that feels really personal and not to mention we're in a fairly small town where everyone knows everyone. 

I was fairly new, and although I recently was getting over my imposter syndrome for being new and young. It came back full force right after ""mourning"" the loss of co-workers that I admired and that I felt were very hard-working. 

My job hasn't changed much since I am the only person who was doing my particular jobs and I had already been covering for another employee who was often absent for the past year or so. In fact my job has been a lot slower since people were let go.

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet). I know I have been working hard to make this workplace better and have been pretty well appreciated by management, but I can't help but feel guilty about others who loved their jobs losing them. And I'm feeling unreasonably useless right now. I know better, but I can't help but feel it and I am struggling to power through.

TLDR: I have a job even though our company downsized by half. Im struggling to move forward because I feel guilty and like an imposter.

323,da06aw,False,,87,Is Linkedin Absolutely Necessary for Networking?,careerguidance,"Hi Redditors

I'm one of the stubborn few that still believes in the Good ol' days and i'm finding it very difficult to conform to the whole social media thing.  Don't get me wrong, i think social media is great and that it has its merits, but honestly, sometimes i could care less about what my ""friends"" had for dinner, vacations, MLM recruiting efforts, and charities begging for everything under the sun.  With that said, i have quit social media and i'm blissfully unaware of all the drama caused my ""friends"" posts on Facebook.

Not long ago, i started talking to a recruiter that was having a career fair in my country, and she sounded very interested on me.  I have been actively looking for a job (reading ads, applying online, requesting meetings, etc.) so for a senior recruiter to be interested on me, that's a big deal.  We chatted both on the phone and by email, made an appointment to meet at the company's career fair, and all went great.  I was told that as soon as the contract got approved, to expect a phone call for a potential opening.  I was also told that if i wanted to know the status of the contract, to follow the recruiter on Linkedin because that is the best most fastest way to contact her.  Problem is, i don't have a linked in account!  I also do not want one.  A few years back, i had started to build my profile on it but 2 seconds after it went ""live"" i got contacted by my ex which absolutely freaked me out.  It was then and there that i decided to forget about the whole linked thing, and i instantly deleted my account.  

So my question to you wise Redditors is:  Do i absolutely need to create an account in order to get recruiters to look at me and the experience i have to offer?

447,c89oa9,False,,49,Being Honest in Exit Interview - Is It Ever Appropriate?,careerguidance,"Interested to read everyone's thoughts on this. I've always read and heard that you should never be honest in the exit interview, never give feedback, they don't deserve it, etc etc.

My question to the group is, is there ever situations where it may actually be of some benefit to the company you're leaving?

&#x200B;

I've got a potential job offer coming up. I've asked for a raise at my current company, citing numerous sources of data suggesting that it's a fair argument. The response is ""we don't have it in the budget this year, CEO wouldn't go for it, etc"". Other employees have told me that they have received the same response. But magically, when someone gets a job offer paying more, my current company matches it.

It's a situation where I enjoy my boss and the company. Just not their old school approach to compensation. Even if they matched my potential offer, I won't take it. I'm not mad at them and there's no ill will.

I'm confident that I could say this in an exit interview without burning bridges. We have a good enough relationship for that.

My thought is, is it such a bad thing that I call my current company on this? Yes, they may not change. But they sure as hell won't if no one says anything about it and just smiles and gives the ""It's just an opportunity I can't turn down"" answer. If I could potentially open the door for someone else to get a raise in result of me leaving, to me that's a win.

What say ye? Let's discuss.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want.

- 30% data analytics (creating segments, data cleaning, regressions - mostly in Excel, R)

- 20% random stuff

There was work to do and we were all doing it, but he was never satisfied. They were good colleagues actually, but this manager was the antichrist.

102,gcyie6,False,Advice,56,Remote work during COVID to permanent remote work?,careerguidance,"I’ve been working from home during COVID and honestly it’s been great for me. Don’t get me wrong, I am so sad for how this virus has upended so many lives. But my company responded fast and told us to stay home starting in early March and since then I’ve had so much peace and contentment. 

Since working from home my professional and personal productivity has skyrocketed. I’ve been keeping up on work, starting a podcast, rebranding myself on social media, lost 20 lbs, read a few great books, used henna on my hair. With all of this good energy flowing, I’ve realized how draining it is for me to sit in an office all day. I enjoy my work but I’ve never liked being in an office all day long. It’s something that I dreaded earlier in my career and now I’ve just accepted it/gotten used to it. And I’ve tried to look for remote work before but couldn’t really find anything. 

This time has opened my eyes and I cannot go back to spending 40 in an office. I have no desire to do it. Prior to this covid crisis, the company reserved remote work for employees who had been w/the company 10+ years. It’s a family owned business and even one of the family members who had been there only a few years wasn’t allowed to work from home. But I’ve heard whispers that maybe they’ll see now that this is a possibility for us. I’ve been candid with my direct supervisor about wanting remote work. He wasn’t able to provide any information about where the company was at on the next reopening phase for us, but he seemed to understand. And I know many other colleagues feel like I do. 

My question is this:  is there anything I can do to move the needle on this? At this point it feels incredibly important for me to advocate for my needs. 

TLDR:  working from home has given me super productivity, peace and happiness and I need advice on how I can advocate for permanent remote work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gcyie6/remote_work_during_covid_to_permanent_remote_work/,287,[deleted] ,2020-05-03 21:21:55

691,fbugg8,False,,13,Starting over at 44: am I doomed?,careerguidance,"So I'll be 44 this year, and I've been disabled throughout my adolescence and for all my adult life. I was diagnosed with autism at 42, and with ADHD at 43. Since entering treatment, my health has improved dramatically, and I'm now in a position to work towards things that I thought could only be dreams.

This poses a bit of a problem, since I have no idea what I want to do - or rather, I desperately wanted to study a language and then translate, but my home situation makes that difficult. I know that I want to go to university, but I have to decide what to study once I'm there, and what sort of work I not only want to do, but *will be able* to do. I'm educated to UK A-level standard, and am doing preparatory college courses to get me to the point I'm confident in my ability to tackle a degree.

I'm focused, driven and meticulous. I'm a problem-solver. I love data and detail. I love complex structures. I love puzzling out difficult things. I love going deep into one small field for years. I argue a lot, and I write well. I read very fast, and I'm a good researcher. I read Acts of Parliament and draw graphs for fun. I like numbers and logic. I do basic coding in around ten languages, and I use this constantly to fix problems around me. I do Japanese fan translations. ***I'm a learner*** - I love to study. Even at my worst, I've always worked to be better.

But I also have serious issues around my health. I can't do hard physical labour. I can't work routine long hours. I can work with people, but I'd need longer periods of working by myself. I put myself across well in writing, but in speech I come across as confused and inarticulate; I don't deal well with people. I have issues with memory and attention that make me prone to constant errors. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a computer, because it detaches me from the world that I need to be *in*, if I'm ever to accomplish anything in any job. I'd like to be able to work from home some of the time, but not all of the time.

I know I want to get a degree, just because it rankles that I've been to uni twice and don't have one. But I'm afraid that I'll take the risks, lose a lot, and still be unemployable at the end of it. I'll be in my 50s by the time I'm looking for work, an age when most people are terrified of losing their jobs because they'll never be rehired. And I don't know what my disability issues will look like in five years. I hope many will improve, but I would be a fool to think that many won't.

Am I fooling myself to think I can start out in a profession in my 50s, with no work history?

And started to research my position at different companies. Looking at requirements, pay, company reviews, growth opportunity. Every position was offering 60 to 80k for my position. I started to apply at places and received a job offer making 80k. This was early march, new job was supposed to start beginning of april. But because of covid-19, the position was instead eliminated. 

I took the month of April to stop the job search since there was a hiring freeze anyways, and resumed a few days ago. Now, I'm seeing reposts and new posts for the same position offering 25 to 40k!!! Even the position above mine was once 100 to 150k and now 40 to 60k range! 


Also, not necessarily part of this but kinda, I received a call for a position above me. Offering $12 and hour! I apologized but said I could not accept anything below $24 an hour. This is just my basic cost of living. Essential bills, gas, food, and $100 in savings a month, no extras. I couldn't believe it.

So with that preface, I know I will be severely limited in my options because of my lacking resume. I've considered ""embellishing"" my resume because I have done some minor things to help with my uncle's business over the past four years. But I'm not sure how far I should go with that and it probably depends on where I end up applying.

Besides the resume issue (which concerns me the most), I'm also just not sure of what industry I want to get into. Some things I'm interested in are the travel industry, mental health care, human rights and social justice advocacy (sort of my focus in grad school), art, music, politics and international relations. But I'm also open to much more than that.

Lastly, I'm wondering if it would make any sense to get some more education before applying for jobs. Or would this be silly? The thing is, money is not a big problem for me (thanks to my wonderful wife) and I wouldn't really mind waiting another 1-2 years if it were in a field I'm passionate about.

As it currently stands, he cannot, but he only sees the company and team growing in upcoming years.

Hi Reddit,

Going through a small dilemma here. I was recently offered a position at a startup. I'm currently working as a freelancer at a fortune 500 company.

Some details:
My current position pays me $34/hour. Full time annually that would be $65,280 assuming I work every day. I don't. Even though Im ""permalancing"" of course that means I dont get paid for holidays (such as this week, I have the full week off). I currently dont have health insurance (missed the window where I can sign up) nor do I have a 401k contribution.

The startup offered me a full time position for $70k annually including benefits. This includes insurance, paid time off, 401k contributions, commuter benefits, stipend for health-related costs ($400/year), free meals at work, and cooking classes.

Question is, should I move forward and accept or try to get a full time offer at my current company? I have only been at my current company for a little over a year, and I'm pretty sure the only reason I was considered and offered the position at the startup was because my current company is so well-known.

Any help/guidance would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.

662,aipm9q,False,,20,How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?,careerguidance,"Hi all,

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I don’t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?


Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/aipm9q/how_can_i_talking_to_my_boss_about_excessive/,93,"You should just talk to them about it, period, especially if your current project is wrapping up. I have worked with consultants in IT for a long time (and my spouse works for the big 4)—travel burnout is not at all uncommon. It’s all about how you frame the discussion.  

Rolling off your current project is a really good time to address this with your department head, or resource/staffing person.   Some projects require more travel, some require less.  As you’re wrapping up the current project, just tell them all the good things you have said here, and be positive—as in, “I love what I’m doing, but for my next role, if there is any consideration for less onsite work or a project that is closer to [home], I would like to be considered for it, given the increased onsite presence requirement that my last project demanded.”   We have people asking for lower-travel projects all the time, for tons of different reasons—their health, issues at home, general burnout, etc.  This kind of stress on your body does take a toll, and you have to take care of yourself.  Last year I had a young (<30 years old) consultant  pass away from a heart attack.... before he did, he was texting his boss from the ER because it was go-live.  Not trying to be a downer, just saying to keep perspective.   

It absolutely never hurts to ask, and it’s much easier to be in a position to try and accommodate  this request when you’re going to be placed on your next project, versus you throwing your hands in the air at cutover refusing to travel anymore—which I have also seen, and does not go over well.  You should proceed delicately since I read above that it’s your first project, but if you frame it in a positive way, no one can really fault you for simply asking.   Don’t demand, don’t complain, don’t make comparisons to coworkers or friends’ companies, just ASK for consideration, and frame more as a “less travel now, will do more for next project” kind of way.  In larger firms, it’s also more likely that they could do something about it, since they presumably have a lot more options as to where you could be placed. 

If they are a good employer and value you as it seems they do, they will do their best to accommodate you.  We make every effort to put someone on a lower-travel project after they have been killin it on a FT travel role for the better part of the year.  You have to do what you can to take care of your employees in these kinds of roles, because if you don’t, they will leave.  

Which brings me to my point—if they absolutely can’t decrease your travel or aren’t willing to consider it...or if their pipeline is only mega-travel intensive projects, then start looking for another job. The job market in your industry is insanity right now, if we sleep on getting someone through the interview process by even one day, we are losing people.  

You only get one life, don’t sacrifice your body, health, or sanity for anyone. ",2019-01-22 18:12:49

I wanted to make a post on LinkedIn about it, but the catch is that my photo is technically NSFW (you can see a very very small portion of an areola in it of my female model).

I am still employed, and intend to quit upon accepting an offer elsewhere. 

Over the span of a couple months and about 20 applications I finally heard from a company. The business is a large company based in my city with locations all over the US and Canada. They wanted to get me on the phone ASAP for a screening with the company recruiter. That went well and I was scheduled for a phone interview with the hiring manager. This also went very well. The call was originally scheduled for 30 minutes, but continued for about an hour. The next day I heard back from the recruiter that they wanted to schedule an in-person interview.

I was told what time to arrive for the interview and was told to “plan for an hour or little bit longer”. I showed up right on time and the interview began promptly. I nailed every question and from what I could tell, they were very impressed with my experience and potential. It was all smiles and good vibes from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. I never once looked at the clock because the conversation was fast paced and smooth. When I left I looked at the clock in the car and it turns out the interview lasted just shy of 2 hours.

The next morning (this morning) I received a call from the recruiter with good news. They were extending an offer to me! Naturally I was ecstatic, but the recruiter quickly turned the conversation to an issue that had come up in my interviews. She told me the hiring manager expressed to the recruiter that I went over on time during both of my interviews, and that if I wanted to work at this company I would need to “nip that in the bud” because this company takes meeting schedules very seriously. She went on to give a light lecture about time management and learning to read the room.

I was completely caught off guard. Generally speaking I think I’m pretty good at room reading and receiving social cues. I was also taught for years that it can often be a good thing when an interview goes over its allotted time since that usually means they like what they’re hearing. I’ll remind you that the room was all smiles and good vibes. They spent about 3/4 of the time asking me specific experience related questions, and left the remaining time to allow me to ask them questions of my own.

Am I over reacting? Is this normal? I’ve worked in a professional environment for years so I know how to operate and communicate in an situation like this.

Am I insane? 27yo male, married, looking 85k to 65k.",careerguidance,"I’m 27 years old, married with no kids (thinking 4-5 years out), own a home with mortgage well below what we could have afforded and have combined cash savings around 8k with 25k in combined retirement funds. We know we are behind on retirement but came out of school with a combined 100k in student loan debt and have aggressively paid it down to around 40k now (she has BS and I have BS/MBA). Overall we make considerably more right now than we need and have been using that on the student loans. 

I’ve worked in construction management since getting out of school and have had ups and downs with that. I’m very good at it and enjoy building teams and systems, but in two different roles in the industry I’ve experienced the same issues with massive hour expectations and work/life balance struggles. For context, it’s not uncommon to work long weekdays then cap the week off with over 40 hours between Friday to Sunday. My wife and I have had some issues based on her frustration with me never being home and being exhausted to the point of uselessness when I am home. I can’t blame her at all. 

I’m very strongly considering switching to manufacturing and taking a 15-20k hit in salary as a result (in a maintenance management or planning role). I initially started looking for manufacturing roles that would be around the same salary, but most either want lots of industry experience or have major travel elements. This move would however bring my hours down a lot to close to 40, and most of the roles I’m pursuing have flexibility in the hours. She works 530-4 M-Th, and while I don’t expect to work 4 10s it’s looking like I could make my M-F schedule 6-3 or something similar to get home before/when she does. 

I’m leaning heavily towards taking the step, but what negatives am I not considering? I know that this move would delay the student loan payoffs and am completely prepared for that, but what else should I be thinking about? 

Most of my family I talk to tell me to stick it out until the loans are gone, but my big fear is looking back in 4 years at a zero student loan balance and either having lost my wife or realizing I’d wasted a full decade of my youth in an industry I don’t enjoy.

1) Your professional career
2) Your personal life
3) Future clash of those things.

You say your wife is dissatisfied now. Even though you're bringing in $85K a year (which is no small feat), have created a strong budget and are effectively setting yourself up for vast future success. 

What's to say she won't be dissatisfied with your performance as a husband when you take the pay cut? Sure, you're around more often, but you're worth less money. She's eventually going to want a bigger house for the kids, a few nice vacations, and ongoing placation beyond that.

Are you willing to chase down another person's happiness in lieu of chasing your own dreams? 

Sounds like you could really start making huge bucks within the next 4-5 years if you stick with your current trajectory. For a vast majority of upper middle class breadwinners, the 20s are when you slog and grind hard af so that you can see copious success through your 30s and 40s without the same impact on personal life that you had in your 20s.

Ghosted after accepting job offer?!,careerguidance,"I recently quit my job of 6 years that I loved because I was recruited by another company through LinkedIn who saw my skills/experience and thought I would be a perfect fit for the job as manager overseeing 3 different high volume locations on a high school campus. 

Recruiter invited me to a invite only job fair. When I arrived the HR rep automatically assumed I was there for a ""shift supervisor position"" which is way lesser of a position than I was going for/ qualified for. She said there was only shift supervisor & assistant management positions open. I told her I must have been mislead, and I had spoken to a recruiter on linked in. Only then did she ""check her computer"" & see that in fact, there was a full management position open. 

The interview itself was with the general manager, & I completely nailed the interview. This company focuses on guest service and standards so I answered my questions around that. My district manager from my previous job used to be this managers district manager as well, so I made sure to ask if she knew him in the interview. They did seem worried that I had worked only low volume locations(my companies high volume doesn't touch their low volume), but loved that I had experience as a leader in 3 stores, supporting other locations & had opened a brand new location in the area recently as well. I also had all the management training done, certifications done, & experience training leaders/tms for the district.  I almost expected to be hired on the spot. But was told they needed to get through the rest of the applicants, see how the day plays out & then would get back to me. 

The recruiter reached out to me and asked what I thought. I was completely honest, I told him about the mix up & how the hr rep seemed to judge me based on my age. He said he would figure out what happened because he had spoken prior directly with her & said that I specifically was there for the upper level management position. He basically hinted that I was overqualified. 

The manager reached out to me and asked me to come in for a second interview with another manager. The interview was with both managers. It was extremely laid back and it seemed like more of a meet & greet then an interview. When I explained all the training I had, the second manager asked the first what one of them was- and the first goes ""thats the training you're doing now."" The second manager asked the first if we talked about pay, where the first manager kinda of whispered - well I think that *hr rep* will discuss that. 

2 weeks went by and I thought ok, not happening. Then I get a call from the hr rep apologizing because they realized noone had reached out and then offering me the position. I explained I was still interested but was currently at work & asked if I could call back in a few hours. "" Ok no problem! ""
2 minutes later the 2nd manager calls me and asks if I'm still interested, I told her I just spoke to Jessica & I was, but I was at work and would call back in a few hours. I called back and neither answered their phones, kept ringing. I left a voicemail on one. Noone ever called me back but HR rep emailed me the welcome packet, job offer, etc. The position was for assistant manager (a position lower than I had interviewing for) but salary pay & higher than I was making at the job I was working. I completed all the paperwork (e-sign) sent it in, and asked if It was possible for a later start date so I could remain professional with my employer & give them correct notice. Hr rep replied it was no problem and since I let them know about my vacation during interviewing. She offered I start the day I come back. I said that would be great!

Since noone had called me back to discuss more of the position, I reached out to check about dress code. They said they would order me a shirt & asked what size. I replied back with size & a thank you. Now time has gone by and I am meant to start in 6 days. I reached out the day before my vacation to the 1st manager, Ccd the 2nd manager in, & did not get any responses.... I asked about the rest of the dress code, and where exactly/what time I would be reporting to since there are 3 locations on campus. 

3 days have passed since I sent the email.

Alright so most subjects in school didn't really interest me. I only liked Dutch, English and art. Unsurprisingly, my grades were quite bad. Luckily they were good enough to pass. 
After my graduation I had no idea what to study so I took a gap year and started working at Burger King (very impressive, I know). After a year I decided I wanted to study social work. Well that didn't work out for someone with social anxiety like me. I also didn't really enjoy the classes. After quitting I went back to working at the lovely burger heaven. I couldn't really stand that for much longer, so I started studying again. I picked goldsmithing for this. Yes, that made sense to me. See, I've always loved drawing and painting so I figured I'd do something creative. But I didn't enjoy the sawing, soldering and all the other technical aspects of the subject. After quitting I started working at a factory to ""save up"". Note: I used to spend my money like you would spend the toilet paper after eating an extra spicy burrito. At this point I went through a couple of miserable months. I eventually ended up at the airport with only 100 euros, about to go to Madrid. If it wasn't for my ex who stopped me, I would probably still be bathing in some Spanish ditch right now. Anyway, after this fiasco my friend suggested I should go for a course that allows me to only attend school once a week, while working the other 4 days. This seemed perfect for me since I would be able to achieve a certificate by experiental learning. The only subject that offers this kind of education here is cooking so I went with it. Bad decision once again, because man... I am way too dreamy and inattentive for this kind of job. It's also very exhausting and I get no free time anymore. So now, at the age of 20, I'm considering quitting again and starting a graphic design course, because I truly love design and I can seriously stare at a computer screen for lifetimes, trying to create a perfect photograph or logo. I also have a great passion for photography, but a lot of people can't really earn a living with that so I go for graphic design. I am really unsure about this though, because I'm afraid I will dislike this as well. Is quitting again a good idea, or will this just cause me to become used to giving up, rather than fighting? If I go for a new start, how could I get myself to make it work this time? Also, would it be a good idea to study the subject abroad?

So, a bit of context to my title: I graduated university with a degree in criminology and psychology. I have a real curiosity about the human psyche, supporting our vulnerable and justice. 

After graduation, I took the first job I could get - investigating and intervening in cases of child abuse and neglect. It was soul crushing to say the least. I quickly burn-out and moved on to a role I feel is more suited to my studies. 

At the moment I work in a local level court, providing case management for people who are in the community awaiting sentencing. Essentially, my job involves supporting people experiencing things like drug addiction, mental illness, homelessness, and trauma. It’s a rewarding, but equally soul crushing and stressful job. I see a lot of the dark side of society and frankly, it’s taking a toll on me. 

As a result of all the downtime from COVID-19, I’ve realised my work is making me anxious and depressed, and that maybe, this line of work isn’t for me at all. Ideally I want to do something that makes me happy; or at least, doesn’t fill me with dread on a Sunday night. 

The decision feels easy but I’m also trapped - my current salary is amazing and I have a debt as a result of my studies. I live in Australia so I’m not worried about the financial impact of the debt, just the sense of guilt that I went and racked up a debt for a career I will ultimately not be pursuing.

Should I look for new employment?",careerguidance,"So long story short, I work at an IT company in the customer service/dispatch department. I had an extremely grueling job in fast food before this one so literally anything would have been better. However, when I first started the glaring problems with the company started to shine through. Mainly the lackluster training to begin with.

The manager at the time was never present, leaving me to deal with a highly abusive senior employee (I'll call her A). She talks smack about everyone through chat and email, reports everything everyone is doing wrong to our bosses, withholds information, the whole bit. She is the literal worst. The definition of a narcissistic psychopath who gets off on hurting others reputation.

Eventually the original boss left and for whatever reason was replaced with someone who has literally no clue about our policies or what we do in our department. He is also never present and micromanages us through email and announces our mistakes in front of everyone. He blatantly ignored my email expressing concern that A was committing slander against me.

I used to have a workload that kept me busy throughout the day, but then the new manager's close friend got hired and started taking over about 80% of my original workload. She also gets away with everything because she is the boss's friend. Never ever gets called out on mistakes. I was then given the important responsibility of managing relationships with one of our most valuable clients. During my 3 month review, I was told I was doing great, and I should have more confidence in myself. (self esteem issues abound due to the negative reinforcement from A)

Then, out of nowhere, said important responsibility was snatched out from under me and given to the previous employee who managed it, due to ""The importance of needing someone more knowledgeable."" My manager stressed that it was nothing against me or my work ethic. I had a hard time believing that. I cried pretty much the entire day. How was I supposed to be knowledgeable about this responsibility if I was barely trained on how to carry it out?

The manager said I had more important responsibilities coming my way and he would be glad to go over them with me, I told him sure, but I never heard from him nor have I received any additional work (besides closing work orders, which is incredibly simple)..

I  like the company I work for. However, I have been here 3 years and my  last actual ""raise"" of any kind was over 2 years ago. Last year bonuses  added a couple of thousand to my yearly income. This year I expect to  make 3-4k less than last year.

From  my knowledge of the company, we are making similar money as we did last  year. My 3 year mark was 2 months ago with not a hint of a raise or cost of living adjustment. My pay is the same as it was 2 year ago so  far this year. No bonuses given so far this year.

Base  pay is 44k for a Marketing, IT & Website management role in the  company(multiple hats). Located in the south(USA). 2 weeks vacation, no  sick leave and a small healthcare credit($125) each month that won't cover any descent plan on the marketplace. No dental, life or vision. No 401k either. I was told offering healthcare was too expensive for a small business so a credit is offered instead.

The credit has not been increased in what I can only guess is more than 7 years. Each year the healthcare on the marketplace goes up by 14-25%, or so it seems. In the 3 years I have been here my tiny credit is worth even less towards a plan. Most family plans are now 850-1400 a month that cover anything. $125 is a drop in the bucket.

We have around 20 employees most of the time. I make most things work  around here along with managing several websites(and building them). I  also have the official title of Marketing Manager and do marketing tasks but its not the main role even though I have the title. I report directly to  the owner and a direct supervisor above me. I am also the companies Photographer/Video guy with our own studio.

657,erhsup,False,,27,Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?,careerguidance,"Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.

I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably.

It's not worth it. You will burn out. People who burn out have a harder time finding good jobs, getting promoted, and managing their money. So it is a bad economic decision. 

If you're willing to work crazy hours, there are jobs out there that will pay you just as much with just a single job.

I suggest you go back to the HR and manager and tell them you can't work full time and ask them to do it part time like you originally discussed. If they won't, then quit one of the jobs and keep the job that pays the most.

Then, with all this extra time you have, hunt for a better paying job. Tell potential employers you're willing to work 60 hours a week if the pay is enough to compensate for that extra time.

I would not pay down the debt immediately. Build up a 10k nest egg first. It's important to have an emergency fund in case you get laid off or your car breaks down. Just make sure you don't increase the debt. Once you have a nest egg, then you can get out of your family's house and pay off the debt ASAP. ",2020-01-20 19:03:20

Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with.

Before I joined, the company’s revenue was around 500-600k. This year, the company revenue will total 800-850k. We couldn’t produce any more work than that because there aren’t enough skilled employees, and frankly the existing employees are pretty awful (lazy, bare minimum, can’t wait to be laid off, etc.).

The company owner tried for over a year to hire a designer/manager to take over for him as he wants to move toward retirement, and I don’t think he expected me to basically take over the entirety of design/sales and crew management in the first year. My potential is limited by the size of the company and lack of skilled and motivated staff. I am confident that I could sell over 2 million in projects per year for a company that can handle that volume of work. 

I was hired in at 65k per year based on the first year sales of 200k (owner saw the first year as a transition phase for him getting out of design/sales so he took a small pay cut).

I had an interview that I felt went great a couple weeks ago but got rejected and no feedback as to why. This is the rejection that has really cut me up.

I KNOW I have the ability to be a great employee and have lots of great attributes but no employer can see this and it’s starting to cause havoc on my mental health. I’ve done all the hard work through university and beyond and it all feels worthless. I feel worthless. How do I get out of this mental black hole? How do you stop the constant rejection impacting your mental health?",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ho9icr/how_do_you_stop_constant_job_rejections_effecting/,387,"For me, it's virtually impossible.  There's only so many job rejections that I can tolerate, you know?  I am really the very worst prospective employee that you want to reject, seriously.  I have a set limit as to how many job rejections I can literally tolerate in a row.  Let's say the number is 15 sequential job rejections....

So with each job rejection I get, I always ask WHY I was rejected.  Now some people say that I'm not entitled to an answer, but I sorely beg to differ.  I was the one who took the time to get my resume ready for YOU, and I took the time to fill out your lengthy-ass application.  Therefore, you at least OWE me a detailed one or two-sentence explanation as to why you rejected me, and the explanation CANNOT be something like, ""We hired a candidate with better qualifications.""  Well, WHAT qualifications does that person have that make him/her better than me?  I want to know so that I can actually GET those qualifications if I don't have them, know what I mean?  I also require an answer for a rejection because if I'm making a mistake, I will know NOT to make the same mistake for future applications I send out, and thus won't be wasting my damn time.  Following me so far?  Ok, good...the fun has yet to begin...

This is my standard operating procedure (SOP) for dealing with a job rejection.  Now in the early rejection phase (say, for the first 5 rejections in a row), I only email them back once asking why I was rejected.  Then when we get to the 6th through 10th rejection, I start getting more insistent...maybe 3 emails or so for each rejection.  THEN, when we get to the 11th through 15th sequential rejection, the anger starts building up to a grand crescendo, to the point of harassment actually.  I call them up, I leave voicemails, I send up to 10 emails asking for a legitimate explanation as to why exactly I was refused employment for the 13th time.

For the lucky 15th prospective employer who rejects me, that's the lucky winner!  They get a death threat, folks!  Yes!  A death threat!  (As you can tell, I am quite psychopathic, having experienced serious career trauma over the past 15 years...\*hint\* that's where my 15th job rejection limit comes from!)  Lord, when is that universal basic income going to become a reality so that at least your food and rent are covered at the bare minimum???  This would alleviate SO much anguish and potential death...seriously!!!!  To me, these job rejections are direct denials of my right to earn a living so that I can actually survive and thrive, so if you deny ME that, I'll sure as hell make sure that you don't have that right either.

742,dxnikc,False,,33,Lost 39 year old looking for career advice (having never participated in the job market)?,careerguidance,"Hello,

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

346,ctpb19,False,,23,HR issued then rescinded a disciplinary notice to me bc they failed to read the dr note I submitted months ago; how protected am I? should I be looking for another job?,careerguidance,"I really thought this company was going to be a long term company for me. I'm working an entry level position but just started classes to move up in the company (a promotion requires more education). I even applied for tuition reimbursement for the classes I'm taking.


I have multiple health issues and checked 'yes' on the ""Do you have a disability?"" question when I was applying for this job. I've been working there for over a year. I was sick for two weeks last year due to smoke inhalation because our area had severe wildfires. I was then placed on a PIP for attendance and told that if my absences were due to medical reasons, I could submit a doctor's note for intermittent medical leave and my attendance would no longer be considered a performance issue. However, I didn't have health insurance until January, so I did not get a doctor's note until a few months ago. I submitted the doctor's note at the same time that I took 4 days of continuous medical leave and the doctor signed one note for both leaves.


Important to note that my manager who was handling the PIP transferred to a different location after I submitted the doctor's note. My supervisor was then promoted to take my manager's place. I had an annual performance review with my supervisor after she got promoted to manager. It was a positive review and I was given a raise. I mentioned the doctor's note at this time and my new manager said she had not yet been made aware of it. I thought that was odd but assumed they were going to fill her in since she had only just been promoted. 

Then in July, a friend of mine died very unexpectedly. Stress exacerbates my health conditions and I missed 1.5 days, then another day for her wake. The lead manager at my office was aware of my friend's passing as well as a few other people I had to tell when I called out. 

The next week, I had a meeting with my manager, my brand new supervisor, and a woman from HR who was running the meeting. They placed a disciplinary notice in front of me which I barely had time to read but it had 3 dates listed on it, dating back to my first attendance warning. 

I said I had a doctor's note on file for intermittent absences and that I was under the impression that was all that was necessary to satisfy the PIP I had been on. HR said I only had the note for the continuous leave I took, and I told her it was on the same note. When she found it, she confirmed that it was on there and swiftly yanked the disciplinary notice away from me. She then chastised me for ""not keeping my managers in the loop"" and also stated that she didn't know if they could accommodate me based on the leave my doctor recommended. She said she would follow up on the issue.

Since this has happened, my motivation to work has substantially dropped. I was putting in extra hours, volunteering to work shifts that needed coverage, and working on my school work to move up in this company. Now I feel that my head is on the chopping block and they are looking for any excuse to fire me, even the death of a friend. I'm stressed all the time, it's affecting my sleep and my health, it's affecting my job performance, and I'm terrified of calling out. I have one more month before I finish my class and am eligible for the tuition reimbursement that I applied for from the company. I'm trying to stick it out until then at least, but I'm wondering if my intuition is correct and I need to give up on this company and look for a job someplace else. And what happens if they say they can't accommodate my medical needs?

This is all good advice, and I have been Googling up a storm researching these possibilities. But I am always willing to listen to people who have a better idea of how to handle this situation. Please, bury me in your tips and observations.)

My resume consists of food service for the most part, though I did spend nearly three years working both back and front of house in a brewery.

I have usually been employed since the age of 19, though there was a long slog in 2016 where I was unemployed. Thankfully, I got over that hump, and I have been working for Chipotle since September of 2016. It pays $9.00 an hour, which is enough for me to live on in a dirt cheap college town even at less than full-time hours, but I'm really just treading water. I'm not working toward anything, and I don't see any future here.

I am moving away very soon even if it means moving back in with my parents in Atlanta.

I, on the other hand, have a print journalism degree I'm not using after I realized that for all that I love the written word, I don't really like the nature of journalism all that much.

I moved across the country at 20 years old (2008 by the way) and realized ""Life is hard when you're the one paying for it""  
Ended up in a bartending job because it was a way to make enough money to pay my bills and have some money left over for the actual enjoyable part of life.

Fast forward 11 years (31 now) and I'm still bartending. Where I'm working pays really well but I swear I'm dying on the inside.

386,dd80de,False,,32,I've gotten to the point where I cant figure out what I actually do for a living anymore?,careerguidance,"To help understand how I got to this point, and where my confusion lies: I'm 31F, and I have a trade certificate in Drafting, no degrees because I'm dyslexic (I do want to try again). I also have no experience outside of the company I work for. 

I started in a small company that has grown about eight years ago as an intern, working in the design department and call center.  Over the next few years, I became a drafting and sales assistant. I then focused solely on Drafting. I developed the drawing office around the companies needs. After about 3 years, I found myself in the position of drawing office manager, out of ease more than ability probably. I was allowed to hire a couple of intern draftsmen, and they became so capable that I started to have a crazy amount of free time. 

I started providing illustrations, and renders to our marketing department as they were looking for a freelancer to do this, I taught myself using freeware, without costing the company anything. The technical guides at the time were elementary, so I started creating documents and illustrating them to help sell our products more effectively. The CEO started using me for his own projects, and I started communicating with suppliers and assisting with developing products offshore. I stopped drafting entirely and had to hand over the drawing office to someone else.

After about 5 years in the company, I was promoted to a product manager, and given a specific line of products. The only other person assisting with this was one of the executive's very capable cousins. About 2 years ago, we hired an R&D manager, who happened to be the sister of one of the Executives. We get on like a house on fire, and she had several years of corporate experience, a masters in her field and helped me polish up professionally. She has somehow become my unofficial manager, though none of the higher-ups wants to say it out loud. I'm happy with it, the entire department runs smoothly owing to her.

The problem lies in that we are under-resourced. It's just the cousin, manager and myself as well as a few strategically placed offshore colleagues.  They keep threatening to hire more people but never do. My manager started using me for product design and rapid prototyping owing to my history with drafting skills, adding to my workload. Then she tackled the technical documentation process, and I suddenly became the liaison between our department and marketing, developing these documents. Including outlining the content, writing, illustrating, researching, data collection and sorting. She edits and we have a back and forth over the document until its ready to send to marketing.

So now I'm managing and developing a product line. I'm designing products outside of that product-line, providing technical support and writing as discussed above, and after all that, my pay-slip actually says R&D manager.  The only thing I don't do other than editing is manage budgets, which the CEO does himself.

So what am I? A Product Manager? R&D manager? Or am I really a Product designer? Maybe a Technical writer and illustrator? By trade, I'm a Draftsman. Do they fall under some all encompassing job title. Do Product managers or R&D managers usually do this stuff? 

A job title seems like such a small thing, but I want to go back to university, it is not going to happen with the workload. I also want to renegotiate my salary. Not because I necessarily want more money (which I do!), but because I if they keep getting the milk for free, why buy more cows?  I adore my job, but my current salary is along the lines of a mid-level draftsman, which doesn't reflect my (perceived) value to the company or based on my official job titles, regardless of the qualifications.  Can I even make comparisons given that this all is so dependent on the niche I've created for myself within the company? And the company has done so much for me as well but after 8 years, at what stage do I stop paying it forward to them and start focusing on myself without been ungrateful?

I am currently paying my minimum on my loans among numerous other expenses, I am in no position to just quit until I am able to find a new career.

I graduated a year ago ( Dec '19) from an above-average business program, with a degree in logistics and supply chain. I was quite active, through my fraternity and the supply chain club. My grades were good (3.4) and I am was also able to graduate a year early due to workload and credits from HS.

I look great on paper, I am even better IRL. Not too gloat but I am currently among the top 5 trainees in my current company ( 500+) in sales, but I just have no interest in working there and would leave at the drop of a hat.

However, my job search is horrid, like worse than Season 8 of GOT. I have only been applying to supply chain/logistics field positions.

1. I am surprised with a task and anxiety or pressure takes over.
2. The specific task requires me to be focused for a long period of time.

One example happened just yesterday. It was my first day on the job and I was so focused on completing tasks on this new higher checklist that I failed to realize there were two other related documents listed within a specific task's text that had to be completed. It was 3:30 and these were due at EOB. I quickly started on these documents and realized today that on the Excel document I over looked the instructions tab and other tab I had to fill out.

My old manager gave me this feedback at my previous job and I am afraid I am not improving. I can't help but feel like I have tunnel vision.

Any ideas on how to combat this?

I’ve just gotten a new job that I really want to do well at, but this disdain for work is deeply affecting my work and my enthusiasm for the role. I’ve worked part-time jobs and they weren’t so bad, but something about every 9-5 office job just feels like signing up for your own death. Like this desk, or another one, will be where I sit till I die. 

I resent it so much. I resent that our society is built this way, I resent that I have to spend my days doing this when I don’t enjoy it, I resent that lucky people like Kylie Jenner can sit at their gorgeous pools in the sun and play on their phones all day. 

I know I sound childish. I know this is just how it is. I’ve literally paid for school with the intent of having an office job. What do I do? How do I stop thinking this way and just accept that this is life? How do I start feeling enthusiasm and excitement for this role, especially now that I’ve just started at a new office?

I would sincerely appreciate any advice. I’m scared this feeling could ruin my life. It’s been consistent with every office job I’ve ever worked.

Should I quit my job?,careerguidance,"I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job  alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I  interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.

I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of  stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/h9ekw1/i_think_im_having_a_burnout_breakdown_and_i_dont/,132,"I don't see a location.

Maybe the board is just taking precautions, but I can't help but feel they are using the whole coronavirus saga as a cover to cut labour costs for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish.

As for money, probably if you stuck with social media marketing or business technology you could make a lot of money, but that doesn't mean you would be poor in helping professions like psychology / social work / nonprofit.  I know several people who are social workers or therapists that do quite well for themselves.   For those positions you're going to need graduate degrees and probably licenses.  I also know people that have been involved in nonprofits or ""corporate giving"" positions that have good (though not spectacular) salaries.

That month I ended up accepting my current job through someone in my network with total transparency about my plans (the company said they didn't care if I needed to leave four months in). As life had it, our landlord changed his mind about selling the building and the city decided not to shut down our train line.

I've now been at my job since October 2018, and my boss (the one who brought me on) was fired in June 2019.  Since then, I've been handling all of her duties and been a de facto member of our company's C-suite, without any raise, promotion, or official acknowledgement. Including me in these conversations resulted in me leading two company-wide primary initiatives that have turned the business around.

I've repeatedly asked for a promotion, and finally my CEO/(new) boss has told me point-blank that he won't give me the promotion unless I agree not move in 2020.

Meanwhile, my partner still hates his job and we both feel we'll want to finally move next year (we'll likely start our job hunts next month and hope to move by midyear).

I feel frustrated that, if I'm honest with my boss, my resume will show zero growth and I'll have been doing a C-level job without compensation for almost a calendar year.

I’m at a crossroads and need some advice. Would quitting a job without something lined up be a huge black mark on my record? I’m currently at a job in high net worth wealth management that’s making me absolutely miserable. I love my company overall, but my current team’s culture is toxic and rife with bullies. We’re also working on a soul crushing project through the end of the year which has and will continue to require a great deal of mandatory overtime on nights and weekends. 

I would normally never go against the conventional wisdom to not leave a job before you have a job, but I think pushing through much longer will break me. I’m at the point where I’m having nightly panic attacks due to how much I dread having to go to the office the next day. I’ve also starting having suicidal ideations where I imagine killing myself in the office specifically. I would never act on these thoughts (I think), but the fact that I’m having them at all is worrisome.

I know my situation isn’t healthy, but I’m terrified of quitting with nothing else lined up as I live in a highly competitive and high cost of living area (San Francisco Bay Area). I’m so overwhelmed with the hours I’m working that I can’t even begin to think of applying and interviewing to new jobs, let alone get the mental health help I need. I’m also worried that quitting won’t even give me the relief I’m so desperately craving as I’ll likely be too stressed over being unemployed to fully relax and contemplate what I want. Additionally, I fear the the problem isn’t the job, but me. A part of me thinks I’m just a deeply sad person who will be just as miserable at my next gig, so there’s a chance I would be giving up my career only to end up just as miserable. What are my chances of landing an equivalent or better job if I take time off in order to protect my wellbeing?

What to say in future interviews?,careerguidance,"As the title reads, I unfortunately lost my cool and quit my job on the spot after being with them for a year and a half. I've never done this before and consider myself a good reliable, employee but for some reason I found myself walking out of this service job.

To provide some context I graduated 2 years ago from a decent school with a degree in Marketing and was unhappy with the job prospects out of school. Without finding anything permanent, I ended up working a service job in the beverage industry and began to enjoy it over time. It was a cool, hip spot and I felt like I fit in with the culture. I ended up making my way into the manager role which was a welcome promotion but still left me deeply unsatisfied. I appreciated the experience and the responsibility it taught me but it still did not feel right and left me yearning for more. I also live in an area that is extremely slow in the off-season and has a huge rush in the summer months, so the winter months left me with little to do. Also the work environment became horrible over time. I realized my co-workers were extremely bad people and it began to effect me over time, mainly my mental health. I was treated so, so poorly by coworkers on countless occasions. I'd rather not get into specifics but I needed to get out of this small town bubble.

Because of my dissatisfaction, I decided to look for housing and work closer to my circle of friends where we attended our undergrad. I fell in love with that area and wanted desperately to go back. So I let my work know months advance that I had begun looking for housing and work and gave them a rough timeline of how things would play out. It's a tiny business and we are all pretty friendly for the most part so I thought this was just a normal conversation. Turns out they demoted me of my position and cut my hours drastically after hearing word of my notice. This meant loss of the few benefits I had and much, much lower pay after being there for a year. My time was cut in half. Not to mention the work environment had become worse than ever. I am currently down 10 pounds my normal weight and it's taken a noticeable toll. In hindsight, I should have never given my notice to the company but I thought it was the genuine right thing to do so they would be in the best shape come the busy summer months.

So the other day I decided that my life is too short to be miss-treated like this so I walked out. I explained to my boss the situation and they are not happy whatsoever. Luckily, I have plenty of savings by living at home, have had many job interviews (sales/marketing) in the area and will be moving in mid-July.

But for now I am 23, unemployed, and have a feeling of guilt that I can't shake. I feel worse than before. I'm disappointed that after all that time I burned a bridge and acted poorly.

I’m looking for someone who’s fairly experienced at IT and content. 

When I received the CVs, one girl really stood out to me. It was very genuine, no management bullshit and was honest. But she doesn’t have the experience I was looking for. I gave her the opportunity to do a task related to the work and she did very very well especially considering she has very little experience in this field. 

I invited her for an interview and she was such an open person. Her personality was refreshing and she showed so much enthusiasm. She kept repeating how much of ah interest she has in this field and how eager she is to learn etc, she mentioned she’s easy to mould. I was really impressed with her attitude. 

However this role is meant for someone with more experience. You need to be technical and she doesn’t have the experience. No doubt she’d definitely put in the effort it takes to learn but, yeah. That’s my pickle. 

I’ve got a bunch of other candidates who didn’t stand out as much in the interviews but definitely have the experience i need and a lot of them are internal already meaning I feel like I owe them more, and then I have this one girl I can’t stop thinking about because of how just enthusiastic and refreshing she was. I genuinely think she’d fit in the team so well but again she lacks experience and knowledge so she’d need training. 

I need to do what’s best for the team here. Please give me any advice you can.

894,a8bmpq,False,,33,I'm almost 40 years old and have no degree. Can you help with direction and degree recommendations?,careerguidance," I am a person who is 40 years old with no degree and I am concerned about job security and the next 25 years of work.  
 

In my teenage years I took vocational and career classes.  I started  college but had to work instead.  I have worked my way up the past 23  years as a draftsman, a cad modeller, a tool maker, a designer and now  an engineering manager for the aerospace industry.  Most of what I do  now is Solidworks design.  I have experience in mechanical, electrical,  hydraulics, pneumatic systems and many various software systems.  I  design turn-key packages that include all of these elements.

I also do  some light programming in PLC, VBA and have previous experience with  HTML, PHP, Pearl, SQL.  I love computers and tech.  Building and repairing  PC's has been a hobby since I had a Tandy 6mhz.   I also build stuff.  Book  cases, picnic tables, bathrooms, kitchens, full size decks... doesn't  matta.  I can calc some hydraulic forces for you and spec cylinders and fittings, or drop you a new stainless dual tub with sprayer and disposal in a few hours.  
 

I can obviously tell that times have changed.  
 

Upset about the election results, my own employer has started a crusade  against ""uneducated"" people.   He also changed my title to strike the  word ""Engineering"" from it and replace it with ""Design"" as that doesn't  imply ""Fake engineer"".  It does not seem to matter that I have designed  millions of dollars of product for him, having completed close to a  thousand designs over the last 20 years.   I am still paid very well  regardless.  As acting Design Manager I do manage actual engineers with  actual degrees (is this all sounding crazy?) and I TEACH them our  industry.  
 

Anyhow.  It appears I need some papers to support the idea that I'm not  stupid.   The worst part of it is when I tell anyone how I make a  living, the very first comment is ""Where did you go to school?"" and I  sheepishly have to explain that I'm technically uneducated.  
 

I'm also concerned that if I needed a new job in the next 20 years I may  not be hired because I do not have a degree.  I have a stunning amount  in 401K, investments as a safety net.  I currently have 2 houses, one of  which I rent, and 4 income streams.  Therefore I feel that I do not  need the king of degrees, I just need groundwork to be considered by  companies.  I feel by 2030 no one will be allowed to WORK without a  degree, as even being a secretary now requires a degree >.<  
 

I am not sure if I want a degree in mech or aerospace.  With the second  half of my life, I may want to focus more on computer systems, or  perhaps focus on management.  But I need a direction to get started.   I  was also looking at the online schooling, as I work 10 hour days and  have a family.  If I could start with an associates that could later be  used toward various bachelors that would be very helpful.  I really do  not know a lot about the education process itself.  
 

I was also thinking I could add certs and licenses too, in various trade  skills.  I could also get a cert for Solidworks Certified Professional  and whatnot pretty easily, but never thought that would actually ""mean""  something on a resume.

Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful. 

Normally, I wouldn’t be upset over not getting a raise within the first year, but I was told I would get a review, then offered a promotion which I have done a great job with...and no increase in pay... am I wrong for being pissed?

It takes a certain personality to be a bulldozer. As for non-lit jobs, I never chose to do them because what I have been exposed to I’ve found dreadfully boring. I absolutely love the law, from a theoretical standpoint, and yet I regret and resent the fact that I became a lawyer. It makes me sad that I feel this way, having planned to be a lawyer since I was in middle school, but it’s the truth. Law school is an extremely expensive financial decision that could have a serious impact on your financial future, so be aware of that when you go into it. ",2019-10-28 04:02:34

90,egzvob,False,,40,How do I stop trying to get personal validation from my job?,careerguidance,"Hey friends, sorry if the title isn't totally clear. Basically I had an epiphany yesterday, after I went the extra mile and busted my butt at my job for a project that turned out to not be worth the trouble. I'm on the east coast of the US, and one of our clients is in Alaska, so a four hour time difference. They told us a file had to be finished by the end of the day, so I decided to give up my plans for Friday night and bring my work laptop home so I could hop on as soon as I got an email from the client. But by the time their office closed at 9pm my time they hadn't gotten around to doing their end of things yet, so I had just wasted my evening for nothing. 

This type of thing is a pretty rare occurrence at my job, so this event is not a huge deal per se. I'm grateful I rarely have to take work home with me after hours. However, I just felt sort of disproportionately embarrassed and foolish for putting in that  much effort and giving up my plans for what turned out to be something less important than I thought it was. After some self reflection I realized I'm trying to somehow derive love and self-worth from my job, which is basically impossible in a corporate environment. I think it was drilled into me as a kid that my education was the most important thing, above social and other commitments, and I've just carried it over into my working life without realizing it.

I'm very grateful for my friends and family that give me social and emotional satisfaction, as well as my hobbies, but I guess I have still not come to terms that my job is just a job, not my life's calling, and doesn't give me much besides money and something to leave the house for. I guess basically my question is, how do you deal with the fact that your job isn't the center of your life? How do you begin to separate how you define yourself from how you spend the majority of your waking hours? Sorry if this is a little too philosophical or over-thinking things. I just haven't gotten it into my head yet that I can't just keep working harder until I earn self-esteem.

TL;DR: Just realized I'm stupidly trying to put in enough effort for a soulless corporate to love me and validate my existence somehow. Have others dealt with this epiphany, and how did you start to derive your self-worth elsewhere?

304,hope3x,False,Edit with your location,54,What does an exit interview usually entail?,careerguidance,"
I quit my job a few days ago when a better offer came along. I told my boss about the offer the week before, he tried to counter it, but in the end he wasn’t able to give me the title change and increase in responsibility that I desired. I wrote a letter of notice to him that explained this and gave it to him in person with a verbal explanation also. 

Part of the reason I am quitting is because of my boss. I’ve been unhappy at my job for at least the past year. I was also just bored and wanted to learn more. I had no idea my boss or coworkers even thought I was an asset until I tried to quit and they said that I was the best person they have ever had in that position and didn’t want to lose me. I have been paranoid about being fired the past 2.5 years I’ve been there. My boss seems to only point out what I do wrong and rarely compliments me even when I am working my tail off. He promised me a lot of things that he never followed through with. He said no to most of my ideas and then was upset when I didn’t bring new things to the company. I mainly avoided him because his main form of communication was yelling. Everyone else at the company feels this way about him. That their biggest problem with the company is him. 

I just want to prepare for this exit interview. What do they typically entail? Should I be honest about how his bad communication skills is part of the reason I’m leaving? He is about to retire in a couple of years, so is there even a reason to do this? Everyone knows him in my industry and I want him to remember me positively.

I’m based in the US.

329,be93ux,False,,92,"28F , recovering addict , 3 time felon...What can I realistically do with my life?",careerguidance,"Hey guys , 

&#x200B;

Informative title , I know. I'm a pretty transparent type of person and don't mind being open and honest about the experiences I've had in my life so far. I apologize if this is long but truly appreciate anyone that takes the time to read. 

I'm a female , 28 years old , born and raised in the US , and have a long history of drug abuse. I've been sober for 4 1/2 years which will probably always be the best decision I've ever made in my life. I started using at age 10 , dropped out of high school at the end of my junior year and continued my destructive path until I was 24 when I got sober. In between all of that , I caught endless amount of drug charges , went through rehab and jail countless times , lost my father suddenly 2 weeks before my 23rd birthday and dealt with ( still do) a very broken family. Needless to say , a career was the last thing I was ever thinking about through these times. I managed to gain 3 felonies on my record ( all a direct result of my addiction ). Possession charges and a receiving stolen property charge ( I used my ID to sell something that was obviously stolen) During my years of active addiction I had pretty common jobs ; waiting tables  , selling glasses at a kiosk in the mall , telemarketing. Hated them all. When I got sober , a friend of mine was a crew leader for a construction maintenance cleaning company and got me a job. The hours were long , exhausting and my boss was a very opinionated woman who I somehow really got a long with but didn't always agree with the way she handled some business. After about 90 days at that job , I got promoted to Crew supervisor and had my own crew of about 6-8 people to run everyday. I didn't necessarily love the supervisor part of it all , but I did like delegating tasks. I also love manual labor. After about 2 years I left that job for a behavioral health tech position working in a drug and alcohol treatment facility.   I really thought at that time that this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to eventually get my GED and go back to school to become an addiction counselor. What ended up happening was me being taken advantage of at that company and made to run psycho educational groups every single day with no schooling behind me and only having a little over 2 years sober. I got burnt out , and I got burnt out quick. I became extremely checked out and ended up making a very impulsive decision ( which I don't regret but have absolutely learned to never do again) and quit my job without anything else lined up. The stress of the job fell off my shoulders but then the stress of life and careers jumped right on. I was jobless for the first 3 months of 2018 and finally found a job through a friend in the 12 step program I was in doing Underwriting for a Loan company. I had no idea what any of it entailed and was extremely nervous because not only do I hate numbers of any kind , but i'm horrible at math. Anyway , I'm still currently with this company and although there's no part of it that I really do enjoy ,and sitting at a desk all day is driving me nuts ,  I would never abruptly leave like I did the last one. It's a very flexible job , my commute is 10 minutes and my boss is extremely understanding when I need time off. Nonetheless , it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently , about 2 months ago , obtained my GED and now am trying to navigate what I want to do with my life. 

&#x200B;

I feel lost in the sense of never really having that chance to figure it out when I was a teenager because I was getting high. I have felonies now , although they are all about 8 years old at this point. I don't want to waste my time going to college for a degree and I ultimately won't be able to get a job doing because of my past. I also hear horror stories of people going into extreme debt for a degree that they can't even get a job for. I'm not willing to do that. I've been trying to do some research about trade schools but I also don't know if my body can handle doing that for the rest of my life. I had surgery on my ankles when I was a baby & have always had issues with being on my feet for long periods of time. I love cleaning and organizing and attempted starting up my own business but it fizzled out for the most part and i'm just not sure I want to own a business. 

&#x200B;

This is a lot and all over the place but it's a pretty good idea of how my brain functions on a daily basis. I'm not getting any younger and I can't help but feel like i'm running out of time.

It’s not a personal thing, it’s a risk thing. Felons are liabilities no matter how good they are at a job or how wonderful they are as people. The felon May not pose a risk themselves, but their status as a felon will always be a risk. If something goes wrong and their status comes out, we’re left holding the bag, regardless of whether or not their status had any relevance to the event. 

Just as you are being smart and realistic about the unlikeliness of being hired if you pursue higher education, you might also consider that even if you work your way up in a place that will hire you and you like it there, management shuffles over time and one day you might get someone like me in the company who will see your HR file and make it clear to the higher-ups that you have to be contained (because we probably can’t fire you if you already work there). Depending on what the laws are where you’re working, we may not be able to fire you, but we can flag you and basically end your career advancement (I know it’s not fair). Either way, it would be unfortunate for you, and eventually you wouldn’t want to work there anymore. Because risk follows you, your manager would be instructed not to provide a reference. 

I wonder though if you would be a good candidate for running your own business, or running one with someone else? A small business environment with very little hierarchy (ie, very few, if any, people like me) would also be a good bet I think. Either be the boss or be close to the boss—that’s probably a real good bet for you. Plenty of people with tarnished pasts do well when they’re not being cock-blocked by risk-averse, white collar folk like myself. 

If you can ever pursue a pardon, I highly encourage you to do so. 

I wish you the very best. It sounds like you know how to keep at it. Good luck—and sorry for being so blunt. ",2019-04-17 15:25:51

Well, as per custom in most US companies, I’m on a 90 day “probation “ period. About 3 weeks after starting I found out I’m pregnant. I don’t need health insurance or anything like that but I do want to keep my job. Right now because I’m still in my first trimester, my job is not affected. But it will be in a few weeks as I lift heavy things and I’m on my feet 7-8hrs a day. There is talk that I will be promoted to a brand new position in the company so this also makes me take pause in telling them. This new position is ideal because it’s behind a desk anyway, but I’m afraid if I say something before I get it, I won’t. I should throw in that the work is mostly seasonal, so while I would have a job full time, the busy season wouldn’t start for a couple months after the baby is born anyway. If all goes well with the pregnancy the timing is perfect.

My brother is 18 years old, left school last summer, and has been working in a high end fashion/furniture store as a Sales Assistant. He has been there for over half a year now and is thinking of his next step. He enjoys the fashion industry and ideally would want to continue and grow in this field, ideally into more the Design side than just Retail. Retail is a cool start, but it's low pay, hard work and weekend shifts. Not ideal.

Through a networking event at work he got in contact with a Senior Manager from Chanel, and after asking my brother to sketch a super quick design and talking for a good hour, he invited my brother to a week long trial.

The catch? The company is in Paris, France, and we live in London, UK. My brother loves French culture, listens to French music, but his French is basic at best.

The week long trial would be a working interview of sorts during Paris Fashion Week, which my brother has been going on about for years, for a full time job, again in Paris.

My brother, after thinking for some time, has decided not to go. He feels he isn’t ready and is too young. However I feel this is lack of confidence and nerves talking, this is literally his dream job and even if they don’t hire him after the week, the expense of being there for 1 week is surely worth the experience and putting it on your CV? I also think that since he’s in his first serious relationship, and works with the girl in his current workplace, that could be swaying his opinion, although he denies this.

What do you guys think? Should I butt out or push him to leap for this? I understand he's young, but this company is on another level to others and this could be a one-in-a-million chance.

Every day there's a new fire. This is beyond crisis communication -  that's different, I don't do that. This is like, ""we need a campaign on  XYZ in three days including radio, tv, print, billboards, social media,  etc etc etc,"" which they will then forget about the next week and that campaign just fizzles and dies. Meanwhile, the actual steady work we have been doing gets pushed back and is in danger of not meeting hard-as-steel deadlines.

AnYwAy, I  want to work a job where I'm not asked to create Michelangelo's David  in three days, where the biggest emergency is that we need to run an errand during office hours. I'm thinking administrative support type jobs. However, I'm overqualified in that I've had loads of responsibility and the work I do is very big and splashy.

My initial thought is to highlight what I bring to the table (project managing, creativity, desktop publishing) rather than my own desires.  However, most places will ask ""why do you want this job?"" or ""why do you want to work for us?""

681,e0gxa4,False,,33,I was devastated after a staff meeting - how to I move on?,careerguidance,"I started this job as an admin. I work with three people. One was hired right after me. Over the last three months, I've been told I've been doing a great job, but still have a ways to go (obviously after only being there three months). We had a staff admin meeting to discuss who was doing what and who was going to do what.

Before, the higher-lever work went to the two more senior admins (80%) with my providing assistance to them (20%) and the other person is still training. Now, the higher-level work were to be divided among my three coworkers and I am odd man out. Instead, my role is literally doing the grunt work. Instead of doing account management, I'm now responsible for grunt work like cleaning out the fridge on Friday and keeping the copier room tidy. I never felt so insulted and hurt. I have and can do more challenging work and am not sure why or how this was decided. It was a conversation I was left out of. I believe our bosses asked the senior admins for their input because they told me to be prepared to doing some grunt AND accounting work. One of the senior admin said that the new alignment would leave her overwhelmed and asked if some of it could be taken off her plate. She was quickly shut down instead of giving some of it to me. I didn't speak up because they would have shut me down too. No need to look stupid in addition to feeling upset.

I have so much more to offer and have proven it. I know I have not made as big mistakes as the senior admins did after their first three months. The head boss mentioned that if someone is screwing up all the time then you're not going to be giving this higher-level work and I couldn't tell if he was directing that comment to me. No one has said anything to me about any major and consistent mistakes on my end. Not one person. Even in the meeting they mentioned some of our shortfalls and mine were minor like missing a call as compared to my coworkers' mistakes literally costing the firm money. I was going to ask them if something happened to make them feel like that I can only do grunt work last night and I didn't because I was too upset.

I keep on telling myself that it's not like I'm going to be paid less to make coffee and won't need to stay late doing paperwork anymore. My sense is that people will start to ask why is I am being paid what I am being paid to make coffee and/or I'm too stupid/unwilling/lazy to do anything else. I will ask my boss and her boss on Monday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not young. I am actually older than my co-workers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, there is some type of disconnect and I believe that it's because one or both of the senior admins are speaking on my behalf to our supervisors. One in particular. I started to cut that person off because I know I cannot trust her, but I was told that cutting people off at work would backfire by the other admin. The other two admins have made serious and costly mistakes when they first started and even recently (which was the reason why we had the meeting to begin with). Those mistakes were brought to their attention formally (closed door meetings with supervisors) as well as plans to prevent them from repeating those mistakes. I, on the other hand, have never had one of those ""closed door"" meetings. There were times when they mentioned to me casually ""hey, next time you take a message from XYZ make sure you ask them for both their cell and home phone"" or ""next time review the bill to see if anything on it looks off."" So when they're talking about people screwing up and being left out of challenging work, I cannot figure out if it's directed at me or to all of us. This troubles me because it can be inferred that they might taking the approach that I'm not worth fixing.

&#x200B;

Finally, I've had blunt conversations with my boss and her boss. I explained to them my anxiety and they assured me that I was doing fine, I am being way too hard on myself and (repeatedly, might I add) that if someone is going to be fired, then they would know it. They stressed to me they try to fix the problem(s) and I see that with current and past employees. They've mentioned that A LOT.

&#x200B;

TBH, I believe that people are right when they say I am not promoting myself enough. I also believe that I might have gotten blamed for things that I wasn't to blame for and am not aware of it and one of my co-workers needs to be cut off. Come Monday morning, I am going to be the first person in the office and speak to my boss and squarely ask her where do I stand and ask her how the choice/justification/logic was made to switch things up and even ask for some of the high-level work back. That is all I can do and keep my mouth shut.

How can I turn this around?,careerguidance,"I recently started my first full time job out of undergrad. I'm a creative writer. That's what I'm qualified to do. That's what I know. The job is at a small law firm, and I was hired to run the blog, help draft damages letters, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, things were going well. I was writing regular blog content and spicing up things that needed to be sent to defendants or shown in court. It took a bit of a learning curve, but I was completely on top of it. 

Then my boss decided our website needed a redesign. I thought he'd outsource the design and have me write the site text. I showed him some other sites I thought were well designed and pointed out how design language could be used to engage potential clients. Suddenly I was in charge of the design. 

Right away, I told him that despite having some limited knowledge of good UX principles, I was not qualified to do an entire website. He told me that I'm ""smarter than I think."" 

Now I've been working on the site for a few weeks. I got him to let me use a pretty dumbed down website building tool so that it would look nice despite the fact that this isn't something I've done before. He keeps asking me to add in animations and build pages that a) this building tool doesn't allow for and b) that I wouldn't know how to create even if it did. 

Every time I present something to him, he wants something even more technically impressive. I keep coming just close enough to what he previously wanted for him to up the ante again. 

He also asked me to design an entire digital marketing strategy spanning multiple domains we own, and including ads etc.

I'll say it again. I am a writer. I write a lot, and I write well, but I am not a visual creative, nor a programmer, nor a web expert. At this point I'm barely doing any of the things I was initially hired to do. 

My boss isn't malicious. He is getting carried away, and doesn't listen to outside opinion. I've communicated my lack of knowledge every time he asks for something. I don't know what to do. How do I stop this train from derailing?

I am 32 Years old and have just been fired today.  I was fired for an incident that occurred 7-8 years ago.   This topic is not about why i was fired so i will just leave it at that.

I have been with this company for my entire adult life. Part time while in university, and full time immediately after graduation.  8-9 years working there full time.  You could say its a government job where most people who work there stay for life, and that was my plan as well.

I have a degree in Finance and graduated in 2010,  it was difficult to find work in my field back then, and I had the opportunity to get a decent paying job out of school so I took it.

I started as a cleaner and took a few relevant courses to become a technician/mechanic within the company.  Sadly these courses do not qualify me for anything outside of my previous work. 

Now I am unemployed, and the only education I have is finance degree from a decade ago with zero relevant experience, and some random trade courses my previous employer decided were relevant.  Essentially zero technical qualifications.



**I have no idea what I want to do with my life at this point.**  I am recently married, and we had our first child 2 months ago, so the timing could not have been worse.  But I do have several months to a year worth of funds saved.

I am open to trying anything really, from going back to school, to starting my own business.
My previous work was easy but brain dead and I did not really enjoy my time there, it was just to pay the bills.  
I'm hoping this time around it can be different.


A few things about me.

* I'm a nerd, logical, introvert, somewhat interested in technology, and I play alot of games.

* I am no good at things like cold calling, sales, public speaking, and grammar. 

* I consider myself a fairly capable individual.  And I am confident if given the chance I can excel in whatever position I apply for.  I just need the opportunity 



Some fields I've considered (but know nothing or very little about)

* Gaming related

* IT related job

* Finance related 




Any extra schooling I go for would have to be a relatively short/fast tracked?  As I cannot afford to go back to school for 4 years.


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, 
for example, the IT field is huge, what sort of courses should I take?  How much money will I make?

Obviously i want to make the most money possible.  For reference I made ~75k at my previous job

I've always wondered why that would be such a risk.  One time when I was unemployed, I considered looking in other areas for jobs and applied for a few out of state.  I got calls back from the recruiters about them, but they'd say they were hesitant to hire someone from out of state or wouldn't pay for relocation (which was fine with me).  At the same time, sometimes I get contacted from recruiters about jobs all across the country..  It seems like some places are afraid to hire from out of state, and some aren't.

Also at that time, I was contacted by a hiring manager at a company within my state but in a different city, about 3-4 hours drive from where I was living.

Hi all,

For context: I'm a final year university student who will hopefully be 'graduating' this summer. I'm also currently applying for jobs, which is obviously not ideal in this climate.

I'm not dealing very well mental health wise with the current lockdown. I've got a few final university assignments to do, which I'm struggling to get done, but other than that I don't feel at all able to do... almost anything else. I'm seeking help etc. (I'll save you all the long details!), but I'm barely fulfilling the basic functions of a human being at the moment, let alone learning new skills, taking online courses, or generally working on my personal or professional development.

I'm worried that, over the coming months/year(s) I'm going to be asked about how I used this period to improve myself and make myself a better candidate, and that I'm not really going to be able to say anything. I can say that I was working on my university work, and that I've done a little bit of aid volunteering (it's an ad hoc kind of thing), but I reckon that lots of people feel more able to use this time to do lots of impressive stuff. That's how it feels among my peer group, anyway. I was already less than confident about getting a job after I graduated, but it would really suck if this was another blow.

I know that many of you are currently seeking employment/might work in recruitment etc., so I was just wondering what your thoughts were. Let me know if this is the wrong sub!

Thanks :)

942,9aaba8,False,,33,"I got offered a high-paying, once in a lifetime opportunity job that I feel I am not qualified for. Should I take the job?",careerguidance,"I currently have my own business with 2 partners that is doing pretty well.
We have been in talks of me leaving the company and selling my share to them. It's kind of hard to explain why I am leaving my own company, despite it being successful and only getting bigger. But I feel like  it's not challenging enough for me and I am stuck in a rut and not learning and growing, so I want to go work for another company where I can learn and cover up my ""weak spots"" in areas I don't know well.

My partners are supportive of my decision and said there's an ownership spot for me if I ever decide to come back, even if it's years down the line.

Anyway, on to the topic of the title.
A CEO of a very big and well-known company in our industry somehow got wind of me leaving my company and looking for a job (not sure how since only a few people know right now), and called me to ask for a meeting. I met with him and he offered me a very high-paying job running one of his company's departments. I was taken aback my this offer. It is very lucrative and a position most people would kill for. However, I personally believe I am not qualified. I know this CEO from my previous job, where we would interact constantly, so he knows my experience for the most part, which is why it is surprising that he offered this position to me.

I am not sure what to do. I feel like even though I am under-qualified, I can read and study and learn what I need to, and in a few months be somewhat qualified. They also said they will train me. I did want a challenging job and this job will definitely be tough.

My friends and family think I would be stupid to not take the job, and the worst-case scenario would be I get fired but would still learn a lot during my time there even if that happens. They also think I AM qualified and just have low self-confidence, which I admit has always been a personal issue for me.

I was thinking of requesting another meeting and being honest to the CEO with my skills and what he expects, just so there are no surprises, would that be the best way to go about this?

Another complication is that if I take this position, I will technically be competing against the company I started, so that makes things even weirder for me.

424,fo246f,False,,85,Can't get any kind of job. What happens to people like me?,careerguidance,"I'm in my early-mid twenties and I've never had a job.

Without getting into too much detail, I've had a problem throughout my entire life which had disallowed me from participating effectively in any kind of institutional setting. I would summarize the problem by saying that I can't deal with ambiguity. In school, I would sometimes not turn in work that I had already done because I wasn't exactly sure where or how to turn it in, and I was too afraid to ask. That's an extreme case, but I had lots of other smaller issues like that. Not sure of how to do some kind of project that they provided little to no information on the specifics of. I'm sure people can relate, but the difference between you and me is that you seem to be able to bs your way through it and find some way to figure out what they're trying to ask you to do.

I was homeschooled for a lot of my life, and my problems with ambiguous instructions began in 4th grade where I attended a public school for the first time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I generally lack common sense in a lot of areas, leading to various other problems functioning. I would go into more detail but it seems unnecessary for now. The basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't deal with normal institutional scenarios. I'm pretty intelligent and pretty talented in some areas, but when an obligation presents itself in the form of an institution, that's when I can't deal with it. I don't want to deal with it but I also can't. Somehow, when a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of profiteers get involved in some sort of activity, they turn the activity itself into a secondary goal. The main goal is to fulfill the bureaucracy's requirements, or to suck up to the right people, or to help your boss make profit. No one wants me to do some task for the sake of simply doing the task, and I think the spirit of that situation is just very difficult for me to function in, and the ambiguous instructions that come up in that situation are just the cherry on top, guaranteeng that I won't be able to do what the job is asking. As an example, I'm somewhat talented at computer security, and I enjoy messing around on my own with it, but in an employment scenario, instead of just doing what needs to be done, I'm suddenly gonna have to write a report, and present a slideshow, or some other bureaucratic garbage which as I said, is designed to fulfill some need other than the immediate requirements of the job, which is where I struggle.

So anyway, just to finish my history. I went to middle school until I left in the 7th grade when I dropped out and became homeschooled again, which didn't actually entail much official schooling. I mostly just educated myself on stuff I happened to be interested in. My parents knew I couldn't take public school anymore. I went to a community college during the time that I was finishing up my homeschooling time. It took me over five years but eventually I got a associates degree and in college I suffered from all the same problems I laid out before. But I did get the degree. It's useless for me however.

So, I'm now in a situation where I've kind of accepted that I can't get a job. If I were to go to an interview, I'd be far too awkward and unable to follow the instructions during the interview, both in preparation for it and in terms of answering the questions during it. Secondly, if I did ever get a job somehow, I'd be fired within a couple weeks as soon as the employers see that I can't perform. My parents have been understanding to some degree and have supported me up until now, but our financial situation is much tighter now and I really want to try and help out, even though I know I can't.

I would say that the only job I could really get would be some kind of job where the boss tells you exactly what to do and there's no reading between the lines whatsoever. For example, the boss says ""take this shovel and move these rocks from this pile into that pile."" I can do that, but even with manual labor, a lot of it is too difficult for me to interpret what they're asking me to do. Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do? I basically just want some kind of manual labor job (not dissing manual labor at all here, just to be clear) where I don't really have to engage in deep thought about what's going on. I was thinking maybe some kind of assembly line job could be possible. I really want to try and find something here, but I don't really think there's a specific job that allows for simple manual labor like that. Do such jobs exist, and if so, what sort of titles would they be under and how might I apply for it? I I just wonder what happens to people like me sometimes. I mean what if I can't get any kind of job? I live in the US and we have basically no welfare state whatsoever. Especially since I've never had a job, they won't give me anything. I guess I'm just gonna be homeless, but I think I might have missed some kind of opportunity in the form of a simple, manual labor job that doesn't require previous experience in carpentry or construction or anything like that, and that doesn't require any of the thinking on your feet that I'm so bad at.

I’m currently getting my degree in Marketing and slowly have been getting into that industry for the past 4 years. My track record has shown that I keep accepting job offers that promise opportunities that never seem to come to fruition. 

When I first decided to switch to marketing (bc I couldn’t find any decent paying jobs in graphic design in my area) I took a job in marketing at a small (but had a huge client list across the country) business that promise I would be working & gaining experience in marketing. They wanted someone fresh because they never really had a designated marketing person and it would be a great growing experience for both of us. They were the ones who got me back in school for marketing. I stayed there a little over 3 years and ended up only really ever doing graphic design with minimal raises, barely any marketing experience, and no promotions. I eventually left that company when they opened a new position in marketing & never considered me for the position (even though this would have been GREAT marketing experience for me and i expressed interest in the position) to give it to someone outside the company that eventually came out she had no idea what she was doing. 

I had another dumb job that didn’t even last a year and now I’m at my current job.

I have a bit of an awkward question. I have been working in software industry for the past 2 years.

I personally love being an engineer since it is a knowledge based profession. You work hard, you study, you get results. You either know the stuff, or you don't. Very simple and clean dynamics.

However I have always had these teammates who were more focused on marketing themselves and polishing their CV rather than actually learning a thing or two, and doing the job. They usually are very dominant and dramatic people as well, often not afraid to pick up a fight or lie.

Now at my current job, except me and another coworker, rest of the team is focused on exploiting company resources to interview with other companies. I mean I can handle one rotten apple every now and then, but having an entire team that is lying to manager (they make up a story together) and manipulating him in order to get those resources so they can interview with FAANG or some start up is just insane.

I mean yesterday I was ill, took a sick leave, and I asked my team if someone can switch with me regarding a task at 9 am. Only that colleague helped me and he only did that afternoon. They practically didn't even responded me for half a day. How on earth I am supposed to work like this ? This is not even limited to times I am on leave and need help. It is just everyday behavior.

These people are like a cult. They have no shame, no ethics, nothing. Most of them are not doing anything for months but claiming they are just busy and get aggressive if you ask more about their work. When given a task they are doing extremely poorly yet still blame the client for being unhappy.

It looks like this is what the market is all about. Anyone who can talk about some generic concepts or simple architecture and a BFS algorithm seems to get the job but cannot do the job itself, rinse and repeat.

1) most of the people that did this were higher ups and as long as they got their work done, it was all good. sometimes they'd let another higher up that they'd be arriving later than usual, but it really wasn't that big of a deal.

2) i could usually take lunch anytime between 1pm-2pm. sometimes i'd have so much work to do that i'd take lunch past 2pm, but it didn't happen that often. i usually went for lunch at 1pm since it was much closer to 9am, but if i took lunch at 1:30pm or 2pm, it meant the rest of the day felt much shorter than it really was.

3) a lot of the people that were there for much longer than me went out for happy hour or to lunch/dinner, but since i was considered a new guy, i wasn't brought along. we did however have a lot of events in the office. these were usually for holidays or birthdays. people usually talked about whatever they wanted to talk about.

4) people did curse a lot, but it was only when they weren't talking to a customer or to a superior. 

5) i wasn't there long enough to witness any special traditions.

6) reading online reviews and the body language/vibe you get from the office helps a lot. the place i used to work at had open cubicles, so you could easily see everyone all at once. in general, the place was emotionless and it being cold on a near daily basis didn't help.

i'd say working in an office is just like any other job. as long as you keep your eyes, ears, and mouth shut during certain situations, you'll be good. a lot of people thrive on gossiping and stirring shit up, so just be careful of what you say and who you're saying it to. ",2020-02-07 12:54:22

It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with ""mandatory summer starts""; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a ""temp"" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. ""buyout"" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people ""working for us"" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over. 

&#x200B;

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps.

I just feel like I’m failing right now and I’ve been thinking over is this career path really right for me.

What worked for me was going abroad for a while.  I spent two years teaching English in Asia. It gave me a lot of time to think, as well as meet people from a completely different culture and see how they deal with this question.

It seems to me the most successful and widely used strategy is to find something you don’t completely hate doing that earns money and has decent benefits, then use your money for the things you actually like, such as caring for your loved ones and pursuing hobbies, and set aside a little bit for old age.  That seems to be the general strategy of the happier older people I’ve met.  Good luck. ",2019-03-19 14:04:24
279,eujyuk,False,,131,I feel like I’ve failed at 26. Is there a way forward?,careerguidance,"Hope this doesn’t turn out too long.

I lost my mom at the start of college. It did me no favors as she was the only positive person in my life. College didn’t work out for me and I never graduated. I feel like I’ve failed massively in this regard. I studied networking (IT)

I have a decent gig right now making 40k-ish a year. However, I wanted to be so much more. I wanted to be able to support myself and my elderly father. I feel like I’ve peaked with what I’m working with right now. I talked to school counselors and discovered I’d have to start all the way from gen ed and basically redo a whole degree. This was super disheartening. I also don’t have the luxury of  quitting my job in order to focus on school as me and my father have supported each other since my mom died.  Also, even if I went back to school, I would not continue down the networking path as it is definitely not for me.

So I feel pretty stuck. My job is not a bad job, but like I said, I feel like I’ve peaked. I want to move upwards in life, and by that I don’t mean I want fancy things and wealth. I mean that I want stability, safety, and security for me and my loved ones. I don’t want to just get by and be at risk for losing it all. I miss feeling like I was building a life back when I was still in school. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Anyone have advice for me?

739,a72vz1,False,,15,"Hiring managers and HR pros, how do you make salary, raise, and promotion decisions? What should I enforce as a manage and what should I expect as an employee?",careerguidance,"Hey all, let's talk salary. I have a few questions about how different companies set salaries and give raises and promotions. I'm keeping this as brief as possible, but am happy to add more color if needed.

1) Hiring Managers: how would you characterize your salary setting philosophy? Meaning, how much weight to you place on a new hire's individual skills & strengths vs their ""paper"" resume (their degree, their industry experience etc). Also, does this change when related to internal candidates where the candidate may have a great track record within the company and very concrete proven skills demonstrated during their employment thus far, but a weaker paper resume and less industry experience? 

2) Salary increases: I'll give an example here. I had two hires for the same position. I hired one in at a higher salary rate due to prior experience and a very strong resume, but the 2nd (more entry level in the industry, originally hired at a lower rate) is fantastic and quickly outpaced the more experienced hire.  Over 1+ year this employee has proven to be more productive, self driven and innovative, and has also taken on a bigger workload. I want to increase this 2nd hire's salary to be more comparable to the more experienced employee, but am getting pushback because this more entry level employee still technically has less experience. Is this normal? Or, as the hiring manager for this position, should I be pushing harder for a raise for this employee? Assume budget isn't a limiting factor here. 

3) Internal Promotions: I've seen my current company manage internal promotions in two different ways,  and I'm curious which is more common practice (or if both are used commonly, or something else)

Lets say a current employee proves their skills & worth and is clearly ready for a promotion. There is a larger role needed,  and the employee is a good fit for growth. Assume budget isn't the issue here, just employee development. Do you....

A) Offer the employee the additional responsibilities and a title change, as well as a salary bump.

B) Give the employee the additional responsibilities. If they do well, offer them the title change and salary bump after they prove they can do the new job. 

C) Another option? Post the new job and do a formal hiring process? Anything else? 

Tldr: paper resume or proven skills, which has more impact on an employee's salary? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/a72vz1/hiring_managers_and_hr_pros_how_do_you_make/,81,"I make salary decision based solely on performance and tenure. If you've worked for me for 3 years and are a subpar employee making as much as someone who works 2 months for me, I'll give you a bump when I give you a review, with the understanding that it is only a small bump and based on performance they could get more in 3 to 6 months. 
The important thing to know is people talk about their rates, no matter what you tell them. So keeping your people whole is important, especially on a staff 20 to 50 people. If people aren't performing I will not give them a beg merit increase or raise and tell them why. I will give them something just not a lot. Because if your not pulling your weight and not turning it around the are other people that will want their job. 
Promotions I normally make when there is room and the person can fit the position, not wholly, on a basic level. I make the decision based on their prior work and performance. If you want a promotion show me you want it. Attitude and how they talk to others is the most important. I dont need lower managers talking down to employees.   ",2018-12-17 19:17:28
142,ha0fep,False,Advice,93,24 with no work experience and completely lost in life. What should I do?,careerguidance," Hello all, I know this probably gets asked a lot but I felt like I really needed to get some advice. Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.

As graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of “so what are you going to do next?”. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don’t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can’t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I’m going to answer when family and strangers ask me “what do you do?”.

I know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.

My main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).

Thank you!
