Furthermore, it’s unknown how long a person has to be exposed in order to actually get sick to begin with. I’ve seen estimates of 10, 15 or even more minutes of direct, no mask contact being used as the yardstick.

My argument is that in this case, with the hair stylists wearing masks, and the haircuts being mostly under thirty minutes, along with the fact the salon was likely employing hand sanitizer, the patrons could have used no masks and likely seen similar results.

I know there will be opposition to my statement, but there are plenty of studies shooting down masks as an effective measure for stopping the spread of something like Covid. 

I understand covid is serious, but I think we are focusing too much on masks instead of focusing on better ways to manage the situation. Like, it’s an easy way for politicians to get you to focus your frustrations and blame on fellow citizens.

“We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.” ",2020-07-15 11:57:19

3,7e1jo1,False,Subreddit Discussion,11056,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,science,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

From Livestrong.com:

Injuries in Soccer

In 2011, the Bleacher Report ranked soccer at sixth place in the top 10 most dangerous sports. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's statistics for 2009 reveal that 88,000 soccer players between the ages of 5 and 14 were seen in emergency rooms for sports injuries. In 2011, Safe Kids Worldwide reported that 104,190 soccer players between ages 12 and 17 were seen in emergency rooms, with 13 percent of those injuries involving concussions. The types of injuries most commonly sustained by soccer players are musculoskeletal injuries to the lower body.

Injuries in Football

Football was ranked as the third most dangerous sport in 2011 by the Bleacher Report, due to the sheer numbers of football related injuries. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2009, 212,000 children were seen in emergency rooms for football injuries. By 2011, there were 275,050 emergency room visits for football players between ages 12 and 17, with 13 percent involving concussions. Knee injuries are relatively common among football players, with lower-extremity injuries overall accounting for half of all injuries. Thirty percent of other injuries involve the upper body. Strains, sprains, contusions, fractures and concussions are the most common types of injury sustained.

Comparing the Two Sports

Both sports carry a risk of injury, and it is impossible to quantify an individual player's overall risk of injury during a game of a season. In general, both sports take a relatively heavy toll on the knees and lower extremities. The risk of injury to the upper extremities is much higher in football than in soccer -- with the exception of the goalkeeper, soccer players do not use their hands and arms to handle the ball. However, concussion injuries are equally likely in soccer and football players. Football players are more likely to suffer injuries to the cervical spine, which can be catastrophic or life-threatening. ",2017-09-19 14:26:04

I had several emergency surgeries and the total bill was $28,000.  I did not have insurance at the time because I’m self-employed and would have to choose between paying for housing or insurance.  The bill was reduced to $7000 because I was a cash patient.  Why is the cost so different? Are hospitals overcharging that much if you have insurance?  

Our education system is a different matter.  Teachers are usually terrific in our nation, but are severely underpaid.  Most teachers in primary schools pay for supplies out of pocket, and give parents lists for requested items.  The money allocated for increases in spending often just goes to the upper ranks of the administration and projects that those in power want.

and i don't.

vaccines work, this is not an anti-vax position. get your vaccinations and vaccinate your kids. annual flu vaccine is another story tho, it's not unbiased the rec to get it, and it's not much use for healthy people, imo
