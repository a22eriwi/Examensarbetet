I accepted a job with the city on May 13th over the phone, and then was told that HR would be contacting me shortly afterwards.

Person told me that I should receive correspondence from HR by the end of next week.

End of next week rolls around today, and still no e-mail from HR. I left the manager a voicemail, but I'm not expecting to hear back until next week because of the Memorial day weekend.

I am kind of a paranoid person, and am already thinking that the offer was probably withdrawn, however I understand that public service jobs probably go through an extensive process.

297,bl1o99,False,Discipline,7,Toxic work environment situation. Is it my fault?,jobs,"I started my current job 2 years ago. From the beginning I noticed some cattiness amongst a few of my coworkers  and so had decided to take a stance of keeping a professional distance between myself and my coworkers so as to not get involved. I leave everything that is personal at the door in the morning. I do my job the best I can, collect my paycheck and go home. I make sure to smile and greet people and be cordial but otherwise keep to myself. 

In the early stages, I was able to be an unproblematic fly-on-the-wall, minding my own business, while those around me did their catty rants about each other. One coworker, let's call her ""Coworker A"", seemed particularly hostile to another coworker behind her back, referring to her as ""that bitch"" in a rant for going to management about an issue she had with Coworker A. I ignored it and got on with being respectful to both coworkers without picking sides.

One day, I had to go to Coworker A for some work materials that she dispenses to myself and my immediate team. Coworker A, asked about materials she had previously dispensed to me, and I said that was for [""that bitch""]. She became hostile and said ""it's not my fault you stupidly gave [materials to ""that bitch""], I don't have any more!""

I asked ""why is that stupid?"" 

She quickly backtracked, and said ""I never called you stupid!"" and went on a mini-rant about her suspicion that I will to go to management about her now (like [""that bitch""]) and "" you wear glasses and can't see"" (presumably the discord between coworker A and ""that bitch"".  I saw it, I just ignored it.)

After this incident I went to the manager after work for advice on how to deal with an unnamed coworker who seemed particularly hostile. Without naming Coworker A, they seemed to know exactly who I was talking about. They seemed sympathetic. They said they had several complaints about her but every time they confronted her about it, Coworker A denied it. They suggested I use my cell phone to record her next time, and call a meeting with management armed with that evidence. 

Over time coworker A's hostility toward me grew into mild bullying. She would tell me to perform my job differently from how I am used to performing it. I would politely decline and give reasons,  she would get upset and say ""everybody else does it [the way she told me to], you always have to be different"" etc. 

It escalated until one day she was ranting about me being ""stupid"" for not following her instructions on how to do my job. Mind you, she is not my superior, I don't report to her. The managers have no issue with how I do my job, and had Coworker A gone through the appropriate channels to express displeasure about the way I did my job, I'm certain the managers would have told her I was doing my job the correct way. But it wasnt about how I did my job, Coworker A  wanted to exert power over me and wanted to punish me for not being submissive enough. On this occasion, I was able to pull out my cell phone as she ranted about me in the other room and record her calling me stupid and making derogatory remarks about the somewhat prestigious high school I attended. She referred to me as ""weird"" etc. 

I did as the managers suggested and called a meeting. They asked me to describe the circumstances around the recording I made, asked me to write a report and I did. The managers agreed that the way I was doing my job was the appropriate way. I played them the recording and they heard clearly the verbal abuse from coworker A. Other coworkers were interviewed and the manager mentioned to me that at least one (not [""that bitch""]) corroborated that Coworker A is difficult to work with.

Shortly afterward, I was told that she was asked to apologise and she refused.

Thereafter. Nothing. Coworker A has since been a lot less overtly hostile toward me but she just ignores me and there is constant tension since I have to go to her for materials etc.  Months later, I asked the manager what was the outcome of my report and I was told that because I stopped short of sending the managers the actual recording, relinquishing control over its propagation, there was no proof they could take to the president and board of management to have disciplinary action taken against coworker A. So it's as if there is no evidence at all and nothing can be done, even though the managers heard it with their own ears. I was also told that the fact that Coworker A has a rapport with the president was also a factor.

I am left confused about what I could've done differently in this situation. Coworker A and [""that bitch""] now have seemingly repaired their work relationship since then and are cordial with each other,  while I am now Coworker A's number 1 enemy. Having an ""enemy"" at work is something I find slightly awkward and I wonder if there was something I should have done differently. I feel as though my biggest mistake was taking management's advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bl1o99/toxic_work_environment_situation_is_it_my_fault/,10,"I'm sorry to hear you're going through this.  It appears to me you handled it the best you can for the most part.  What I would do differently is stop going to the manager from here on out.  You've stated your case, you've shown evidence, they've done nothing about it.  

Document everything.  Every word she says and every meeting thus far; every refusal to give you the equipment you need to do your job, etc.  It is very hard and it will feel like you're reliving it but it is so important to do this.  The reason for this is so that if this place decides they want you out and you can't find another job quickly, you have proof of what happened.  You can consider filing for unemployment, or suing if you find out you have legal grounds (unfortunately bullying still isn't illegal but if the harassment gets especially nasty or there is other evidence of legally-protected harassment/hostility such as racism, sexism, etc. you might end up having a case). 

If you end up out of a job or decide to leave, consider hiring a professional reference-checking company to see what they say about you (something I should've done) and have that conversation about what they plan on telling future employers about you so that you can be on the same page when job-hunting if you list the job in your history.  

In the meantime, when she tells you how to do your job, go ahead and tell her politely but firmly that you know how to do it.  Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain).  She's not your boss.  Doing this with a toxic person just feeds the fire and oftentimes that's all they're really looking for is attention.  That said, it's a good idea to remember how dangerous people who have been honing their socially predatory skills since grade school can be.  Keep your distance, remain polite, do your job but definitely keep your distance.  I can't stress that enough.  Take the time to separate yourself from this stress outside of work and take care of yourself; sleep well, eat well and get enough exercise.  

Also if you're on Facebook there is a group called Workplace Dignity (they also have a blog) with people dealing with these issues in their lives.  

There are other pages on Facebook and also elsewhere online against workplace bullying such as the Workplace Violence Prevention Institute, Healthy Workplace Bill advocates in many states (I used to follow Massachusetts for example which posted many very informative articles and insight into workplace bullying).

Assuming a recruiting firm, remember how these people get paid.  The hiring company pays them a very large fee if they successfully find a candidate that they hire.  Some recruiters do a lot of fishing for candidates when they don't actually have many roles available, to expand their network and so that they have lots of candidates ready to go when a role does arise, that they can pick and choose from.

That said it's a good idea to maintain relationships with them.  They may or may not have good openings right now.  They are often eager to talk to you if you have some experience in the fields they focus on, so it's a little different than normal interviews, and it doesn't necessarily reflect their likelihood of finding you a job.

1853,eoqysb,False,Recruiters,3,Information needed on recruiting services and how they can help a recent graduate land a job!,jobs,"I just graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Finance in December and I have been applying to Financial Analyst positions posted on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. I have no experience in Finance other than my academic projects.

Sure!  It's a common misconception to think that recruiters and temp roles are restricted to secretarial type work.  You should not pay them any money to work for them or through their service. Typically, the employer pays the temp agency $X per hour of your work and they pay you a smaller $x per hour.  The temp agency makes money on the margin between what the employer pays them and the lesser amount they pay you.  

These are often project and overflow positions where the big name company doesn't want the expense of on and off boarding lots of people quickly and the liability of legal action resulting from early terminations, worker's comp, etc.  If you have no experience, it would definitely be worth your time and, as you say, investment in your future self, to take a financial analyst position through a temp agency.  Maybe there's a company that is has a seasonal business and needs an extra hand for three or six months.

469,ex3vl2,False,Qualifications,3,"Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?",jobs,"Hello Reddit,

I have a question regarding work experience as I’m currently job hunting. 

I’ve been fired from my last job as a assistant fashion designer as of December 2019. I’ve had this job since mid October so roughly 2 months.

I was also also working part time in evenings during this time but only as a seamstress.

As an assistant fashion designer, I did tech packs for the company that included fabric type, trim info, colour way, etc. We then send my tech pack to one of our suppliers in China with a sample. 

The sample and the actual product that I designed in the tech pack comes back and we make revisions. This means I have to update the measurement spec sheet. This goes along with doing a fitting where someone wears the product I’ve made and then we make adjustments and send it back to China where hopefully all the mistakes were corrected. 

So everything I’ve mentioned here is the basis of being an assistant fashion designer or technical designer in the fashion industry.

Since job hunting, a lot of companies are looking for a year experience or more in terms of technical design.

Since I only had a technical job for 2 months, and I’ve been fired, I was wondering where else could I put that experience in my resume?

The only experience that I have that are slightly similarly related to that was my seamstress jobs or my job as a student entrepreneur where I made my own clothing, or my time in college where I learned these things. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what is the best case I can make for myself that I do have some experience as a assistant fashion designer/technical designer without mentioning that my last job that I was fired?

The reality is that Employee Selection is a critical part of organizational development, so it doesn't make sense for a company to not have the wherewithal to handle it, or believe they will always do it badly. It's like avid marathon runners outsourcing their shoe-tying to somebody else, because they don't have the time to do it themselves or believe they wouldn't tie a knot well. If they want to run, this is one of the basic things they need to do.

The problem is that companies didn't equip themselves with an HR that contained knowledgeable professionals who were trained to do hiring. Selection is totally a part of HR's wheelhouse, but most of the field is still comprised of old guards who got the position by being nice and know how to handle a payroll spreadsheet; and they gatekeep professionals from entering through arbitrary networking tactics. Companies could've easily onboarded someone with an HRM or related degrees, maybe certified, but definitely have expertise in organizational development; but they are stymied by the current HR Manager/Generalists who believe they won't be able to do the job effectively because reasons.

At the very least, the company doesn't have executive leadership that are well-versed enough about this. So they have no idea any of this is happening. Then, the only conclusion is to outsource their recruitment and selection efforts to third-party vendors like Staffing Agencies and Recruitment Firms, believing they are getting a 1:1 replacement with a talent acquisition professional. Like many comments have mentioned, these companies are ironically bleeding money because these firms aren't using sound methodologies to hire effectively, and they're sacrificing an already limited budget or competitive compensation because these agencies need to take their cut from somewhere.

174,cwuhyf,False,Rejections,7,Previous manager won't give my girlfriend a reference - advice needed,jobs,"I am writing this on behalf of my partner - she's having the work issues but I am running out of ideas on how to advise her.

This is might be a long one so apologies for length.  Plus, I should add, this is everything I have been told from my girlfriend's perspective, so happy for people to play devil's advocate.

My girlfriend started a new job at the start of the year, as maternity cover, at a university.  Prior to that, she'd been at the same company for 6 years (interrupted by a year maternity leave), during which she was promoted several times.  And prior to that, she has been a longstanding employee at several other jobs.  I would say she is a model employee.

She left at the end of 2018, for a new challenge, and soon started the new job.  She was trained up in the role by the lady for which she was covering.  The role was, in basic terms, preparing for an event happening about 4 months from her start date.But after that lady went on her own maternity leave, my gf soon learned a few things about the role:

* No-one, other than the lady now on maternity leave, seemed to know what was expected of the role, in terms of procedures or outcome.
* The role was unique to that university - very few, if any, other universities have a similar role.  It's incorporated into different departments at other universities, so using another university as a gauge as to what was expected wasn't an option.
* My gf wouldn't have a manager for a couple of months, so she was pretty much left to figure things out, unguided, and instigate programmes and procedures for which she had basic training.  Which naturally led to errors.

So my girlfriend, for the first couple of months, felt undersupported and undertrained.

She then got a new manager after a couple of months.  This manager was promoted from within the university, from another department.  As much as I know about her, I would say she is a yes person.  Tells the bosses what they want to hear to cover her own back.  A jobsworth.

Things got difficult with the manager really quickly.  Errors started popping up in the run up to the event.  the manager would expect my GF just to perform tasks for which my GF had no training.  When my GF asked her new manager for extra support, or if she could come in on weekends or work late, to prepare for this event, every request was met with a 'no' with various different reasons.

3 months passed in the job and my GF had her mandatory probationary period review.  And in that review the manager tore her apart.  Basically said my gf was underperforming drastically and if the manager didnt see any improvement, she'd seek to terminate her employment within 3 weeks.

The list of complaints (which I saw) were insanely detailed and epically long.  Like the manager had been detailing every error as they happened to cover her own back, rather than try and solve the issues as they arose with my gf.

My GF asked for a meeting with HR, in which she gave her own version of events (no support, refusal to requests).  Naturally, as you would expect, the manager disputed this.  Which left my gf felt like she was facing a path of being let go in 3 weeks.  If she was unsupported in the run up to this meeting, why would she be supported in the next 3 weeks, in an effort to save her job?

So she resigned - she had my full backing to do it.  She wasn't happy.  Why stay in a job if you aren't happy?

&#x200B;

That was about 2 months ago.  My GF has since been looking for work.  She has had a couple of promising interviews.  One company was very interested.  Practically offered her the job.

They asked for her references, to which she gave several.  But then the hammer blow - 'we'd also like a reference from your previous manager'

I think you can guess what happened next - my girlfriend, reluctantly, contacted the manager to ask for a reference and the manager refused.

And the job offer was rescinded.

So my question is:  is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?  How can she broach this with future employers?  It's frustrating to think that this one terrible experience might hamper her work opportunities.

Or should she considered short term contracts so she then has more recent managers to call on for references?

Cheers for any advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cwuhyf/previous_manager_wont_give_my_girlfriend_a/,1,">So my question is: is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?

2306,cv9c9a,False,Training,32,"Am I not trained well, or just not fit for the job?",jobs,"I apologize for the blocked text, I'm on mobile 
I recently graduated college and started working my first ""real"" job at a house plant nursery/greenhouse in the western US, been working there a few months now. I have had many internships in such jobs before and love growing plants, but this new job has me more stressed than I have ever been in my life. I come home depressed and paranoid that I did something wrong while at work and will get chewed out for it the next day. Basically my job is to watch about 30-50 greenhouses with new very delicate propagation plants. If any of these houses do not get mist during the day, within 15 minutes they can be damaged or die. Many things can happen, irrigation booms can crash or blow fuses, they could be programmed incorrectly, electricity can surge or drop out for just a little bit which can stop the booms, so we have to constantly be driving around in the farm truck and checking them. I feel like I was undertrained and just thrown into this position but like I said it's my first ""real"" job in the industry so I'm not sure. My boss spent a total of about half a day showing me around and trying to teach me to program booms (there are 3 different software systems to learn) and the rest of what I've learned has been from my coworkers, who were expected to answer all my questions and teach me things while also trying to do their job and watch their own 50 greenhouses. As a result, I felt very much like a nuscance with all my questions especially in the beginning, and made quite a few mistakes because I didn't know any better. On top of that we work in shifts with partners and mine gets very annoyed with me if I make any mistakes at all. As a result I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my coworkers and am constantly afraid of messing up. The other day we had an electrical problem and some of our plants were damaged, and later I heard him talking badly about me to our other coworkers. Also, whenever my boss sees I have made a mistake he automatically assumes it is because I'm being lazy or not checking my plants and irrigation enough. Now that the growing year is winding down and daylength is shortening our schedule has changed and I am scheduled to watch the entire farm by myself every other day, 10 hour shifts. I was in no way trained to take care of the other parts of the farm, it is completely foreign to me and I feel like I have been just thrown in to sink or swim. I was given a check list and talked to for 10 minutes about what I should do to care for the other part of the farm, but only because I asked. If I hadn't asked I would have gotten nothing. I would have felt much more comfortable shadowing someone else do it for a bit.... What should I do? This job has me so burnt out with worry it's not funny.

2071,avj53g,False,Layoffs,8,Used dealership fired me over an accident that they want me to pay for.,jobs,"Okay, I am sorry in advance but this is going to be a long story. I figured if anywhere, this would be the best place to post this story. I have been thinking of posting this story since December but never got around to it. And with this story, I am not even including the following situations:

\-Straight up sexual harassment

\-sexism

\-drugs on premises 

\-finding a LOADED GUN in a car while photographing the inside 

So I took this job at a used car dealership as their photography assistant or “Webmaster” as they called it. At first, it sounded like an easy gig, having cars pulled into the booth for me and take some shots and on to the next one right? Wrong. So once I got hired, my boss has informed me that I needed to find, drive and park each of the cars into the booth myself and the only job the main photographer had was to find the cars for me and park them in front of my booth. Which this guy never did. He just goofed off while I did all the work and he got praised for it instead of me. They had never mentioned in the interview or anywhere that they needed me to know how to drive manual/stick shift cars. So when I told him that I didn't know how to drive stick, he told me not to worry and that he would get my co-worker to teach me. Well, that never happened. He just kept putting it off and telling me “oh, you won't actually have to do that. Just call me and i'll come to park it for you”. This was BS. I had to call this guy at least 10 times a day to ask him to move a car for me. And when I did, he made fun of me and complained that I didn't know how to drive stick. I only ever got trained by our mechanics that I became close friends with. And that was only two times that I ever actually drove a stick car. Very badly might I add. Fast forward to one day when I am photographing a Scion FR-S( a very nice sports car for those who don't know what that is). Once I got into the car to start it so that I could turn the tires for a side angle, this car jumps forward and hits the refrigerator that is directly in front of me. Now I had my foot on the brakes and the emergency brakes were on as well so I don't know why it did that.  Luckily no one was hurt but I was very shaken from it. After all of my co-workers came to see if I was okay, they checked it out and moved it to behind the building. The front left bumper was messed up and needed to be replaced, so when I was sat down by my co-worker, not even my boss about the details. I was confused when he said that they would make a contract and have my sign it and have 100-200 dollars deducted from my check each week and all bonuses we got each month as well once the car was fixed and they got the price for all of the damage. I was still shaken up so I just nodded along. After I got home and told my mom of the whole thing, she looked at me furiously and told me that they can't charge me for an accident that happened on the site because that's what insurance is for. I was unaware of this and looked it up and she was right. It is illegal for them to charge their employees for any damage done from an accident on the site. I even went so far as to call a lawyer to make sure this was true. Now, this ends up going quiet for about a month, until one meeting we had. There are meetings every Monday and Friday mornings before we start work, and the owner of the company asks me and my co-worker how many cars I am photographing a day and such. Then he proceeds to say jokingly “ well, maybe you can attend the driving school we have so that you don't crash any more cars.” or something like that. My mind’s a bit fuzzy on what he said so I am sorry for that. I was furious and just gave a fake smile as maybe 2 or 3 people faked laughed at it. I felt so embarrassed about it. Now I make fun of myself a lot and joke with people all the time. But when my boss just says something like that to me, that is not cool. So skipping to the next week. The car finally comes back from the shop and is put in the front lot to be sold already. Now here's the kicker... they never submitted the claims to Carfax so that they can update it and let the customer know that there was damage done to the car at one point. I know that for some cases, they don't have to (correct me if I'm wrong) but I knew that they should have for this case. So that day, my boss wanted to talk to me about how we were moving buildings and stuff like that. Then when he was done, i brought up the accident I told him that I do not believe that I had to pay damage on the car because it was not my fault and that there was no reason why insurance couldn't just pay for it. He then looks at me and proceeds to turn the blame on me that I got into the car and starting it, therefore it's my fault and that said “ wouldn't you feel guilty leaving a place knowing you did damage and didn't pay for it” Wtf?? I said no because it wasn't my fault and that I was never properly trained. He then says he will make up the contract and sent me away to continue working. I just left the room to stop myself from having a panic attack. He then called me back an hour later showing me the paper and demanding I sign it. Now I have the full recording of this conversation because I was on the phone with my mom who recorded the conversation. He then told my mom not to worry about it and that we had everything figured out. And then he again sends me away to go work and “not to worry about it” and so I did. 4 HOURS LATER, he calls me into an office and tells me that I am being fired because “it's just not working out”I just say okay and walk out of there and out of the building as fast as I can. I left after saying goodbye to my co-workers that I am friends with.

Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally ""unpaid internships"" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both ""unpaid"" and ""internship""**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young & inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is ""paying for itself"" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

&#x200B;

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

&#x200B;

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.   
I appreciate any advice or insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b4m8ym/unsure_about_unpaid_internship_at_unlaunched/,2,Tons of red flags there. If he's not offering to pay you now he never will. The guy clearly has plenty of money but just wants free labor.  ,2019-03-23 18:10:46

So I recently got my first job in the tech industry as technical support agent  and at first I was excited thinking this would be a good stepping stone in software development.

237,ei2pth,False,Discipline,14,Will I get fired (or someone from my team)?,jobs,"Some very weird changes are happening to the team, and I'd like some advice as to whether I should be concerned. It's long but will try to keep it as succinct.

1. We are a very small team with a lot of work. We have a middle manager, one big boss, and two junior analysts (one of which is me). I am one year above the junior-most analyst.
2. The junior-most analyst and I had a tense relationship for a year. The junior-most and I started at the same time, so they consistently perceived us as peers and yet consistently received worse assignments than I did. The middle manager and big boss didn't assign the junior-most analyst any work, leaving it up to me to manage them, but the junior-most struggled to take my directions and advice believing that I should not boss them around. The end result often was me being frustrated, and/or doing the work myself. The middle manager is well aware of this problem but refused to engage. The big boss is also aware of the junior-most underperforming (though not the management issue), based on various comments he makes in team meetings.
3. All this while, my relationship with the big boss was really on the upswing. He would call me to thank me for my hard work separately, compliment me on job well done (""I knew it would be just fine since you're handling it""), check in after business trips. He also seemed to become more open and honest with me, about his thoughts and opinions, took me aside to give me individual feedback. The middle manager too would call me to check in on a large project that was going haywire, thank me for job well done.
4. Long story short, the junior-most person launched an informal complaint against me and the middle manager for ""mistreatment"". There's no allegation of protected class discrimination, but the gist of the complaint appears to be that they've been told that they were a bad employee, that because of this they were getting bad work, that their relationship with the big boss deteriorated after a project gone wrong, and that they were told (by me) that there was a ""retaliation"". The management side overseeing HR complaints came to give me a talk on this, at which point I explained I never said any such thing, and the only occasions I can think of where that analyst may have made that conclusion are in the context of advice. If anything, I tried to wrangle some ""good work"" for the analyst but that effort failed because I left for vacation and no one gave the analyst anything. The management side overseeing HR noted ""hm, interesting"" but still encouraged that I may want to consider switching teams \[Edit: to add that there was the ""most complaint"" against me\]. The management side asked what was going on with the middle manager too, at which point I explained that the situation in the team is very toxic for a variety of reasons.
5. The junior-most person later told me about this complaint they filed but also told me, after this follow up, the HR asked her about me at which point they said ""things are better"" with me. The junior-most person confided that they complained about the middle manager too for their mistreatment/yelling/etc. and that they told the HR that the mistreatment did not stop as to the middle manager.
6. Around the same time, the big boss began holding team meetings including the junior-most analyst (used to never be a thing, because junior-most was consistently excluded), where he would make that analyst read out loud instructions for hours, while both the middle management and I were just there listening. The big boss began to be way more explicit about expectations and instructions, in ways he never was before. He also began to split up projects in the most inconvenient and artificial way possible to include the junior-most analyst (only to have the substance filled out by me, or redone by me at a later time). The big boss has also been making passive aggressive comments toward everyone -- especially pointed at the junior-most, insinuating that they were useless, and taking away their existing work and giving them a ""more important and urgent"" project.
7. At the same time, the big boss began to act very formal toward everyone and I sense a little big of anger toward everyone including me. This change is not very dramatic for the other two, but the most dramatic for me, as he used to be pretty casual and friendly toward me. He is formal even in exchanges that are one-on-one with me. He would avoid eye contact with me or engaging me in friendly chat in team lunches, unlike before.
8. The middle manager and I still have the same work, although the team is much slower now, and I'm not hearing from the big boss as much as I used to. The junior-most has no work. The big boss is unusually silent, although perhaps it's because of the holiday season.
9. The middle manager told me that no one had followed up with them regarding HR complaint.

It is clear to me that the big boss has been told. My concern is whether (1) I will be written up/asked to leave, (2) I will be kicked off the team. Why is the big boss acting so distant and holding all kinds of team meetings + breaking up work in such artificial ways? Is the company trying to retain the junior-most? Any thought would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ei2pth/will_i_get_fired_or_someone_from_my_team/,2,"Middle manager: clearly the route of the problem. Hopefully more likely to be fired or reassigned than anyone else.

Big boss: heard about the complaint and is being over the top and exaggerated in responding to it. They seem to be shifting things toward the most junior analyst, possibly to protect the middle manager over her. This is the one you seem to trust that you maybe should be wary of. But I don't think you're in danger of being fired by him.

Junior analyst: was and is being mistreated. It's unclear if she gave you a more honest version of the HR complaint or if HR did, but if you've otherwise had a decent relationship with her (and haven't been dismissive of her like some of your posts kind of imply, but it's unclear), it seems like HR either misunderstood who the problem was because of unclear hierarchy or they also want it to not be the fault of this middle manager. It's also quite possible she vented about each little thing and maybe HR latched on. 

If you've heard nothing else from HR, I wouldn't worry about your job, but I would look into switching teams, away from big boss if possible. ",2019-12-31 13:14:38

This. Is. Wrong.  

So many comments are giving the OPs a false sense of hope/security by assuring them that performance that lead to them getting fired (for example) won't turn up in a reference check.  Far better advice would be to help them frame a response that will help them address the situation with potential employers before it comes up.

Don't just take my word for it; here's some reference articles (by a HR Professional and an Employment lawyer) that will - hopefully - put paid to this idea that it's illegal for past employers to give a bad reference. They also give suggestions for how to try and manage bad references while job hunting. I've added one from a manager on ensuring your references are in order.

1387,2oo8jq,False,[advice],36,Brief reflections on interviewing 50 candidates for a 100k/year sales job,jobs,"* Ten minutes early is the ideal arrival timeframe. When you arrive 20-30 minutes prematurely you're actually throwing off my day. Be it cutting my lunch short, or preventing me from using allotted time to handle other tasks. I suppose I could leave you up front until our actual interview time, but I don't want to be a dick.


* I disqualified an otherwise decent applicant because his nails were femininely long for a male. I've got to draw a LOT of conclusions from preciously little information, and this was one of them.

* If I ask what your current income is, don't avoid the question or speak in general terms. An applicant yesterday avoided the question up front, and then my partner asked it again more specifically, and he still avoided it. If you want to work for me, I need to know what you're coming from.


* If I can detect that you're lying about your previous income, and frequently I can, I will assume you inflated it by roughly 10%.

* Appear as though you want the job, even if you don't. You can always decline my offer. But I will not make an offer to somebody who isn't showing some degree of zeal. A fantastic applicant from four weeks ago just called back to ask about the job (which has been filled). I would have brought him on to phase two if he had just acted more interested up front!

* I get a handle on your zeal two ways: The questions you ask me about the job, and the way you close the interview. I absolutely love when somebody wraps up by saying ""Do you have any concerns about me that I haven't addressed?"" and ""What is the next step?"".


* The guy who just walked out remembered the receptionist's name and said goodbye. It's the little things...


* Be prepared to talk about what you do at home and hobbies. Some applicants have given weak or evasive answers that make me feel they're probably boring people.


* Turned down a guy who works in my tiny niche industry because his tie was loose and the top button wasn't done. I was on the edge, but he seemed a little unmotivated to me and that button made the difference. Again, drawing a lot of conclusions from limited evidence.


* Have solid, concise, honest answers for why you left a previous job. If you talk too much, I'll find similarities between my job and the job you left, and I will hit you with difficult questions.


* My first question is always the same: *You've told me about where you work today, and how successful you are in that position, why on earth would you want to leave?*

It's a job that pays very little but gets me some income versus none, meanwhile I found a job that pays double of what I'm being paid hourly here and went through 4-weeks of consisting of numerous interviews down to the last one where HR and my hiring manager said I'm *in great standing* and they would update me after my background check passes (HR says this was the last step. I went in for many separate on-site interviews with everyone from manager, HR, team members, and even the CEO.

I received an e-mail from my hiring manager saying that everyone I interviewed with loved me and believe I will excel in this position for their company, ***however*** **due to upcoming holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmastime  Company X is putting a hold on hiring.** They went on to say that the position will be open again in 2020 and would love to reach out to me if I'm still interested.

Is this a common practice for many companies, or is this another way to say ""Sorry, we don't want you but will keep your resume on file"". Additional detail from the company is that they told me employees get the entire week off at the end of December, could that be an additional factor? (Funny the HR guy joked with me saying that they are pretty in need of this position filled and if I get it I could benefit from the holiday time off soon)

Do companies usually start hiring at the start of the new calendar year, Jan 2020?

Lastly, this is something that I know you guys probably can't answer (and I e-mailed my manager to confirm an hour after getting the e-mail, no reply yet), but would they re-start the hiring process with a new batch of candidates and sprinkle me in?

1050,gmol34,False,Covid-19,2,Anxiety/depression and returning to work after COVID lay-off,jobs,"Need advice on dealing with my mental health and my job

Here is a little background on my situation. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, have been on meds since. Throughout this time, I’ve always had a full time job, although in the last 2 years, switched around a few times to different companies (all in the retail sector).

Before covid, I was having a really hard time at my workplace. It was a very toxic environment and I was looking for new opportunities, working with a psychotherapist to manage my anxiety and issues, and making a little bit of progress. 

Then covid arrived, and I was temporarily laid off for the past 8 weeks. I applied for gov assistance (I live in Canada and it’s very helpful!). Within the first few weeks, I immediately noticed I was the happiest i had been in months, and working with my psychotherapist, attributed this to not being in the toxic work environment everyday. 

Fast forward to Friday of last week when I got the heads up that I’ll be going back to work this week. I have had the worst, most depressed, anxious weekend. I’ve had two panic attacks, crying/sobbing fits and my mind has been in another place, I can barely enjoy or think about anything else. 

There’s two main concerns of mine: one of course is going back to work during covid, nervous about the precautions and changes we need to make, my health and safety etc. But the other is going back into the environment that made me so miserable just a few months ago. I had issues prior to covid, but I feel as though the will be masked into just being “covid anxiety”. 

I can’t quit my job- 1. I need the financial support and 2. I do not want my mental health to result in me losing my job. I have been looking into short term disability leave, but again, I feel like they will assume I just have covid anxiety and it will be a fight to “prove” I had issues before this. 

If you guys have advice on how I should go about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Having crippling anxiety is the worst thing, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I am supposed to return tomorrow (Wednesday) so any suggestions will be really helpful! 

Also thanks for reading this long post :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gmol34/anxietydepression_and_returning_to_work_after/,6,"I have been in a very similar situation.

It sounds like your psychotherapist acknowledges the effect your toxic work environment has on you and so would likely agree to do this. ",2020-05-19 13:30:16

I was never short before until Saturday. I also think it waa because I gave the Teller next to me 20's that she needed and she didn't give me the right amount back. I had the Control Teller count my drawer and my two other managers. Everything else proofed out correctly, so that's why I assume it could be when I helped out the Teller next to me. Mind you she has worked there for a long time, so I was being a little trusting. I did that for her while I was with a customer, so I could've also gotten confused.

I know it is a rookie mistake and I feel so dumb. There is no excuse for it, but they didn't say much to me after everything. They showed me how to fix the variance on the computer and sighed away. I felt worse, because they didn't say ""It's okay."" Or ""Shit happens."" Which of course I don't expect from them, but they kinda just acted aggravated with me.

Anyways... Going straight to the point, I’ll be pretty much homeless in a matter of months if I can’t find a job that pays at least 30k a year. Doing all my budgeting, this would be the bare minimum I could get to “survive”. It would obviously depend on city/state since 30k in SF is absolutely nothing, but kinda doable in Seattle. (I currently reside in Florida btw). Does anybody have an idea of what sorts of jobs can I find that allow me to basically live by myself? Right now I’m just trying to go through all my options. I’m good with my hands and I’m confident I could put them to very good use with the proper training... Just don’t know where to look or where to start.

1100,g36ps1,False,Covid-19,4,Is Covid-19 pandemic affecting the length of prehire screenings or am I being impatient/paranoid?,jobs,"Hi all,

Background: I received and accepted a written job offer on Monday.  Soon thereafter instructions for drug screening and consent forms for a background check were sent to my inbox through an automated HR system.  The HR rep never gave me a timeline on how long this step would take and she also hasn't given me an expected start date.  I completed the drug test on Monday and I'm still waiting to hear back if everything checked out OK.  The testing center said 1-2 business days and therein lies my concern.

My questions to the sub: Is anyone else experiencing delays in background checks or is a week fairly normal?  The drug screening was done through Lab Corp and several friends have suggested they're likely inundated with coronavirus tests, which I can believe.  My other question is when is it appropriate to follow-up with HR if I haven't heard anything to make sure all my ducks are in a row?  My thought would be this Friday afternoon or Monday, but I also don't want to come across as impatient.  Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g36ps1/is_covid19_pandemic_affecting_the_length_of/,4,"Yes. Thankfully since I've been contracting with them they are bypassing the drug screen and are going to take whatever background check they can get.

They did say, however, that when things start to open the background check could come back with something and I'll be fired if there's something on there. Thankfully, I'm clean, so shouldn't be a problem.

This was a special circumstance though. Most other positions are in hold. I'm guessing most other companies are trying to pivot and deal as needed. And public companies are probably even harder hit. ",2020-04-17 17:42:38
2245,71brlh,False,Startups,5,Moving from start-up CTO to large company,jobs,"
I've worked for mostly early stage start-ups in leadership roles and have held had some very fancy sounding titles, including CTO.  Since these were start-ups I'd wear many hats and be responsible for things such as:

-designing and writing software 

-building and deploying virtual servers

-hiring and leading a small team of developers

-reinstalling printer drivers and resetting people's passwords at 2am when they can't get into their e-mail

-helping CEO develop the business plan.  


I'm now interested in leaving the start-up world due to fatigue with the inherent risks and getting a job at a bigger company.  The problem is that CTO is a VERY different role at a large company like google or IBM.  I'm not qualified to hold a job with this title at a large company, nor is it even the career path I'm interesting in heading toward.  I'd like to be hands-on designing and writing software.


I'm worried that applying for those jobs with CTO in my resume could make HR departments immediately toss out the resume fearing that this is a stop-gap job while I look for another C level position.  I also worry it would color me as having more of a business oriented background and career goals when really I have solid software engineering experience and matching degrees.


Does anyone have advice for how best to handle this situation?  Would it make sense to put a different and more descriptive job title on my resume?  Or maybe qualify it as ""Start-up CTO""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/71brlh/moving_from_startup_cto_to_large_company/,2,If you're applying through a system I'd just change the job title to something more appropriate to the level you're looking for.

I have a new boss as of a year ago, and he can't get business to save his life. My savings are being dug into. I'm under $2K in my personal savings, though I do have a windfall in a separate account of about $30K, so I'm not desperate, but I also do NOT want to rely on that money.

Life specific details out of the way, that brings me to the point of this thread. Can any medical coders tell me how you feel about the job? Specifically:

1. Is it a low/medium stress environment?
2. Is it good for someone that has a history with (but is also getting over) social anxiety?
3. How much schooling is typically required?

600,hcluem,False,Unemployment,23,Will I receive unemployment if I get fired for telling my boss I won't do part of my job anymore?,jobs,"Little (ok a lot after reading through it) backstory: I accepted a position with a company in Ohio after I graduated college with a BS in Design Engineering Technology. I was led to believe that I would be working with customers to design CNC machines that fit their requirements. In actuality I was hired to be a travelling service mechanic. Every review for 3 years I told my boss I wanted an engineering job, and he always told me I needed to learn the how's and why's before I could design them. Meanwhile I realized that was all bullshit because my company hired fresh graduates to do those jobs anyways.  
  
Two years ago my boss was promoted and my new boss started cracking whips. Made my life a living hell and has me on the road 50-60% of the year while other techs get to stay home quite often, and most of it is no-notice. I started looking for new jobs but we're in a very rural location with little engineering jobs available. I applied on my company's website for an open detailer position, but HR said the company needs me more where I am. So I started branching out back to Michigan where I grew up and all my family lives. It's now been over 5 years with just one phone interview. I was just recently told by a family friend hiring manager that it would be tough finding me a job 5 years out of college with no engineering experience.  
  
So here I am seeing my only way to move up at my current company is to tell my boss I won't travel anymore starting January 1st. My question is if I give him this ultimatum and I'm fired for it, would I still be eligible for unemployment?

A recruiter actually found me on LinkedIn and said I would be perfect for the job and they would be silly not to hire me. I send in my resume and score an interview! The company asked before we interviewed if I would take a personality assessment. I know some large companies do this to get a sense of the person before they commit to hiring. I do the assessment, still good for the interview. I had probably one of the smoothest interviews ever! I was so confident this was going to work out. The interviewer was thrilled with my experience and excited for me to join the team. I even sent a follow-up thank you email.

A couple days go by and I finally hear from my recruiter: It was a no! I was stunned! My recruiter said the person who interviewed me loved me, she fought for me to be accepted. But, apparently, the owner of the company is basing hires on these personality tests, and I just didn't fit the mold!?

I have had some time to think and reflect: it's like it wasn't me, but, it was me? Idk, I am still confused.. If. Company was basing hiring on those tests- why conduct interviews of those who don't ""make the cut""?

2481,3nllcb,False,Experience,145,How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years,jobs,"This is a personal story.  Some details have changed or kept vague to protect my identity since I work for a ""high profile"" position now.

---

First, my humblebrag: I make over $100k per year working about 20-25 hours per week for a multinational corporation in the Midwest US.  I'm officially a ""business analyst.""  In reality, I look at Outlook and Excel for 10 hours per week and B.S. the rest.

Three years ago, I worked 40 hours a week on my feet doing retail customer service B.S. at a local grocery chain.  I made $10 per hour.  I have a liberal arts degree.

Here's what helped me make the transition (in order of importance).

**1\. Learn new skills on my own time**.  When I decided that I had enough of retail, I went to the library and picked up books on different office skills.  Excel, accounting, finance, project management, basic programming, and business leadership.  For me, these were the topics that stuck.  I came home every damn night and read and practiced everything.  I continued to do this even after my first office job.

**2\. Be a job hopper**.  I found job hopping opened many more opportunities.  Yes, some people will thumb their nose at your resume, but it's necessary to advance.  I've had 5 jobs in the past 3 years (not counting the retail one).  Contract positions were great because it taught a lot.

**3\. Keep in contact with old coworkers (aka networking)**. This didn't help me get my first job, but it did help me land my current gig.

**4\. Find the path of least resistance.**  Opportunities just came up organically that I was not interested in.  I would normally not be interested in programming, but a software development position came up in my company and my boss asked me if I was interested.  No, I wasn't, but I studied my ass off and took it anyway since it was a move up.  I'm not a developer now, but I have used a lot of those skills in my current job to get some street cred with the IT/tech department.

**5\. Be willing to stay late for a big project.**  My father gave me advice once that said: be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.  This advice is old hat.  Here's my version.  Stay late for a big project ONCE, then come in late and leave early afterwards.  Once you get the reputation of the one who got that big project done, you never have to worry about being on time to work again.  You get a lot of cred with leadership who don't give a crap about what time you came in today.

**6\. Keep a good relationship with a GOOD third-party recruiter.**  Third party recruiters are a dime a dozen.  And there are some shady ones out there.  But if you find a good one, they are really valuable.  Found 2 jobs through one.

Here's been my career path:

First job: admin assistant (aka secretary) for around $25k/yr

Second job: financial analyst - looked at spreadsheets for around $40k/yr

Third job: junior software developer - built some stupid internal websites around $50k/yr (only job where I moved within the same company)

Fourth job: project manager - a much better paying admin assistant around $80k/yr

Fifth job: business analyst for around $110k/yr",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3nllcb/how_i_broke_out_of_retail_got_a_6_figure_salary/,254,"The problem with a post like this is that you are setting someone up to get caught, denied a job or at the worst, fired after they got the job from lying. People fib on their resume and embellish all of the time, but every now and then you will be asked of your proficiency with skills you listed. I interviewed at a sports media company last year over the phone and the interviewer wanted to bring me in to test my CSS skills as I had listed it on my resume. Did I use CSS in my everyday? Yes, but not to the extent they wanted me to do so. Luckily I didn't have to do any hand coding, just observation and telling him what I saw. It didn't cost me the job as HR ultimately canceled the position, but I came away with a very important lesson.

I asked them for a reason and they said “lack of it,” and they refused to provide further details, stating that they were “unaware” of the specific issues since HR is a “different department.” The paperwork says I was supposed to receive an “exit package,” but I have only received my paycheck, to which the pay ends the day i was terminated. My health insurance was cut off the day after (fair), but they took out money for the pretax subway card which I did not receive.

I have had friends who believe that there were discriminatory concerns, as I am the youngest female in that particular department, and had staff comment on my appearance, moreso than other staff members when wearing the same attire. I personally believe that there is no discrimination, and perhaps they didn’t feel I was mature enough for the job. However, I didn’t get any warnings of my performance with my supervisor, so I did feel a bit blindsided. 

I just want a neutral POV of what might have been the concerns they saw, and how can I avoid them in the future. But also to know if this is a fairly standard type of termination when fit is the issue. Looking back, I’m not too upset about the job loss, as the commute was 3+ hours and extremely unreliable.

253,ce5hna,False,Discipline,48,I'm a depressed $30 a day worker that needs advice.,jobs,"This is gonna be a long one so if youre not interested in hearing a Millenial whine and ask dumb questions please move on. 

I'm 23 years old, i work a minimum wage job for 30ish dollars a day. I'm miserable. Ive been blaming the system but I realize that will just end with me hanging from the ceiling fan sooner than later.

First things first, I like hard work. When im at work I work. No talking, no chit chatting, just me and my work. Im the fastest production line worker in the company right now. But my boss sees my quietness as a bad thing, and I have been passed up for raises twice because of it. And my coworkers dislike me, or rather ""are made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by my attitude"".

I'm antisocial and anxious, speaking to my coworkers about anything but the task at hand drains me and irritates me. Is it so wrong to devote my shift entirely to my work? Will it really get me nowhere if I can't communicate mindless dribble to my coworkers? This is my main issue, this is what has actually led to me losing jobs in the past.

Second, I want an 8 hour shift. I dont want to work 16 hour days with a trade. I know people see this as whiney and entitled, but I have a family I like to spend time with every day. They make me happy and are the only reason i havent offed myself already. Is it so wrong to show up when your shift starts and leave when it ends? Will i really get nowhere if i dont dedicate my entire day to my job? Is that really what it takes? Is being the best damn worker in the business for exactly 8 hours a day not enough to be successful?

Last, I am bipolar. I get sick a lot. Sometimes i cant even force myself to stand up. And sometimes I call in because if i dont i will be less than useless at work and i know the only thing keeping me employed is how fast I can turn over products and i know if i show up and screw everything up im as good as fired. My boss knows of my condition and ""tolerates"" it. But usually i get snide remarks and unhelpful ""advice"" on how to be less worthless. Calling in hurts the company, i know. But even with medicine it's the only choice I have sometimes. It makes my coworkers hate me even more and hurts my chances of ever moving to full time again. Entitled again, I know. But if anyone has advice in this area, please let me know.

Im lost. I cant get my mind around these things and I'm so close to giving up. If staying at work for 10-16 hours a day is required, and so is being a social butterfly, to be a successful part of society than I think I'm just not cut out for it.

So I got contacted last week by a job recruiter with a position at a MAJOR company with a job that looks like it was written for my skillset and experience. Even the recruiter mentioned this and told me at the time that he has high hopes that I'd get the position and that he'd most likely have an answer by Friday. He even said he loved my personality and thought I'd fit right into the company. 

Friday comes along and I hadn't heard anything from him so I sent an email to follow up. Problem is, I found out on Monday that my website/email hosting site has been having authentication issues where all emails lack a certificate and they get filtered as spam by most email clients, so my email didn't go through. 

So today I called to follow up and got the recruiting agency's front desk and asked to speak to the recruiter. He seemed pretty annoyed that I had called, confirmed that he didn't get my email, said that he had already submitted my resume and application and was still waiting to hear back, but kept acting annoyed as if I had broken some kind of protocol by calling him.

Here's a few questions I had about the process:

* Is this a reason for him to pull my resume and portfolio from this position?
* Is my potential job jeopardized because of this interaction?
* If so, then is there anything I can do to remedy this situation?

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm ""an expert"" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

My manager had come up to me ran by me a couple of questions he has asked me If I I was in school and whether or not I had another job. My answer was no. He offered to give me forty hours, something that a lot of people would be grateful for. He had asked me If I wanted to do the coffee position at my job. I use to work at Mcdonalds and making drinks use to be fun so I thought that this would be a nice opportunity for me. I had agreed to take the position but that I only wanted to work 30 hours, that way I could move up or down in hours depending on how I felt while working the new position. He was upfront and told me that I would only have my trainer for one day and that I would be all on my own from there. I saw that he had put me on the weekend and the trainer said that it gets really crazy with coffee and Im scared for the weekend because I know the servers are going to be frustrated with me because its going to be super busy and I will be slowing everything down for them.

It was my first day working the restaurant side of my job today. Usually I stick to banquets. Throughout the day I had been following my trainer around and one person that I know from banquet said ""cmon guy"" in response to me not knowing the table numbers and not knowing where to drop off the coffee and It was this comment that made me feel awful. I just cried. This is because I am not able to take criticism. I wasnt sure if I just needed to sit on the idea of telling my boss that this isnt the position for me for a day and get outside advice. The thing is that the coffee guy only makes cappuccinos and espressos but I still struggle with working the machine. Theres a certain part that we have to take out and then put a new one in and I can never get to put the regular coffee in. Not understanding simple concepts is something not new and I believe that my anxiety has something to do with it.

My manager had asked me how was the first day and he was on already on his way out of the restaurant and I just didnt really know how to tell him how I felt because I was very scared. I would have felt guilty telling him that I was uncomfortable and that I didnt think the position was right for me. I was going through some scenarios in my head but none of them I thought would be perfect. I had to prepared to answer what do you need? Can you give it another day? What is stressing you out?

I just told him that it was okay, I was just thrown out by the numbering system that we have so we know whose tables are whose. He had brought up something about needing a map, I think it was a joke but its important interactions like these where my anxiety just freezes me up and I dont hear what the other person is telling me.

353,a5gnzx,False,Discipline,14,"Called in Sick, Told to come in Anyway",jobs,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place to do this. I've been working at my job for 2 years now, and in the beginning I got sick a lot and would call in whenever I was. I still was a very hard worker, and many of my managers praised my hard work, and even some of the higher ups complimented my work as well. I also would come in on days off or work for hours after my scheduled shift.

So recently, just got a new manager. She worked at the store before, but was never in charge of me. Initially, we didnt like each other, but once she saw how hardworking I was, she began to like me, and same with me, for requested days off were usually approved. I've been working with her for 3 months, and during these three months I haven't called in sick once. I've also worked give overtime hours, and she has written me several times thanking me for how hard I've been working (I work at Safeway so I stock things basically and face)

One of my other managers who oversees the schedule and such, doesnt like me (which most people in the store do like me and even were shocked at some of the things hes done) There was a time he yelled at me during my first year when I needed time off after finding out my Grandma had stage 4 cancer. The past 4 days Ive been feeling very sick. I didnt want to call in because I really wanted the money for Christmas presents for my boyfriend and family, so I worked those days, not taking a lunch either on any of those days to make sure the job was finished. Today though, I felt dizzy and couldn't even get out of bed for a few hours. I've been having a very bad headache, sore throat, runny nose and cough with a heavy feeling in my chest. I'm not sure if its bronchitis or another sinus infection, just a really bad one, but I just knew if I went to work today i could potentially pass out. So, I let my manager know, she didnt say anything. Then I called the store to let them know. My schedule manager answered and instantly was annoyed and I felt terrified because I knew he might yell at me again. I told him I felt awful and was wondering I could use my sick hours for today (whenever I called out previously I never used sick hours, but this time I really didnt want to take a hit to my paycheck) he began saying ""this is the worst possible day to do this, she has to count EVERYTHING.  You can't call in you have to come in. You've been calling in a lot again."" I tried to fight back tears because I was not expecting him to tell me I couldn't, is that even possible? And I wanted to say I hadn't been calling in, in fact it had been over 3 months of solid working even overtime. But I just said okay. Hung up the phone and cried. My boyfriend told me I needed to be more firm, stand up for myself and learn to say no, but then offered to call.  I told him no, that would make things worse.

My mom also was upset, and told me he can't do that. I told her I already agreed to come in. Now I'm concerned not only will I potentially pass out from being dizzy, but also that I could get others sick.

I'm also now on the bad side of my schedule manager (let's just call him J) again, who yelled at me on the phone. I've even come to work before with a face mask on when I was very sick, just so I didnt get yelled at by him for calling in. I have a very weak immune system, have had doctors notes almost 90 percent of the time I've been sick, and they even see me coughing and having to blow my nose. 

What should I do? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a5gnzx/called_in_sick_told_to_come_in_anyway/,3,"> What should I do? 

You should get another job. Any manager that thinks they have the right to yell, scream at, or berate a worker for not coming in when they're obviously sick is not worth sticking under. They care more about you doing inventory than they care about the fact that you're spreading your potentially contagious disease(s) to unsuspecting customers? They'll have fewer customers next week if half of the people who touched the items you stocked get sick. Also, learn to hold your ground and not be a doormat. If you can't come in, then you can't come in. Point blank. That goes for working on days you're sick, days you're scheduled to be off but they call you anyway, etc. They can ask you to come in or to cover someone, but you don't have to oblige. I understand that it's holiday season and you want to earn the money to buy gifts for your loved ones, but I'm sure they'll appreciate that you're healthy and happy more than they'll appreciate a material item that you put yourself in the hospital for. Take care of yourself. ",2018-12-12 09:30:14

2200,82h3z6,False,Startups,8,Should I join a startup as intern or stay at my current corporate job while finishing school?,jobs,"Hello reddit,
Need some help regarding my career situation. Some background info:
22M in Canada, in university for Business Degree, has one more year left (8 courses)
Current job: Part time contractor at one of the biggest oil and gas company in Calgary, Canada, making about 50k CAD a year, doing it while in school, I used to intern here and that's why I have this nice gig. I have a lot of coop experiences at big oil companies. Love my coworkers, and my boss, he is the most caring and chill manager I've had so far. I pretty much can stay part time until I graduate and very confident that I will receive a full time offer from this company (already verbally confirmed from my boss) making about 80k CAD right after graduating. The work itself isn't too exciting (IT Application support) but its not demanding at all, I prob only work half of the time and chill for the rest. 
Potentially I have an offer from a startup in San Francisco coming up for this summer, 4-8 months term. They just raised their series A and prob doing their series B this year. I believe in their mission and business model. I will be helping out with their business team doing project management and operation roles. The pay isn't great, like 15 US a hour. They are looking to double their headcount this year and I do think I have a good chance to stay full time after internship. I always wanted to work at a startup because I believe I can learn a lot there vs at a big company since they will be growing really fast. And I love SF as a city, so much more things to do than Calgary. 
My problem: SF is a really expensive city to live in vs where I am now, I am looking at double the cost of living. And 50% pay cut vs what I make now. So every month I am there I will need to put in my own saving while working at that startup. And if I were to leave my corporate job now I doubt I will be able to get it back after. Also there is a chance of full time at the startup which means I wont finish my undergrad degree (1 year left). Talked to my family and friends about it, all of my friends support me to go but my family not so much. They think I should finish school and my job is really good so I should stay at this oil company. But my argument is that if the startup fail I can always come back to school and finish up (you can take 10 years max to finish your degree), and the learning experience/opportunity I will have at that startup is very valuable, I see it as my ticket into the tech industry.

I just wanted to stop by to vent and share my experience.  I have been on the job hunt for about 10 months; 4 months unemployed and VERY actively interviewing, testing, and (as the title implies) getting rejected. 


I just finished the process of interviewing for a position supporting the Superintendent and Board of Trustees of a small, public school district.  Long story short, it was down to me and one other candidate.  I ""knocked [the first interview] way out of the park"" and met with the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent on Monday.  I just got a phone call from the Superintendent himself and I was told the following: 


* You didn't get the job, but I'm calling because you did very, very well in the process.

* You have incredible potential and your references/qualifications speak to that.


* There's nothing else you could've done; I don't want you to think that you could've done x, y, z or done anything differently. 


* You're at a great point in your career; there was nothing else you could've done. 


* It was a matter of circumstance. 


* We have some openings in the Spring and we really want you to keep us in mind.  We will probably be reaching out to you before you reach out to us. 


I've been in similar positions (i.e. getting to the last round and getting beaten out) probably about a dozen times in the past couple of months and I'm so **very** tired of hearing ""you have incredible potential *BUT* we went with another candidate.""  


I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just an outlet to express my exasperation with this process.  But here I am.  I really have done everything I can to prepare myself for each interview; I just (stupidly) let myself get really invested in the idea of this particular position.  Has anyone else felt this way?  What do you think of what he said to me; was it bullsh*t or was it genuine (no one knows for sure, I know..)?  How do I muster the strength to move forward?  I'm so tired of constant rejection and (fake?) validation at the same time.  I can't help but feel defeated each time this happens.  I'm overall a more bitter, jaded person because of this experience.  


I guess it's just two steps forward, one step back.  As cliche as that sounds.

983,bnmxo6,False,Education,14,"""Don't Tell Them You Are in School""",jobs,"After many years with only two years of college under my belt, I decided to return to University to finish obtaining a bachelor's degree. 

I am pretty miserable at my present job and have a potential opportunity to move to a job that offers benefits that I do not have, but it comes with a pay cut. As much as I don't care for the idea of going backwards, I thought I could still make it work, as I would have the opportunity for quick advancement. 

An acquaintance of mine scheduled my interview for next week, saying he'd rather do it on his day off instead of Monday. I commented in passing that worked for me, as I have Summer classes starting on Monday. He seemed surprised that I was in school and told me that I shouldn't mention that in any of my interviews, as his company wanted people that they felt would be devoted to the job. I told him it was a little late for that, as I had mentioned it on my application. 

Frankly, I feel disheartened. And although I will still go to the interview, it gives me pause as to whether I want to bother working for the company (should I be offered a position), as I am not willing to give up on my education now. Most of my classes are online, as I work 40+ hours a week now with crazy hours; but there will come a time when I may need to take a few classes on campus. My present job is at least supportive of my endeavor, even if I am not happy.

I thought a pursuit of education would be considered an admirable quality, if anything. It's been over a decade since I have been on a job hunt.

I made it through a three interview process and due to my experience was offered a Store Manager in Training position. The training time is a small pay cut, but because of the extra hours I will be putting in, I will actually make more than I am now...and even more once I am given a store.

I was very honest about my pursuit of education, as it is very important to me. I switched my major in January to a Bachelor of General Studies with a concentration in Public Health. During my interview with the Regional Manager and his District Manager, both were intrigued when I said I picked something that would apply to my real world experience. I made sure to mention classes, such as OSHA training. I also mentioned that I was simply looking to look better on paper and wasn't necessarily looking for any major career changes. 

I am in my forties and a looking towards the future. Whatever I can do make myself look better and grow is a plus. Where I am at right now, I am the top of the food chain, and if something should happen to the Owner, I am out of a job. This new job offers a lot of benefits that I do not have and an immense room for growth. I have been primary to my job and schooling in my free time...but I will need some time for a few classes on campus and intend on working them in on my off days. Even now, I have too much responsibility to do otherwise. I do worry because I will need to put in at least five extra hours a week. There will also be 5 mandatory lunch hours a week.

196,dbwjut,False,Rejections,2,"Did I make a mistake in communicating with this prospective employer who seemed interested in me, or was I just unlucky?",jobs,"Hi all, first-time poster here.

I graduated in May with a degree in Music Technology and Composition, and began applying to jobs about a month ago after a busy summer. I came across a posting from a UK-based company for a freelance audio producer position in New York, which is right up my alley in-terms of technical knowledge and work experience. It may be worthwhile to note that while the position is in audio/podcast production, the majority of the company's business is \*not\* in that field.

About two weeks after applying, an employee (I'm not sure of their position) — let's call them Jim for the purposes of this post — contacted me by email with the following message:

>Hello u/iam_hexxed \- thanks for getting in contact, we're getting ready to move forward with this role, I wanted to check what your current availability was. We are potentially looking for someone to work with us in early October.   
>  
>Also could you confirm your day rate: thank you  
>  
>jim lastname

While I do have an existing day rate, I knew that a) it would be well under market for the area and b) that this job was a step up, and that I should ask for more than my current rate. After reaching out to some mentors in my field, as well as the r/audioengineering sub (see post \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how\_do\_you\_set\_your\_day\_rates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how_do_you_set_your_day_rates/))), several people I asked said that a key piece of information I needed to know was whether I would be paid via a 1099 as a contractor or as an employee before I could give them a rate. This made sense to me because, while the position had ""freelance"" in the title, it also listed several benefits that would only be given to employees (IRA contributions, etc.), so I didn't feel that I could infer the answer. Mentors and members of the audio engineers' sub also encouraged me to ask whether I would at any point be using my own equipment, which merits a higher rate for maintenance etc. So, early that same evening, I replied:

>Mr. Lastname,  
>  
>It's great to hear from you!  
>  
>I'm shortly relocating to New York from \[nearby city\], and with that slated my calendar is wide open — early October definitely works. As far as the rate goes, that depends upon whether or not I would be considered an independent contractor on a 1099. Can you clarify that? In addition, please let me know whether or how often I would be expected to use my own equipment?   
>  
>Thanks very much,  
>  
>u/iam_hexxd

The next day, which was a Wednesday, around 12 noon:

>u/iam_hexxd \- to be honest, I dont know the answers to your questions, I'm afraid but i'd be happy to set you up on a call with one of the producers here so he can explain it in more detail. ​  
>  
>in the meantime I'll look into how you will be paid.   
>  
>would you be free for a call at 3pm Uk time which I think is your 10am

You'll notice that this message arrived in my inbox \*after\* the suggested call time based on the timestamp, so this wasn't possible. Still, I felt excited because they seemed interested in me. I replied about an hour after receiving the message:

>Hi Jim,That's no problem at all! I appreciate your honesty on that. Unfortunately, it looks like for some reason this message didn't reach my inbox until well after 10 am EST. I'm traveling tomorrow, so do you think we could arrange a call for some time on Friday?Many thanks,u/iam_hexxd

I received no reply until today, which was six days later:

>Hi u/iam_hexxd,  
>  
>We’re just writing to you to let you know we’ve reviewed your application for the ... position and unfortunately, it has not been successful this time.  
>  
>We really appreciate you taking the time to apply and please be assured your application was reviewed and given full consideration.  
>  
>Thanks for your interest in \[company name\].  
>  
>Kind regards,  
>  
>jim lastname

My question is, did I make some mistake in the process of communicating with this employer that might have upset them and caused them to pick a different candidate? Perhaps I'm naïve, but it seems as though they were interested with a back and forth happening, and then they suddenly went silent, five days went by and I got passed over. I'm pretty bummed because it feels like in following the advice of mentors (one of them said to me ""you should definitely ask if it's a 1099 before giving a rate""), I lost out on a good job opportunity which has been hard to come by so far.

TL;DR: not sure if something in my emails (see above) with a prospective employer for a freelance audio production job caused them to change their mind about my candidacy.

Note: I have changed some details to protect my privacy and the company's, but they have been changed to accurately reflect the situation (i.e. where the employer did not capitalize their name, I did not, and I removed my current town for privacy reasons)

It has been a family owned company for 80 years (since the 1940s). Unfortunately, the owners have had health problems (stroke and mental problems). We are a profitable company that supplies a niche apparel product. We are still gaining new customers, creating new designs, and etc. We have several patents. We own two manufacturing plants in Central America. I work in the stateside distribution center (located here for 30 years).

Today we had a meeting with this information provided. The company have four potential buyers. They are optimistic about them. They have been trying to sell for years but the owners were only interested in investors not a large competitor buying. All four companies interested are smaller than ours. Two are in the same apparel as ours. One sells a product that is a direct competitor. Some have distribution centers, some have manufacturing plants but in Asia.

Management seemed positive but management is also older and closer to retirement. They are also less expendable. They said a lot of stuff (they have always presented the company as a whole, this will help the company grow, the companies interested are ""good people"", etc) but it is hard to tell if it is just corporate speak or not. They are in the ""due diligence"" part of the sell.

I have a Bachelor's but it is in Special Education. The town I am living in is **very** small and in the Midwest. I bought a house last year and am going to be paying that off for the next 20 years. I am a naturally pessimistic person so this is stressing me out.

This cafe opened in July, and I have been working there since August. It's my first job. Typically I don't work out front serving food and what not. Since we were short two people today and it was busy, my manager had me serving food today. I have not been trained or prepared to do this. He just threw me out there.

I think I did pretty well even though I was nervous and I had to ask my coworkers lots of questions on how to do things.

However, there was one thing in particular that I messed up on and I am beating myself up over it.

This week at work we are selling tacos and nachos. As I was serving a few people, some of them asked if they could have like their salsa and stuff on the side. As I was putting their food in the containers, I like put the salsa outside the container to itself. Like you have the tacos and stuff in the container with plastic wrap, and I put like the salsa outside the plastic wrap to itself. I now realize that was not the best way to do it.

I didn't know until a coworker mentioned it that we have plastic cups for side stuff to be placed in. I was upset with myself that I ruined a few customers servings. Also for one lady, I accidentally put salsa on her food container and it was dripping on the side. I felt bad about that. I directed her where our napkins are.

I didn't know though. I didn't know that we had those plastic cups. Had I known that, I would've put their side stuff in them. The way I was doing it was kind of sloppy.

Doing things like this is how you lose customers. I would hate to be the reason why customers don't come back.

The question coming up might be broad, but I could not find any satisfactory answer in an existing post so far (because you know, specifics), so I thought I'd ask around for enlightenment.

Long story short, I am now in my mid-30's, decided to quit my job in one of the Big 4 tech companies after 12 years, and while I'm not yet at the point where I want to go back to an office job straight away, I'd love to hear your opinion and  experiences on the topic.

\- Dropped out of uni before the end of my BSC in computer science and industrial programming (yeah great move I know)

\- Jumped immediately into a Tech support / Customer service rep role for the next 3 years.

\- Spent the next 8 years in 2 different management positions (In B2B support), still in the Tech support/Customer service area, with job responsibilities heavy on Coaching/Leadership and Admin/Reporting, with months-long missions in Recruitment and Operations.

\- 5 Months in a UX/UI analyst role afterwards. I maintained a decent IT background throughout the management career (particularly on Network technologies, Mobile Device management and programming), which probably helped landing this job.

\- Native French speaker, pretty much native-level English fluency at this point too. I understand Italian/Spanish/Dutch fairly well, fluency in either of these 3 would be a matter of months practicing.

\- Interest in and good understanding of Finance/Stock market.

And this is where I am.

My worry at this point is that customer care/tech support careers seem to be a good path to ... another customer care job, which is and industry i'd preferably steer clear of. Most of my network left our company for another Customer care department, and I'm just not sure what roles this job prepared me for outside of it exactly. While leadership is an important skill in itself in my opinion, I am not too sure about the job market for a management position outside of my field of expertise. Also, the fact that I did not graduate can be an issue, as some companies/countries/roles will enforce strict degree requirements, while for others work experience can make up for it.

So in a nutshell my question is: What's your experience with your career after call center / call center management careers, or any thoughts/recommendations you would have based on my profile. 

Finally, I'm willing to relocate outside of Europe (the last 2 gigs were in Ireland/Netherlands), with a preference for HK/Singapore or if stars align for it find a location independent job.

TIA :)

1254,dka9h1,False,Onboarding,1,Recently started a job in a newly-created role. I've been getting minimal guidance or training and I'm not sure what to do.,jobs,"Context: as in the title, I've recently started a new job in a role that was newly created within an established, ~100 person software company. Basically, the plan was to hire someone full time to do a particular job that one team (team A) had a rotation for, and wanted to stop doing since it's out of the scope of their own roles. The people in team A work mostly remotely, and it's them who are my ""customers"" (and who I work with the most so far). However, I'm organizationally a member of a different team (team B) whose manager I report to. It's a weird structure and I got a sense of the weirdness during the interview process when the hiring manager (the manager of team A) revealed I would be reporting to someone else.

While it makes sense for me to be a part of team B given the set of tools and technologies I'm working with, since joining I've had almost no official training with either of the teams. My current training has consisted of shadowing members of team A as they do the job I've been hired to do, though this is proving difficult as they are all remote and keep doing parts of the job without me. I've also had very little official contact with either of the managers. At other companies I've worked for, I'm used to having weekly one-on-one check-ins with my managers (and sometimes daily check ins during onboarding), and after four weeks on the job, I haven't had a single one. Manager of team B (my manager) has assigned me some projects, which is fine, but they're all relatively advanced and have little to do with the job I was actually hired for (I also haven't been getting much help on them). As time goes on I do want to spend more time on these kinds of projects, but for now I first want to establish myself in the job I was hired to do. 

Truth be told, I'm starting to get worried. I'm still not sure how I should be spending my time, how long training should take, and how to get the training I need. I'm also relatively isolated since my primary customers are remote. It's clear to me now that little thought was given to this role's day to day, and there was (and is) little coordination between the leaders of the two teams regarding this role. I'm imagining it was basically team A saying ""there's this job we don't like and we want someone else on team B to do it for us"", and team B saying ""sure, we'd be glad to have another person"". I'm also totally unclear on how I'm going to be evaluated. Will I be reviewed by team A or B? What should my goals be? When should I expect to be ramped? How should I learn what I need to know? Who do I need to please?

I've been trying my best to manage in this unorganized situation, but as of right now it does not seem sustainable and I need clarity from my manager. Unfortunately he's definitely hands off, and while not a bad guy, mentoring does not appear to be a strongpoint of his. What do you recommend I do in this situation to get the guidance and clarity that I need?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dka9h1/recently_started_a_job_in_a_newlycreated_role_ive/,1,"First prioritize your projects, then write down a list of questions for each.  I assume you know how to do some of what you’re being asked or they wouldn’t have hired you.  Go to the person who assigned a given project and let them know you’re of course still learning the workflow but wanted to walk them through what you think the steps should be.  If Team A member jumps ahead and does something without you, ask them how they did it, say hey I would really love to take this part off your hands can you show me your process or here’s what I think your process was, does this work.  There are two types of people in your situation, those who quit because they dont know what to do and think there’s no training and those who figure out how to fill the holes, figure out how to slowly help each member of team A or  team B.  A lot of times companies have a group of employees that says they are really struggling to get something done and so they hire someone to do it, you, so if they won’t show you how to do it, try a few things, show them a few things, show your manager a few things, don’t ask or wait, just do.  The brilliance of a job like yours that isn’t standardized is you could make it what you want and then be the person everyone wants to go to and that person climbs quickly.

But I want to leave on good terms.",jobs,"I have always wanted to do Masters from Germany. I was working at my home country, it was a new job and I started to hate it because of the toxic environment. So when I got my student visa I gave a two weeks notice and left the job. The main reason was not the masters, it was the toxicity. My manager was pain in the ass. Anyways, I received an email from the university that they'll conduct the classes online because of corona, this happened just a day before I was supposed to fly. They also said that they classes have been postponed. 
This hit me pretty hard. It's seemed as though all my dreams had been put on pause for an indefinite period of time. Since my graduation (Bachelor's) I have had a job. I didn't know how to cope with this ""free time"". So I applied for a few jobs. I was also unsure if I want to pursue master's online, because it won't be the same as on-campus. And I applied for jobs that suited my skillsets, aligned with my career goals. I applied mostly at small companies, and only at one multi-national which is also the among the biggest corp in my home country. 

I had been a while, since this happened, and I had to decide whether or not to take online classes, so I availed the option and started my classes. It's been 2.5 months that I've been studying.
So the most unexpected thing happened. I got an interview call from that big company, and I got so excited, I went for the interview. It went well, then the final interview, and finally I landed the job! I couldn't believe it. I landed it so easily. Now they want me to join them, and this just seemed very foolish of me to pass the opportunity like that. I took my time to think about it and accepted the offer. But I'm still not sure, I haven't signed the contract yet. I've only accepted it verbally. 

I had my exams in July, but they've been postponed, the university says they next semester will probably be online as well. But it's not confirmed as of yet and they'll see how things evolve. Which makes sense. 

All of this uncertainty, made me accept the offer. But it really stresses me out when I think about leaving the job in a few months. ""What if the university calls on campus for exams?"" ""What if the next semester is on-campus?"" I know leaving a company in a few months does not leave a good impression and ruins the employee's reputation. 

I don't know what to do. Though writing this post has cleared my mind to some extend like I don't think joining was a stupid decision. But I want to tell my manager so that when I leave it doesn't come as a shock to him. But since it's a big company idk how soon a ""new"" ""entry-level"" employee should give out that information because that could really work out against me. But again, I don't want to drop a truth bomb, and just come up to them one day with the news that I'm leaving. 

I'm really enjoying studying. And I DO NOT want to put my masters on hold for this job. Legally, I can do both as long as I'm staying in my home country. 

In the interview, they didn't ask me anything regarding my future plans, expected duration of anything like that. They don't even know I'm doing master's.

I was thinking was casually dropping little info so they at least know about my master's. Instead of having a one-to-one serious meeting. 

This whole thing has been extremely stressful. I don't like disappointing people. And I want to leave as soon the classes start on campus. Masters is my first priority.

But, i want to market my skills and use them for gain. 


Basically, i want to become kind of a freelance editor, like, someone send me their videos or footage online and i'll edit it together for them. Like, a wedding video or something. Kind of like that.


I'd rather work from home, if possible, (rather then like, an office or something). Because i am somewhat disabled, i have knee problems and limited mobility so i can't really get around very well, i just think it'd be better.


So, my question is, how do i go about doing this? I don't have much ""formal"" training with this, i didn't go to college or anything, but i did learn a lot about editing in high school broadcasting class.


I honestly think i could make a career off this, i love editing videos,

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9xgar/you_should_stop_participating_in_indeeds_online/,509,The assessments are not great.

two weeks ago i was hired on as a shipper at a local warehouse, there are a number of them around so they sent me off to get trained in another building a city or two over.

i figured it was a bad day but it went on like this for 2 weeks with my trainer steadily growing more and more angry with me but not telling me anything, I had no idea what i was doing to make them upset so in the end i basically just shut down and waited to be told what to do, I did have a moment or two of extreme frustration bordering on anger because I had no idea what i was doing and ever question was answered with something like ""that's just what we do""

the building i was training at no longer wants me to show up for the last two days of training, so im going to the building im supposed to be working in, the problem is word of my negativity and attitude have spread so my reputation is already sullied in my actual work environment.

I got hired two weeks ago as a manager in my new company (one position lower than the general manager). There is one employee in particular (I'll call her RD) who is very harsh and has an attitude problem towards me specifically. Turns out, RD interviewed for my position but didn't get it, and I did. The problem now is that she is VERY obviously bitter towards me for it and she is openly that way in front of other employees and even my boss. 

The problem is that when the previous manager was preparing to leave, she taught RD a lot of her responsibilities. Now RD has taken over and won't let me touch anything or really do anything that is part of my responsibilities. When I answer the phone she will talk in my other ear about how to answer a question I've been asked like I have no idea what I'm doing. When a client comes in to talk to me, she INTERRUPTS me while I am talking to them to answer herself. It's very rude and is obviously awkward for me and the client. 

I've talked with my boss (who I'll call GM) about it and long story short, he told me that it is going to be an uphill battle for me because she is still bitter about the position. He told me that if I feel the need to talk to her, to talk to her. GM told me that he will try to let us figure it out between ourselves, but if it becomes a real issue he will step in. He also made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk about it or need advice I can ask. 

GM also made it clear that RD has had issues with the manager before me, GM himself, and even other office staff. He even told me that I'm ""going to make her mad no matter what. That's just how RD is"".  He also said that he doesn't trust her at all with anything personal and that if she walked out tomorrow, we would be okay because her job is just an unnecessary extension of my own. 

RD even admitted to me that she is ""a control freak and has to do things herself"" and that she had a ""tough childhood and that's why she is the way she is"" neither of which are excuses to treat anyone, let alone your boss, the way she treats me. 

I had the opportunity to talk with the girl who had my position before me and she made it very clear that my boss wanted ME for the position and that I need to establish my position with RD quickly. My latest experience with her happened today when I told her that she doesn't need to worry about what I'm doing because I can manage on my own (this is my second week on the job), to which she never made eye contact and responded with ""well I just need things done right"" gave me a slight look, and turned around and walked away. Which leads me to my main question that I really need advice for...

I have never been a manager before, and I'm even amazed that I got this job because I had zero experience in this particular field when I applied. So how the heck am I supposed to handle this situation? I have accepted that I will not be her friend, which I am 100% okay with because she is not a kind person, but how do I go about this in a professional manner? I need her to understand that even though I am newer than her (she only started 3 months ago) I am still her boss and she needs to respect that. And how do I reclaim my responsibilities that she jumped on to take over? 

TLDR; Started a management position and an employee that also applied for the job is bitter that I got it over her.

My advice is to accept you won’t know everything and just do what you can. Don’t let people walk on you - speaking from experience the industry is full of bullies who prey on the weak.
If you want to avoid another toxic workplace, you may want to explore opportunities with larger consultancies with well established systems and HR protocol where It’s less likely a sociopathic manager will get away with bullying and harassment.

So I just finished my 2nd year as a civil engineer, and haven't gotten a coop work term yet. I applied to about 80 jobs but only got 5 interviews, and no offers. Getting no offers really sucks. It seems like my confidence lowers everytime after an interview. One interview that hit my confidence was an interview with the city of Edmonton. They were looking for 2 students and interviewed 3 people (including me), and I still didnt get the job. It really sucks.


I've been going to my university job office for resume/interview help, but still had no luck. Even before going for help, I realize the biggest weakness I have compared to other students is my lack of work experience (ie. I have no work experience at all). I thought that grades were everything and dint focus on getting any experience. And it's a mistake in my part, and probably should have tried to look for jobs during highschool, but no point in regretting in the past. 


With my lack of work experience, I have been volunteering and joined an engineering club to compensate for the lack of experience. With those, I gained amazing memories, but it still doesnt feel the same as getting a work term. 


I feel like a part of not getting interviews is my interviewing skills. I generally don't have very good experience with talking to people, but I felt that most of my interviews felt really good (only 1 interview felt unprepared). But I guess that wasn't the case since I'm still looking for jobs. 


Since the first work term started today, they waived my first work term since they saw I was actually applying to jobs/put some effort into looking for jobs. However, if I don't get a job in my next work term, I'll be dropped out of coop. Furthermore, the experience I hear from my friends about their first day, makes me really depressed since I cant partake in the same experience.  Also since about 90-95% of civil students got a job makes me even more depressed about it.


Being dropped out would kill me inside. I worked so hard during my first year since I needed a higher GPA to apply for coop, but I feel like that was just a waste if I end up being dropped out. In addition, if I don't get a job for my coop, what are the chances that I get a job after I graduate? Thoughts like this scare me. 


At this point, I kinda accepted the fact that I'll be dropped out of coop, but the future terrifies me. I basically don't see a future in what I do right now

Hope all is well with you in this uncertain times.

**Context:**

I received an e-mail on last Friday (8 May) by a recruiter from the retail fashion division of a big company in my country.

They have several business areas, and I applied to opportunities in the food retail division (supply chain and logistics), and by that contact, the recruiter from the other fashion division said in the email that wanted to call me soon, to know my interests and motivations, if it made sense.

As soon as I read the email (end of the day in friday 2hours later), I sent a response thanking for the contact and showing availability to talk about that, and if preferable for them, i was available to arrange a given time to expect a call!

I didnt receive till now a response from the recruiter and at this point I don't know what to do. I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.

**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...

I would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.

If I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?

I'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.

Of course now it doesn't matter since my friends who were once saddled in debt now have MAs, some PhD and have established a career path.  

There is one route which they back, that's me completing a PGCE to obtain Qualified Teacher Status so I can be a state school teacher. Everything else is just ""but the debt Xemnas"" and I...frankly don't have a very strong sense of self to oppose them. If they treat me as if I can't handle the loan then, maybe I can't :/

2381,7qu3b2,False,Training,129,Is the Skills Gap a Myth?,jobs,"A recent SHRM article, written by a professor in the field, argues that [“The Skills Gap is a Myth”](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/1217/pages/the-skills-gap-is-a-myth.aspx).


His arguments confronts the claims that U.S. businesses are having a tough time finding and hiring qualified people because of factors like universities inadequately training recent graduates for the workforce.  He responded that such claims are exaggerated because employers, that used to provide training to new employees (especially in entry-level positions), have been cutting training budgets and are expecting new candidates to come in already trained for the tasks specific to their roles.  This was especially common during the recession when there was a surplus of seasoned employees competing for entry-level jobs.


 As a result, these entry-level positions, that used to serve as starting points in a career for recent graduates, now require multiple years of experience.


The author argues that universities training students for specific job roles is incredibly inefficient because of the rapidly changing demands for different skills in the job market:
>One problem with trying to get our educational institutions to produce the students employers want is that there is no guarantee that anyone will hire them when they graduate. Telling young people to major in, say, petroleum engineering, which was among the hottest jobs this decade, turned out to be bad advice when demand fell off. It’s also incredibly inefficient to try to learn work-based skills in a classroom setting.

656,fc7l6i,False,Unemployment,9,"(23m) Communication graduate, four years unemployed.",jobs,"Get all the jokes out of the way early, I know my degree means fluff.

Now to specifics. I'm in my fourth year of no full-time work. Over the years I have honed my applications, resume and interview tactics to a fine art - the problem is, everything comes up green except the actual job. It started with a marketing position at the head office of the company I currently work for (casual). After taking me under their wing, the state manager pretty much guaranteed me the job (""apply for this and you'll get it""), and then right through the interview process was ""your resume is outstanding"".

I didn't get the job.

So I didn't give up. I kept applying through tonnes of rejections, until I conveniently found another job at my current company. Again made it right through to second place, being told everything was perfect, even when I asked for feedback.

I didn't get the job.

I then found a startup company, who loved me. They even said they went out of their way for a second interview because I was exactly the candidate they were looking for. They excitedly told me they'd be in touch until I received a phone call in a regretful tone from the hiring manager.

I didn't get the job.

I turned to free internships and free labour as a means of getting my foot in the door. The companies used my ideas I pitched to them and gave other individuals the actual internship (this one especially stung as my ideas were splashed all over their websites).

Today I just scored a second interview with a new job, and was praised for my ""entrepreneur attitude"". The problem is I'm worried history is just going to repeat itself a fourth time. I get it, that's the job life, but four years unemployed is not normal for even my unluckiest of friends.

**The Problem**

I feel like it's a literal impossibility to me to get a full time job now. Over the past four months I've submitted easily 80+ applications and tonnes of internship enquiries. Either they are ignored, rejected or lead nowhere. I can't even find opportunities to gain experience as they're either targeted at uni students or any mentioned as any demographic but me (white, straight male which has disqualified me from several internship opportunities).

I can't afford to go back and study as I can't even pay off my current uni degree loans. Worst of all my casual job has started removing shifts so I may as well be unemployed now. What do I do? Where do I look and how do I keep up hope?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fc7l6i/23m_communication_graduate_four_years_unemployed/,13,"First of all: I'm sorry to read that you've had such bad luck on the job hunt. I know that is really disheartening, because I went through the same thing 5 years ago. I didn't really know how the game worked, back then. But I do now.

So the good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve your chances!

You mentioned that you've applied to 80+ opportunities. This tells me that you're using some standardized process for your applications. You're basically submitting the same resume and a slightly altered cover letter in each, right?

Thing is: if you submit standardized job applications, you're likely to get standardized rejection emails.

As any good communicator knows, you need to tailor your message to your audience.

So the trick is **pick way fewer opportunities** and go all in on those.

So go find a company you would really love to work for and do your research. What do they do, exactly, and how could you, bringing your skills, add value to this company?

I'm sure you can think of something, since you mentioned that you pitched ideas to the companies and that they even ended up using them! I'm sure that really stings. But the harsh reality here is that your ideas were good, but the company just didn't trust you to execute on them.

And that's a problem.

Because, as any startup investor will tell you: ideas are cheap. In the end, it's all about the execution. An investor will sooner invest in a great team with a mediocre idea, than in a questionable team with a great idea.

So you need to make sure the company believes you can execute.

Solution:

**Turn a 'we should' into an 'I did'****.**

For example, instead of saying that the company could improve its copy on the landing page to tailor it more to audience XYZ (cheap idea), go ahead and actually rewrite that copy and submit it with your application!

Another example: instead of saying that the company could improve its marketing by increasing its presence on social media, go ahead and actually create a week's worth of social media content for them!

Not only will this allow you to show off your skills, but it will prove that you can do the job before you even have it!

There is no better signal you can give a potential employer.

Finally: **show genuine excitement** for the job in your application.

A standard cover letter is a terrible medium to express excitement. It's frankly plain dull, impersonal and boring.

Remember that you're marketing yourself!

Would you ever choose a ""dear sir/madam"" letter to market anything else?

Probably not.

Making a video cover letter (like with [crash.co](https://crash.co)) will really help you to express your genuine enthusiasm, as well as your communication skills and willingness to go the extra mile.

1786,gfztdd,False,Recruiters,0,What is working for Hermes actually like?,jobs,"Hi guys,

I live in West Wales and am 20 years of age. I am fully aware that business insurance will be a LOT higher for me until I reach 21 years of age but that's why I'm preparing now as that's in around 4 months time. I am really passionate about driving and am looking to hopefully do something in delivery, but need to be earning a sustainable amount of money. I applied for Hermes once and got a call asking for further details but I never got back to them after doing the sums, it was truly awful. I don't know if it's like this everywhere but based on what I've heard, this is what I can approximate.

Income:

50p per parcel (assume 100 parcels per day, 12 parcels an hour approx means 5 minutes between deliveries, seems about right). That's £50 in income, or a gross rate of £6.25/hr.

Outgoings:

Assume the cost of running a car is 35p a mile. With business insurance, that is roughly what it would be I'd imagine. Where I live, as things are pretty far away from each other (quite rural). I would assume that over 8 hours of driving I'd cover around 150 miles a day, which would mean an average speed of 19mph which seems about right given my experience of driving where I live.

So, 150 miles at 30p per mile, is £45

Total income for 8 hours work = (£50-45) = £5 or... 63p per hour.

I have heard of Hermes SE+, which supposedly you trade in some of your per package income for a stable pay rate. Does that sound any better or does anyone have experience with it? If the income is so bad as I have calculated, why am I still getting deliveries via a hermes courier?

For all candidates I scan their resume and look at their LinkedIN profile.  Assuming I see enough of interest I take the following actions.

For internal candidates, I email their boss to confirm they are available for release as well as ask for general feedback on their performance.  Assuming I don't know the candidate I also check with any people I know in their department or shared contacts on LinkedIN.

For external candidates, if we share a contact on LinkedIN I call them.  I do refrain if the shared contact is at the same company as the candidate.

For all the candidates that pass this initial screen I send a short email.  It has the position title in the header and reads.

>Hi xxxx,
 
>I am the hiring manage for this position and would like to schedule an initial half hour phone interview with you.  Please share 4-5 30 minute time blocks that meet your schedule.

Tip #1, even if you have carpet bombed your applications don't respond hey thats great can you send me the job description.  You have the title, and the company I work for.  I expect you to be able to put 2+2 together to know which job I'm wanting to talk to you about.

However since I am having trouble filling this role due to its niche nature I gave the benefit of the doubt.  I sent a meeting invite with a time and date that matched the selection provided and worked for me.  I also included the description in the meeting invite.

Tip #2, don't respond to the meeting invite with thanks, when do you want to meet.  The time and date are in the header.  Most email systems, especially gmail, not only recognize the time and date they provide a nice little button that allows you to accept or decline.

I've had two interactions with this candidate and in both cases they have either demonstrated ineptness or laziness.  Those are not good qualities and frankly I don't have the time or bandwidth to micromanage.

So, I have 4 employees right now. Had 5, but one left already due to the employees having near-daily arguments.

I leave them alone for one minute and they start fighting. I don’t have the ability to constantly watch them, or anyone else I would trust to do so. 

We already had a two-hour long discussion on it, which helped for one day. Great waste of time when we’re already weeks behind schedule.

- I cant drive/never learned how, so I have issues with reliable transportation in that area or able to have the ability to snatch a job that requires driving
- I have month to over a year gaps in job consistency and even when I did have a job, I’d have to quit due to unreliable transportation/sudden city to city moving and also would get fired for lack of performance under high stress(so unstable with lasting jobs)

-Job areas ive applied for(retail, fast food, cafes, restaurants, shoe/book/clothing stores/shops, grocery stores, pharmaceutical based, hair places;think sallys, at malls, movies, post offices, etc)
- I live in a college area and not out in the city so most jobs are taken by either those in college or those who have a lot of stable job experiences 
- Ive sent out emails, called places back(to be told they aren’t hiring even when their stores have a hiring now poster up), re-applied to jobs(well over 30), applied both with and without resumes, etc and all of them keep telling me they found better matches or aren’t hiring


I really do need some sort of good advice here because I’ve been unemployed for a year and need just general help since I’m at a loss with knowing what I can do",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eyrkok/what_can_i_do_about_my_current_situation/,1,"Let me preface this advice by saying that it is my sincere belief that people born after 1990 just really don't understand how powerful the internet is because you've had it your entire lives and just completely take it for granted.

Those of us over the age of 40 grew up in the Industrial Age and as such, we have modeled our Socio-Economic-Political Structure based on the Industrial Age.  Go out, get a job, punch a clock, work in a factory or company, etc etc is all ingrained in our society.  

However, we are now in the information age.  Unfortunately, the inertia of the Industrial Age is still with us and many people, like yourself, are guided by that inertia.

Don't be.

Learn how to make money using the internet.  Notice I said ""learn"".  Every day as a society we spend billions of hours on the internet doing ""Stuff"".  What you need to do is you need to find a way to provide a service for people that use the internet.  What exactly? I have no effing idea.  All I know is that the internet is a giant sandbox with billions of kids playing every day.  There is an infinite market that you have access to.    


What can you do?  Learn how to code, learn how to do Graphic Design, Learn how to do Video Editing,  Learn Social Media, learn about Bitcoin, become an expert at some ""part"" of the internet and then provide some sort of service for people who use the internet.

Maybe you help old people and/or Mom and Pop businesses develop social media profiles, maybe you figure out how to become a virtual assistant and offer your services to affluent types, maybe you build a website selling widgets, maybe you figure out ""something"" that people on the internet can use and you code an app for it....

Here is my advice.  

Watch at least 3 seasons of Shark Tank (doesn't matter which 3 seasons, just pick three), read some books on Entrepreneurship and starting your own business.  go through youtube and watch a few hundred hours worth of those annoying ""Here is how I make money using the internet"" scam videos that want you to buy their bullshit courses.  Do the above for 6 months like a machine and ""something"" inside your brain will click on how to make money on the internet.

You will start by working like a dog and making peanuts, in fact, your internet hourly  wage will probably start off around 5 cents an hour, that is, you work for 20 hours trying to get clients, sell widgets, etc and out of that 20 hours someone pays you $10 for a widget.  You work the next 20 hours and make $25 which comes out to 12.5 cents an hour.  You work the next 20 hours and make $50, then the next and make $100, then the next and make $150, then the next and make $400....   By the end of the year, you've figured some stuff out and now are making more than minumum wage on the internet.  By the end of the next year, you have learned even more and are now making $20/hr... by the end of the next year you are making $100/hr....

You have to learn to hunt and gather for yourself.  We are in the information age, stop trying to live by the old rules and paradigm of the Industrial age.  Educate yourself with the internet.  Yes, it will be tough, yes, it will take a lot of hard work, yes you will have to actually study and read and write shit down and learn how to code and use programs from scratch...  but long term, this is your best path.  It is not easy, it will take you a couple of years, but man, longterm it will be worth it.

Another thing that can help is to partner with someone who is in a similar boat as you are in.  You guys decide to form H&F Online Consultants.  H&F stands for Hustle and Flow.  I don't mean hustle in the bad sense, I mean hustle in the Entrepreneurial sense.  You guys help each other learn, motivate each other, spend every day looking at the internet thinking ""how can we scrape some cheddar off of the mountain of cheese in front of us...""  

You grind everyday with the mentality that you are gonna make money doing ""something"".  You are going to find a need, a niche, an edge that you can exploit.  

that is my advice.  We are in the information age.  The era of working for others hoping they dole out a salary for you is yesterday's model.  Sure, it will work for most but it is no longer ideal.  There is a sea of money out there on the internet right now, you only need a tiny fraction of a fraction of a fraction to thrive.  Figure out how to get that fraction, learn to carve your own niche.

My name is Phil and I have been a retail worker for a big company for the last 6 months. I am paid the minimum amount and working full time. I never really asked any questions because I am not very experienced with working yet (I am 19). People tell me I am good at my job, one of the best where I work and I'm glad. 

However, my new colleague told me that I am severly underpaid for the amount of work I do in the store. Basically I do most of the stuff myself and my other coworkers don't take the job seriously, using their phones while supposed to be working. My manager is always looking for new people to replace them, but very few people want to work there and my coworkers are using this at their advantage. I think am someone who is very loyal, which is why I didn't look for something else all that time. 

I am starting to slowly hate my job here because I do a lot alone. I hate the fact that other coworkers are paid way more than I am while doing almost nothing. I work 40 hours a week at 12$ an hour. 

With Black Friday and the Holidays coming up, I would feel bad quitting and I don't think it would be good for any future job, but showing up every morning and doing the job that wasn't done while I was gone is excruciating.

Do you guys have any advice? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9zes6t/im_feel_like_im_underpaid_and_the_only_one_who/,182,"Loyalty to large companies is ill placed.

Loyalty is earned my friend. If a company or small business treats you well, Pays you what you are worth and makes an effort to make their employees lives even a little bit better then you can place your loyalty not in the company but in those around you. If your boss is a great guy, Gives you all the opportunity he can provide, Understands day to day problems that sometimes require absence from work and so on. Then you can place your loyalty in him.

&#x200B;

Companies are not built for employees happiness. They are built to exploit people for profit. This model has worked well over time but at the cost of quality of life.

Being so young I would give this advice I give every youngster. Speaking from experience. I hate my work life and am actively trying to replace it. I just wish i realised all these things sooner.

* If you working harder than what you are being paid for. You are losing money.
* If you feel like you are being exploited then you probably are.
* Working harder than those around you won't do you many favours in the long run.
* Work requiring low skill or just an able body is never rewarded well.
* Loyalty placed in companies is misplaced
* If there is little room to move up the chain, Don't exert more energy than needed.
* You will always hate your job after a while and dread coming into work.
* Use your free time wisely, Don't waste your youth working 40 hour weeks for little reward
* Retail is a horrible industry
* Ask for a pay rise when you want it. Don't be a pushover, More money does not come without asking.
* Working diligently to make someone else more money that they pay you is an exercise in futility and should be limited.
* Look at starting a business.
* Picking a career immediately puts a hard cap on your potential earnings. You will only ever be paid so much.
* Business has a no real cap on potential earnings.
* Depending on your personality type you may find structured organisations relentless and disheartening.
* Anyone who tells you they enjoy their job and isn't a marine biologist or doing some other cool shit is lying to you and themselves.
* There are better jobs out there. None of witch will fulfil you, most of them are horrible grinds design to squeeze the life out of you.
* Don't take your boss to seriously.

Advice from an IT manager. But I am also a fucking retard. You will encounter people like me often.

I have interviewed kids for service desk and dev ops roles, I can see they are eager and keen, It breaks my heart when after hiring one they become a drone right in front of my eyes.

Start a business mate, Don't end up like the rest of us.

If someone says they like their mediocre job. They are lying and want you to experience the same pain they are.

Did I forget to mention, the higher you are paid the worse life gets and the less time you have? This is the rule for employment, There are exceptions but you are not likely to be one of them. Higher pay does not mean better quality of life. I know from experience. Being on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week is not worth the money.

It's been the best job of my life so far, however it was anounced in April this year that the UK side of the business hasn't been profitable in a long time, and the company needed to make 350 redundancies in total this year. and they also had to make 150 redundancies last year.

&#x200B;

I work in the IT department doing 2nd line tech support. We were told by our boss after the original anouncement that these redundancies wouldn't affect us as we were needed so much, so I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing. last week it was anounced that the 1st line team (4 people in total) is being made redundant and their job is being moved to one of our offices in Poland, and now I can't help but feel like the 2nd line team (3 people in total) is next.

&#x200B;

I'm hesitant to just leave. I've had a lot of family issues recently (my dad was diagnosed with Brain cancer last November 2018 and died in February 2019) and my boss as the time was incredible to me. He gave me so much time to take my dad to appointments and sort out what I needed to sort out at home, and also gave me so much time to recover after he passed. He was always calling me outside of work to see if I was okay and if there was anything i needed and just being a generally great guy, so I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I feel like I owe him a huge debt. since then though, he was promoted in January/February 2019 and I've had 2 different managers since then, so everything seems all over the place and I don't know exactly what to do.

&#x200B;

My main question though.. should I ride it out for the redundancy pay and get a new job afterwards, or should i start looking now and abandon ship? I've never been in a position where I'll be made redundant before, so I'm not sure what happens in that situation. I believe I get 1 months salary for every year of service, so it wouldn't be a lot in redundancy pay. I've never had issues getting employment though. I was a contractor for a long time, and the longest I've ever been out of work was 4 weeks.

Of course if your guest blog posts match up if the interests of the companies you're applying for, that's even better. 

I think what really stands out is to make sure your writing samples are technically sound and you at least have a good vocabulary.

The other thing is that out of an 8 hour day, I'm only paid for 4 of those hours. The pay is okay enough to make up for it, but I'd be paid based on performance; which apparently means I could make anywhere from $600 to $1200 a week, which seems strange.

The last thing is just how unconventional the company seems; in the interview, I was told I would be making six-figures if I stuck around for a year or two (huh??) and the company has apparently grown from 1 to 20 offices in two years of existence.

Now, I admit that some of those things you mentioned would annoy me also, but I certainly wouldn't use those criteria to assess potential candidates. So maybe you can clear up a few things here:

1. I see that you'll look at Facebook profiles as well.

This sounds like a form of impression management, the dangers of which I am sure you are familiar with. Perhaps you can further explain how these trivial physical behaviors can account for variances in job performance/satisfaction/needs of the organization?

3. If the purpose of the job fair is to connect potential applicants with the organization, and for the organization to show a presence for applicants to consider, why is there such a strict list of criteria on whether or not they are *allowed* to further explore the company with us? From the way it was written, it sounds like we all have a checklist to mark off when someone comes to talk to us; and if they don't meet enough of our criteria, they can't work at the company.

For an *entry* level position, you aren't really gonna be the main photographer/editor anyway.

Same goes for things like customer service or marketing. All these entry level jobs are asking for one year of experience, would it be okay to just apply? Some of the other jobs I'm looking at is stuff like social media manager and they just want you to post on IG, YouTube, Facebook etc. I'm a millennial, that's easy, I post on social media all the time. But would that count as marketing experience? Like I know what they're asking for (Post a photo to Instagram and say ""Look at this product, buy it because of X Y and Z!"" or upload a YouTube video of a product).

I've been yelled at and threatened.  I've only been given a few assignments since starting.  Got the job through a friend after taking some classes and obtaining certificates.

Boss calls me into the office for a review.  Very much a ""no beating around the bush"" sorta guy.  Tells me I need to grow a backbone.  To be honest, he's right.  I am awful at dealing with confrontation.  You wouldn't guess it by looking at me, but when people start becoming aggressive with me, I tend to lose focus which exposes my lack of experience.  I've been in the customer service industry for so long that my automatic response is to calm the situation by trying to appease the aggressor in any way possible.

First of all, I definitely understand the struggle as I did not find it easy either and like you, I volunteered at several places and I stuggled securing interviews.

Now, there are few things you might be doing wrong. 


1. NHS vs Private
Searching through Indeed tells me you've mainly looked for private jobs, but most clinics want to hire someone with at least 2 years of experience. This might sound like the easier option but I'd suggest mostly focusing on securing and NHS post first to gain some experience and quality 
training.


2. UP THAT SUPPORTING STATEMENT!! 
This is the one element I found made all the difference for me - this is what secures you an interview. A lot of people don't want to feel like bragging and they might overlook things that would sell you to the interviewer because you've assumed they are normal (Such as managing your independent ward etc). They often are not. You did amazingly well on your last placement? Let them know! You had a really niche research done at uni? Let them know why you chose it - it tells them you're passionate about the profession!
Don't be shy in using words like ""outstanding"" and ""excellent"" in relation to the quality of your work. If you don't convince them you're the best possible asset to them, then someone else will. Recruiters will also think ""if they are so insecure about their skills, then why would we be""?
Also, ask a friend to look at it, even if they aren't PT. After my boyfriend (studying 3d animation) helped me tighten my SS , I got asked for 5 interviews of the 7 jobs I applied for.


3. Have patience. 
It's easy to get discouraged after you don't hear back. Persist and work on your application.

Good luck! ",2019-01-22 20:28:08

\*How can I ensure that I can get a stable job when I graduate? Should I get a master's degree after I graduate? or I should serve for government jobs to repay for my scholarship (like DOST).

\*What course should I take if I want to pursue to be a Wildlife Biologist or Animal Rehabilitator? Should I take BS Bio or BS Forestry? or should I take other courses?

\*What school really does focuses on these aspects? Should I take a famous and well-known school?

\*How many years can it take to have a stable career? What is the estimated income of these jobs?

\*They said that if I study this track, I might end up being a teacher because my ideal career is not having a major impact on our country. Am I really going to be a teacher?

\*Lastly, should I take other courses first and find a temporary job to earn money to study these courses?

Here's are some input. 

Fore most, a bachelor in biology, biochem, or chemistry isnt really enough to get the good salary because your competion are those with master and doctor degree. U will most likely need to pursue a master or doctor if u want a good salary. Also a good salary vary...

As for school, it only matter if u looking foward toward a concentration or career. What do i mean by this? Most of the classes of biology are the same regardless where u go, however some schools offer concentrations other university may not. For example, in california; the univeristy in the bay have marine biology as a concentration while those in the central valley dont. Some university offer wild life biology as a concentration and some dont. Some university focus more on medicine sides of biology. Biology is so broad especially at an undergrad level.

When pursing your undergrad, talk to your professors especially the one who focus in your concentration. Get to know them and ask them how u can help on their researchs. For example, when i was taking my pre req for biology, i joined a field biology club and talk to the professor. He offer me a part time position to help with data entry regard to species phenotypes. This experience allow to understand how field biology was different than lab work.

The science u will need to know are physics, chemistry, and biology. The program will teach u and discipline u so dont worry about it for now.

If u go toward biology or any science major, i really really recommend getting a master or doctor afterward.But for me, i got what i needed and took my analaytical skills to run a business because that where my passion align.

I truly recommend majoring in biology, it's an amazing journey and u will learn so much about the natural world. If u have more question feel free to dm me. there's alot more but i cant cover it in one go. ",2020-04-03 16:20:04

259,93frua,False,Discipline,380,A good employee is a no-show and won't answer her phone. What should I do?,jobs,"I'm a manager of a  small business, a store. We are a little short staffed. Last night, I was called in on my only day off (I hate that, sorry.)  because one of my employees was a no-show. We have a process where if there's no call/no show they get written up and potentially fired. It's a few steps. ( still, we're an At will State and it's in the policy so if corporate decides to, yikes.)

I'm worried. She's one of my best employees. She always is on time, does a good job. I recently gave her a raise and she was excited about that. I worked on Sunday and she switched shifts with me. She said ""Hey, I'll see you tomorrow!"" But then, didn't show up. It's really uncharacteristic. My employee who was working the morning shift texted her, called her and informed me her line had been disconnected. So I tried calling and texting; also disconnected. I emailed her, no response. She has a few longer shifts on Sat/Sun and I'm nervous about it. She hasn't reached out to me at all.

What if something bad happened? How do I approach this? I've had employees skip out but it was usually just because they were being irresponsible, as I said. I just don't want to overstep my boundaries as boss but I'm worried she's hurt or something. What do you think?

Edit: Okay, I called non-emergency and requested a welfare check on her. I hope she's okay and that this is all for nothing. I'll update if anything comes of it.

Edit: I should probably mention she recently broke up with her boyfriend and she told me he was mad about it so that's another factor.

UPDATE: I got home from work. The police haven’t called me back. There’s a staff member at the shop, I told him to stay vigilant. He’s aware of the situation and is just as worried. I looked her up on Facebook and found her profile. It hasn’t been active for months but I still sent a message. Turns out, she lives in a shady part of town. Nothing to report from driving by. It’s like she’s just a ghost. I’m preparing to deal with the possibility that I won’t hear from her again. I have no idea how I’m going to deal with covering her shifts cause I’m on almost 8 days straight of working. Stressed. Some of you have suggested maybe she just skipped town. Seems unlikely but if her boyfriend situation was really bad... who knows? I’m wondering if the police checked on her and it was fine and they just didn’t tell me? Either way, I’m going to reach out to them and try to get an update tomorrow. If she turns up Friday to her shift I’ll be floored and relieved. If she did this just because she “felt like it” I’m going to be disappointed. I doubt it though, she cares.  Thank you for the support guys, I appreciate it. And your kind words. Either way I’m probably going to be hiring.

\---

**FINAL UPDATE:** She got back to me this morning on Facebook and quit over text. She waited until Friday to contact me. Why? Because I called for a Welfare check.  She didn't give me a reason why she skipped work, cut all contact and ghosted me and our staff. But she was mad I sent the cops to do a Welfare check. The police must have done a check and it was fine so they didn't bother calling me back. 

 I woke up to this from her*:*

I'm not sure how this is logical, but I guess I don't know her private life. I don't think you can get evicted for a welfare check. Unless she's doing something illegal?  I politely explained that I was worried about her because it was completely out of character for her to be irresponsible. Also, the break up. She was silent for five days. She's was a valuable asset for our store and I'd just given her a raise?  I doubt I'll get a response. I'm a little upset that she doesn't understand why suddenly disappearing would alarm me, the staff. I'm floored. She was with us for three months. Regardless, I hope she does okay out there and I'm happy she is safe and well. At least this didn't end with someone dying, right? I'm disappointed but relieved.

Sure I could easily get hired at Macy’s doing the same thing but I don’t care if someone buys a new shirt or not, for Best Buy I don’t care if anyone buys another TV just because a new model came out that is 4% better than the one they bought last year.

So I'm basically just before entering university and have no clue what I want to do...

I asked myself sometimes what I want to do for a living and well, the answer is always the same, nothing. 

I considered various careers; law, veterinary, economics, translation... But I just can't imagine doing any. All of them sound interesting but I just quickly lose interest in things. That's the reason for my regular grades too. I often find something we learn at school interesting, but after half an hour or less I lose interest, that line crossed, I start procrastinating and just can't focus.

Anyway, despite those impediments, there are some things I do like. I have a flair for language (not sure if I used the right idiom, I just learn languages pretty fast). I currently speak 3 languages fluently (English, Spanish, and German.) I understand some French but dropped it (May continue later) and I'd like to pick up 2 new ones (2 out of Japanese, Chinese, and Russian). I am furthermore studying a bit of Greek and Latin (In order to improve my general culture besides having a genuine interest in those cultures). Other than languages I am a bit curious about economics and entrepreneurship.

So I used to procrastinate the urge of finding a job I want to do for a living with the thought that I'd have no problem finding a job being polylingual, that thought got enhanced by some people in my environment. But as there are only 2 months left to decide what career to start I pushed myself to research a bit and write this post. 

Now straight to the point, does someone know a job I could like? or am I a hopeless case and should straight-up work on my mentality?

I also hyperlink where I think the HR employee would copy/paste into Google. The fields usually are the name (link it to their LinkedIn), companies (to their websites), and awards (their websites). I also hide the hyperlink (the underlined blue) so to not ruin the design.

Due to class this semester I was only working 8 hours a week. It wasn’t until March 23rd that I was told not to come in due to the lack of work. Understandable. At the end of it, I personally wanted to quit and move on to a graphic design position at an advertising agency. I never wanted to go down like this on these terms (uncontrollable situation, I know).

I filed for unemployment recently due to my busy schedule and have been getting money that way. I texted one of my coworkers who is one of the higher-ups I guess you could say and engages in what is called a manager’s meeting. Thursday I had asked when there is an expected due date for return. He said the following:


“We have no date in mind.  There just is not enough work. I would try to find something else.”

With that being said, I said thank you for the update. I haven’t given it much thought up until now. I plan on talking to my other coworker to see if I can get some other insight but it’s late so it’ll be pushed till some time tomorrow possibly. She is still working as a digital press operator except she is full time/has kids/etc. So I can understand why she still has her job but I don’t technically.

Hey guys! So ever since I graduated college, I've wanted to move to a state that has plenty of nature, cooler climate, and outdoor activities. I am big into hiking, climbing and all that jazz. Living out here in Houston, I feel like I get none of that. So for the past 4 years, I have been working really hard in my current company (i work in finance). I have pretty much mastered SQL and a bunch of other analytic tools that seem to make me standout in my field. I took a stab at applying to a few companies out of state and it seems to be working. I have been getting interviews and even got to 3rd round with one company before turning it down due to salary (salary not being on par with the cost of living in that city). So that got me thinking, would this be a good time to relocate? I am pretty comfortable in my current role and I love my co-workers. I make a decent amount and I am living comfortably. However, I don't see myself long term in this company and I have lived in Houston most of my life. I am kind of tired of driving down same street I grew up on and honestly, I just want change. But in current climate, I still haven't found a company I really want to work for, in a state I want. It's probably due to COVID forcing companies to freeze hiring. Even then, would it be smart to relocate for a new company right now? There are talks of a second wave of Covid hitting in fall and with 2020 being already rocky; I am afraid that I might get furloughed once I relocate. So there is already an underlying risk on top of all the stuff that comes with a new company/relocation. What would be your opinion on this?

The job itself isn't overwhelmingly difficult, nor is it very fulfilling. Although it provides me with great financial security, other factors have been building up that have made me resent the job (I'm sure I'm among many in saying this).


The paving company idea came up with a life long friend who is a heavy machine operator and technician, who also shares the passion for wanting to build something of their own. My CPA background to this point is being viewed as a means to an end, and can give us the business/finance/tax benefit of pricing/costing/financing the business and assets we acquire.


Basically what I'm looking for is some starting points to acquire the hands on ability to pave and gain as much knowledge on the field that I can prior to starting the business. My initial considerations are as follows, along with some other important points to note:


1) Ideally structure my departure from work at end of Summer/18 and in a way so that I can receive unemployment


2) Take heavy machine operators course throughout the Winter/18


3) Work in the industry for a local paving company throughout the 2019 season to try and obtain as much hands on knowledge as I can


4) Come up with business model and acquire appropriate assets in offseason Winter 2019. Basic business to start will be paving/sealing/patching driveways, which would limit our initial capital outlay when compared to more commercial paving equipment/staffing requirements


5) From what I have read so far, the general machinery will consist of a single axel dump truck, 1-2 ton rolling machine, small paving machine (or could we get away with shovels/brooms to start), a hauling trailer and other miscellaneous tools i.e. tamper etc.


6) I have accessible capital of about $130,000. My life long friend also has sufficient capital to finance machinery/other start up costs


I know this is very rough, and obviously so much more consideration has to go into this plan. But at the end of the day, I want to do something outside for a living, I am prepared for gruelling work, and I want to build something for myself. I would appreciate any other advice with respect to the career path in general or how to best prepare/educate myself before starting the business.

Sounds like your friend already has the hands on knowledge, or he is at least the one who should gain the additional hands on skills. Your skill sets should be used to make the business run with a long-term profit. 

Start small and keep your job - or maybe find an accounting job that is part-time/flexible. Remember, depending on where you are operating the business, paving can only be completed in a specific temperature range. So, months that are too cold = no paycheck. 

Also, maybe look out for a small paving company with the proper equipment and trained employees that you can buy. Seek one that you can add value too, like advertising, better financing, and by seeking higher margin jobs. 

Lastly, not to be pessimistic, but we have been in a bull market for nearly a decade... the first thing to go in a recession is home building - where a lot of paving is done.  ",2018-06-15 01:41:28
210,h7poht,False,Discipline,2,Life With Company After PIP,jobs,"Note: I also posted this in AskHR but would love to hear other perspectives as well if anyone has gone through something similar. 

I'm located in Maryland; however, my company operates out of Washington DC. Some context but a general question at the bottom.

In late January of this year, I was placed on a 90-day PIP related to project timeliness and communication. At the time, I had been extremely sick for several weeks and had requested time off, which had been denied. I missed a deadline and a few days later was placed on the PIP. At the time, I was convinced it was a cover-their-butt, I'm getting fired move and started looking for new work - although I'd never had a performance issue or negative appraisal in the past, my supervisor and I don't work well together (she's an extreme micromanager and I've tried talking to her about how I perform better when I have some flexibility in process, but this hasn't changed anything except me just needing to adapt. I'm also her only employee, so I have almost no autonomy in my work, which isn't the norm for my position in other departments).

But after 90 days (late April), I ended up passing my PIP and was formally removed from it, with the feedback that I excelled at the goals set and to continue the good work. This was a huge relief - since COVID hit, I hadn't had any luck finding other opportunities.

In late May, our company advertised they were looking to fill about 10 positions from internal applicants for a new department - some would be a promotion, others would be lateral transfers. I've worked well with the hiring manager on other projects in the past and my skills matched really well to what they were looking for, so I applied. The interview with her went well and I was brought in for another meeting about it this week. I was incredibly excited - I love my company but there's no room for growth in my department (my supervisor keeps pushing back her retirement), and I want to be able to stay and grow under a new supervisor so badly.

However, I was told that I wouldn't be transferred or promoted at the meeting. Our HR rep was there, which I thought was strange. The hiring manager asked if I wanted feedback on why I wasn't selected, and I told her yes - that's when the HR rep stated that due to my performance in my current role, it's unlikely that I would be approved any transfers for ""some time,"" and that internal promotions would be ""very unlikely at any point.""

I feel devastated. I understand their hesitancy - on paper, there's no context around what happened earlier this year. But the tone seemed to be that I would never have opportunities internally because of this. I'm curious what bearing successfully completed PIPs have on internal hiring decisions in general, and if I should resume my external job search? Thank you for your time and thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7poht/life_with_company_after_pip/,4,"In Ask HR, someone asked about the circumstances surrounding the illness. I'm more interested in the long-term impacts of the PIP at my current company, but if the info is relevant, here was my response:

I was scheduled to co-present at an international conference. Since mid-month, I'd had what I thought was a really bad cold at the time (I tested negative for the flu so my doctor attributed it to being a cold) and I told my supervisor that I wasn't sure if if was a good idea for me to travel. She told me I needed to ""deal with it"" and that not attending wasn't an option.

The deadline I missed was related to a non-exigent writing project that she assigned me the last day I was there. I fully intended on completing it between sessions, but ended up sleeping longer than expected while laying down to rest. The next day I told her I needed some additional time since I had little energy due to the cold, and she got extremely upset. A few days later the PIP was created.

I'll also add - my condition worsened while I was there, which I told her about as well, but she discouraged me from seeing a doctor and asked me to self-medicate since I needed to be present at each session of the 5-day event (she said something about not letting a cold be an excuse).

It wasn't until mid-March that I realized that I may have had covid-19, but at this point there's no reliable way to test that. ",2020-06-12 17:59:02

Situation:
I work as an engineer in a small development department, up until recently my manager has placed me in a leadership position with talk of increased responsibilities.  I have been running customer teleconferences, driving the largest and most complex project open and have rewritten and redesigned a vast majority of our internal documentation, and trained most of the other employees all within my own drive.

Recently an internal  position for a sub manager was opened.  I applied and didnt get it, which is fine.  Instead  the position was split into two positions, and all of my higher level responsibilities were given to one of the sub managers, including the project I have been driving for two years.  Both hires were from our own small department and had the same title I do. 

My manager has done nothing to create a transition period, given me any feedback of my efforts up to this point, or any reassurance that this isnt a titleless demotion. I just showed up to work and all my usual responsibilities were no longer mine. 

I'm pretty crestfallen.  Leading up to this event has felt like a steady push out of any responsibilities I try for.  I have had meeting requests get denied only to be invited by another employee to the same meeting at the call of my manager, ideas vehemently rejected only to be later dictated out by my manager as his own.  He has a favorite employee with substantially less experience than me that he spends every day talking to about everything in the department.  Even while I was running projects he would never check up on them or talk to me about them.  

TLDR:  
An internal restructure leaves me feeling shafted. How do I interpret these events? Am I just jealous? Am I being a baby about this? Or am I just a victim of shitty management.

I'm at a low point right now.

I have been a very fun-loving and life-affirmative person, but lately the job market does not make it easier to find motivation for cover letters.

I tailor every letter to the position, I research about the company and their values, I adress that and I double check it's the right person etc I am writing to. I went to a training for writing letters and she said I write really nicely (German is my native language). But after rejections and no answers (that is the most annoying part) I have zero confidence and motivation to write another cover letter for an institution that does not care how much effort I put into every application and doesn't even consider me as an applicannt. What should I do? Should I write heartless, standardized cover letters? 

I am applying for jobs that suit my profile (e.g. done internships in that area or wrote a thesis in that field etc), it matches my skills etc. So I don't get what their problem is?

I work for a fast food restaurant and our hours are all managed through an app we are invited to when hired.  The owners have a few stores so they have a big group message feature they supply updates in.  This includes things like new menu items, workplace policies, and in this case responses to the pandemic.

On March 23 we recurved what looked like a copy pasted message from one of the higher ups in the fast food chain. It stated starting on As of that day (3/23) employees will be receiving a 25% pay increase until further notice.  The owner of the store I worked at then sent a follow up message stating it would go into affect 2 days later (3/25) due to when I payroll reset.  

I noticed at first that nothing was changing, but just figured it was taking an extra cycle to come into affect.  I was paid again this morning and once again it didn’t seem to reflect this update.  I went into the app we use and added up the hours for the previous two weeks, the last pay period, and with tax the amount matched the amount I was paid.  That is, without the 25% “hazard pay”. It’s been over a month so I know that it should have come into affect by now.

I’m one of the newer employees, started just over two months ago, and one of the younger ones as well (18).  

I would think the issue isn’t only affecting me, but none have my coworkers have brought anything up or said anything either.

How can I take more ownership of my performance?,jobs,"I started a new job in a corporate office about 4 months ago and have been working in my field for 5-10 years (i.e., not a newbie). My first month here was spent training, and, afterward, the person who trained me has been on a sabbatical for the last 3 months (and will continue to be so for another 2 months), so I've basically been on my own since that time.

My team's work is pretty siloed, and each of us work on our own projects without much overlap. In other words, my teammates aren't very familiar with the technical details of what I work on, although there is some overlap with some of our more general job tasks that everybody on the team is responsible for. My boss says that if I have questions on my projects, they would be the most knowledgeable person to go to. 

Onto my problems. I am basically making mistakes in my work, and, so far, I've always been the last person to complete their work amongst my team, sometimes going a few hours over the deadlines. When I started this job, my boss said they are looking for someone who can work independently. I feel like I can work by myself, but it just takes a very long time for me to find the answers when I look independently. I can go to my boss and ask questions to make things go faster, but I feel like lots of my questions would be very basic things that would make my boss ask, ""The information's right there. Why are you asking me what to do?"" I can work independently, but it just takes me a long time to find the relevant information I need. I also don't want to keep bothering my boss with every, little question I have, and I feel like I have a lot.

I'm also naturally a slow learner and need some hand-holding with new tasks (whereas hand-holding seems to be frowned upon these days). There are still a lot of things I don't know about my projects, lots of what I feel are basic things, like how they work in general. I feel like this is because my trainer didn't have time to train me on everything before they left, and my boss often tells me to just look at previous examples to try and recreate what they did. This leaves lots of gaps in my understanding about my projects since, while I can recreate the work, I don't really understand what I'm doing.


I feel like my boss is now starting to lose confidence in me. They continue to accompany to meetings about my projects and has started leaving me reminders about my job tasks on my calendar. (When I started, my boss told me they don't want to be have to remind or keep track of his team's detailed tasks and wants them to take ownership of their own projects.)

My team had most recently completed our most critical time of the year, and I made my boss stay late at night since I was the last person to finish my work, whereas all my teammates had completed their tasks and left for the day hours before I finished my work. I was finally able to complete my projects a few hours after our deadline, whereas the rest of my team was able to meet theirs.

My work quality was also not good since I was rushing to complete my work, and, sure enough, the next day, another team pointed out errors in my work, ones that I've made before. Once I have a chance to review my work in more detail, I expect to find more errors. My boss did not seem upset at me when the other team pointed out my mistakes, but I think they were starting to get a little irritated.

2258,5m12y4,False,Startups,3,Pressured to sign contract extension (no benefits) instead of promised new contract. Need advice/opinion,jobs,"Hi,


this is a throwaway account due to the fact that my colleagues are heavily using reddit as well.


First of all: I hope this is the right space for this topic and additionally, I currently work in Sweden (originally, I'm from another country). So nevertheless, I still hope for some advice (probably not legal advice due to different laws and so on).


Short intro: I am working for a start-up as an Android developer and I just turned 27. This is not my first job and when I started, I was offered an one-year-contract. It's been a really rough but successful year not only for the company but also for myself. During a feedback meeting a couple of weeks ago (which was also regarding further steps for a new contract) I was overwhelmed by the positivity. My supervisor said that he asked several people in the start-up and continued that 'everybody is really happy to work with' me and 'feeling really confident about' me, and so on, you get the point. Bunch of positive stuff. Nothing negative. When we talked about further steps he said that he promised to give me 'without a doubt' a permanent contract and a raise. (This was actually already mentioned 2 months before that meeting).


(Fyi, in our start-up everybody knows about the salaries of the others and I figured out that I am the lowest payed employee in the engineering part... the next person above me receives around 20,000 USD/year more than me). Of course I should be happy that I have a job and so on. But actually, I don't really earn a lot. I still live in a shared flat and try to save money wherever I can. I actually live like back in university.


Back to the topic: Days after the feedback meeting, my supervisor informed me that plans have changed, also due to the finance department and HR: 
- contract extension for another year 
- same salary 
- no benefits, no bonus, nada, nothing. (Well, apparently it's easier to fire me I figured out while I was reading the info regarding the contract extension.)


I was actually quite shocked and still am. My supervisor then promised me, after I received the contract extension, that I will receive a permanent contract and a raise in a couple of months. Probably by the end of May.


I had a bunch of sleepless nights during the past couple of weeks. I love working for this start-up, I really like my colleagues (there is not a single one I dislike and I am being completely honest here) and I see potential in our product. But right now I don't know what to think. I actually planned this year to move out of the shared flat and find a nice place with my girlfriend, but this won't be possible under such conditions. Also it is quite hard to find a decent place to live at if you don't have a permanent working contract. (90% of the landlords in this area will always take people with a permanent work contract - makes of course sense).


I gave everything during the last year for this start-up. So much stress, unpayed overtime, unpayed work time during weekends, 'work hard & don't party' and also put my health at risk at one point. I feel disappointed in the start-up and partially in my supervisor, because he promised things that he obviously can't keep. And now I feel unsure about accepting the contract extension and wait for a couple of months until I get the, again promised, permanent contract with the raise.
By the way, my contract ends by the end of February, until then I have time to sign the contract extension.


Does anyone of you had similar experience? And if so, how did you handle it or in general, how would you move forward in such a situation?


Thanks so much in advance.


(I hope nobody gets me wrong here, I am really happy to have a steady income. I just have the feeling that my work is not being appreciated, even though there has only been positive feedback).


TL;DR: Supervisor promised 'awesome' contract several times, just made another promise that I will get that 'awesome' contract in a couple of months, instead I get another contract without a raise for a year, feeling 'utilized', not quite sure how to continue.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5m12y4/pressured_to_sign_contract_extension_no_benefits/,1,"Well, you have to decide. 

You can call their bluff and say you'll only work for X and be willing to walk away. If they say they are going to give you a raise/new benefit in a couple of months then make them put that in writing.

687,f012z7,False,Unemployment,3,Current job said they will fire me if I don’t improve.,jobs,"Okay, this situation is a little complicated.

TLDR: I’m about to get fired but it seems like a pretty amicable situation and my manger even promised a good review. I could likely collect unemployment. I have interviews lined up and need time off for that but there is no way I could get time approved. Can I just call in sick or will this hurt chances of unemployment / strain the remaining relationship I have with my current job?

————

My current job said they will terminate my employment if I do not improve by February 20th. I am trying my hardest because I always try not to burn bridges, but honestly this is kind of a blessing. I genuinely hate this job, and have already been searching elsewhere for new employment. 

Even if I do improve to their standards by the 20th, they then would want me to come in office which is simply not feasible as I live too far away (I work from home currently). So no matter what this current job is pretty much out the window. I would just leave on my own, but I can’t afford to lose my job without unemployment or another job lined up.

That being said, I have secured quite a few interviews for next week - unfortunately, the interviews are during when I’m supposed to be working my current job. My current job offers no PTO at all and any approved unpaid time off must be scheduled several **months** in advance. 

My main question is: **If I have to take 2 “sick days” in a row for these interviews, will my chances of unemployment be hurt?** I’m not sure what do. I obviously want to attend the interviews no matter what since losing this job is pretty much inevitable and I need to prepare, but I also don’t want to screw up my ability to collect unemployment if the interviews don’t work out. I know if people are obnoxiously late all the time or call in sick too often it can sometimes be considered termination for cause. I have 100% attendance besides this. Is 2 days enough of a cause? The speed of my performance is the reason they are wanting to let me go, but it was nothing that would make me seem completely negligent, just “not a good fit” for the role. I finish at about 80-85% of the speed they’re expecting from me. I don’t think my performance issues count as a cause by themselves. The can fire me for any reason as this is an at-will state, I’m just talking about “causes” in terms of unemployment. 

I’m also scared of going the route of telling my boss that I have interviews lined up and need time off for that. Getting fired is pretty much a guarantee so that isn’t the concern, it’s just that her and I still have a decent connection separate from my performance and she did previously agree to write a good review and a letter of recommendation for any future endeavors. I would hate to burn that too by just bailing, could even hurt my ability to get the jobs I’m interviewing for lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️

I love my workplace but I think they don’t realize my full potential because they know me more as the quiet deaf girl.  

Thing is, I owned my own graphic design business for five years and was really successful in my market.  Managed to get on the first page of google organic search results for my keywords.  I got burnt out with that and sold it after I met my husband.  We’re separated now.  In that ten years I had SSDI approved because of the deafness.  In that ten years I’ve also had a few other diagnosis and was pretty sick, had brain surgery, blah blah.  In any case, I was lucky the place hired me because I needed the work and I can handle the physical aspect for the most part.  They could only give me part time because the day bartender needs to be able to answer the phone.  I can do that now, with specialized equipment.  They’re willing to purchase it.  I don’t really want to work full time there because it’s really boring during the day, pay is tip share and fluctuates so much it’s hard to budget.

In January I reduced my hours for an opportunity to work at home again,  but it didn’t work out.  Boss ghosted me and I haven’t been paid for my work in April, so I’m back at bar with as many hours as they will give me.

Prior to my design business, I worked as an AlohaPOS software (table service and quick service restaurant software) support manager and project manager for five years.  I did pretty much everything including hardware repair, staging, training, installation, network wiring, remote and on site support.  I also trained on the same software for a large corporate rollout.  I set up a company wide oracle CRM which improved our customer service and response/resolution times.

I’ve been looking for Aloha jobs specifically on Indeed and LinkedIn.  Problem is it’s been ten years since I’ve worked with it.  I am also self taught with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, illustrator, Bridge.  

I don’t have a degree, but have about 6 semesters of college credits.  Ideally I’d like a full time job but my resume is really specific.  I’m not sure the best way to go about wording it and I don’t want to sell myself as a general project manager when my projects were purely Aloha based.  

The rest of my experience is in the Restaurant industry as fine dining server, Bartender.  It was the first thing I turned back to when I needed work.  I was lucky they had a place for me considering I couldn’t hear a damn thing.  Now that I can, I’m more confident, etc.

I’ve tried working with Vocational rehab but have gotten no where with them.  I think they’re understaffed so my counselor is serving a very large deaf community in the coastal Virginia area.

1388,1t44tn,False,[advice],6,"Quit job with no backup plan, landed job in less than 3 months - Here's what worked for me",jobs,"(throwaway because there might be identifying stuff on my other account)

I'm a writer in my mid-20s who got involved with a content mill. I've only been out of college for a couple years and this was my first grown-up job. It turned out to be a really toxic environment.

I burnt out in less than a year. I made a big decision to take a leap of faith and quit with nothing lined up, because I knew I didn't have the time or energy at that job to look for new work. I had about 6 months of money saved.

That was only 2.5 months ago. I just got a new professional, full-time job in my field that I actually wanted, with a salary and benefits I'm THRILLED about. 

I know part of the equation is luck, but I wanted to share some thoughts on what I think helped the process be (relatively) quick and easy. Hopefully it will help some of you.

- I DIDN'T apply to every job listing I saw in my field. **Over 2.5 months, I applied to maybe 30 jobs at the most, probably fewer**. Most people go for quantity of applications, but I focused on finding listings that I *really* thought fit my skills and experience and that I had a good chance at. 

- **Every single cover letter I sent was customized**. I started from scratch with each one. Previously, I had used a cover letter that was a form letter, more or less, just inserting the company's name and the position title where appropriate. This method is one reason I didn't send a lot of applications: each one took me a fair amount of time to put together. I would write them with the job description at my side so that I could hit the different points in the ad.

- I do have a relatively strong resume (internship experience, freelancing experience, brief stint in marketing aka the content mill), but **I emphasized qualities that you don't necessarily get from jobs or education**. I focused on the fact that I am a reliable and organized person with strong communication skills, and this was what seemed to resonate with most of the people that called me back, not that fact that I worked at such-and-such place.

- Cover letters had very little to do with my resume. The only references to my resume were contextual - more like, ""I happened to be here when I showed this quality off especially well.""

- In the case of the job I got, **I wrote the reasons I wanted to work at the particular job** (it's an area of interest, I admire [specific thing they do], etc.). Manager seemed impressed and brought it up at the interview.

- **I woke up at 8 every day, but I didn't always work an 8-hour day**. Some days I did job search stuff all day, but others I didn't because there just weren't enough positions I found that I wanted to apply to.  On those days, I worked on freelancing or sending emails to people I'd be interested in working with someday. I went to coffee with mentors, visited friends, worked on getting my life back (I had been really depressed working at the other job). Sometimes I watched puppy videos, because sometimes you just need to veg.

- During the interview at my new job especially, I made a point of making eye contact, smiling and being relaxed. I laughed. I made a couple jokes. I wanted to be at my most personable and make a connection.

- **When addressing why I quit a job after less than a year with no backup** I didn't give any real details. You don't have to, and I clearly blew one interview earlier in this stint of unemployment by letting myself talk too much (it was a PR job and I accidentally, in my rambling, said something about wanting to get away from marketing. The fields are similar. Whoops). I said I wanted to move on to pursue new opportunities, such as something in [area of media this job is in].

- I made sure to give all my references a heads-up, and to choose them carefully. After I was hired, the director told me she was ""floored"" by the references I received. **Make connections with people who will really go to bat for you, and then stay in touch with those people**. I'm sending them all ""thank you"" cards.

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. **If I hadn't stayed in touch and on good terms with my references, I might not have this job. I really felt like the references clinched it for me**. Get coffee with your old professors. Have lunch with your boss. Message your former classmates on Facebook who are in your field and check up on them. People will help you if you reach out.

----

I know this was long, and some of it might seem a bit obvious, but it wasn't all obvious to me the first times I applied for jobs. I was really scared that quitting my other job would doom me to a very lengthy job search, but I ended up feeling completely refreshed and finding a job I actually want to do. I also believe that in my mental state while working at the content mill, I wouldn't have given a very strong interview or had time to write more tailored cover letters.

I hope everyone's job search goes well and that maybe this post will help someone just a little.

For the record, I know quitting a job with no fallback plan is not for everyone and isn't technically a wise decision, but it ended up being the best thing for me in my case.

Basically, we built a front end in excel that is coloured up in company colours, and all the buttons on the GUI are hyperlinked to locations in a file directory. Within each linked file are 3-4 resources. 

1. the training module (i.e. excel sheet with data, explanation on what methodology is used to process that data, and calculation checks)

2. a tutorial video (I used OBS studio - it's free and seems to work well)

3. a notepad file that you add your initials to to check off that you've done it and also checked for errors (essentially acting as like a wiki of sorts)

4. any other relevant content

So, we've built this index, and now we're filling it up with content.

We're also going to record presentations from industry leaders and stuff like that to help pass on knowledge from company and industry veterans.

The idea is we're trying to make records of stuff that is known, and knowledge that has taken years to accumulate, then put it in an easily accessible structure, complete with full walkthroughs on how to actually *do* it.

So, we have, for example, field studies, tests, which generate data, so our breakdown (so far) is something like this:

* geotechnical -> subdirectory: analytics/field work/calculations
  


*geochemical -> lab testing/static/kinetic/field testing

*hydrogeology -> field tests/data handling/GW modelling

Etc. so each sub-directory has a new list, and you just keep drilling down until you find what you're looking for.

Hope that helps - eventually we'll replace the excel/VBA GUI with an actual app. ",2019-02-05 16:49:47

1013,ha4hjc,False,Covid-19,3,Turning down interviews in the time of Covid-19.,jobs,"I lost my previous position because of Covid-19. I'm 1.5 weeks into my job search and I have three interviews thus far out of 36 applications. 

After an HR interview, I determined it's a bad fit. The work isn't interesting, I'd be forced to be at the office for weird hours to try to sync with the Pacific Time Zone despite being in Eastern, and I'd be in an office for no reason since I would not be interacting with anyone there (I asked).

I'm scared to turn it down because well....Covid-19 is making UX jobs harder to get and I'm scared for the second wave making things worse. I plan on working wherever my next role is for two years, which would mean that the recession is likely over, I have enough experience for most UX jobs (4 years plus a master's is enough to get most senior roles), and I could go anywhere I want. 

I am fully aware I might have to suffer for two years, particularly in a location I don't want to be in or a job with boring work. 

My finances are fine; I am moving back with parents and unemployment covers my monthly bills. I am not drawing unemployment yet and the mandate that you have to take the first job offered does not begin until July 31st unless a new bill is passed.

Would I be stupid to turn down interviews based on HR interviews during this time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ha4hjc/turning_down_interviews_in_the_time_of_covid19/,1,"I would suggest taking the interview.  This will give you practice in a ""live"" setting.  Plus this will help get in the grove of answer the common interview questions that you are likely to receive.  Congrats, you made it past round 1.  

Check out my post on common questions during various stages:   [My Experience From Job Hunting](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/) 

A couple of other thoughts that I had:

* You can always take the job, and keep looking for a new place while employed (getting paid and health insurance benefits)
* I know absolutely nothing about UX jobs, but you said they are getting harder to get.  Why pass on an opportunity that has been presented to you?  
* Is it just the hours that is making you not want the job, not interacting with anyone in the office or is it something else?
   * If its just the hours, again not knowing your personal situation, I would not view this as an obstacle.
   * Is it not interacting with anyone in the office:
      * do you want to be in a office talking / working with others?
      * Is it the commute?
      * Is it concerns about the corona virus?
* Is it pay / salary?
   * again, tricky one with high unemployment.  You can always take it, and keep looking for a new gig.  You can explain that you are looking for a new place since it is a shorter commute, better benefits, etc...
* Did you pick up on a possible toxic work environment? Unrealistic workload / time deadlines, etc?
   * This is the trickiest one.  I always advise people to avoid a toxic work environment as it will demotivate you, which then typically leads to the quality of your work slipping.  Not to mention the anguish this can cause mentally on you at work and at home.
      * Just during the time we are in with unemployment around 20%, this makes it harder to just give a blanked statement of pass on this job since its toxic.

I would take the interview.  I would personally during this time, accept the job since you can always keep looking.  You can always explain an extremely short duration at a job by saying:

* Once I got into the position, I realized that the opportunity was not going to be a good fit for me.  The daily responsibilities and hours were different from what I was told that I would be doing during my interview.  The working environment and culture were completely different than what was presented to me during the interview.  I would like to leave it at that to be polite.
   * remember, don't bad mouth a past employer to a future employer.  This response will typically cease all inquiries from HR recruiters since they do not want to push you into bad mouthing an employee or getting into a potential grey area.
   * be prepared though after this response to talk about the hours and culture that you would work best in or are looking to work in

Again, I don't know your personal situation, but I would point out that the Federal Unemployment of $600 ends at the end of July unless it gets extended. ",2020-06-16 13:57:01

PowerPoint slides that they told me the are confidential and that I shouldn’t share them with anyone. I just started at the company, and I’m in an entry level position. 

A few weeks ago, things were very hectic at work and we got a last minute call from the CEO to change the meeting rooms for a planned meeting they would would be presenting at, using the PowerPoint slides they sent me.

The VP of a department at our organisation asked if I could send him the slides to add to the deck, which he (the VP) would also be presenting from his laptop (so I had to send the slides to him).

2486,4anux5,False,Experience,6,How I prepared for my first phone interview,jobs,"Last week I had my first ever phone interview. Luckily, it was a scheduled interview, so I had a couple of days to get prepared and ask my friends about their experience. 


My former classmate, let's call her Julie, had her first phone interview about a month ago, it went well, she got to the next round which was the office interview, but didn't get the job due to lack of experience. (By the way, don't you just love this ""no job - no experience - no job"" vicious cycle?)


Julie told me she was prepared, read about the company, thought the possible questions through, so she was pretty much relaxed when the phone rang.


Now we know that the call went well, but **Julie made some mistakes**:


1) During the interview she was lying on a couch in her pajamas, that's why her voice was too relaxed and later during the office interview the employer said she didn't sound ""really motivated to get the job"".


2) She didn't turn off the Facebook notifications on her phone so during the talk she was distracted by the message sounds a couple times. Also someone tried to call her on Skype.


3) The other thing Julie regretted was that she didn't have all the needed documents handy. When the employer asked if she had any questions about the company, she remembered she had some, but had put aside her notebook and forgot what it was.


So **Julie helped me realize this**:

1) I better wear something formal and sit straight so that my voice sounds interested and serious, not demotivated.

2) I should eliminate all the distractions

3) My resume, my notes and company info should be somewhere near when I get the call.


Another friend of mine Mike said he got a call from a company when he was walking home. The interviewer asked if he was available to talk at that moment and he said 'yes'. Mike later regretted it because half way through the interview he got nervous and couldn't answer the questions properly. So his advice to me was **never agree to have an unscheduled phone interview**. Apologize, say that you're busy and schedule for later. That way you'll get an opportunity to prepare.


I had a couple other friends give me some tips. I've collected all of it here, in an [article](http://www.essaytigers.com/blog/getting-ready-your-first-phone-interview).

Background: I'm 24. I had ***11*** internships. I have an MA and I'm at my first fulltime job. Internships suck, companies are taking advantage of people, etc etc. But we (Gen Y) need to reflect a little on ourselves. This is the kind of thing that bothers me: One girl recently told *[The Week](http://theweek.com/article/index/242065/america-is-raising-a-generation-of-interns)*,  “You either do what you like to do for free or you have an entry-level job for $25,000 where you answer the phone and are someone's assistant.” This kind of attitude is a problem. Internships largely do not lead to a job. According to *[this study](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx),* 

> 63.1 percent of paid interns received at least one job offer. In comparison, only 37 percent of unpaid interns got an offer; that’s not much better than results for those with no internship—35.2 percent received at least one job offer.

As young people, we've been raised on the idea that if we try hard enough, we can do anything. We're tumbling into an internship spiral, and we can't afford it. 

Now our parents would say that we should just create our own businesses. And once again, that's a misunderstanding of our generation. Part of the reason why we go through so many internships is because *we desperately want to be accepted into existing institutions.* We're *scared to death* of entrepreneurship.  But here's the thing: Unless you want to get underpaid for a job you're overqualified for (there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm assuming that you're taking an internship in the hope of getting something better), or want another internship, that is your option.

An internship with the local government until just a week ago, and an internship with a private company that started this Monday. I've applied to hundreds of jobs in my city in Southern California.  Due to my wife's career, I've only been able to apply for jobs here. My internship hosts in the local government wanted to hire me but were unable to. I've gone to networking events, taken extra classes, and cold called several companies in addition to applications. Can anyone please offer advice?

2271,glsc2u,False,Training,13,Am I going to make it in the real world? I keep getting told I'm too slow wherever I go. I got fired from my last job.,jobs,"I'm currently almost 24 years old, and in my senior year of college. I am studying to become a Forensic Biologist. However, it seems that I am slower than the average person during both work and school. I get extended time on tests, because of my Asperger syndrome, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Without it, I'd fail college.

I got my first job when I was 16 washing dishes (2012). On my first day, I felt excruciating back pain. The pain was so intense, that it slowed me down tremendously, and it caused me to get agitated. Because my Autism was more debilitating back then, I wasn't able to properly communicate exactly how much pain I was in. I got a call from my boss telling me not to come back again. I did not attempt to convince him otherwise.

At my second job at Mcdonald's (early 2014-2016), I was initially too slow. When I got assigned breakfast duties for the first time, I initially got sent home twice for being too slow (they told me it was because of high labor). I suspected there was something wrong, and talked to the managers. I eventually did pick up the pace, and I worked there for 2 years. I had to quit, because my mental health got out of control.

At my second job, as a busser a nursing home (2017-2019), I almost got fired, because I got worked up very easily. This is because I was paranoid from my near-firing at Mcdonald's. Two months later, I decided that I wasn't going to care about my work speed. I ended up becoming a very valuable employee. I worked there for 18 months. I left, because I graduated Community College.

I got a job at KFC last summer, but I quit after only 25 days. It was horrifically understaffed, and I was insecure about my speed again. The manager was also a toxic person who didn't know how to run a business. The other employees were also very unprofessional.

Last December, I got a job as a cashier at Speedway. During the summer I had been put on Immediate Release Seroquel to help me sleep. However, all it did was make groggy during the day. I warned my boss on the first day that if I was too tired, I could get off the medicine. I was fired after two days, because my grogginess made me take too long to complete the computer assessments. When she made the decision to fire me, I had not yet interacted with a single customer. She also gave me no hint whatsoever that there was anything wrong with my performance.

This semester, I got reprimanded for taking too long to complete a lab in Organic Chemistry.

QA - Software Quality Assurance

So I am an IT person with 2.5 years of IT support work experience. I pursued a career shift to QA because I wanted that ever since before graduating from college. After six months of being jobless and countless interviews, I finally landed on a junior QA role. I was so happy about landing this job...

...until the training session began.

Basically, the purpose and goal of the training is to learn about three company-specific tools, and the endgame was to develop a working system using these tools. I was motivated at first, until the trainer began to inform us that if we fail the training, they'll have to ""let us go"" (it wasn't his intent to scare us in the first place though).

When I heard that, my motivation...became fear. So I had to learn them all by a bit of ""force."" (I was able to learn the use of these tools properly though)

Our training session only has two weeks overall, I am currently at the last week of my training, and we are now developing the system on our own hands. Most programming languages used in these tools aren't thoroughly discussed, and we had to use Google to even begin studying for it. In the first place, developing a system from scratch wasn't my forte, so I experienced so many difficulties coming from here and there, to the point that I am beginning to feel shy asking questions to my teammates.

Not to mention, the training session is still in the process of being improved. There were many VAGUE requirements and data dictionaries. We had to figure out the rest, according to our trainer. The two-week pressure was too much, and we had to resort to overtime just to finish one module from another (this OT is not paid and is not approved as an offset). Heck, we even had to sacrifice our weekends just for this.

The final day of my training will be next week, and I am already anticipating the results. I am particularly slow in developing a system, and I felt like I will fail the training.

Fast forward if I fail the training: I was thinking that I will need to put that company in my resume because they had my government numbers for taxation purposes (in our country, almost all companies required our government numbers). I cannot lie in my resume because it will just make situations worse when applying for other companies. 

So I was thinking: Am I complaining too much? I tried my very best, but everything becomes overwhelming for me. I would feel ashamed of myself if I only lasted in a company for less than a month and got fired because I failed in training.

Again, I would appreciate any advice, suggestion, or insight. I will try my best to respond to your post.

""you're supposed to follow him and help"" ""This is the easiest way to piss me off, by standing around not doing nothing."" Then about 15 minutes later we started stocking the eggs and the supervisor walked up and told me to take my lunch break early but the way he said was, to me like he was relieving my more experienced co-worker of me helping/learning how to stock eggs. So I thought the standing around situation was a little uncalled for so I came back from break early to talk to HR about the situation because I thought that was a little harsh for someone on their first day. I didn't do these mistakes by choice.

TL:DR first day of work, went to HR because I felt like supervisor was being too harsh.

Once the supervisor finds out about this, it won't be any surprise that they are suddenly going to be critical of your every single move.

First-generation college student here, and I'm lost as heck.

I started college off as a Computer Science major at UC Irvine; I applied to the major since I've always been mathematically inclined and had messed with Code Academy but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, nor had I ever taken any CS classes. It kicked my a— my 1st year of college, and I had never felt worse: I only passed the first introductory course and failed the next class. I coasted until my Junior year by taking GE classes and not focusing on any upper divs.

Fast forward, my counselor decided it was best for me to switch into Sociology if I still wanted to graduate with a different major on time. Me being me, I followed her advice since I figured she would know more than me.

Now as a senior in college, the sociology classes that I am taking are okay—they're interesting—but I don't know what type of job I could get out of college? I haven't considered graduate school for Sociology because I'm not too fond of the major.

As I stated, I love math, but after coming to college, I feel like I am not as smart as I thought I was in high school. I was thinking about switching into Business Economics since I've taken a good amount of Econ courses which I enjoyed, and I've passed all of the math classes required for the major already.

Given that, I would have to stay a 5th year in college to get my BA degree in Business Economics. Is it worth staying if my 5th year is covered by FAFSA? Could I get a business job with a Sociology degree?

So I recently accepted a new job at a major hospital. Very excited. The job itself is business casual and you can also wear scrubs (Seems like it's something they're testing new). My interview I even dressed business casual. (grey top with a black cardigan, black slacks, black flats)

So I just re-read my orientation instructions for TOMORROW and it's says the dress is business professional. So I'm kind of freaking out.

Both my mom and my boyfriend are saying it shouldn't be a big deal to wear a solid colored blouse with slacks and shoes. And the term ""business professional"" for women is different then what it says on the internet. But when I look up on the internet, it says basically a suit for a woman or a dress, which neither I own. I have black slacks and the shoes. I just need a suitable suit jacket and  white top.

So it also says that scrubs are acceptable but I want to make a good impression and feel I shouldn't go this route because:

1792,fqgkz1,False,Recruiters,7,I want to renegotiate my hourly pay with a recruiter a month into my new job,jobs,"I have been actively looking for a job a month ago. I was presented with a couple of offers, but I had an interview that I enjoyed that was set up via a recruiting agency.

After my interview, I was talking to my recruiter for 1-2 weeks trying to speed up the process. I got other offers and I told him about them and hoped that he would speed the process up for me to make it easier for me to make a decision. One of the offers was for $36/hr but it required me to relocate, which I preferred not to do at the moment (I did not tell him that I would have to relocate but told him about the pay)

He said that his job pays 36$ as well and that I should just wait a couple of more days.

I then received another offer, for $38, and told him about it. However, I told him that I am still interested in his position because once again, I enjoyed the interview and could see myself as a good fit.

The recruiter ghosted me for a week. Stopped answering phone calls, texts. I had given up.

Eventually, he picked up the phone after a week. He told me someone else had filled that position. I contacted the company that I would work for through the recruiting agency DIRECTLY and the people there told me that they would have been excited to work with me, but they were told that I had already accepted another job offer. 

Two days later. on a Friday, the recruiter called me and told me that I could still get the job if I wanted to. I had other offers on the table but told him that I could still be interested. I told him that I'm willing to entertain a potential offer.

The recruiter told me there was a catch - I would have to accept it that Friday night and show up to work on Monday - which was actually an insane condition. However, I needed a job and needed it fast. I said ""Okay, I'll work with you""

The offer came in at $31. I told him that I was expecting him to keep his word and offer me the $36, but he used the typical recruiter excuse ""It came in lower than I expected"". I know they are getting a huge chunk of what the company is paying for me.

Anyways, I'm a month in and have done an excellent job so far. However, I'm still wanted by other companies - and here's a thing that I saw as a red flag: Even though there is an ongoing pandemic, the company refused to let me work from home even though my job is technical and can be performed remotely. 

I feel like I have nothing to lose and I also feel like I'm terribly underpaid for the tasks that I'm doing.

Can I give my recruiter an ultimatum of keeping his original promise and renegotiating my pay or else I'd be moving on to other prospects?

I would have nothing to lose if I went to a new job. However, the recruiting agency would lose money by losing me, so I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

I want to ask for the original $36 that I was promised. Or else.

A few weeks ago I was laid off due to the current pandemic and have decided to use my free time for things that are more productive. I was thinking of maybe starting towards my CompTIA certifications, beginning with the Core 3 of A+, Network+ and Security+. 

Would not mind getting into PenTesting later on down the road, but my question is, if I were to put the time to study for the A+ test first (and then work my way up), would the certification increase my chances of getting better pay?

376,b2egvj,False,Discipline,2,Call center / service desk employees -- how leveraged do you feel is 'over-leveraged'?,jobs,"I work at a large corporation that provides great benefits and decent pay (for my locale anyhow).

Originally, I was hired on to work on their internal IT helpdesk.  While it was still crappy call-center-esque phone and email support, I still enjoyed the work because I got to talk to a lot of people, troubleshoot issues, and had a lot of autonomy to work on solutions to problems.

Over the past couple of years, though, the department has really gone down hill and has started implementing some really miserable policies (strictly scheduled lunches and breaks, metrics, 60 second wrap-up time, etc).  But we also started taking on many new external contracts -- and many of these contracts each have their very own SOP.  Some clients, besides having their own SOP, have multiple projects under them, and each project may even be handled different.  They are also all *white label*, and many of them are angry assholes (unlike internal employees).

An example would be that one client requires that we open a ticket in one ticketing system, while another requires us to use another ticketing system, except we close that ticket and then send an email.  Another might require us to some combination of steps, while yet another has two completely different SOPs depending on the time of day.  In fact, multiple clients have their own operating hours, and none of them are standardized.  There is no training, either -- we just get an email from management going, ""Hey!  New THING is going live today!  Here's a KB article!""

I spend more time digging for KB articles in three different knowledgebase systems to check for proper 'procedure' than I do fixing an issue -- even when I already know what the problem is and how to technically fix it.  I am not even exaggerating here -- my average call handling time has gone from 2 minutes to over 14 minutes.  I literally spend 10+ minutes just figuring out how to route and document the call because I'm not allowed to do that post-call.

&#x200B;

I feel like we're getting over-leveraged, and I'm tempted to approach management about it and try to think of some solutions to suggest.  But I'm also wondering if I'm just being lazy or am not coping well with change -- is this normal in a call center environment?

I work in three different ticketing systems and have so many clients that I actually can't name them all -- I think it's around 25-30, many of which have between 2-6 sub-projects -- and I manage 15 different email boxes.  I can't always depend on ""whispers"", because many callers will dial into a generic IVR and mash '0' immediately and then just expect me to know who they are and what it is they are talking about.  We're also the ""roll over"" for other service desks.

&#x200B;

**The point:**  *So -- sanity check -- is this all really over-the-top or am I just getting too old for this shit?  Should I suggest trying to dedicate agents to different projects?*

1991,elhq90,False,Layoffs,6,Lost my first full-time office job yesterday and want some help,jobs,"Thankfully it was through no fault of my own (I hope?), they just couldn't afford to have me. The company was a startup in a way and while I knew that startups are notorious for not being able to continue the way they anticipate and that the position could be unstable, I didn't think it was going to be that soon. It's a bit of a bummer because I loved everything about this work and the people around me. I told everyone how much I loved everything about the company.

After being told this news, I went home and felt sorry for myself (only a few tears were shed!) and had dinner with my family as a consolation. But today I've filed for unemployment, made an outline of things to do while I have so much time on my hands (which includes a lot of time for applying for jobs) because I can't stand not having structure, and will be working on updating my resume.

Since I haven't been unemployed for the past 7 years, I'm almost at a loss of what to do. I'm a bit discouraged because I graduated from college 2 years ago with a BA in Social Science and stayed working at the daycare program while I've been searching for work up until September 2019. Before the daycare, I worked in retail for 4 years, the last year being a supervisor. Now I have a 2-month position for my only office job in marketing, a career that I want to pursue after having no direction to work towards. Just a few questions:

&#x200B;

1. How do I list the 2-month job on my resume? Should I even list it because it was such a short term position? If I do list it, how can I talk about it when it was a short amount of time?
2. Is there anything I should know about being unemployed? I know I need to keep busy, so I'm making sure that I'm continuing to take the online courses for marketing as I have been for the past several months so I can show that I serious about this, and the fact that I didn't go to school for this industry. And exercise for stress relief.
3. Should I just get another job as soon as I can, no matter what it is? I'm not talking about going back to part-time work, but another entry-level office job? I'm aware that I have bills/loans to pay, so that does add weight. I live at home now though.
4. I will also have no health insurance. I turn 26 next week. Happy birthday to me? What do I do about that?
5. If you don't have any answers to those questions, I'd still love to hear about anyone's past/current experience in any similar position!

Edited for formatting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/elhq90/lost_my_first_fulltime_office_job_yesterday_and/,3,"I would definitely put the position in your CV with no time-frame. I would explain what I did and how I did and I would explain to any prospective recruiters/employers that you were happy there and they were happy with you, however as it was a start-up they had to make some budget-cuts/layoffs. Be honest about it. Be enthusiastic about working in the field and if you are then you will definitely be hired. 

I wouldn't worry too much about courses, any popular high-demand ones I would take if I could but the normal online ones are normally no value. 

I wouldn't hurry. Think about your direction in life and what you want to accomplish for the next 10 years. Do you see yourself in retail or marketing? Do you see yourself in a different field. It is always easy to change a job, however building up is hard. You normally need years of experience for high-level positions so if you liked marketing and you want to do marketing in the future then you should try and get into marketing or a similar sounding role - PR for example. I know it will be though for a few weeks/months but stick it out and apply for any marketing jobs. It might be even worth getting a below market value with 1-2k per year but staying there for 1-2 years so you can build experience.

About the health insurance - are you in the US? If so then I can't help as I'm UK based. Ask maybe a friend or a relative that has experienced unemployment at some point. Surely you're not the only one ever to be layed off. 

5. I got layed off a position during my 8th month there. It was a bit sad but it was absolute hell to work for them. They killed my joy in work and it was a blessing in disguise. I now work for a letting agency (property sector), which is what I wanted to work as for a long time but was not really qualified to do so yet.

I am currently working on my AA degree right now, but have no concrete idea on my job opportunities after getting each of these degrees. I know I may be jumping the gun, but I am just curious on how useful these degrees will be. That being said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask you guys a few questions.

1. I heard it's hard to get a job with a Biotechnology degree, especially if you don't live in the right place. I live in Florida, how good are my chances of landing a job and how much should I expect to make?
2. With a BS in Biotech, what type of jobs would I have available to me? (Research, academia, etc.)
3. Considering I don't change my mind later on, what value would a Master's in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology have when it comes to me getting a job? Would it be at all useful compared to other grad degrees I could go for? (Bioengineering, bioinformatics, etc.)
4. Would I be limiting myself with this potential Masters since it is ***Animal*** Molecular and Cellular Biology or am I just overthinking it?
5. After getting these degrees, would job hunting be a lot easier for me or would it be just as much a struggle as with other bio-degrees?
6. What can I do to help better my chances of getting a job whenever I get either of these degrees?

I was really excited about working for a startup. It would be lots of work and it was a major leap after struggling to find a full time job. I’ve been there 7 months or so and over time I was seeing things I didn’t like but thought I’d tough it out.

Now, things are getting bad it feels like. We were just purchased by another company. The CEO and his wife, whom he works with, met with us individually. Not one big meeting, but meeting with employees alone. It was weird but tried not to think too much of it. Yet everything has slowed down. To the point that there is nothing to do. And the CEO does not like seeing his employees not working. He already has an attitude, is quicker to criticize than reward. Priorities shift on his whim. He once said to me “if I find that thing, I’m gonna be pissed. I’ll fucking kill you”. I tried not to read too much into it, but it was shocking. But he talks to everybody that way.

We also have not seen the people who bought us. They have not spoken too any of the employees or anything. Yet we know we will be moving locations. But we don’t know where.

That’s just some of the stuff. It always seemed like there were all these pieces, yet none of them were moving in the same direction. Now it just seems like we are in a sort of limbo and not being told anything. Especially since I just learned from a coworker our last two paychecks were paid out of the CEO’s pocket. Too anyone who has worked or owned a start up, is this sort of thing normal after a buy out? Is there always a strange period of silence or not knowing what’s going to happen?

1420,1fe21s,False,[advice],6,I got hired! Plus- my tips on filling out a memorable (min. wage job/retail) application!,jobs,"I was underemployed, working part-time retail at a clothing store at the mall.  I've been looking for a second job for months, and finally got hired!  I am now also a cake decorator at a local grocery store.  I had work experience working in a bakery but no cake decorating experience but applied anyway even though they were asking specifically for ""experienced cake decorators.""  I'm very excited!  Today I finished day two of training.

It's rough looking for minimum wage jobs.  It takes a lot of time.  It's a pain in the ass!  

**Here are some tips I have and things I've done that have helped me get (retail) jobs:**

* Keep applying!  Don't bank on one job.  Put in as many applications as you can.  

* Make a professional looking resume, and staple it on top of your application.  You can even make a cover letter, too if you'd like, but I never did.  (In some cases, I guess a cover letter might be over-kill for this type of job, but I don't know.)

**When you're ready to turn in your application:**

* Go to the store in person dressed very professionally.

* Smile and be nice to everyone you see.  Try to be confident.

* Ask for the manager.

* Shake his/her hand and introduce yourself.  Give him/her your resume + application.  ""Hello; how are you.  I'm so-and-so, I'm a student here/new in town.  I'm applying for the [whatever] position.""  Smile your face off (but not in a [scary way](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mag4auYoHa1qcja3b.jpg)).  
EDIT: If you're not applying for a specific position but are willing to do whatever job they give you, that can be a strength.  (Some people thinks it's a weakness because it makes you seem direction-less, but it's only a weakness if you let it be.  Realize that if you're open to any position, it can help the company out.  I mentioned that I'm willing to work in different departments, so if a cashier calls out, they can call me in to cover for them, which will help your employer out a lot.)  


**On the application:**

* Write as neatly as possible.  Seriously, take your time.  I have good hand-writing, but I really slow myself down on the applications to make sure everything's clearly legible and spelled correctly.  Use white-out if necessary.

* Of course, fill it out as completely as possible.  

* Sometimes the applications will have optional questions like ""What other skills or technical training do you have that could be relevant to this job?""  DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE CHEESY!  I don't have technical training, but on my application, I wrote ""Teamwork!""  It's cheesy, sure, but it's also true- in my past jobs I've had to work on teams, and I'm good at it.  You could also write hard-working, fast learner, determined, ambitious, or something along those lines.  If you fill out more info than necessary on the application, it shows that you really do want the job and are willing to put time and thought into your app.

* Also, on some apps, there will be a space with a question like ""Why do you want this job?"" or ""Why do you think you'd be good for this position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?"" or something like that.  Tell them!  They want to know that you want the job for more reasons than just ""I need money.""  If you like the products they sell or the atmosphere of the store, tell them that's a reason.  If you could be passionate about the position, tell them!  On my cake decorator application, I knew I was lacking the experience they wanted so in this section, I wrote a short paragraph something along the lines of: ""I loved my time working at [competitor] in the Bakery.  I liked the work, and it's given me relevant experience.  I wasn't a cake decorator; however, I had some experience baking/icing cupcakes/writing on cakes/blahblah, and I really want to be a cake decorator.  I may need some training, but I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  I'm reliable, and always show up on time.  Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.""  <- I think that answer is what got me the job.  When I came in for my interview, it wasn't really an interview.  We chatted casually for a bit, talked about what I'd done before in the bakery, and then she showed me the area, introduced me around, had me ice a cake, and then gave me my uniform!!  

* Be genuine.  Don't take my advice and say you're great at teamwork if you go into the interview and can't back up that claim with a story about how you once had to be a team player in some work scenario.  Just be honest, be yourself, and be willing to try new things.  

Well, I think that's about it.  I hope some of these tips help any of you looking for retail jobs.  These are tips I've acquired within the past two-to-three years of looking for work and working.  :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fe21s/i_got_hired_plus_my_tips_on_filling_out_a/,11,"To add another point to this excellent list: when you get to the ""personality"" questions, answer it so that it makes you look *good* (lie even if you have to).

For example, the question may ask: ""everyone knows someone who has stole something"".  Answer may range from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree.""  In this scenario, you might be inclined to answer somewhere in the middle: ""Agree.""  But that's the **wrong** answer!  For the sake of scoring an interview, you are an honest person who only associate with honest folks!

I'm pretty sure answering these kind of questions honestly resulted my application being sorted automatically by computer into the ""no"" pile many times.  While it may seem like I am encouraging lying, I am a strong believer that these kind of questions shouldn't even be asked on applications if the employers aren't expecting honest answers.

2151,bx3bbv,False,Startups,8,Given 2 Equally Awful Options at My Company,jobs,"**Edit**: I do have equity in this company. Forgot to include that.

To put it in perspective, I've been working with this company before it became an official LLC. I worked for free for almost 3 years to make this happen because I was passionate about the we were doing and I wanted to see this company succeed. I still do, but after what I was informed I'm actually shook right now.

I was originally brought on as remote full-time and eventually I'd have to move to their HQ (where the majority of the workers were.) Fair enough, I didn't get paid even close to what I should be making at the start but we were an early company and I believed in the vision, so I understood that my fiancee (girlfriend at the time) and I would have to move there eventually. My thought process was if I got a salary adjustment, my fiancee and I would discuss it more in depth and finally decide when the time would be right (which would primarily be with the salary adjustment since I live in a very expensive area currently, and saving up has almost been impossible.)

So the months go on and here I am at about 9 months as a full-time employee. I get informed last night that I have two options:

**1.)** Move there with a slight salary increase (a super small percentage of an even lower than entry-level salary given 6 years in my field), 12 months of guaranteed employment, and they'd give me a small amount for travel (less than $1,000.)

**2.)** Become a contractor and lose all my benefits (and eventually be pushed out when they found someone more local to them.)

I am absolutely devastated right now. The incentive for moving is not there, and even made worse that I have to pay an absurd amount for a lease break among other financial commitments coming up (we literally just signed for a wedding venue *yesterday*.) Since I couldn't save up a lot I would clearly be going into the red for this move, and as much as my fiancee is well-off financially and can help afford things, I can't place her into this financial burden with me. On top of this, she would have to find a new job there and disconnect from all of her friends and social activities she does. I feel ashamed

On the other hand, going contractor literally feels like I'm losing my job but in a ""nice corporate way."" I would have to get on my fiancee's health insurance through eloping early because I have a reoccurring medical condition and I *have* to have decent insurance for, less I pay an absurd out-of-pocket every year. Then finding a job around where I live would be insanely difficult because the market for my career here is abysmal. I worked too hard for this...

I'm at a loss. I talk to my CEO today in a few hours to hear more about it, but after busting my ass for almost 5 years working 60-80 hour weeks... I don't know. 

I have nothing to ask of anyone, so I suppose this is just a warning to people: a company doesn't give a fuck about you if it means saving them money.

I started work as a cashier three days ago. I was shown a thirty minute video for training then put straight on to the registers. We would have customers pick up online orders. We retrieve the items for them and hand them to the customers.

Well, there’s a receipt attached to the items ordered online. I didn’t think much of it. On my third day, I was scolded by my manager for almost letting a woman leave with the attached receipt. He told me to never let them leave with the receipt, and that by not having a manager scan the accompanying receipt, the customer never pays for it as the system only has the customer pay once it knows that they have left the store.

So I basically let hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise out of the store, without the customer paying. I was honest with my manager about it and let him know that this needs to be made clear to all of the new store associates.

Our senior project manager was largely MIA throughout the holidays and then announced he would not be returning for at least 3 mos if at all. This meant that outstanding projects were not being completed and could not be collected on so no income was coming in. After 10 days they let the three of us go.

341,bua96k,False,Discipline,3,"NEET, about to turn 28. Degree, but no real work experience or skills.",jobs,"This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 27-year-old guy, two months away from turning 28. I've been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. Truth be told, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

Are there any entry level jobs that are just looking for four-year degrees in any subject? Right now my big priority is to at least start working and then figure out what I want to do from that point on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bua96k/neet_about_to_turn_28_degree_but_no_real_work/,1,you should focus on an entry lvl job you want thats within reach bc i sense you lack direction in life. anything that interests you that sort ,2019-05-29 04:30:13

Mind you, what you're feeling is of course completely normal in this situation, and it's always going to be awkward if you're applying for a role where you work with the interviewers if it doesn't work out.

In terms of feedback, think of a few key moments in the interview you might want to get feedback on. Were there any particular questions you struggled with? What did the interviewers think of your responses to certain questions. Did you miss any opportunities to talk about X, for example? What did you answer well? Make a note of which responses were a hit or a miss. A lot of interview questions are the same so you'll probably end up answering a lot of the same stuff in your next interview.

I think it's also fair for you to ask what it was that put the other person ahead of you. Sometimes there's a legit reason, like maybe they have a bit more experience so would be easier to train, for example. It will be interesting to see what they say here. ",2020-05-30 03:52:41

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.

After that, begin your sales approaches to anybody in your network. You start part time and work yourself into a full time job.

Meaning, when you make more money teaching than you do in your current job, quit and go full time.  

Things to remember:  depending on where you live, you may collect state sales taxes, will need to file federal and state income taxes quarterly, will have to file for permits in your city, county, to work from home until you move out (check your hoa or lease to see if you can do this).  After you get your first check, you’ll need a corporate checking account (bring your papers with you when you do).  And you will need a way to take credit cards.

Lastly, a website with an your name @ websitename . Com email address is much more professional than some gmail email account.  So find a short, easy to remember name and register it.  Pay the $$$ for email capability.

In total, you’ll need about $5k or so to do this.

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was ""his favorite book"".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few ""standard"" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them ""I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y & Z.""

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that ""something would come through"" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.

1801,fb5elk,False,Recruiters,4,Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?,jobs,"Hi, hope I used the right flair. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So first off, I'm not very familiar with working with recruitment agencies so I'm not sure what the usual etiquette is. Omitting some details for confidentiality. **TLDR at the bottom**

&nbsp;

I had my resume and details uploaded to a job board for a while, and a few days ago, Agency A reached out to me and said I seemed to be a good fit for a job, X, at a large company. Note that I didn't apply for the position before Agency A reached out to me. Now this company is... definitely known nationwide, and they're very prominent in their field. 

&nbsp;

I was able to talk with Agency A a few days ago, about the position and other details. For where things are now, Agency A has forwarded my information to the hiring manager of the company, and are waiting to hear back. The next step, if the hiring manager approves, is an onsite interview. Overall Agency A seems to be larger and has been around longer, has more reviews, but seem to be based in a different state.

&nbsp;

But today around the afternoon, I got a call by Agency B... for a slightly different position, but at the same exact company and same location - **However**, at the time I applied, their listing didn't say the name of the company - they just said the location of the position. I applied to the position via Agency B *before* I first talked with Agency A on Wednesday. Agency B is smaller and newer, but unlike Agency A they're local to the general area they recruit for. 

&nbsp;

In my call with Agency B, **that's** when they told me ""The position's at (large company)"". I could've gleaned that from context clues in their listing but wasn't 100% sure. But TBH, I wasn't expecting to hear back from Agency B because I applied through them before and never heard back.

&nbsp;

I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping. The two positions are in the same department I think but not exactly the same, so I'm imagining that the recruiters would be talking with the same hiring manager, which after googling is not a good idea and the hiring manager would likely get confused about who is actually representing me. But since the company is so large, I'm wondering if that would make any difference vs. if it were a smaller company where the hiring manager for sure would be the same?

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure how to proceed with things... do I tell both agencies? Do I stick with one agency and drop the other? AhhHHh. I just don't want to accidentally end up burning bridges with anyone.

&nbsp;

**TLDR**:

-Agency A got to me first for the position at a large company by finding my resume through a job board

-I applied to Agency B *before* I talked with Agency A

-I wasn't aware at the time which company Agency B was recruiting for until they called me

-I got a call back from Agency B *after* I already talked with Agency A and got things rolling

-Agency A and Agency B are recruiting for the same exact company

-The positions are slightly different but chances are very high they're in the same department with the same hiring manager

-... What should I do now?

\- Your boss is busy worrying about their own work. 

\- Make your boss's life easier.

\- If you don't understand what is being asked of you, ask for clarification.

\- If you have an issue with someone, talk to that person first.  Don't complain to others. 

\- Every day, write down a list of the most important things you need to do - it may be 2 or three things.   At the end of the day, review the list.   If you're not sure what should be on the list, review with your manager. 

\- Never talk disrespectfully about your manager to anyone at work. People talk to each other. 

\- Never put in writing something you don't want others to read. 

\- Learn, learn learn.  Take every training opportunity to learn more about your job, company, industry. That is how to get ahead.

\- Be present.  You're paid to be there, do that. It's half the battle.

765,blec3k,False,Unemployment,33,unemployed 3 years after college (frustrations),jobs,"I graduated in December of 2015 with a B.S. in Architecture, and the job search just hasn't been in my favor since. In the mean time, I've been constantly volunteering my time with free labor places, and have been tirelessly trying to learn more marketable skills to put on my resume and have been searching and searching for any sort of job. Everybody I know, my colleagues and friends and now my partner, all have these fancy high-class good-paying jobs, and making good names and careers out of themselves, it seems, and I'm still living with my parents frantic, nervous, and unable to get a job STILL. I'm at my wits end right now, and I'm starting year four of unemployment and I honestly don't know what else to do right now except to just sit here and keep applying. 

I've been out of any sort of workforce for so long, I have no clue how to even break into the job market after a period of unemployment like this. I am clueless. Is there a chance to recover from a three-year gap of unemployment after graduating college? I'm not sure how much my volunteering counts, and I'm not a student anymore to qualify for these internships, but I'm actually taking some classes at a community college right now, and absolutely hate it, but I don't have much else to do right now.

Another problem is that I'm a little lost in terms of career, too, so I'm looking for anything and everything right now. I might be looking in the wrong places since all these jobs listed are for assistants, clerks, technicians... It seems there is not a fit for me anywhere, but perhaps living in a smaller city isn't working in my favor. When I do get the occasional interview, I can't help but to tense up and be really nervous. Interviews are simply not my strongest point.

Being out of the job market for so long, I have no idea where to get help (if I need it), or where to turn to. Submitting resumes to staffing services doesn't even help even though others I know have had success with those agencies. I spend my days staring at the computer hoping something will happen, and nothing really has. Creating and designing and trying to get more portfolio pieces (and doing art stuff I like to do) seems like a bit of wasted time because it doesn't seem to be productive to me in terms of job searching. I don't know what else I can do, and I don't want to settle for just a cashier job, honestly... part of me thinks that's the most I will ever do, and the other half of me thinks I deserve a good job, but I don't feel very deserving after these long years of sitting around unemployed (I know I have a shit attitude, but therapy is expensive and I don't want to do that to my budget again).

Besides the occasional temp job I have had, I've never held any sort of real and long-term job before... I've always been under the impression that I've needed some fancy office job or some sort of professional job that I've never been able to get, and that makes me frustrated because I don't want to waste my existing artistic skills, and want to design and not be holed up inside a cubicle all day... I think. I probably have a really distorted view because I lack such experience, and it's really embarrassing because I'll be thirty in a few years...

**APOLOGIES.** This has turned into a rant, but I've been having such trouble and this has really been getting to my head more and more and more and it makes me want to hide from the world and maybe give up after I spend my days job searching and crying all the time. It's really hard to keep your head up when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Advice is welcome, but I'll re-iterate a few of my questions:

How does one break into the job market after a large gap of unemployment?

How do you keep your spirits (and your self-esteem and confidence) up when all your efforts seem to not work?

What are some interviewing tips for someone with bad social anxiety/how do you get over the nervousness??

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat. 

&#x200B;

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy. 

&#x200B;

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.

I'm considering studying at a Canadian institution like BCIT in order to have better access to the local labor market (making contacts, BCIT job board, etc ). 

I would like to know if paying the price of a certificate (some 7500 CAD) from an institution like that is worth it from a job search standpoint, or if I'm just better off looking for a job in the traditional way (applying directly to companies, Zip recruiter, Linkedin, etc).

For example, here in Mexico, having access to the job boards and contacts (both faculty and students) of elite universities is a game changer when it comes to gettting a high paying job, while public job boards are basically useless and have awful job offers.

On the other hand, in Spain (where I went to university) I found university job boards to be a waste of time with usually poor job postings, and few contacts to be made (most of faculty are bureaucrats without private sector experience). In Spain you're better off applying directly to companies or using public job boards.

The career field you want to enter is called ""student affairs."" In addition to admissions, it comprises all student services: housing, counseling, conduct, Greek life, and so on.

Virtually all jobs in student affairs are master's-required. If you want to have a chance, you will need to get a specific student affairs master's degree. Unfortunately, your food science master's degree will not help you one bit in this field.

Luckily, most master's programs in student affairs will accept students from any background - as long as you can articulate on your application that you are passionate about helping college students, you'll be golden. People who work in higher ed come from all kinds of backgrounds. It's an extemely diverse field, and prides itself on being so diverse.

A few warnings: it's a very competitive field. You'll probably spend a few years while in grad school overworked and underpaid as an ""intern"" (even though your responsibilities and hours will be comparable to a professional), and then still might to struggle to get a job after all the effort. 

In addition, I hope you aren't attached to where you live, because it will be expected that you do a national job search after graduating. If you are selective about which colleges you apply to for full-time work, you will just be holding yourself back. Take whatever you can get, anywhere in the country. Some people end up working at the same college where they got their master's, or in the same area, or at the college in the next town over - but many people do not - so be open to traveling. Furthermore, promotions are rare, so once you have learned all you need to from a job, be ready to move across the country yet again to take on a higher-level position.

If that kind of workload, and those warnings, don't bother you, then absolutely go for it.

And if you want to know more, go to your current school's career services office and make an appointment. I can almost guarantee you that every career counselor went through a student affairs master's program, and they can tell you what the career field is like.

One last thing: the student affairs field is made up of so many people that you'll really have to come to your own conclusions. I'm trying to be a realist here, but some people will say it's only positive and fun, some will say you don't actually need a master's, and some people are extremely toxic. Everyone who works in student affairs has a different perspective about it. 

Sorry not sorry for the long answer. Consider yourself informed.

Sincerely,
Someone who had worked in student affairs for 6 years, in 3 states, at 4 colleges. ",2020-03-23 19:18:35

Recently he got sick again. With no vacation time left and no sick time left either, I put in, with my boss' in-writing blessing' 40 hours but told him I would have to take some vacation time initially to cover my ass. 

We had a meeting discussing his future and decided on a modified schedule until he gets back on his feet. I told him about what I was going to do as my hands are tied and it isn't my money...He seemed fine with it as he left.

He later threw it back in my face via email that I am exacerbating the situation, making life stressful and hellish for him and now he says he'll go on disability and doesn't know if/when he'll be back.

From a quick phone conversation with my boss regarding this, I also found out he'd been making comments about me to my superiors. Nothing egregious, but enough that they had to take notice and were monitoring the situation. Of course this whole situation skews them towards my side, thankfully.

First time poster, but I thought I’d ask around a couple subreddits to get the a wider perspective of a major life decision I’ve been heming and hawing about for half a decade: Is a Masters degree going to help me find a job? 

 So here’s  my perspective. I graduated in 2013 with a BS in Biology and since then I’ve been working as a lab tech and worked my way up to a team lead position (basically pays the same and have the same work, but I also cover some of the more basic coordinating stuff and sometimes attend as a department rep when my boss is out). A couple years ago I wanted a new job and I COULD NOT GET INTERVIEWS. I applied, and applied, and applied but I just wasn’t getting calls. I’m not sure if my resume was awful or just didn’t meet the job experience expectations.  So, I figure if I can’t update my resume if I can’t get a new job maybe I should get more education. I got a couple of certifications through work (six sigma and excel certifications) and I worked for about a year studying for the GRE, taking it, and applying for a Non-thesis Biology graduate program. I can take classes for a couple years and then I’ll have a Masters in Biology. Great plan right?

Well, now I’m not so sure. What if I go through all this time and money, and I still can’t find a better job? Or now I’m a grossly overqualified lab tech who’s applying for jobs that pay $15 an hour but I’m expecting more since I have a Masters, but I lack industry experience for the typical jobs someone with a Masters applies for? My SO asked what job I’d want after school, and I said I wanted the same job just more money (but I don’t think they’ll pay a lab tech more to press buttons a machine just because I went to school for s couple more years) Is a Masters even necessary once you get to a certain point of job experience (Does someone with a MS and 1-2 of experience trump someone with 10+ years with a BS) My graduate school advisor was unhelpful bless her heart. She said that typically students who are non thesis MS either become teachers or go on to medical school, so she couldn’t tell me placement stats for my situation post-school.  My HR department couldn’t advise me either (“It’s a case by case basis. If someone doesn’t have a degree but has more applicable laboratory experience than another candidate, we have made exceptions since this is a hands on field”). 

I don’t want to go into debt if I can’t be guaranteed a better job position than what I currently have. Is a MS worth it? Has it been worth if for you?

We also live in the age of basically the Bachelors degree being akin to a high school diploma, so anything above that is nice to differentiate yourself.

Hey guys, 

I’m graduating this spring with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences. I have 4 years sales experience at Nordstrom as a top seller, along healthcare experience as a primary care intern. I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard. Although I would describe myself as outgoing and a people-person, I definitely have a calm demeanor. I don’t have a super hyper personality all the time, but I can’t change that. I feel very discouraged and like I’m not cut out for a career in medical sales because of this. I know this was my very first interview, but Im finding myself questioning my abilities.

I’ve been made redundant from my job this week, along with 4 colleagues, including my boss, after being there for only 7 months.

My other option is I take a redundancy payout of a month’s pay, and go back to contract work until I find something else permanent. 

I’d been finding it a toxic environment for a while (no development opportunities, lack of training and support from my boss, no objectives, high staff turnover, really cliquey), so I’m wondering if I just see it as an opportunity to leave instead of settling for an unrelated position that could make me even less happy, and focus on finding something else that allows me to thrive and use my knowledge? My worry is not finding something quickly, sometimes it’s better to jobhunt whilst in a job - and paying my rent!

Unfortunately in February of this year, I had a bad fall and had to get back surgery which was supposed to be routine and about a week of bedrest, but it ended up failing and my recovery time got extended for about a year. I went from being an active rock climber and dancer while employed at a decent job, to needing a cane and not being able to walk around the neighborhood. Obviously I haven't returned to work since and my savings is draining fast from medical bills and gas to drive to appointments.

Now I can walk decently well, can't lift anything but I feel more comfortable managing without a cane and my recovery process is still ongoing.

I am only planning to be there for a week but if her condition is serious, I will extend it to help her out.

I know I have a lot of things working against me like the physical limitations and having to be gone during two major holidays for my grandmother (Christmas and New Years). One friend said I can find a job now and tell the employers later so I have a secure job by January, but others have said I should wait until I get back from Japan and spend more time in physical therapy. I think I should wait, I have gone to a few interviews but they all rejected me due to my injury, so maybe focus on my grandmother and myself before rushing into it. The financial situation is really stressing me out and I applied for temporary disability with no luck so far, I made some money doing crafting projects but they're not good enough quality to open an Etsy shop for (also supplies are expensive).

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

So I guess I want advice on what might be the right move here, just stick with it? Try to swallow all my doubts and endure?

There are a few options that you could do here and different perspectives you can use.  
  
A) Your other employees have a different mindset than you and you come from a different background. You come from the business world and they’ve come from cs and big companies. Different viewpoints help a company as a whole and you being young to this job (because you’re an intern), you’re not expected to know everything, just a higher general understanding. Maybe on your free time try to learn SQL or other useful skills that could help not only this job, but potential future ones.  
  
B) Talk to your boss and see why he offered you a job to provide some like so you can improve your self doubt. Maybe try mental health consulting if you think you need it (I am just going off of the imposter syndrome you explained).  
  
C) Ask for help from a coworker or two to help train you more? Since you don’t want to move back, view this as some money is better than no money. Think of what tasks you do on a daily basis that you could do better and practice them.  
  
Motivational bit: If you’ve been lucky enough to be selected by them twice, once for interview and once for a job offer, they clearly see something in you that you don’t. You clearly want to stay there and I believe that you can beat this challenge that’s in front of you no problem.

I will be starting at company A next week. Lo and behold, I received an interview from company B, which I applied for during my job hunting period.  After interview and checking my references and background company B called me earlier this week and said they approved my position and verbally asked if I would accept. This is my dream government position and so I accepted and my start date is in mid September. Because it is government, it took them a while to go through my background check before they can approve me. I am still waiting for my offer letter, and the manager said to wait until next week. 

My dilemma is that I have not received an official offer letter from company B and so I feel like it’s not official yet and nothing is set in stone. However, given by how the manager communicated very thoroughly through every step of the application process and actually set a start date for me, I am pretty sure it’s official they are just waiting for their HR just as much as I am.

327,bz3xih,False,Discipline,2,I hate my job and don't know what to do,jobs,"(Please note this is my first post in reddit ever, so if I put this in the wrong place please tell me! Thank you!)

Alright straight to the point, I HATE my job.  As a college student, I thought I'd lucked out getting a retail job for this company (a world wide and pretty expensive cosmetics company).  The job was nothing special, just your basic helping people find their stuff, cashiering, stocking, and the likes.  Or at least I thought it was.  

So everything was going really well, I even got a ""promotion"" and was able to take on more responsibility, which I enjoyed.  I was constantly asking what I could do to improve, what I needed to work on, or if my manager needed any help with anything.  Everything was fine until I had to request time off in order to complete my last semester at college before I could move onto a University.  Trying to finish off classes is normally hard enough, but during this time my parents were always fighting and seriously considering getting a divorce.  Add on top of that the fact I can only go to college if I keep my grades up, as I rely only on scholarships.  You could say I was just a *little* stressed out at the time.  Scheduling for this place has always been bad.  The manager would make it one week in advance, your never allowed to switch shifts with someone else, and in order to get time off you have to request it a month in advance.  So anyways, I told my acting manager (he's actually the assistant, but because the stores real manager broke her leg and couldn't work for a long time, we as the staff filled out a survey which got him temporarily promoted) about everything that was going on with school.  It should be noted that while I didn't love the manager (I actually thought he was and still is super child-ish.  He refuses to take any criticism, is rude, and is super 'car sales man' like to the costumers), the two of us had a pretty good relationship.  At this point, we'd only really only had a one on one when I expressed how much I hated the new sales tactic we were using (basically continuously bothering costumers in every section of the store, even if they asked us to go away).  

So I tell him the issues with needing more time for school and he assures me he will do everything he can.  Next schedule comes out and guess what?  I'm scheduled for MORE hours!  I was pissed, we had another meeting where he tried to tell me ""I did do everything I could, this is less hours, I don't know what you want me to do.  Besides, you only go to school four days a week, you should have plenty of time to work here.""  I had to explain to this man how even though I go to school four days a week, the work load required for my classes was that of a full time job.  So even though it seemed like I had all the time in the world, in reality I was spending hours upon hours a day trying to figure out homework and getting tutored.  Eventually, my manager said he understood and agreed to let me give up one of my shifts.  I was still pissed, but I eventually was able to graduate so my availability became free again.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  So, our real manager finally got cleared to come back to the store, and within about two weeks of being back she pulls me into a meeting with the supervisor I'd been working with thanks to my promotion.  They tell me I'm basically de-promoted because of my availability and because the old manager (now the assistant manager or AM) and my supervisor thought it was taking away my commitment on the sales floor.  She also told me the amount of time I had taken off because I was sick or for family emergencies was unacceptable and if I missed another shift I'd be fired.  I was in shock.  That promotion was everything to me, and to make matters worse my supervisor in that position told me they were still ""so thankful for all the work I did and the new organizational systems I had created.  In fact, there so great will still be using them.""  I'm sure they meant well by saying this, but all I could here was ""thanks for fixing everything, but you're useless now so bye!""  On top of that, I even checked with both my supervisor and AM if my availability would affect my promotion, and they both assured me as soon as my hours became open again I could go right back too it.  I ended up having to be sent home that day because I had a break down.  

At this point I just don't know what to do.  I am so upset about the fact they took away my position (I was able to work behind the scenes more and was insured longer hours).  Honestly, what makes everything so much worse was that I never heard anything but positivity in that position.  They never told me I was doing anything wrong, and never gave me things to improve on.  At this point, I know I worst case scenario I will need this job until the summer ends.  Its only a couple of month but with how much I hate this place it might as well be a century.

Our district manager was supposed to train me, but for whatever reason he didn’t. So instead our general manager did, with the rationale being that the GM used to be a DM. Kinda weird but whatever.

Sales still suck, and the quarter is almost over.

So today my district manager came in and told me our sales are bad, and he gave me a chart to track my sales. He says he wants me to improve my sales by basically 10% in the next six weeks. He asked me what I think is keeping the team from higher sales, and we brainstormed some things to help raise sales.

He didn’t say what would happen if I don’t.

I don't know what you sell, but I can give you some tips for selling anything. 

Basically the first thing you want to do is identify what level of investment your customer/client is making in purchasing goods and/or services from you.

Basically, there are a zillion combinations of product/service, but you can boil almost anything down to a fundamental relationship that is this: all sales fall somewhere along the line connecting two extremes, the extremes are:

1. Low price point, service means nothing since the item is likely consumable and you'll never have to see the retailers ugly mug again

2. Extremely high pricepoint, where you're purchasing a high end product that is irrevocably paired with strenuous, rigorous service - and, by buying this product or service you are tied into a relationship with the seller. (Examples might be hiring a specialized consultant to build a model of a highly complex system, or hiring a lawyer, or purchasing a fleet of Boeing 747's) - in all these cases, you're going to be locked into a relationship for some period of time, sometimes your whole life.

The point here, is that as the seller you need to be cognoscente of the investment the consumer must make in the purchase of your product. If you are selling paper - are you *just* selling paper, or are you selling the service agreement in which you will provide them with paper for a period of time?

If you are selling something relatively inexpensive, your focus should not be on YOU, the focus should be on the product, and economy. If you are selling something more expensive, then you must start to sell yourself as a reliable provider, as well as the product.

In a project management course I took recently, there is a ""goal"" of becoming a ""trusted advisor"". This means that you speak to your client with truth - not sales; but truth. Meaning, that you aren't acting solely to benefit your pocket, or your company's revenue, but you are speaking to them with their best interests at heart. And by doing this, you gain significant good will. Sometimes this comes cheaply, and sometimes it comes at significant expense.

Here are two examples: A client approaches me and asks me to compare and contrast the model we built and the model they had from a couple years ago. I realise immediately that their previous model was built in a very robust way, and contains several tertiary level calculations that I know my junior engineers could not possibly  do. I tell my client that the previous work is at a standard that surpasses the work I have just provided him. He agrees, but then instead of getting mad, he asks what I can do to remediate the situation. I say we can use the client's previous model as a basis for improvement and we adopt some specific modules to the higher standard. We cover the work under training, since I know my junior engineers will learn something valuable. The client is extremely happy and as a result we are awarded with more work.

Example 2: I submit a proposal for some work and the client is considering two different software types to accomplish the job. We are specialised in only one of them. We realise quickly that the training time on the othr software would make our bid uncompetitive. I tell the client that we are not in a position to make a bid on the work because of this issue. They appreciate our position and award the project to someone else. Here, we've been honest up front and the client appreciated our forthcoming attitude and honesty. We lost $150k worth of work, but we gained credibility.

In either case, it's the cost of doing business, but by gaining good will and credibility we're putting ourselves continually in a better position.

The TL;DR here, is that you can find ways to be honest with the client, be honest about everything and it'll pay off. a 10% increase in sales will not be difficult with a bit of time spent getting to know your clients, or knowing what to focus on.

Ohya, and I wouldn't be worried about getting the axe. Don't stress that - that's just paying interest on a debt you haven't incurred. ",2019-03-12 02:43:37

1221,dl8w6x,False,Onboarding,6,Unsure if I should stay at this job?,jobs,"I have been with my current company for around 19 months. For the first 18 months (also my first job after graduate school), I worked in a challenging environment that gradually became more toxic, as time passed, due to low pay, issues not being resolved from administrators, numerous staff quitting due to burnout and never-ending staff shortages, ethical concerns, etc. I requested to transfer to a different department 2 months ago into a slightly different role (for slightly higher pay) and more growth opportunities. I knew other people who had left my former department to transfer to my current department, and they had positive experiences when changing, and I hoped I would have the same.

I have been at my new job for 3 weeks, and given the 3 varied roles within my position, I have one ""main"" supervisor, but also 3 ""additional"" supervisors for each of my roles. I thought this would be a ""good"" thing to have different insight and mentorship; however, it has frequently resulted in miscommunication among the 4 supervisors when advising me for what to do for the varied roles within my positions, as well as figuring out who is responsible to ""train"" me for different roles. I am frequently told how to complete a task from one of these supervisors, but then having my ""main"" supervisor become frustrated with the differences in information being shared with me. I only see my ""main"" supervisor 1-2 time(s) a week, so on the days I do not see her, I have to e-mail her, and hope I am given a response that way. There are also times that my supervisors have not communicated necessary training information to me because they believe that another supervisor has already told me the necessary information and/or due to assuming I transferred within the company, I should already know the information (which is not possible due to differences in the departments). When I interviewed for this new position, the directors were aware of my limited experience related to some aspects of this new job, but felt confident that I could learn on the job and with experience, which I hoped also. The department has never hired someone into so many different positions like what they made my position to be, and say they are learning, as they go, with how to best supervise me, but it's feeling very frustrated.

I feel that all of these different supervisors are now realizing the impacts of the miscommunication during my training process, and have been asking me how ""training"" has been going, and are not very happy with the results. They are expecting me to independently complete my job responsibilities starting within the next 2 weeks. They have been having me shadow one of my supervisors 2-3 days a week to watch how they complete their specified job responsibilities, which has definitely been insightful to watch; however, with all of the time spent observing, they have given me very minimal on the job training related to my workload for one of these components, which is very different than my supervisor's.

Today, one of the supervisors spoke with me privately (and mentioned she would be speaking with my other supervisors to see how everything has been going, etc) to ask how training has been going, etc, to which she questioned me if I felt ""ready"" to independently complete some other aspects of my job due to my limited experience with some areas of the position, and also mentioned that if she had interviewed me, she would have highlighted other pertinent information related to the job to have a better depiction of the job, etc. I felt that she also implied that she does not feel I am the best fit for this position, as I said I was interested in taking this position to gain more experience in different areas, but told me that was not the purpose of this position, and that I needed to view myself as more of an ""expert"" to succeed in the position. However, with only 3 weeks at this new job, and most of my time spent in ""training"" by watching other people do their job, and not being given direct support with my own workload, I am definitely feeling overwhelmed and not confident in my abilities, and feel like the department now regrets hiring me, although I know I did not misrepresent my credentials, etc. It seems like this new department is almost just like my previous department, disappointingly, with a toxic and unsupportive environment again. Another supervisor also mentioned to me that she was not used to having new hires to the department with such limited experience either, which again is making me question why I was hired.

Additionally, I am scheduled to work at 2 different locations, but do not have adequate resources to complete my job, as at one of my locations, I temporarily have no office, desk, or computer to use due to building renovations for a few weeks, and at my other location, I have no desk to store any pertinent files, and have to borrow one of my supervisor's filing cabinet to file important documents.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do with this situation?

I think doing things right away will actually be a benefit in the long run as the longer you are at the job the more responsibilities will pile up.... and it becomes a bigger risk to procrastinate... also I’ve learned the hard way that procrastination leads to anxiety... so you’d be right back where you started. So me the question is about priority. If you ask a “when would you like this done” ... every person will respond saying ASAP because they don’t have any concept of what you are working on at that very moment. I’d strategically ask your question about deadline in a way that also asks which is the real priority... so saying “I will get this done. I’m currently working on XYZ and have X hours more to finish it. I expect I can get this to you by X time. Does that work for you?” 
This will remind them what you are working on AND gives them the opportunity to say “yes that time frame works” or “no I need you to do this first”. Either way you get the real answer you need and not the generic go to answer of “asap”. It also manages up which is a great way to communicate your efforts without blatantly saying “I did This, This, and This, today”. 

Then with time you’ll get a real sense of what is actually pressing and what’s not, but always a good idea to manage up regardless. :) hope that helps!  ",2018-08-13 13:23:07

874,f0qxci,False,Education,12,Graduate Certificate? or Associates? (Post-Bachelors),jobs,"So I graduated from a below-average state university on the west coast of the USA last May 2019. I graduated with a finance degree and a 3.59 GPA. I only had one unrelated internship during a summer years ago in the engineering field. I took some time off for the summer and fall to travel with family and learn some new coding languages like SQL. I started my job hunt on new year's day this year and as I expected, the search has been brutal. Over 50 applications sent out to analyst and accountant jobs in my city and only one interview for a credit analyst at a regional bank has crossed paths with so far. I'm in the final running for 3 positions on that one but I'm not going to hold my breathe until I get an offer letter. I'm already regretting not doing a double major and I'm already thinking deeply about going back to school.

All the advisors at my alma mater are pushing me towards MBA and other Master's programs but I feel that's all just a sales pitch for more of my money. I really rather not get a full fledged masters degree without any work experience as I would just dig myself deeper into the over-qualified hole.

3. An associates in software/database technology at the same community college (11 courses involving oracle, SQL, java & other programming)

\#1 is the only step above my bachelors. #2 is the fastest and cheapest option. #3 would give me the biggest boost in technical skills.

A Masters or even just being a CPA candidate can impress a hiring manager even if you have little to no experience. 

Also combining accounting with MIS or data analytics is a growing market. People with these skills are rare and so are in demand. There's potential to make big bucks, allowing you to pay off student loans faster. ",2020-02-08 12:23:29

482,f3drlz,False,Qualifications,2,I'd prefer to leave by job and work elsewhere in Accounting since it's what I taught myself but I don't feel my knowledge is legit nor do I feel educationally qualified.,jobs,"So I'm reaching out today because I've decided to quit my job sometime in the future but I haven't the slightest idea how to quit or even how to begin looking elsewhere for work since I have, what I feel, is basically nothing to show potential employers. Like, I understand I do a lot and both my boss and my co-workers routinely tell me I'm ""not allowed to leave"" and if I do, ""the company won't last ten years."" It's always said with a solemn tone and tbh I'm a little tired if hearing it.

I'm 30 years old. I've been at this company nearly six years. I was hired through a temp agency. I have never had a different job nor have I ever had an interview. I have learned a lot through this company though. For the sake of easier reading, I'll try to bullet point this out.

- I spent the first two years working as a grunt in the production department. The boss and I got along about as well as oil and water and our screaming matches could often be heard over the deafening sounds of the machines. Nevertheless, I was kept because I often out-worked my co-workers. What took them three days to complete, took me only one. I'm not saying this to brag; it's what was told me as the sole reason for hiring me and what continues to be the reason as to why they keep me on.
- Due to the irreconcilable differences between the boss and I, HR (who doubles as my current boss) intervened and gave me a position in the office. Due to having zero prior job experience and zero education (other than a GED which I don't have a copy of), I was supposed to be their filing clerk. This company still uses an outdated paper filing system so I have six large rooms I must maintain to ensure every employee can find the paperwork they're looking for. I must also cull through the files at the end of each year because we only keep seven years worth.
- Two weeks after my transfer another employee unexpectedly quit. Her Accounts Payables duties were split between me and another co-worker. My new partner received all of the training from the departing co-worker because she already had prior experience. I didn't get any training whatsoever. Unfortunately I soon discovered my new partner felt this was entirely unfair and she should not be required to do these duties. It has been an astronomical learning curve but over these past four years I've taken away from her nearly every single aspect of Payables and single-handedly run this dept myself. The only thing I don't do is print the checks each month.
- 3 weeks ago my boss informed me that this same co-worker has been discovered to be slacking in her Receivables duties for the past three years. It is now my job to rectify our customer's accounts of their past due balances and open credits. No, I will not receive any training nor will my co-worker be punished. This is a moot point anyways because I have already resolved all of the accounts.
- Because a different co-worker is getting older in years, I have also been rather unceremoniously tossed into the position of being a back-up receptionist. I answer calls, transfer folks where they need to be, take messages, etc.
- In addition to these duties, I also do a lot of things which go unnoticed by my boss. I have a lot of freedom in my position tbh. I print labels, I type up paperwork, I maintain our first aid cabinets, I have the flexibility and training to help in multiple departments (inventory control, production, and shipping) due to me being tossed in those departments any time my ex-boss and I were fighting, I can receive in mail, I order products for various projects I need and charge them to my co-workers company's credit card, etc.

I guess my fear is that I may have my GED but I technically did not progress past the 9th grade so I don't feel well educationally qualified. I don't have the funds to go back to school. A lot of what I do know, I've taught myself but I don't even feel confident in this knowledge because this company is ridiculously outdated. (We still use electric typewriters on a daily basis except for my co-worker who still uses a real, old-fashioned typewriter.) This company is family-run and well respected in its field so I do have that going for me though.

If I looked for another job, would I even be considered for an Accounting position? How would I even explain to potential new employers the extent of what I do know without it sounding so far left-field (which is how I feel like it comes across)? I am currently paid nearly twice the current minimum wage. Could I get this again if I left and became employed elsewhere? Honestly I'd rather not stay in this wretched place any longer than need be but I never thought I'd want to leave so desperately. Until this past year, I have never really thought about it. Now that it is in my thoughts every day though, I'm completely at a loss on what to do, what to expect, or where to even start. And should I even leave? How would I present this to my boss who, I know, would be distraught? I'm sure they'll ask me what it'll take me to stay so how I can say it's just time for me to move on? (The motto of this company is, ""It'll drive you to drink,"" which is what I'm currently struggling with as well because my drinking has increased ten-fold. This has been incredibly detrimental to my mental health but I've been reluctant to leave because I need the money.) Am I even required to give them a reason on why I'm leaving? Finally, when I leave for a week or more, at least five co-workers must step in and cover for me so do I need to let my boss know more than two weeks in advance before I quit?

I've never had any prior experience with any of this so I'm rather at a loss in this matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f3drlz/id_prefer_to_leave_by_job_and_work_elsewhere_in/,1,"Make your resume very good.

I'm an entertainment lighting specialist.

Last year I made about 60k before taxes. Its my dream job, I'm good at it and I love it.

  
In March, my current tour, future tours, and plan B local gigs all vanished with the pandemic. I have booked one weekend gig for the foreseeable future, in the season I'm normally working 80 hours a week. I have robust savings because I've always known my job to be feast or famine, and government aid plus EI will keep me afloat for a good amount of time. However, I can't help but feel like the entertainment industry will take years to get even close to what it was. Shows that actually pay enough to be worthwhile need big audiences, big venues, and most notably, big insurance policies that currently no one is giving out. It's also extremely hard work. On tour I'll work an average of 100 hours a week, sometimes we'll do 14 show days in a row.

I’ve been living with my parents and job searching since around October. I’ve applied for about 200 jobs, done about 20 phone screens, probably 8-9 full interviews, and just received my second offer. I rejected my first offer at the beginning of February because the salary was so low I wouldn’t be able to support myself, had no benefits, and would expect 60-70 hours of work for me weekly with no paid overtime. 

This next offer is a little better. The personnel were incredibly friendly and warm (it was nice to be treated like a human) and even negotiated me a slightly higher salary without me even asking. However, that salary is still only $35K a year and the benefits are very mediocre. Furthermore, the position is far more niche than I was initially expecting, and wouldn’t give me any of the transferrable skills I’m actually looking for for the career I’m trying to pursue (it’s pure developmental writing for social work education curriculum, where I’m actually looking for a job in copy editing or copywriting in a business setting. My entire background is already in academic writing and I don’t want to pursue a career in it). The small city it’s in also doesn’t really have much of a market for what I’m looking for career-wise, and it’s not a desirable place to live or one I’d want to stay in. 

The city this job is in is several states away, and the job offers no relocation assistance. 

Is there any kind of justification for not taking this? I’m not starving or homeless, though I do have a somewhat strained relationship with my family.

I've worked for a well-funded startup company (30-40 people) for about a year. We work on an incredibly ambitious, technically challenging hardware problem. When I interviewed, it was apparent that there were major, major unsolved problems (part of the reason I was brought in), and while they obviously did not reveal the full magnitude of the problems at the time (partially because they didn't know), I thought I was making a ~50/50 bet on joining a company with a viable concept.

After a lot of hard work and the discovery of problems we couldn't have known (we're really pushing the limits of physics in some respects, and it pushed back... if only we could change the speed of light a bit!), it is apparent that my bet was ""correct"", but I landed on the wrong side of it.

I realized what interests me the most is the Neuroscience field. I've been on hiatus from a university for about 4 years now and have been working since.

I worked as a restaurant line cook and even did a year of a culinary program at one point because I thought I enjoyed cooking enough to really learn as much as I could. I realized though, I no longer want to work in the restaurant industry. 

I currently work in the manufacturing field. I've wanted to explore jobs that are more hands-on just to earn a solid paycheck and maintain hobbies outside of work.

I'm a clinical histotech with a BA, I'm the field for three years. Due to the work environment, unhappiness, and no prospect of moving up, I've been looking for jobs. My undergrad was in a hard science with a focus on research and I'd like to go back to that in preparation for grad school. 


I just interviewed for a position as a histotech in a research lab and I think I will get it. The only snag is the pay - which I understand. Research labs can't afford to pay as much for a Histotechnologist as a clinical lab can. After three years (Union too), I've worked up to a salary of 60K. Keeping in mind my long term goals, I expressed a range of 45  to 60 K, to encapsulate what I'm currently earning; I think I can go as low as 43,000 though. The job was posted as 30,000 plus DOE. They've been having a hard time getting qualified candidates with a histology background to apply for this position.


The PI said my range was too high and I'd really have to think about if moving to a research job will give me the benefits that I'm looking for (research experience, publications, growth). I understand this, which is why I'm not just looking for jobs in clinical histology or processing labs. 

However, according to the PI, my job isn't just a research assistant. I would be 'fulfilling an important role in preparing tissue for the other lab members who don't have time to cut their own tissue'. In this case, my technical skills are very important. 


I'm also worried that if I accept an offer that they still feel is too high, that I won't have job security. At first, I would be filling in for a research histotech on maternity leave and they're not sure if she's coming back. I would also no longer be in a union. I think they could easily let me go if my salary is a strain on finances.


I feel that, despite the benefits, 30,000 would be exploitative for my histology skills. What are your thoughts on how I should proceed?

Just to give a bit of background on my education experience. I have a BBA in Management Information Systems, and I'm working on my MS in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. Also, I'm slated to take my CompTIA Security+ test next month. 

For my work experience, I've been working helpdesk for about two years doing Tier 1-Tier3 work. This is due to my IT group being a small entity so the responsibilities are many. While in college I worked as a Network Technician for 4.5 years, taking care of connections and installing infrastructure devices such as UPS's, AP's, and the occasional switch. Also, terminating connections and patching in new ones, very basic stuff. 

I'd eventually like to get into the cybersecurity realm, but I'd like to know a good place to start? There is absolutely no opportunity where I work for upward movement, everyone is riding out their careers, and there isn't any inkling of a new position being created.

As the title states, I am recently unemployed due to a corporate merger/acquisition with another firm and the necessary cuts made when this happens. Simply, my position was not needed at the new company, and they did not have any openings where I would have been a good fit. 

Here’s my dilemma: I’ve been in this industry (Transportation) since 2006, and it’s fair to say I’m not a rookie. It’s also fair to say that I am not qualified for an executive level position. In my area, however there are very few opportunities that are between entry level and executive level. This makes my job search a little extra challenging. 

For the first 10 years, I was a driver in various capacities and have been working on the admin side for the past 3 years as a broker, a dispatcher, and most recently a recruiter. I think it’s fair to say also that I’m well rounded in several aspects of the industry. I am not interested in going back into driving, unless that becomes absolutely necessary.

1454,1oa485,False,[advice],8,Is there really a skills gap/labor shortage in the (skilled) trades?,jobs,"I realize this may be difficult to answer. However I was hoping someone in this subreddit might have some insight. I think we have all heard how the skilled trades are in decline and that people are needed desperately in these fields: plumbing, electrician, pipe fitting, various mechanical technicians etc. I think you get the idea. Mike Rowe, from Dirty Jobs, has been championing the skilled trades fairly heavily. He even has a website for it. 

However, I have heard numerous statistics about this situation. One is that there is a shortage now. The other I heard is that there will be a big (Bigger?) shortage in the next 5-10 years because (apparently) the average age of these workers is quite old. I was reading the average to be in the forties and fifties. Thus, I wonder if the claim is more geared towards the future than now. Mostly, I wonder why so many people have not jumped on the skilled trades road to employment. I imagine many people are saddled with school debts and are reluctant to do more school. Of course, the skilled trades is still school and it costs money. I think this could be the main reason and I think breaking into these fields is more difficult that it sounds. However, with all the unemployed, it seems like more people should have jumped on this awhile ago or maybe not.  The economy started to get bad in 2007 and 2008. If people started a 4 year degree in that time, they would have graduated only a couple years ago. So its feasible most people just didn't know about the skilled trades (like me) and are only figuring things out too late.

I interviewed for a job this past Tuesday. Shortly after, I emailed my interviewers, including the hiring manager, to thank them for their time. On Wednesday, I received an email (directed to me) from the hiring manager that said I was being offered the position—I was so excited! I emailed back immediately to let them know I accepted their offer and I even received a response saying they were ""happy"" to have me ""on board."" 

However, today I got a voicemail/email saying that I was offered the position by accident, that it was an email/working-from-home ""glitch."" I'm absolutely stunned and devasted. 

Here is the email I received:

""Hi \_\_\_\_,

I am back in the office today and just left you a message.  I made a huge error in saying we've offered you the position. Working from home, I had computer glitches and made an error. Given that I do want to let you know you're high on our list, but still waiting to hear back from everyone on the team about ranking.  I am deeply sorry for this mistake and hope you understand. Please call me if you have any questions.""

Like I said, I'm stunned and so, so sad about this. Any tips for how I should respond? I can't think clearly right now and I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm a grad student (graduating in May) and was so stoked to know what my next steps are. Is this worth complaining to their HR manager about?

It went well and when I sent my follow up email I got a response asking if they could contact my references, which they did as one contacted me soon after.

On February 7th around 8 pm I found out I didn’t get the position but in the same email they stated that they were impressed with my profile and offered to put me in contact with another director in the company looking to hire for a similar role.

On February 10th, I noticed they removed the job listing for the position with the other director. I really don’t understand why because it was posted February 5th, less than a week.

That one is fair. It's better to have a no foul language rule and not enforce it, than not have a rule and then have to deal with foul-mouthed staff offending customers and arguing that it's their right since it's not in the handbook. Not to mention it can be off-putting and uncomfortable for some other employees, especially if it's mostly men being foul about sex, or vice versa.

If they are saying you can't drink ever, that's unreasonable. I wouldn't work somewhere that dictated how I live when I'm off the clock. If they're saying you can't drink at that restaurant ever, or you can't drink in uniform, that's a pretty common policy. ",2019-07-24 18:50:46

Fast forward to the beginning of April and COVID-19 in full effect. I am an essential worker but the company annouced hiring freezes, paycuts and furloughs, across the board.

This job is an administrative job with the ministry of health so not like there is a conflict of interest between the 2 jobs. I just graduated nursing school and landed a job as a public health nurse and it pays double what I'm getting at my part time job but it's specific to COVID response and therefore the job is temporary, probably lasting a few months. I think this would be a great opportunity for me and would hate to give it up because of a few scheduling conflicts. It would look great on my resume and would allow me to make a good amount of money for a few months. Whereas my part time job pays way less but has been my stable job I've been able to pay rent off of and live pretty frugally with.

There are a lot of scheduling issues with the new job as they have scheduled me Sunday-Thursday 10am-6pm with Friday and Saturday off, and my part time job is usually Tuesday & Friday 4-8pm with alternating weekends. I've been able to speak to some coworkers and get them to cover me on some days and weekends but there is one reoccuring weekly shift the Tuesday 4-8 at my part time job that I'm not able to get covered, and I can't just show up 3 hours late to my shift, so asking my current manager to compromise isn't even an option I think.

So I'm thinking my only option is to speak to the new manager and ask them if I can be changed to the 8-4 shift just on Tuesdays so I can rush to my 2nd job. In the job offer they stated my schedule was fixed and that I had to work all the offers but I'm wondering if there may be some flexibility to that. I'm afraid I might come off as being uncooperative or difficult having just been a new hire and I'm scared of jeopardizing my contract with them or having them let me go. They hired 15 other nurses as well.

I'm getting mixed advice from different people. Some people are telling me it's best to be honest from the get go and let the new job know about my scheduling issues and that I've tried my best to resolve them with my other job but am having difficulty with this one day every week and that this would be easier to figure out from the start rather than wait till after orientation and bring it up 2 weeks after starting. And some people are telling me this could come off as me not being dedicated to this new job and that I'm being difficult and would leave a bad impression to the point they would let me go, or that it looks bad that I', working a party time job ontop of this. Quitting my part time job is not an option as I need this after my contract ends with my new one. I really need some advice about what to say to the new job and when I should say it, or if it's even a good idea to say anything.

They’ve lost my check and am unsure of how to respond since I won’t be here to collect it.,jobs,"I left out a lot of details that were not as important and this is still pretty long sorry about that but I just really want some good advice on handling this.

I got hired to work in an office as the two owners really needed help because they were understaffed. I told them that I would be willing to work until mid-August since I would be leaving to go to school, this was back in April. I made sure to mention early on that I wanted to take a two-week vacation in July, which was approved and worked up until the start of my vacation everything was fine.

Fast-forward to the end of my two-week vacation, I text my boss, owner 1, and say that I made it back okay and that I’m ready to continue working. 

He responds to me a day later stating,
”Hey man, hope your vacation went well. So here's an update on things we have hired two more employees, so we are covered with regular staff. Your last check is here which you can pick up during normal office hours. Also, we may need help here in the office on the weekends (busiest time of the week) and if that is the case we will reach out to you and check your availability.”

The thing about maybe needing extra help was basically fluff to make them seem like they weren’t putting me in rough spot by letting me go a month earlier than we had agreed on, but such is life, right?

I didn’t respond to this text because I was equal parts embarrassed and upset at the reality of my being let go. I was never given any indication that they didn't want me or that I was messing something up for them and the office. Also something about getting let go through text made me really upset and I find it somewhat demeaning. 

As well as not responding, I never went to pick up my check until yesterday. When I got there, the only person in the office was one of the new employees and despite his best efforts, had no luck finding my check. He texted the owner 2 and he told the new employee to tell me to come back tomorrow in the afternoon to pick up my check.

Which bring me to today. As I was about to leave my house to go to the office again I got a text from the owner 2 saying,
”I looked for your check in the office but owner 1 placed it somewhere and I couldn't find it. He's on vacation until next week but I'll try to get ahold of him again to double-check on where it is. Thanks and sorry about that.”

Honestly, along with being taken aback by the what happened with my previous employer, I'm left not knowing how to respond to any of this as it's the first time I have been fired/let go/laid off (whichever is most appropriate) and I have has other jobs before this one.

I'm a 28-year-old guy that's been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. To be perfectly blunt, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

968,bihrxd,False,Education,20,Majoring in Physics was the biggest mistake of my life.,jobs,"When I was choosing a major in college I didn’t have the option of choosing an engineering discipline so I chose the closest thing I could, physics. I loved the school and wanted to stay, but I also wanted to get into an engineering career. When I was discussing this with my parents, my father told me not to worry because engineering and physics are so closely related that I wouldn’t have a problem finding an engineering position post-graduation. “You will be able to tell the engineers what’s wrong with their designs,” he would say, and I blindly believed him. 

So I graduated and started looking for engineering jobs but I didn’t seem to be qualified for any entry level ones. I thought to myself, “That’s just cause you don’t have any experience. You learn these things on the job, just find something to get yourself started in the engineering world and you’ll find your way.” I eventually figured out that with my degree, I was most qualified for Test Engineering jobs. That’s got the word engineer in it, I must be on the right track! 

I got a job as a Test Engineer and quickly realized it wasn’t the type of engineering I thought it would be, but the pay wasn’t bad so I sucked it up and worked. After a few years I wanted to take on more responsibility and since there was no room for growth in this particular company, I started looking for other jobs. I thought, “I have some experience, I can get an engineering job now.” So I searched and searched and quickly realized that I am in no way qualified for an engineering position. I don’t feel like I have any actual skills. I used to be able to do math and stuff, and I took simple electronics classes in my physics coursework, but it’s been so long that I don’t remember how to do it anymore. Now I’m working in systems engineering, essentially making sure test plans and reports aren’t written at a second grade level (which many of them are) and I’m so bored. I don’t know where my career path will go, but I’m sure now that I don’t have the education to pull off an engineering job.

I don’t know why I’m posting this, to be honest. I think I just needed to get it out. Maybe I’m looking for direction too. IDK.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bihrxd/majoring_in_physics_was_the_biggest_mistake_of_my/,33,"I'm sorry, did you bother reading the job description of whatever the hell you were applying for?  Picking a job because it has the word ""Engineer"" in it is retarded.  Incidentally, being a Test Engineer isn't bad at all and you can definitely use your Physics degree for that.  It also opens the door to Quality, Analytics, Performance, Operations Research, etc all of which you can make decent money and stay technical.  

WHen I went to college I will admit that ""Engineer"" was the buzz word of the day and that is what I ""thought"" I wanted to be.  But when I read all the various majors and course descriptions, it wasn't quite what I wanted.  Turns out, the closest thing to what I wanted was Physics.  So I got a physics degree with a heavy emphasis on Engineering courses that I liked.  

Post college when I was looking at various jobs, I didn't really care as long as the job was technical and dealt with technology.  With my physics background I was able to quickly pick up and learn whatever the job entailed.

So Not sure why you are knocking the Physics degree.  To be honest, based on what you wrote seems like you never put much thought into it.  So it isn't the fault of your degree but rather to be quite frank it's your fault for just blindly doing something without doing your own research on the subject. ",2019-04-28 23:57:02

Did you want to be patronized or talked to like a child when you were depressed? I've studied in four cities in three countries, and I did an internship at a factory in China.

I'm now in Europe and almost all large companies now want to enter the Chinese market. Sounds great, right? The problem is that it is impossible to get in touch with them. The only time I've heard back it's been ""we'll be in touch"" or ""you don't have enough experience."" Certainly there must be plenty of people who'd want to hire me (I have a STEM/business dual degree too), I just can't get in touch with them or find out where they are. I make my CV and cover letter as a website and send it to companies on Twitter in response when they announce job openings but they don't even look at it.

If you're really in business and have a somewhat senior position you should educate yourself about how the economy works and how a digital business works.

First of all, we are in a global recession due to completely mismanaged monetary policy, which results in money flowing to the top - away from production, manufacturing and entry-level jobs which are cut or replaced with internships, to finance and venture capital who in turn invest in Silicon Valley startups. THIS is why WhatsApp is ""worth"" 19B.

The secondary consequence of this is an environment where labor is abundant while jobs are scarce, meaning employers pay very little and offer no security and won't train employees as that is also a cost. Since nobody wants to train, it is close to impossible to gain experience and skills needed to get a job.

2339,dvi3i9,False,Training,0,Trying to build skills on a low budget with less than great hours.,jobs,"I graduated in May with a design degree and I ended up taking a job at a coffeehouse while I kept looking for work. I was hoping to figure out where I wanted to specialize as a designer so I could better market myself and improve on my craft (Also it turns out that my year was the last year my college would offer my program, so yay! /s). I did eventually sorta figure out that I like working with textiles and as well as working on UX/UI. I was hoping that my time working in food service would only be tempory but it now been over 6 months and nothing has really come to fruition. I want to end up doing something that is meaningful and pays the bills, but I feel like I never have the time, money, or energy.

 I wanted to work on retooling some of my old portfolio pieces that I made in college, but I haven't been able to do so because Adobe is ridiculously expensive when not paying student prices. I've ran into the same issue with textiles because cloth isn't cheap and even the budget-esque practice of making a muslin so as to not use more expensive materials is still more than I can justify as of current. I've been spending money on paying for a domain name that never left a private setting thinking that I could make a blog/ online portfolio site to better promote myself but never could really get everything to run right. I feel like I'm held down by a ton of financial barriers, and that isn't including that I need to start paying back student loans this month.

Time is also a major constraint at the moment. I don't have a car which forces me to use a less than substantial bus system. On average I'll spend 30 minutes a day heading into work, and depending on when I get off, I can end up spending over an hour to get home like I did last night.  I live in the midwest and the temperature has been at or below freezing for a week now. Its really not even properly winter yet, since temps can hang around 0 degrees Farenheit for months. Honestly just having to commute ends up draining a ton of energy, especially when I realize that if I did have a car my commute would take around 20 minutes for a round trip. Being reliant on the bus schedule also limits where I can search for a job and what hours I can work, because the bus cut off before 8pm and run on an hourly schedule. Even if money were not an barrier, I would still be at the mercy of a rapidly fluctuating schedule that leaves me feeling unable to work on anything because I'm constantly having leave far earlier than I need for a shift in order to actually be on time.

In short, I feel that I can make something out of my skills and creative drive but I dont have the time or money necessary to do so. I'm currently looking for a better paying job that has me work more regular hours but so far I've been striking out.  Do I just need better discipline when it comes to practicing, or is there something that I'm missing that I could be working on? I really want to start getting to a better situation fast.

How do I deal with this on a day to day basis? She's the type of person if I confront her she is going to be passive aggressive and snobby... (other people have left the position because of her) :( I hate this, going to work everyday is toxic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a0dhat/how_to_deal_with_a_negative_coworker/,7,"Hi! I've been where you're at before and have successfully turned that kind of relationship around! Girls like that can kind of suck the life out of you sometimes :( One day I decided I had enough of my co-worker's snobby, narcissistic and controlling personality--and I wasn't going to let this woman-child walk all over me. So, brace yourself, but you have to talk this out with her. Chances are she's not the kind of person who's been called out before, so this is just as good for you as it is for her!

&#x200B;

Definitely don't start with an ""I think you're a toxic person"" opener because then she'll know that you've been hating on her for a really long time; I would assume she would act out (get passive aggressive or snobby) just because no one likes getting called out; it's a defense mechanism. Instead, pick an isolated incident--like if she ever puts you down by saying ""Ew, don't wear that"" then, I'd recommend in the next 10 minutes to an hour, that you ask to speak with her away from everyone else so you can tell her that you don't appreciate it when she says flippant comments like that. Maybe one of these lines would work for you: ""Hey, can I ask you something?"" or ""Let's go get a coffee"" or ""Let me put time on my calendar so we can chat. When are you free?"" Anything neutral like that to get her away if you work in a group so she doesn't feel like she's being called out unprofessionally. Once you have that down--ease into it and say something like: ""Hey, when you said/did *that*, it made me feel really shitty/disrespected and I want to make sure this stops"" or ""Maybe you didn't pick up on it, but when you do or say *that*, it's really unprofessional and I'd rather you kept it to yourself"" Sandwich it with something like ""I really like how you're such a hard worker and you show initiative in the office"" or ""I like your style and would love to hit you up for advice sometime"" --Something that is positive and that shows you respect, at least one part, of who she is.

&#x200B;

Remember--Why are you letting her determine how YOU feel? Once you stop putting her needs before yours, you'll see that it's necessary to advocate for yourself. Don't expect an immediate change, but do expect some push back. When I called out my co-worker, I wasn't prepared for her to go into a crying fit and explain to me that she has a lot of stress in her life/lots of father issues and that sometimes she's mean and just doesn't even realize it. Historically, I'm not the type of person to stick up for myself--I've always minimized my feelings in those situations and it honestly felt so good to A) understand why she is how she is and B) to rally for my fucking self. You can do this gently and in a way that is genuine to your attitude and lifestyle. Don't get worked up, don't shout, don't engage. Just state how you feel (show your vulnerability) and it's up to her how she reacts. 

&#x200B;

Another thing to think about is making sure you can dot your i's and cross your t's--she could call you out for ""doing nothing"" so really look at your work performance so she doesn't manipulate this back on you. If she brings that up again, you can say that's something you'll be happy to work on. If she is just actually that awful to work with, you should escalate it to your boss or your HR department **AFTER** you've attempted to fix the situation. They will be happy to cut off the poison on the team if it means keeping good workers.

1794,f9vve7,False,Recruiters,9,Is this typical practice of a recruiter?,jobs,"Bear with me, I’m providing details for context. 

I interviewed with a company that I fell in love with last year. The hiring manager emailed me personally to tell me that I lost out to an internal candidate, but I’d be a great fit at the company, and she “strongly encouraged” me to keep applying, and that she would keep me in mind if a spot opened on her team. I kept applying with no luck, and sent her a follow up email months later restating my interest. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I get an email from her with a direct reply to my follow up email, telling me a spot opened on her team, and that I should apply and that she would flag my resume with internal corporate recruiter. I did, and he emailed me to schedule a phone interview. 

Had the phone interview last week, nailed it, and he told me that the hiring manager (not the director who emailed me, but the lead manager below her) might want to skip the phone interview with me and just bring me in, since his boss (that emailed me and whom I interviewed with last year) already tagged me, and I already interviewed with so many directors of departments that I would be interacting with last year. 

He told me (unprompted by me) that he was speaking with hiring manager on Friday, and that he would reach out to me either Friday or Monday the latest to let me know the interview schedule, as they are moving quickly.  I heard nothing, so yesterday morning I sent an email to follow up, asking for a status update. He never returned my email. 

It’s 2020. I have a computer on my wrist. I work at a big Corp and am also very busy with emails, meetings and life, but if I tell someone I will contact them, and they email me, I take the literal 2 seconds to respond and tell them if there’s a delay, someone is on vacation, whatever. 

Is this typical practice to ignore someone in a situation like this?  What should my next steps be?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9vve7/is_this_typical_practice_of_a_recruiter/,3,"Quick follow-up:

I had the phone interview 5 weeks ago after the director reached out to me and asked me to apply. I thought the phone interview went REALLY well, recruiter was so nice, and he offered to accept my friend request on LinkedIn, and then I never heard anything back. I sent a follow-up email five days later (the recruiter had told me he would call me the next day to arrange a face-to-face and didn’t) then waited another week and reached out on LinkedIn. He never read my message and never replied. 

This morning, I received a generic rejection email. Should I even bother to email the recruiter again to ask for feedback?  After his blatantly ignoring me for five weeks, I feel like he wouldn’t answer anyway. 

I know that recruiters are busy, and they get tons of emails, but why is it so hard to get anyone to contact me in any way?  Most jobs I apply for, I get a generic rejection email. I’ve been applying for almost a year, and I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. When I was in sales years ago, I had no problems getting to final interviews and getting jobs. Now I have a MPH and work in marketing, and I can’t even get a face-to-face interview. I had a few last year (when I had interviewed at the company above), but since then, it’s been crickets.

I have recently been juggling whether or not to get my MBA. Here's my situation:

I am in my early 20's graduated with my bachelors in finance about 3-4 years ago after graduating early. For the past 3-4 years I have been in and out of accounting to finance positions. Currently I work in a senior accounting position managing a department of 3 (non-staff accountants, not an accounting manager). My short-term/Medium term goal right now is to work as a senior financial analyst in a medium to large size company, or an accounting manager (upward progression). Eventually I would want to be head of corporate valuations or a controller/CFO. Would 100% like to stay corporate and non-bank, I like my work life balance.

I recently came across an opportunity to go back and get my MBA with a concentration in Finance. Not a top 10 school however AACSB accredited, and a lot cheaper. The MBA in finance would kill two birds with one stone for me, as I need 3 more classes that I can't afford to be eligible for my CPA, plus the MBA part would be great too.

Currently I have around 20k in debt from my bachelors. This is not overwhelming in any means, and very manageable. After grants, scholarships etc. I would be looking to add another 20k to my debt in order to finish the whole masters program.

I'm kind of yo-yoing back and forth as to whether or not this would be worth taking on the new debt. I realize top 10 schools would be better for job, networking all that, however it's just simply out of my means as it stands right now.

Would this be a reasonable decision to go? Just looking for some advice and wise words from all you more experienced working class.

[xpost from askHR]",jobs,"So this is going to be a long post, but I want to make sure I explain the entire situation in hopes that I can get some opinions on what my next steps should be.

I'm in the US btw.

I'll start off with explaining that I was hired 3 years for position A. Hiring manager, and my reporting manager were incredible! One of the best things about this job was that they offered complete flexibility on working from home as needed, and there was no hard start-time. 

I was blessed with some great genes.

One being asthma since birth... which sometimes leads to pneumonia during the colder months. And the other is my kidney disease... which brings kidney stones, and causes me to be frequented with gout flare-ups. Whenever I have a gout flare-up, it'll last anywhere from 2 days, to 3-4 weeks. During which, I have a really tough time walking, sometimes not even being able to put a shoe on. So the job I took had to be completely flexible with working from home as necessary.

It also offered me the flexibility to help my in-laws (who are retired and disabled), and be home with my elderly dog when necessary. It was one of the main reasons I took the job. And I fell in love with this job. More and more every day. Was thriving in my role, and was working with some very awesome co-workers. First year review was great - 4/5 (and he noted he never gives out 5s. there's always room to improve, but couldn't really think of anything in particular with me. Raise #1 was alright. Didn't expect much, as it was my first year with the company.

Shortly after the first year, my then-manager mentioned that there was another team in need of someone with my skill-set and he thought it'd be a great fit as they were really in need of the help. He moved me to the new team, and I was situated with a new manager. Manager 2 was extremely supportive in furthering my career goals, and we clicked really well. Meetings with him were a blast, we'd geek out about technology for an hour+. Working with the new team during my 2nd year was great. I was learning more skills, and my opinion was being asked by department heads, on various important decisions. 

My 2nd year review was again, great. 4.5/5. Said that I should spend time writing more tests, and possibly get into automation if I ever wanted to chase a 5. The others on my team all have a different job title than me. They all went towards being full-stack developers, whereas I went more of the front-end UX/UI focus route. It's where my passion is, and is something I'm able to contribute to fully. Raise #2 was better than the first... and was on par with the work I was completing. No complaints about anything I did. Whenever I, or anybody on the team needed to work from home, it was perfectly okay. He knew we were all working, and that ""we're all adults here."" Treated us all like grownups, and showed us that respect. Something neat that this manager did, was introduce a 'completely optional learning objective', where we could choose to learn something new... to encourage us to keep learning. You could take time during the work-day to do this, too. If you chose to do it, it'd be noted on your annual review, and was something you could choose to demonstrate to the department heads. I was actually excited to do this. Did a learning objective to further my knowledge in a front-end programming language. Built a dummy site. It was small, but I learned a ton. But the important thing to remember here was that he helped get me excited about it.

Fast forward a half a year, and manager 2 got a job with a different company. Our team was given a new (much less experienced) manager... Manager 3. This is where things started going downhill. I'm sorry if I ramble on with any of this. I've never been so angry and sad about something like this.

So from the very beginning, there wasn't that great vibe, or connection I had with my previous managers. Manager 3 was constantly over-involving themselves in every meeting, and all of our planning (which isn't something any of the previous managers did.) The micro-management was obvious. Constantly asking how to get us to produce more work, ignoring the fact that we've been over-delivering for the past 2 years. Completely disregarding the work that we complete, and just constantly looking for more, more, more. Culture/Personality mismatch... 100%.

Manager 3 they started over-doing the individual meetings with us. Remember that 'completely optional learning objective' that manager 2 started? Manager 3 started pushing this as something that we should do... while continuing to call it 'optional'. Totally turned me off to wanting to do it... because not only was Manager 3 pushing this previously optional thing as a soft-requirement, they would tell you what they think you should do for it. Manager 3 wanted me to learn server-side coding, so I could become a full-stack developer, so I could ""contribute to more work"" - as if my days weren't already slammed packed with other work. So I say that I'm not interested in the optional learning objective, and that most of my days are already packed with work. Manager 3 also started speaking up during the personal meetings about wanting people to not working from home as much. I explained that some days I need to work from home for 'medical reasons', and it was something that I, and the company agreed to when I took this job.

During her first 6 months, I'm involved on multiple things, from UI wire-framing, to finishing stories for features, to resolving defects. Lead the entire design, and wire-frame process for multiple key features on a product we frequent. This was something I thought would be notable for a great review. Wouldn't you guess... Manager 3 gave me a god damn 3/5, and under critical notes explained that I didn't opt into doing the optional learning objective. I also got a smaller raise than I had in previous years. 

All and all, this review was a complete slap in the face to all of the hard work I put in, and money I both made for the company, and saved the company by reducing the amount of resources necessary in the design/mockup process. It didn't discourage me to the point of not working... I was really just disappointing that it was completely ignored. 

The next ~3 months, continued doing similar work, and manager 3 was constantly making comments about the team not working from home as much. Mind you, this isn't a company policy that they were trying to enforce. And sometimes, people are actually unable to make it into work due to health reasons. We're human.

Another month passes, and this is where things get very... inappropriate. This was around the time where we began working on strictly server-side code for a project. Something that I explained that I'm not at all experienced in. I explained that I'd work alongside other developers, and hopefully learn as we go by observing. It wasn't realistic that I'd learn an entire programming language all while also owning and completing stories. I didn't say this, but it's worth mentioning that none of said language, or skill set was described in my job description... and that work was way above my pay-grade.

So I end up catching pneumonia... which completely knocked me off my feet with Thanksgiving just a week away. Had to go to the ER as I couldn't breathe. Asthma going crazy. It was awful. At that point, I had been out sick for 5 days... when I all of a sudden get an email to come in for a personal meeting the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I'm still sick at this point, so I angrily get dressed, and go in for said meeting.

Manager goes and asks how I'm doing, and follows that up with a discussion about how ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature..."" I'm dumbfounded at this point. The nerve to even say something like this... I explained that I'm still very much sick, have ER/doctors notes if necessary. But working while having pneumonia is just about the craziest thing I've ever heard. I explained that it sometimes takes people weeks to fully get over it. 

I don't think it's at all appropriate for a manager to make any comment about any illness, infection, or disease. If there was any policies, or company rules broken, then that needs to be addressed. But I hadn't broken any. I had sick time, and was using it as needed. I left after the meeting, still sick. Luckily had the two-day Thanksgiving break, and weekend to fight it off.

Got the news late Wednesday night that my grandfather passed away. that was miserable. Funeral/wake on Friday.

We still had Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday as planned. Never having eaten turkey on Thanksgiving as an adult, for whatever reason, I did this year. And boy, do I regret that decision entirely. Turns out, turkey is loaded with purines and is incredibly bad for people who suffer from gout. 

OH JOY! The next morning, my entire foot was swollen... and I couldn't put any pressure on it. At all. I've never had gout flareup the entire foot before, normally just effects my toe. I stubbornly tried ignoring it at first, limped down the street walking the dogs. I knew as soon as I got back in that I was very much doomed for the foreseeable future, with easily one of the worst gout flareups I've ever experienced. Here I am, pneumonia-gout ridden. I'm a total mess at this point. Couldn't put my shoe on, couldn't walk, couldn't do much at all. 

Luckily by late Saturday/early Sunday, the antibiotics finally killed my pneumonia. Unfortunately for me, my arch nemesis gout, remained with me. Sunday night the pain got so bad, I had to go to the ER. I was there until 6am on Monday... and a round of anti-inflammatory pills. After spending the entire previous night at the ER, I had to take another sick day on Monday. But emailed in that I'd be working from home on Tuesday ('for medical reasons'). Still suffering from the flareup, I worked from home the rest of the week. I made sure to participate in every meeting, and make my presence known. I wanted to make sure it was apparent I was working.

So that takes us to today. I finally made it back into the office! Had a semi-swollen toe, but it wasn't nearly as painful. Manager schedules another personal meeting with me, right after our morning team meetings. We get into the meeting and immediately felt the negative mood shift. Manager asks 'if I'm doing any better' (different tone than them previously asking how I was doing.) Then again, immediately going into their concerns over the past few weeks, and how I haven't shown any improvement.

I bluntly just looked at her, and explained that I've had pneumonia, gout and a death in the family all in the last month. Explained again that if necessary, I'd have doctors notes, to which they replied ""not necessary."" I explained that when I have a gout flareup, I'm unable to walk. Which means, I'm unable to safely drive. I'm able to sit in a chair at home and work from home without problem though. Manager replied ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more."" I replied, that ""as long as I'm able to successfully work, it's wildly inappropriate to even suggest that I email my specific medical status."" I then asked if I should go speak to HR regarding my kidney disease, and work with them in allowing me to work from home as I need to... manager replied that ""we could both go and talk with them together.""

I've just about had it at this point. I have a kidney disease that I know one day will eventually kill me. And this manager is basically saying that coming into the office is more important than my comfort.

So I guess my question is:

Do I speak with HR regarding this? Or do I go directly above the manager's head to their manager? How would I approach HR, without this setting off landmines and losing my job over escalating this. What protections do I have legally (if any)?

Sorry for the long post... any advice would be greatly appreciated.



**TL/DR**:
Worked for current company for a little over 3 years. Took job because of the 'flexible work environment' which allowed me to work from home as needed. I have kidney disease, and pretty bad asthma. The kidney disease causes me to get gout frequently, and the asthma is just something I have to cope with during the cold months. When I have a bad gout flareup, I can't walk at all. First two managers let me work from as needed, treated me as an adult. New manager is fussing over me not getting as much done due to me being out sick.

Actual quotes: 

> ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature...""

...

> ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more.""

1386,1n1la7,False,[advice],22,How I received multiple offers in a couple of months,jobs,"1) Find a job that you like. I find that LinkedIn is the best, Monster and other sites work well too.

2) Find many jobs. Even if you are skeptical you might turn out to like the company or the people. Also it's better to mess-up an interview at a company you don't like than your dream job. Interviewing is a skill like anything else it gets better with practice. Nothing is better practice than getting out and doing it.

3) Find the right person. If you can on LinkedIn find out who posted the job and contact them directly. Always ask for advice. I would put the subject line as ""Advice for someone interested in working at Company name"". Then I would ask for advice. It would really help me stand out from the crowd of people who just hit apply now.

4) Follow up. Many people are busy, don't hesitate to follow up a couple of times.

5) Write thank you cards. They're a small touch but help you stand out.

6) Be prepared. Know about the company and people that you're interviewing you.

7) Keep track of everything. I like Evernote and would have a note on each company. What I did to contact them, when I followed up, who I spoke to, what my next step was. I also set a quota of finding 10 jobs a day to apply to.

I have a meeting tomorrow morning with the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager at the supermarket I work at in Australia, it is a large supermarket chain. I will not name them, however, I recently made a complaint to my line manager after I experienced inappropriate behaviour from the duty managers supervising the night shift that I worked (several times).

Among other things, the following happened:

* Duty manager kept us in the store after midnight when our shifts had finished, yelled at the team and team supervisor saying we had ""no sense of responsibility, never have and never will"" as we didn't finish putting away all of the stock (short staff, 2 new people on the shift)
* Duty manager confronted me in the bathroom on a 3-hour shift by the duty manager, 3-hour shifts have no break and I was told I was not allowed to use the bathroom during the shift
* Yelled at for purchasing a drink during my shift (again, 3 hours with no break) after I forgot to bring one, which is fine, but it took longer to lecture me about it than it did for me to buy the drink
* Told that ""heads will roll"" if I did the wrong thing

After experiencing this and general inappropriate behaviour and expressions from these duty managers, plus, having other staff share in my feelings, I made a complaint to the line manager and said I would consider resigning.

The store manager then contacted me and has requested a meeting tomorrow to discuss what I have said. I feel like this will be held against me at work and that I can't go back.

1422,3jaxn4,False,[advice],4,Advice on Job Offers (x-post from r/Biology),jobs,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me advice on two job offers that were offered to me. First, I'd just like to give a little bit more info about myself.


I am a recent graduate as a biology student (B.S.). I have no previous lab or work experience since I focused majority of my time in school, so I am VERY excited and grateful to have any job offers at all. In the future, I hope to transition into more computer science / software engineering, or maybe even something like bioinformatics. Since I am thinking of going that route, I am also thinking about going back to school to either get a M.S. or another B.S. in CS or SE if I have to. But this is way in the future once I have enough money saved up!


So here are the two offers that were given to me as I looked for a job:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 1**: Lab Assistant (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* $13.27/hr  – No clocking in or out, so it’s kind of like salary.
               -Flexible hours for when to start/leave, and flexible lunch break.
* Accrue PTO hours – 5 hours per paycheck (Every 2 weeks).
* HMO, vision, and dental. 
* 401K available, but no matching.


--Pros: 
* Flexible hours are nice. As long as I work about 40 hrs a week, no one seems to mind what my hours are.
* Not as strict with regards to workplace as long as I finish my work since I would be working with the rest of the lab techs only.
* I am fairly familiar and comfortable with the duties assigned to me.
* I can get great references for future jobs or for grad school (well-known as well as new Ph.Ds). 

-Cons: Quality Assurance for pharmaceutical (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* No overtime. And based on what other workers I have spoken to said, I will usually end up staying longer than 8 hrs per day (~8.5 hrs, sometimes maybe even 9).
* Less money
* Further from my apartment, (~30 minute drive).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 2:** Quality Assurance in Pharmaceutical
* $14/hr for the 1st year as a start, annual performance review. 
* 1 wk vacation for first three years, 2 wks after three years, 3 wks after five years.
                -3 sick days per year.
* HMO, vision, and dental included after 30 days.
* 401K after 90 days +$250 annually for contributing to 401K.

--Pros:
* More money is always nice. With this, I make almost an extra $100+ a month, and almost $1000+ more annually.
* Overtime (1.5 hrs) for whenever I work after given hours.
* Closer to my apartment (>10 minutes away using side streets).
* Less wet-lab work.

Cons: 
* Most of the tasks that will be assigned to me are things I know little to nothing about.
* Stricter start/end and lunch times since I have to clock in and out. 
* I don't know if references for this job will be as useful as the other in the future. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my questions are: 
1. Which job offer would be better to take?
2. Which job offer will be more beneficial financially?
3. Which job offer will be more beneficial in the future career-wise, or would help me reach my future goals better?

My boss (their sister) would literally not give me any work and then complain about me not working. She would not give me any guidance and then accuse me of not taking initiative, how am I supposed to take initiatives on things I don't know about. And then they told me in the firing meeting that they thought I would just come in and take over the responsibilities on my own. Seriously how? They literally told me nothing about what I'm supposed to do except help their sister. Thats the only job description I got. Besides, we didn't have much projects over the summer, and I perfectly worked them last one and another one I was working on. When they hired me they didn't look at my transcripts or anything although I offered. Geez people are weird man. I'm honestly glad I got fired. It's like a burden being lifted. Seriously feeling so much better. Because this whole time I really thought I was the one to blame. My confidence is back. 
Sidenote: people who spend that much time with their family seem weird to me.

349,bc7t5x,False,Discipline,5,I’m a recruiter for internships at my organization. Just hired a graduate assistant and NOW learn from someone else that she’s a horrible employee,jobs,"So to put this in context. I’m 23 years old, a recent college graduate, and I work at a research organization within a university. I’m a very recent hire and my job is to recruit student workers, volunteers, interns, grad assistants, etc. And basically be their “boss” aka I have the power to hire, pay, and fire them. Which is a HUGE responsibility! 

To get to the problem, I hired a grad assistant and I just had orientation with her this morning. One of my coworkers recognizes her, pulls me aside IMMEDIATELY and tells me “that girl does NOT do her work, she doesn’t get along with anyone, she has an attitude, and she’s overall a bad employee”. This is from a past experience working with her, I guessed.

I just submitted all her hiring paperwork to HR, and she’s here to stay for at least the next year, is what I told her. I’m supposed to talk to her actual boss tomorrow and warn her about this girl. Also, this girl is 30 and I’m scared she’s not going to take me seriously if i try to talk to her about her performance. This is one of the reasons I don’t like being in charge of people my own age, or older.

I don’t know, I’m trying to prepare for every scenario possible in my head and I’m freaking out. It’s not like I can fire her but I feel like I really screwed up and I should have seen this coming when we interviewed her in the first place. She SEEMED like a great candidate, she clearly had the experience necessary for the job, but the way she talked was very off-putting and it really didn’t seem like she would fit, but we had to hire someone and she was the only “good” candidate.

Basically I don’t know how to discipline people if they are not complying with our policies or not completing work assignments.

1057,git0uj,False,Covid-19,6,Employer Forcing People Out - How to respond?,jobs,"
I work at a very small recruiting firm and was furloughed along with a few other coworkers due to Covid. A few weeks ago, because of the PPP loan, we were brought back. Since then leadership at my company seems to be doing everything they can to force people to quit, and this has escalated as we slowly transition back to the office this week. A few examples:
- If we are not “productive” enough or if we break any of the new procedures we will be sent home without pay for 14 days
- CEO outlined mask requirement in his plan but offline said he doesn’t care if we wear them or not. Also told us we are forcing ourselves back into the office because we failed at working from home
- I asked questions about the mask policy, what we’d do if someone becomes sick, etc. and received a link to the CDC as a response
- A coworker has an autoimmune disease and has been going into the office - they were asked if they’d prefer to just resign since that would be easier for the company 
- I asked to take PTO today instead of going into the office and was also asked the same question over the phone

Overall, I don’t know what to do. They’ve created a stressful, toxic environment that’s hard to deal with. I don’t want to get forced out but don’t know what to when it feels like they have all the power. At this point I’m just trying to wait til June when the funds will run out and they’ll probably lay me off. Until then, any advice? 

TL;DR - my employer is creating policies and procedures to force folks to quit so they won’t have to pay for unemployment or have to pay back the PPP loan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/git0uj/employer_forcing_people_out_how_to_respond/,12,"If you wind up quitting, file for unemployment compensation due to constructive dismissal.

33,g532nh,False,Rejections,4,Feedback from Rejected Internal Position,jobs,"So I finally received feedback after asking a month ago about why I wasn’t selected for an internal position and I am more annoyed and bitter then before.  The position in question was the next higher up position in our department and I was the only one who was internal.  At first my boss said it would just need to be posted three days as an internal posting but then no action was taken to interview for it for months.  I finally get my interview scheduled directly after multiple meetings by my boss so that I wasn’t even able to prepare.  On top of this, the interview committee is made up only of my boss and coworker.  I thought the interview went as well as could be, but turns out I didn’t have the skills she was looking for based on her vision for the position which wasn’t even how the job description read.

Anyways after asking for feedback when I was rejected and receiving no acknowledgement on the matter, suddenly I get my answer when it is now time to train people.  My boss’ answers felt like excuses to me.  She claimed her committee was neutral, but I don’t know how that was possible when the two that interviewed me were my bosses and she even stated she would have liked to hear more of my examples from my current role even though I provided examples from all of my previous positions.  What really got me was the statement that she felt I did not offer to help out enough and learn new areas of the office.  This was like a slap in the face as I have frequently asked to learn new things with no reply from either of them.  Additionally, apparently she claims she knows I do a great job and she doesn’t need to question my work but feels I don’t communicate to her.  When I started and anytime I take on a project she has always said I don’t need to keep her informed of every step, yet now she claims she wants project check in emails all of the time.  I feel I always either tell one or the other how projects are and what is complete, so I feel the communication problem is on her side.  

I’m just frustrated because even though I stated my feelings on everything and my place in our hierarchy I still feel like she doesn’t get it.  It apparently is an unreasonable request that either of my two bosses take on any lower duties that are outside their job responsibilities but since I’m apparently just a great hand at my current job, I get to do my duties and the training duties of the job I didn’t get without getting paid more.

So I went to a staffing agency , and they have been disorganized , flakey , and have lied  to me about the jobs , the location of the job and the pay . 

They got me in there by saying they had something “perfect” for me and they could match me at 14.50$ hour ,

Now , their “clients “ can’t match my rate and they want me to basically start telemarketing at 8am to 5pm in their office as a “junior recruiter “ 

Monday and Friday they texted me last minute saying that the boss was in a meeting and I only needed to come in at 12 . 

Today I slept past my alarm bc we lost electricity last night . I have to be honest I don’t feel so bad bc they haven’t been consistent . 

My friend went to a different agency and she said she got the similar run around . They didn’t have the jobs they said in the interview. But they could use her “internally” 

One thing I thought was weird during my time there was how my “boss” said she had to always beg people to come to work . But the handbook basically says if you leave voluntarily , you can’t get unemployment .

Since then, I’ve re-entered graduate school in a field I was more interested in.  I did so because I had been struggling with finding a permanent, full-time position with my experience since April, and I figured I could transition to a career I really wanted.

I’m currently in my second semester. I have had atrocious luck finding work, because retail managers know based on my resume that the work is temporary for me, but appropriate positions (temp and full-time) haven’t been pulling through.

Fast forward to this Thursday. I’ve been working with a recruiter, and she’s been extremely helpful (rare, I know). I interviewed at a place that was the best fit I’ve ever had, based on their culture, location, compensation, and growth opportunities.

The first person I spoke to, my would-be manager, loved me. The second person also seemed to really like me, but he asked me what I’ve been doing since July. I told him I was in graduate school. He didn’t seem to recoil at all, but Friday I heard from the recruiter that they really liked me, but they were afraid that I wasn’t looking to work “in a permanent position” because of school. I’ll have to wait until Monday to hear the results.

I'm a Data Scientist who deals in analytics in the infrastructure industry, and I didn't need to get the Master's (or Ph.D.), but when I started out as an analyst over a decade ago, I still had a pretty solid background in statistics, math, programming, and data manipulation from my B.S. in physics.  Much of what I learned in the last ten years (machine learning, Big Data stuff, etc.) has been self-taught from online courses and practicing when opportunities arose at my jobs, but if I didn't have that base from undergrad, it would have all been impossible.

Plus, employers still aren't sure what to make of skills developed through self-study, so the piece of paper from a reputable institution just gets your foot in the door in ways that some line items on your resume about some online courses you took can accomplish.

Otherwise, it's worth getting out into the working world and seeing what experiences you can drum up as an entry-level analyst, trying to grow and build your skills outside of work in parallel.

I was inching closer to leaving my job before the whole COVID thing started (as in, when my country went into full lockdown I had a four week timeline to start looking for the next job). 

But then this whole thing exploded and I got trapped here, in a job that basically exhausted its possibilities and with bosses that don't take our health seriously. Even if a lot of us could work from home full time, they still make us go to the office one or two days a week. 

I'm personally not happy with that and I'd like to look for another job, but I'm not sure how good of an idea it would be.

On the other hand, we don't know where lockdown will finish and, particularly, how the job market will be when it ends. Somehow I get the feeling that waiting until then might be waiting too much because it may be much harder to find a job during recession.

861,fdn91a,False,Education,10,Is it bad to just get an Associates Degree?,jobs," Hello,

I am 18 and currently attend a community college and only plan to do the needed two years to earn my Associates Degree, and not transfer to do a Bachelor's.

Is it bad to just have an Associates Degree? Can I still get into good paying jobs with two years? How much does GPA really matter with a 2 year degree?

My reasoning:

Firstly, I have extremely severe issues focusing on studies (will be getting diagnosed by a doctor in the next few weeks, I believe I have very strong ADD) This is the majority of the reason why I do not want to do two more years.

I am ***not*** saying the following to ""flex"" (so please do NOT say that in the comments thank you!!), but to give more context upon my situation.

I am not in a desperate need for money, I am fortunate enough to own two vehicles and soon my own place to live all which my parents have graciously provided me (I am very fortunate I know). They cover a majority of the needed costs + I have a delivery driving job that I make decent pay from. Possibly after a year or two of being moved in I plan to get a roommate to pay me rent so that will be an extra source of income.

Of course I want to be successful on my own, this is my reason for attending college in the first place. I try my very hardest, but end up with a C average.

Planning to go into business or marketing or IT. My goal is to eventually start up my own car customization shop.

Thank You for reading, Again please no trashtalking me for having all this stuff given to me. I already deal with that criticism IRL and do not need it here.

USE YOUR HEAD, USE YOUR HEAD!"" \*while pointing to his head aggressively\*  My co-worker is soft-natured and this affected her so she went to him later in his office and confronted him about him trying to act like a big shot in front of the higher employees by disrespecting her and that it would have been better for him to have told her about her mistake privately. He apologized and it was over.

Or so I thought.

I keep hearing small anecdotes from her here and there about how he chewed out the last girl in my position when she would make a small mistake and how he's chewed others out. I guess what I am trying to ask is, what is the best way to handle such situations? If that had happened to you what would you have done? In my opinion, he seems insecure as he makes me do more of the technical work on Microsoft office since he is an older fellow (mid-50's) but, does not admit that he does not know how to do it. Instead, he acts like I ""helped"" him out due to his ""high work load"". He also acts differently when the government employees are present since we're contractors. How does one handle someone who could potentially be demeaning and rude at work? I do like my job but, I want to avoid being embarrassed publically.

Let me add to this: Yes, he is my direct supervisor but, the project manager is the boss for both of us and is much more professional in nature. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h7yuuq/concerned_about_supervisor_behaviordisrespect/,2,,2020-06-13 02:35:47

She has said she is doing me a favor by asking me to remove this as a future employer would look down on this. 

I will be speaking to her supervisor tomorrow, but she keeps saying my contract came to a ""natural end,"" which is strange to me because I quit. She has emphasized that I don't say anything bad about her or the job once it is done, however, once my notice period is up, I am confused over what she can even do....and at this point since I'm within my notice period, I am still confused as to what she can do to me for vaguely mentioning my unhappiness on social media.

Hi all, new to this sub. Looks like a good one to watch from here on, but came here specifically with the following question:

I've started looking for a new job recently and have started getting a lot of emails/Linkedin messages from recruiters. Not company recruiters, but recruiters that work for a recruiting company if that makes sense. Most of the offers so far are way off and don't at all pertain to me. I have just been replying with a polite I'm not interested right now, but will keep you in mind in the future type of message.

However, I have had some that are offering what I'm looking for. One in particular works for a recruitment company, but based on their linkedin profile seems to be tied with the company that she is offering positions for. This company is a big well known company that I would be thrilled to get a job for. I'm following through with the recruiter for the position that they brought to my attention, but there are numerous other positions on that company's website that would fit with me. Should I keep with the recruiter for those as well and just tell them I am applying for the other positions? Does going through a recruiter hurt your chances of getting a job?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g67x4i/how_to_deal_with_recruiters/,2,"It’s advisable if they haven’t already submitted you. In most cases agency candidates are at a disadvantage because they cost 15-20% more than direct applicants due to placement fees. Most internal talent organizations have a mandate to minimize agency spend and in a lot of situations, they don’t actually give the agencies a job - the agencies find the same listing, source candidates and then present them in the hopes that they’ll get approved to work on the search. So at least ask about the relationship with the client, but if they don’t have exclusivity (which only really happens in exec search for full time roles), then make sure you apply before they submit you so that they don’t get credit for the submission and you don’t have to rely on them to negotiate an offer (a major PITA).

Hi,

as the title suggests, I'm torn between these two fields. I'm set on beginning studying this fall, and don't know which one to choose. Below are pros and cons that I see. What do you think about this? 

**Engineering/Architecture:**

This programme is a double degree, in both Engineering and Architecture. 

Pros:

* I enjoy the creative and aesthetic aspect. I am almost certain I would be a good architect. 

* I have some sort of business vision

* I enjoy maths

* I enjoy building (construction)

Cons: 

* Worried I won't feel like I'm helping humanity/individuals; that I would lack meaning. 

* I worry that I might be mislead by the apparent praise/value/prestige a double degree is given, while I only value the engineering degree (apart from my appreciation for maths) as far as a merit to retreive higher positions and pay in future jobs. Solely a degree in architecture, I reason, would not be enough to speedily propel me toward my end goal (having my own business, being self-employed). 

* no higher purpose, other than the fact that I enjoy the ideation of living spaces. 




**Physician:**

Pros:

* Actually helping individuals on a daily basis; altruism; reducing the amount of suffering in the world.

* Opportunities for research, which could have a significant impact, and would probably feel meaningful.

* Working with people, as opposed to sitting behind a computer designing houses for the middle/-upper class. 

Cons:

* Lacks the creative aspect. (Might be wrong?)

* I haven't ever really been interested in neither chemistry nor biology in school. However, one's interests change through life. It is common that what once has been deemed uninteresting, later in life is discovered to be very interesting. My stated disinterest in chemistry and biology is not to be taken as completely true, as I'm not too familiar with the subjects, other than from high school, really. 

* (Difficult education. However, I am from Sweden so it's not as bad as in the US, same goes for working conditions)


Basically it is, as I see it, personal enjoyment with a struggle to find meaning VS. meaning with a struggle to find personal enjoyment. Which is preferable? Am I missing something? Any help/input would be highly appreciated. Thank you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fgi2xm/career_choice_engineeringarchitecture_or_physician/,0,"In what universe does engineering NOT help humanity?

Bridges , buildings, houses.. society need those things.

You are comparing direct vs indirect help. If you prefer day to day interaction with people and want to feel good about directly helping someone then be a doctor.

Being an engineer means you will more than likely not see the end results of your labor even after months of work or directly see the faces of those who will use your product. ",2020-03-10 18:04:24
2248,8qp029,False,Startups,0,"Young CPA major career change - thinking about starting a paving company, need practical advice",jobs,"I'm 29 years old and have been a CPA for the past 6 years, working at the same job for 10 in your typical office setting. The job itself isn't overwhelmingly difficult, nor is it very fulfilling. Although it provides me with great financial security, other factors have been building up that have made me resent the job (I'm sure I'm among many in saying this). 


The paving company idea came up with a life long friend who is a heavy machine operator and technician, who also shares the passion for wanting to build something of their own. My CPA background to this point is being viewed as a means to an end, and can give us the business/finance/tax benefit of pricing/costing/financing the business and assets we acquire.


Basically what I'm looking for is some starting points to acquire the hands on ability to pave and gain as much knowledge on the field that I can prior to starting the business. My initial considerations are as follows, along with some other important points to note:


1) Ideally structure my departure from work at end of Summer/18 and in a way so that I can receive unemployment 

2) Take heavy machine operators course throughout the Winter/18

3) Work in the industry for a local paving company throughout the 2019 season to try and obtain as much hands on knowledge as I can

4) Come up with business model and acquire appropriate assets in offseason Winter 2019. Basic business to start will be paving/sealing/patching driveways, which would limit our initial capital outlay when compared to more commercial paving equipment/staffing requirements

5) From what I have read so far, the general machinery will consist of a single axel dump truck, 1-2 ton rolling machine, small paving machine (or could we get away with shovels/brooms to start), a hauling trailer and other miscellaneous tools i.e. tamper etc.

6) I have accessible capital of about $130,000. My life long friend also has sufficient capital to finance machinery/other start up costs


I know this is very rough, and obviously so much more consideration has to go into this plan. But at the end of the day, I want to do something outside for a living, I am prepared for gruelling work, and I want to build something for myself. I would appreciate any other advice with respect to the career path in general or how to best prepare/educate myself before starting the business.

Okay so i'm absolutely terrified that i'm going to get fired and so I've come here for some reassurance or advice or something to try and make me less of a panicky mess.   
I work at a dog boarding facility in Ontario Canada and while my actual work with the dogs is excellent the more practical side of things is a poopshow. We have a set time for cleaning out the kennels and I am constantly lagging behind. I have absolutely no idea why. I am going as fast as I can and  at what is an uncomfortable pace for me and yet i'm always finishing about half hour behind everyone else at the very least.   


I got totally chewed out yesterday for it (and honestly thought I was going to burst into tears because I am apparently a strong independent adult)  and now I have to outline why I cannot meet my time goals to the boss. But....I have no idea?  I literally cannot go any faster, I spend 2+ hours out of breath and covered in sweat as I am actually going full pelt (with all the water on the floor and my clumsiness that's caused a fair few injuries including one fairly nasty head injury, the speed isn't exactly helping my asthma either)  


The only explanation I can think of is that I am dyspraxic which often makes people slower than their peers at physical tasks but...that feels like a lame excuse? I have disclosed I have dyspraxia to my boss but it felt like I was making excuses there again.   


Maybe i'm just an idiot or being lazy or something? I seriously don't know.

&#x200B;

So can I be fired for being slow?  Can they fire me despite offering no help or solutions to my slowness?  Is having stunted motor neurons a valid reason for being slow and therefore a reason to fire me?  


I'm freaking out I cannot lose this job, i'd be so screwed if I did...my medical bills would probably be lower though. But then again i'd be homeless so..,

Yesterday, the Project Manager handed in his resignation letter. He knows & does a lot of stuff I don't know how to do or I'm not very good at, like meetings with the clients, figuring out the exact requirements for them ect. Overall just a dude with way more experience that I am, he has around 10+ years in the industry while I only have 2 & around 3 with IT.

What should I do?,jobs,"FYI, I am posting on behalf of my fiance since she doesn't use reddit. I do not want to be too specific. But she works at a major hospital in the states with 4 hospital buildings and a lot of small specialist. She is currently working in a selective surgery field and works in a practice with another pa, 4 doctors, and a few medical assistants and receptionists. They have put the 2 PAs on a rotation with the rest of the office (except the doctors) to clean the office bathrooms more regularly since they will start seeing patients in office for the first time since covid started. They have janitors , but need to wipe it down frequently and for some reason the office manager thought it would be a good idea to make a rotation.  

I just want to say that there is nothing wrong with cleaning bathrooms or janitorial work at all. We both believe no one in that office should be cleaning the bathrooms except for the cleaning staff. She is not working at a small practice and the actual office is located in a large 4 story building all owned by the hospital. They bring millions in every month ekth the surgeries. I was surprised when she told me earlier today and I couldn't believe it. Do they expect her to take off her white coat and start wiping down the bathroom? How is this even safe? When someone is a janitor, they are not expected to exam patients with the same clothes they just cleaned the bathroom in. Just so you know her scope, she does everything the doctors do. She will see a patient pre-op, post-op, help with surgery , and is the main care taker when following the patient long term (up to a few years post op depending on the patient)

They've asked me for ""ideas"" on what to do to improve their social media. They are quite a specialized web service company, and the majority of their clients are in construction and firms. The chill college gent coworker seems like he's got everything on his hands and wouldn't necessarily want help, it could be that taking some work off his plate can give him some down time which will be boring since our manager is quite strict. 

This is just my hunch as it took him very quick to show me what he does: copy and paste from a built-in sheet, read a blog and copy a part of it to re-post. Make sure to use a picture, rinse and repeat. The manager and him were very keen on asking me: ""so if you have any ideas for improving the social media, let us know"".

I don't think they trust me enough with their social media, otherwise they would have personally gave me a role or a page to manage. How can I give them something that can actually give me another job? It would be neat to have a side-thing to do other than sales. As a casual social media user, who also happen to take multiple relative courses (regarding to social media) I have some ideas... Advice would be welcome...

1. Be their ""graphic editor"", I know AI and both of them do not. Basically, what I tried to do with small businesses as a freelancer was re-design their banners every now and then to fit the season, or even include deals as in writing 50% off on the top right of the banner

2. Be an auditor, I can search for irrelevant social media names/pages that they do not have a reach of (I actually don't want to do this) and report after, then what happens when I complete all?

3. A poll creator, basically have my set schedule on when to post a poll to ask followers, it's some form of engagement right? I could be ""okay here is my poll, can you paste this code to their page please""?

Yes, it's the typical position in where he just copies and pastes and automates. I don't think the introduction to Hootsuite would fly as the main boss wouldn't want to spend extra, he mentioned to me of Followerwonk but I know these types of services cost a subscription and yes, I'd like the idea of introducing this once I insert myself as someone who ""can be useful"" in terms of social media. I need to write the two an email soon, but I've already wrote what I know about social media to the manager, after a couple of days, she introduced me to the social media writer guy.

Lastly, It's a little uncanny that they're just asking me for ""ideas"" but I think the work is already cut out for one person, but what do they mean by ""improving""? I almost want to say that they were reluctant on introducing me a new job. I'd very much like to at least have something else to do, the boss has promised me to expand into social media, didn't actually expect that I'd be asked for ""ideas to improve"" if I haven't even gotten the chance to participate in their automation. At the same time, I'm still unskilled as I have no experience in social media, I'm just a sales clerk but would love to expand.

1569,ed39v6,False,Companies,35,"Lots of negative glassdoor reviews, should I be concerned? Has anyone had a positive experience with a company with a lot of bad reviews?",jobs,"They all cite similar things, sound like different people, and HR has clearly put up one or two positive reviews but it's overall negative. Like, one star reviews negative. It's weird to me because you think HR would put up more fake reviews. However despite this, I already went to the training and recently started this job. 

I'm thinking a few things. I think a lot of what these people are saying is *true* but that doesn't really mean it's a bad company if that makes sense. As in, this is a retail-type position so there's inherently always going to be a lot of negative reviews right? On top of that this company only recently entered the market in my country so there's going to be some growing pains in terms of management and organizational structure. I'm wondering if these reviews might be a mix of lack of voice from the positive employee experiences (because they're newer) and maybe fake reviews from competitors astroturfing mixed in because they're a threat to their market. I know they might mostly be real reviews but I'm hoping it's mainly lot of people who just weren't suited for retail. Like I've worked at McDonald's and some other retail stores and it's not as bad as a lot of my coworkers would complain about it. It seems like some people are just not cut out for retail and retail nets a lot of people who are likely to have a bad experience. Sometimes the work experience can be really dependent on the specific team too. I just looked up one of the companies I've recently worked for and it has a much higher rating than I'd expect judging on how rough the store was (it's probably the only retail experience where I genuinely thought it was bad). I might just be doing a bunch of mental gymnastics though here to justify my choice to work here.

I'm just kind of scared and looking for advice or positive experiences if anyone has any to share. It's my first time working in the role I have and there's more responsibility on me than I've had in previous jobs. It's very attractive in terms of benefits and pay, and I think it'll look good on my resume due to the title although it's not at all related to my degree. I just wanted a stable job like this because I've been unemployed for months. There's so many negative reviews online but the team we have seems to be alright. Yes, there is almost constantly work that needs to be done and the hours are crazy right now but it's not *a bunch of one star reviews* bad imo. Then again I've only been here for less than a week.

599,avcc64,False,Qualifications,13,"Working in IT without university degree. Expectations, Pay and Self-Doubt.",jobs,"I'm 28 years old, live in east Germany and work as a software developer since 2012.

Before I started working, I was studying Information Technology, but I aborted my university degree due to self-doubt, laziness, lack of knowledge and my former mindset of never asking for any help at all.

I only barely got my high school diploma too, because I was always stubborn and refused to do anything for school at all, but I was intelligent enough to kind of struggle my way through it anyway with minimal effort and, needless to say, with bad grades.

&#x200B;

Today, I’m living in a city with a fairly small IT sector at around 500k inhabitants.

My current company is fairly liberal when it comes to hierarchy and the need for any degrees. Our CEO always claims to pay people according to their actual performance, quality of work, etc.

That said, every employee in our company still only gets paid fairly poor, based on talk with colleagues and the manager for HR.

&#x200B;

After struggling through school and aborting University, and earning relatively little money compared to my friends (who all graduated, but in different jobs, not IT), I now feel like I’m falling behind. Some of those friends started working after graduating and they (of course) earn way more money, some even up to 1.000€ per month more than what I get paid.

Still, I don’t want to invest another 5 years of going back to university, earning next to no money and in the end maybe not even be intelligent enough to graduate this time. I lack skills even for basic high school maths, and It has been 10 years since I actually had to study.

&#x200B;

In addition, in the past 4 years our company grew and we hired a lot of new developers, and to be honest, I often don’t feel like the ones with a university degree are naturally better than I am.

From my personal experience with my new colleagues I can tell, that not the degree determines how good one is as a developer, but just work experience, ambition and having a knack for logic, abstraction etc.

I talked about this with my CEO, and he was very understanding of my situation. Still, he claims that a University degree won’t help me in the end, because I basically just invest 5 more years into an education that will give me only a better understanding of general mathematics, computer science and of course the diploma/masters degree, but won’t necessarily make me a better developer in the end.

&#x200B;

I’m torn, between my need for validation by earning a university degree, or by earning way more money, so I can get validation from my bank account, and the voice in the back of my head that tells me „The value of a human being is not determined by a degree or money. Don’t put so much stress on yourself, you earn enough money to live comfortable“.

You have also noticed one of things most people notice about higher education graduates, they barely know a thing about doing their job, it's virtually worthless as an indicator of how well they will be as a software developer, the only thing it actually tells you is they were willing to put in the time it take to get the degree.

The only thing a degree will really do for you is open up a few job opportunities, some companies are really hung up on only hiring people with a degree. But currently in our field there are plenty of place you can hop around to, if you just want a raise. With 7 years experience you could (probably, I'm not really familiar with the german job market.) easily find a higher paid job without wasting time and money on a degree.

Leading up to the shutdown, I had 2 jobs lined up. The hotel that housed my nightclub was going to absorb me as one of their employees. I received an email a month ago saying that job has been canceled and they won’t be bringing me on

The other, I was hired, passed background and drug tests with flying colors but orientation was canceled thanks to the shutdowns. After a week of phone calls and emails that got me nowhere I finally was able to visit their employment center (another strip hotel) and I was told I’m not “officially hired until orientation is completed” meanwhile, the manager who interviewed and hired me gave me a call during the shutdown and told me I’d still have a job once they reopened. But I haven’t gotten called yet. The guy at the employment center told me to wait 2 weeks as they’re still getting everything organized and deciding what new hires to bring on and who isn’t. 

Being as this job is as a food server at the pool, the job would have been seasonal anyways and I probably wouldn’t start until July which would only give me 3-4 months worth of work. So I’m doubtful they’ll bring me on

I’m getting more and more anxious as time goes on. I’ve had 2 interviews at 2 off strip bars but nothing looks promising as of yet. 

Prior to moving to Las Vegas all my work experience was in retail, I never made more than $20k a year until I moved here. I made almost $60k in 2019....If I were to take one of those jobs it wouldn’t earn me enough to keep up on a $500 car payment and $1000 a month rent plus everything else, even if I worked 40 hours a week

O*Net is a good one to start with.  This will open other potential careers titles that you can search for, the best part is that they have separate lists for different levels of education.  I made a list of job titles that interest me, started searching job boards for them and reading all their postings and gradually compiling the skills, qualities and education they were looking for and keeping track of how they word things.

I then narrowed down on the titles or field that i thought i would do well and was capable of preparing for.  Then I sat down and wrote out all.my jobs, all my responsibilities --expanded resume, then googled all the hot key words that recruiters are looking for and how to reword to sound active and how my work reflected that skill. Rewrote my resume and cover letter. I then started looking at various certification programs and the price for jobs that needed more training while i was applying for one's that didnt require certs.  I found that cert programs are often cheaper than a degree.

I don't know you and don't know what the work of strip clubs entail, and I'm guessing you're okay with late nights, so that means you are mentally and physically capable of second and third shift.(They generally pay more)  You are able to multitask or prioritize tasks because you are dealing with loud high energy fast pace people and space.  You are very self aware, you know how to work as a team,  you value safety,  you able to quickly respond to situations, and you probably have great communication skills.

From retail, you have developing customer rapport, understanding customer needs, point of sales experience, teamwork, prioritising , understand chain of command, and maybe creating sale displays.

And the country is slowly reopening. Keep job boards on your phone,  indeed,  glassdoor, linked in.

And you can also spend the time creating a more professional social media personality.  Go through your Facebook, Twitter etc create a Linkedin There are lots of job coaches on youtube too that you listen to.

They first called on November 14th for a first screening, then scheduled for a skype interview on december 5th, then gave me an offer on december 11th.  The offer however was just an email congratulating me for passing the last interview and asking me for the date I'd like to start (maximum was january 6th) so they could put it in the contract, I emailed on the same day of the congratulatory email stating I can make it for the 30th of December. One week later and no contract was sent, and the tickets were getting increasingly expensive due to holiday season.

Although it's been sort of in the back of my head that this could be a scam (it was all very easy, but they also needed someone with my background desperately), they all had @company name, had full linkedin profiles with profile picture and everything, the skype interview matched their linkedin faces, and the company has its own website, linkedin profile, linkedin submissions and articles, so I'm sure it's all legitimate. However I still got uneasy given how sudden I needed to move out to work and how easy the interview process was so I have emailed them earlier today, and they confirmed they'd need me there on January 6th, and supposedly they were meant to have attached the offer letter in the email for me to sign and didn't do that, so I sent them another email asking for it in case they had forgotten.

I'm sorry if it seems a bit confusing, but this process has been all over the place. Rushed and at the same time slow and I don't know if I should just be waiting for them or if it's OK to email them for these inquiries.

Today is Monday, she walks in and is told by management that her assignment ends today and that her last assignment is to train her replacement.

I started this position about 5 months ago and it's been fine so far, nothing special but it's the highest paid job I've had so far (I'm 25).

Anyways, my working hours are 8:00 - 4:30 (I am supposed to take a 30 minute lunch, but I usually just end up working while I eat). Even before and after I get home from work, I am still responding to some work emails on my phone (which I'll count on my time sheet even though I am **salaried**).

When I got into work today, my boss told me that 'things are all about perception' and has asked me to stay until at least 5, if not longer. He then went on to say that a new (as in started 3 weeks ago) business development 'higher-up' noticed that me leaving at 4:30 just means that I am apparently not busy enough... Even though I have great time management skills and am able to do all my work in the allotted 8 hours while at work.

I was then asked if I could start working 9 - 11 hours every day, and then asked me to start taking on more responsibilities (I just checked out my job description (I can find it on our ATS, and the job description is only about 50% of what I actually do).

So not only do they want me to work 3 extra hours every day, just for ""perception"", they also want me to start doing way more than what I was originally told I'd be doing. So I'm not very happy.

1241,cioof8,False,Onboarding,6,Nothing explained on the first day?,jobs,"I started a job today, at a dog boarding/grooming facility. I am in the US. 

Keep in mind, I was under the impression I would fill out all necessary paperwork (W-4, how I’d be paid) this morning. 

Got there at 8, put me right to work. Took the dogs out to go potty all morning. Got told, “Start taking them out.” No knowledge of any of the dogs’  temperaments, no info about them. Just start working. 

Would have been nice to know liability info in case one of the dogs bites. A couple of them were aggressive towards me, and it took 5-10 minutes to track someone down for help. 

The manager there expected me to already know their policies and how to do things and was getting upset I didn’t know what I was doing. The other girl there said she’s super hard on new people and just want people to do their job. I just started; I at least want a chance! 

She said on weekends it’s super busy so I don’t get the”luxury” of a lunch break, so I need to bring food or call some in. (Eat while working, I guess?) I don’t get breaks either. I’ll be working 10-11 hours on the weekend. I can work, but not that long without a break. 

I went home, quickly ate, went back, and asked the girl at the front when I’ll fill out my paperwork. She didn’t know.....she said she didn’t have hers filled out for months. 

So then the manager comes back out and says it could be weeks before my stuff is filled out, and that’s just the way they do things there. 

I said any job I’ve had, I had to have that info filled out before I could even start. She said there it’s different, and they’re all friendly with each other and I shouldn’t worry whether I’d get paid, that it would happen.

2121,9yv1sq,False,Layoffs,5,Can you put a price on job security?,jobs,"  

I am a mid-level manager for a very large BPO, work from home on the west coast, and have an overall team of 19 individuals located in other countries that I manage remotely. I’m a college dropout that started entry level, and worked my way up through the company starting in 2010. 4 years ago, my current employer acquired my previous one, and I survived the acquisition with a pay increase and increased responsibilities. Well, now my current employer has been acquired by another company, and my hopes of surviving this acquisition are very low for a variety of reasons. 

&#x200B;

This has been a roller coaster of employment for the entire 8 years I’ve worked for this company, and the go-to motto is “Embrace Change” but that usually means layoffs, restructuring, and other negative things. I love my job, the work that I do, and the people that I manage, but I’ve rarely gone more than 2 months at a time without a sinking feeling or sense of dread that I’d be next on the list of RIFs. All in all, every single person that I counted as a friend has been laid off over the last 3 years, and I am all that's left.

&#x200B;

Because this is my only real career that I’ve ever had, I have no idea if this horrendous lack of job security is normal for everyone, normal for the industry I’ve gotten sucked into, or only normal for the company that I have the pleasure of working for.

&#x200B;

I’m about to hit the job market again, and would like to get some insight into how much people value job security, or if it’s take-what-you-can-get. I’d love to start, you know, planning to buy a house, but I cannot fathom taking that risk not knowing what’s around the corner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9yv1sq/can_you_put_a_price_on_job_security/,3,"I hate to break it to you, but there is no such thing as job security.

277,bpqs1f,False,Discipline,13,My manager at my second job is knowingly scheduling me outside my availability and is threatening to write me up,jobs,"I'm very frustrated about this entire thing. My manager at my evening job knows that I can only work evenings there and is still scheduling me during the day which overlaps with my day job. I try to get there as soon as I can but I'm always late. 

Yesterday she pulls me aside and tells me that she's scheduling to the store's needs and that I have to work whatever she puts down on my schedule. If I don't then she'll write me up and if it happens again then she'll terminate me. 

Now the big issue I have with this is my original availability that I put down on my application was that I can **only** work evenings. During my interview she never stated that this was a problem. I was never told that it was a problem that I can't work day shifts. This is very ""all of a sudden"" that I need open availability. I assume this sudden change is due to my manager having to manage another store that is currently without a manager so she has not worked at our store in about a month now. But again, I was never told that it was required that my availability be open and she made it clear that me only working closing shifts was fine. That was when I was hired 2 months ago.

The only reason that I did not get into a further altercation with her about my job is because I have another job opportunity elsewhere and I have no issues quitting this job or, if push comes to shove, her firing me. But she has done this with other employees and I'm not certain if I should report this to higher ups for their sake. It's just not fair that we were lead to believe that our availability was fine, when it clearly wasn't and we're getting our jobs threatened because the manager failed to inform us.

I'm not sure how I should go about quitting this job. If I give my 2 weeks notice and she continues to schedule me outside my availability she might just fire me before my last day. I also feel entirely bad for even entertaining the thought of quitting when we're very short staff and our manager is working at another store.

You didn't give your location but in pretty much every single place in the US she can schedule to the stores needs (which have changed since you were hired) and you can quit. That's the way it works.

I was taking classes consecutively that were technically supposed to be pre-requsite classes.

It got to a point where I didn't even apply for jobs for about 3 months because I kept getting so discouraged. I've had a couple of interviews that ended in rejection and I feel like it's because I let my anxiety and self-doubt interfere in the process and wasn't able to seem confident.

Long story short - I got hired right before everything got out of control. I was scheduled to start training the end of March, but I still haven't received word from anyone. I emailed/called to check in and keep myself in the loop, but the manager not once replied to my emails or calls. I'd just like to know if I still have this job or not, because if not then I'll have to start yet another gloriously terrible job search...again.

Whilst waiting for the results of the medical to reach their hr team, covid came along and changed everything. The company overnight enacted a total hiring freeze. Her medical came back flawless and a contract was written and was meant to be getting mailed to her that day, but ultimately due to the new policies this role was no longer available.
The role was never formally rescinded and the hiring manager continued to assure her that they were working on it for over a week before all contact was dropped.

A month or 2 has passed now, and given job uncertainty in the near future we would love to try and find out if this role is still available and ultimately if they'd still be interested in hiring her.

So herein lies the questions,
How would you approach the company to find out if the job offer is still available? What would you even say? 
Would it still be acceptable to ask for the same offered salary particularly given the current climate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/h9f5ax/how_to_get_back_job_offer_taken_away_by_covid19/,16,"Did she give notice at her prior job/is she still employed?

If it was me, I would reach out to the hiring manager or someone I interviewed with -- not HR. They will have a better feel for whether that position will be opening up in the next few weeks/months. Lots of times it depends on departmental politics, and HR isn't always in the loop on that. 

Sometimes hiring freezes end but new job reqs are dropped or go to the bottom of the pile - and by the time they open back up again, it might be a whole new team doing the hiring. 

That said, if this was a vital role and the manager had enough flexibility and authority to immediately offer her several grand above the advertised rate, I think there's still a good chance they still try to offer it to her. 

They needed someone in that role a few months ago.  They'll probably still need someone when this all blows over. ",2020-06-15 12:14:22

I’m a data entry specialist/on air personality/office specialist, basically a jack of all trades in the station. Typically work overnights but work early mornings quite often to help out. 

My boss has it in his head that the national wage is going up to $15/hour and so it has caused him to make snap decisions. He fired two of the girls in the office (who are single moms), a lot of people quit, and he eliminated my position to where I’m only working on weekends now starting January 9th according to the schedule.

He’s anti confrontational and never told me of any of these changes. We’ve heard rumors, but nothing set in stone. I only just found out because a coworker of mine was accidentally looped in with the manager’s email chain talking about the changes. 

Imo, I think the business is going under. He made a very idiotic decision for our sales team to offer 1 ad for 50% off and get another one free, essentially losing ad revenue with doing this deal.

338,7x01ze,False,Discipline,56,"My boss tried to pressure me to come into work, at a restaurant, while I have the flu.",jobs,"This flu epidemic is scary. Last I saw over 70 people have died of it. I work in a franchise diner, as a server, and many of our customers are elderly people. I think it could be extremely irresponsible to put people at risk of getting sick, not to mention putting myself at risk by working night shifts on my feet for 8-10 hours while I'm really sick.

I told her initially that I was afraid I might have caught the flu, and I missed one shift. I had the following three days scheduled off, so I told her that if I wasn't feeling better by my next scheduled shift, I would get a doctor's note. 

I called the afternoon before my next overnight shift, and told them that I was definitely sick, it definitely felt like the flu, and that I'd be going to the doctor ASAP. I asked if I could bring the note in tomorrow, and she immediately got irritated with me, and said that if I didn't bring in my doctor's note before my shift that night, I'd be fired. I told her I'd try to get one today, but either way I didn't think it would be reasonable for me to come in coughing and sneezing, and serve people food and prepare their desserts, etc. She said that's not a good enough excuse, and that I should just come in because ""that's what everyone has to do even if they don't feel good."" She said unless I have a fever, it just sounds like a lot of excuses. 

So I spent 5 hours in the ER on Friday, while they were insanely busy specifically because of the flu. Got a flu test (positive), and they wrote me a note saying that I'd been seen, and had the flu. I immediately drove to work, gave them the note and they said, ""Okay, so you'll be back tomorrow?"" I said no, guys, I have the flu. You are absolutely not supposed to work in food service if you have the flu, especially during an epidemic. 

I spoke to my boss again and she said that if I'm going to miss any more work, I need another note from a doctor saying when I'm cleared to come back to work. My boyfriend had our only vehicle and was working, so I took a bus to the ER, waited a few hours, explained my situation, and they wrote my a note clearly stating that I have been diagnosed with the flu and will not be cleared to work until after the 15th, and if get worse or get a fever, add another 24 hours to that. 

I understand that it's hard for her because I'm fairly new, and she has to have someone fill in for me, but I think it's entirely unethical for her to guilt and pressure me to work when I could infect other people or worsen my own condition. What if I infect my other coworkers and then we all miss work? We do not have any kind of sick leave, so she would be screwed and so would we (I'm surviving right now because I made my serving tips last, and my boyfriend just got his tax return. But I have not earned money this week.) 

She seems to just generally have a bad attitude with me now, and while the assistant managers still like me, she's the general manager so her word is it. I have the experience, should I be looking at other jobs? I feel like there's just going to be a bad environment there now, and my other co-workers all seem to be intimidated by her also. She also only writes schedules one week at a time, and writes each schedule the day before it starts, so it's really stressful trying to plan anything unless I know about it in enough time to put in for the days off. 

TLDR : My boss is kind of unprofessional and rude, and pressured me to serve people food while I have the flu. She seemingly does this a lot, and people don't ever stand up to her because it's just a franchise diner and they probably know they can be replaced. 

Has anyone had experience with this? It seems unprofessional, and maybe even against company policy (though she didn't give me an employee handbook so I'm not sure). What would I tell my next employer about why I quit this job? Would it come off like I was just whining and had bad attendance? 

UPDATE: My boss now says that the 2nd note I brought her, stating that I was cleared to work again the 15th, does not have the proper letterhead from the hospital (it was written by a nurse) and I'd need to get another note before I can come back. I told her I don't have my car right now, and I think it's pretty unreasonable of her to ask me to take a bus, in the cold, while I'm sick, back to the ER for a non-emergency, just to ask them for a better note when she could just call the number they provided on the note if she has any questions.

I just started this position (my first out of college) and I really love it even if the lower pay is not sustainable for me longterm, but I went ahead and started applying elsewhere just in case the furlough went on longer than anticipated.

Now (somewhat to my own surprise) I have another promising position that I'm currently interviewing for and feel good about, with the potential for better pay and a better title.

This pandemic is turning a lot of things upside down, so do you have any tips or advice on etiquette and expectations in a situation like this? I'm not even sure if there would be an appropriate way to leverage an offer in the current job/economic climate, and I certainly don't want to be burning bridges.

Given the current work from home rules most companies have had to implement, if you do get an offer from the new place, you could accept and test it out since I assume it would be remote. I actually just did that as I started a position before covid but had still been interviewing at another place for a job I REALLY wanted. I got the second offer and took it since all work was remote. I’m so glad I did because I love the new job and I’m taking a bit of a pay cut, but not only to I like the position and company more, their future outlook is much less risky in my opinion due to their industry. 

The other company understood when I let them know, and I wasn’t even on furlough. I think all companies understand you have to look out for yourself right now and just being open and honest and even leaving it up for discussion when things open up, you will be fine.  One thing is I wouldn’t push to hRd for a higher starting rate rn.

I'm in a rather uncomfortable situation. But let me start by giving some background info!

A month ago, I was working and one of the customers I got to talk to is in a very good position in another bigger company. So I asked him if they were hiring. He immediately gave me his email adress and told me to send him my CV. Did that during my break and got no reply. 

Didn't get my hopes up since that company usually hires people who are really close to each other (x's son, x's brother, etc). In other words, it's kinda difficult to get in, but they are building a new plant nearby so I took a chance.


The main thing here is, the day before yesterday I was working (we cannot carry our mobile phones with us, safety measures and bla bla bla). So I take my break, check my phone, and see a missed call from a number I don't know. I googled it, and the name of such company appears everywhere. 


What I did was call them but no one answers, it doesn't even give me the option to leave a message.
In my country we have a long holiday period starting from yesterday to next Monday... so I was wondering if I should call them again and try my luck or wait it out until Monday and see if I get a call.

What do you think about this situation? Could it be possible it's them? There wouldn't be any other reason to call me than to at leeeeast try to hire me?

I'm kinda confused but anxious at the same time because it would be a very good job offer.

1330,37iu1q,False,[advice],64,Knowing When To Quit Your Job,jobs,"I felt it was appropriate to share some guidelines to consider when you feel it's time to leave your job and start over. This list is a combination of my personal experience and articles I've read in making my decision to leave. When we're so comfortable in a job that we've been at for a few years, it is sometimes easy to be deceived that we're in a ""good place"". Just like any bad relationship, it's hard to break up when you're comfortable.

A quick background of my career history - I was a paralegal for a few years looking to change law firms due to boredom and unhappiness. Was offered a non-legal position through a temp agency for a job I did not apply for, but this new position resulted in a  free ride to law school and an entryway to an attorney position with the business. Would've never had this opportunity if I didn't take the leap of faith to quit.

**1) Quit your job if you're more often bored/dissatisfied with your days at work** 
Regardless of how happy you are at your job, we all have bad days. However, if it gets to a point where the bad days outweigh the good and you start dreading going to work because you can foresee a bad day, then it's time to reconsider your job.

I used to find myself throwing tantrums on Sunday evenings because I could not stand the thought of going to work on Monday. 

**2) Quit your job if you're underpaid**
My husband used to always ask me why I was settling for only $11/hour for a paralegal position. I used to continuously tell him that it was a good place to be and I was learning new things. His rebuttal was simply, ""How do you know other places can't offer the same but for more money?"" Essentially, he was right. How can you really say your position is ""good"" if you haven't seen what else is out there. I now make nearly triple the amount I used to and it is definitely a better place to work and it is definitely a job I keep learning in. I would have never known about this position if I didn't step out of my comfort zone.

**3) Quit your job if you're being verbally abused by your boss** 
When we're too comfortable in our position, it's as if office etiquette flies out the door because coworkers start feeling like family. Regardless how close your peers become, the office is still the office. My previous boss used to cuss up a storm and emotionally abuse us when our working performance was not up to par. I truly believed this was just how a typical law office was like and any ""good"" company would push their employees in the same fashion. Wrong! I now work in a Fortune 500 company and no one would dare treat their employees like such.  

**4) Don't be afraid of the unknown** 
What if I don't like my new job? What if I lose a good opportunity here? Stop thinking of the negative and think ""What if I never made the change?"" If you're even in a place where you're daydreaming of a new job, then maybe that's where you need to go. The change in my life started with simply applying to as many legal jobs, but the search concluded with a job that was offered to me through a temp agency. Even though the position had nothing to do with my career choice, I still chose not to fear the unknown. You never know what's on the other side of the road you'll take, so the best way to take that route is to simply go for it and don't look back.

**TL;DR - Quit your job if you're bored, underpaid, and abused. Don't be scared :)**",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/37iu1q/knowing_when_to_quit_your_job/,82,"This list is retarded..

What you are saying is that people should quit when the going gets tough and based on your 'feels'..

841,gtawls,False,Education,1,18 year old - deciding a major in the U.K.,jobs,"
This whole time I've been focusing on business management/marketing as a field in university and I keep hearing things on reddit about how it is too broad. I think one of the main reasons I leaned towards this was because personally, I love talking to people, not necessarily socialising but persuading, negotiating, advertising things (in real life). I seriously think I'd be more passionate being a door to door salesmen instead of a person who sits behind his computer all day. I say this because, from the ages 10-16, I always sat in front of my computer for multiple hours a day after school, I played games, edited videos, all that. I loved it, but then after that, due to an environmental change, it forced me to be more extroverted outside of school time, it made me want to focus on becoming the best version of myself, I started lifting, properly talking, I gained confidence and stopped feeling sluggish. I know that...because during this lockdown, I've felt more sluggish than ever in the past 2 years and now I know why.

So anyway, I researched a bunch of fields and their experience, though I did not do well in school with Maths, I see that Computer Science is a highly demanded major especially for making money, though it does not appeal to me I could be willing to put in the work, as I got quite disappointed after searching up any business related degree and seeing it get bashed and people regretting doing it.

In my previous workplace (professional services in a big uni in London), we had a work experience placement for college students, and most of them hadn't decided yet what they wanted to do but they wanted to see how working in an office is like. A lot of young people (including myself a few years ago) have preconceived ideas of what it means to have a desk job or how workload is distributed between departments. I've always worked in non-profit environments (so not a lot of money-making here) but I've always had tons of interaction and opportunities for leadership. I'd recommend that you check out different industries and roles, talk to older friends, etc to get a sense of the kind of culture you'd feel comfortable in and take it from there.

Also, it's important that you study something that you actually enjoy doing because once you're in a course and you have to take exams, the motivation of ""this is going to give me a lot of money in the future"" simply won't be enough. When I was in uni, I had so many classmates that didn't like studying languages and struggled for years with their Chinese classes...

I was in my previous role for around 18 months, and left due to a toxic environment, which led to never-ending staff shortages, significantly heavy workload for low pay, etc. My new role was literally created as a new position, as it is considered a ""hybrid"" position to take on 3 different roles between these 2 locations, and offered me slightly more pay than my old job. I also understood that accepting a newly created position could be more challenging, as management is kind of learning how to provide the best supervision/management, as I learn how to make the position more of my own. This management ""learning curve"" has also resulted in several issue that have required mediation between multiple supervisors and directors (which they are supposedly taking responsibility for, and aren't faulting me, but I still feel very uncomfortable about the situation).  Although I am definitely learning a lot more in my new position (I've been doing a lot of self-education outside of work also), I am still feeling super overwhelmed in my new position, and feel inconsistently supported by my supervisors. Most of my coworkers are nice, but I do not feel like I fit in with any of them, as most of them are all 10-40 years older than me, and married with children (which I am not), and just have very different personalities than me, so I sometimes feel even lonelier and more lost at my new job with few people to turn to for advice, etc. I also feel like when I ask questions, these people with more experience appear to sometimes get frustrated for something that seems so ""simple and easy"" to them, but may not be that way for me, as a newer employee. My new department also is very similar to my old department in some ways-it's not as ""toxic"" as my old job, but there are some very opinionated and close-minded colleagues that are also making my job significantly more challenging to complete (which again, my supervisor is aware of, and trying to mediate to the best of her ability, supposedly). I have started looking at other potential jobs, but the job market is very saturated for my profession, so my options are limited. I also worry about leaving so soon, and having other employers potentially believe I am a ""job hopper"", which I know can carry a negative connotation. Has anyone ever experienced something similar at a new job, or have any suggestions to help me feel more comfortable/confident?

However, if you aren't familiar with Paul Feldman and his bagel business, [here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/what-the-bagel-man-saw.html) an article that talks about it briefly. Basically what Feldman does is buys bagels in the morning, leaves them in various offices with a collection box asking for one dollar per bagel, and comes back later during lunch time to collect the boxes. For anyone that is unfamiliar it might sound crazy, but it was actually a wildly successful business. He was able to quit his full time job and earn more than he ever did just by depending on peoples' honesty to leave money for the bagels. I believe that he still continues his business to this day in Washington.

I was primarily thinking about targeting elementary, middle, and high school faculty in my district with this bagel service. Leave 2 or 3 boxes of bagels and a collection box in each school's faculty lounge (if they allow it).

My concern isn't so much as to whether people will be honest enough in order for the business to be profitable (Feldman showed that honesty didn't hold the business back from being profitable through meticulous data collection), but rather if breaking into this kind of side hustle is viable or not. Will the startup cost outweigh the profits? Will the risk outweigh the profits? Will it be hard finding clients that are willing to do business? Is this just as a side hustle too much?

So I need to preface this story a little. I worked for a startup in the SF Bay Area as a Business Onboarding Specialist for about 7 months and some change before being laid off in September of 2019 ( We went through a messy acquisition and a large portion of the company ended up getting laid off :/ ). Shortly afterward I took some time off to travel and in October I took a contract position that lasted until December. Since then I've been feeling a little hopeless. Most of my experience in my work career has been as an Account Manager for a real estate company. I apply to a minimum of 20 jobs a day, most are startups. It's currently the middle of February and I am going crazy due to not working. I have some saved as well as unemployment so I don't need to find a job right away. That being said it's incredibly demoralizing to watch my bank account slowly drain every month. I've been using this time to work on skills ( I've learned SQL, some Python, as well as some inbound marketing skills. I've also been taking classes to finish my bachelor's degree as well) during this time in hopes of finding ways to make myself more marketable. I understand it's still early in the year so I may be overacting but my apartment lease is also up at the end of May and I do need to have money saved to move and at this right, I won't have enough since I've been paying the rent with my savings. If anyone has any leads on any sales or operations roles for any startups in the SF Bay Area I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to DM and I can shoot over my resume and my Linkedin as well.

1486,34b9vg,False,[advice],2,Would like some opinions on my current situation of temp employment.,jobs,"I will just lay this out in a simple timeline and then add a little blurb at the end for my real question.

Sept  - Get hired for temp to hire position at large company along with one other person, told they are trying to fill two permanent positions within 6 months.

Sept - Dec  - Consistently told by my supervisor as well as temp company that I am exceeding expectations.

End of Dec - supervisor tells me she is moving ahead to get the authorization to offer me full position. 

January - Supervisor leaves company, replaced by previous supervisor who had left to work for different emerging department. 

End of January -  Other temp is fired for bad attitude and underwhelming performance.

February - Temp pulled from different department and brought in to replace him, I do all of the training for the position.

March- This is my 6th month and I ask about the permanent position and whether or not it will happen, reassured that they are going to, but issues with budget are delaying it.

Now - Still told that budget is holding it back but as soon as its cleared I will be offered the position.


I am a no longer recent grad (finished Dec of 2012) my student loans are too large monthly for me to pay on the temp wage but manageable on the permanent position's salary. I like the job, the benefits and salary are more than acceptable assuming I get hired.It feels as though I am just going to be stuck in an endless temp position losing money and getting further behind.

Not sure what my options are, I have not been actively looking for a perm position while in this role, mostly because my resume falls a little flat, good education, but have only had a series of 3-6 month temp positions with no permanent positions. Not sure I can wait this out much longer, but feel that jumping to another temp position would be even worse.

813,hbkkf1,False,Education,3,I want to go back to school and I'm not sure where to start. Any advice on which path I should take?,jobs," 

**Quick background:** I'm from Maryland and I just graduated with a *less than useful* undergraduate degree about a month ago. I honestly don't even want to say what it is... I hate the stigma of calling any degree useless, but I think it truly is useless to me with the new goals I have in mind (even *without* the current pandemic I graduated into). After hearing horror stories about my job prospects without the proper education, I want to get a head-start on bettering my situation before going through years of no job opportunity dry-spells post-graduation.

Currently, through a personal connection, I was lucky enough to get hired to do some at-home part time administrative and graphic design work for a local business. I want to take advantage of this period + the limited mobility I have due to COVID-19 to get some **online** schooling done. My ultimate goal is to break into **Human Resources.**

I can't decide if I should:

**1) Get a second bachelor's degree and pretend the first one never happened.** After doing some research, it shouldn't take another 4 whole years to earn another Bachelor's due to my accumulated credits.

**2) Go for a postgraduate degree.** I've been told that earning a second bachelors isn't the best use of time and money and that I might as well go for my Master's in a more productive field? My concern is that I'm not sure if I have the qualifications to be accepted into a Master's program in my new chosen field . My current degree isn't all that transferable to different subjects :(

**3) Go for certification programs.** This might be the quickest way to make myself a little more marketable. It might make it easier to find entry level jobs and internships I want in my new field. And I can always pursue my Master's at a later time.

**4) Go for an Associates degree.** Just another option, but I'm not sure if this will be more or less helpful than pursuing certifications.

Of course I'm still going to be applying for jobs, learning more helpful skills, and crossing my fingers on my own time (I'm also juggling trying to get my driver's license right now).

But I would appreciate any advice on what would be the best way to dedicate my overall time. I don't want to make the same mistakes again. My family is getting older, and I wish to be able to give back to them some day soon.

**TLDR;**

**I'm a recent graduate. I have a ""useless"" degree. I want to do some online schooling/training to better my prospects and break into HR. All of the schooling I'm considering will have to be** **ONLINE.** **There are various routes I'm thinking of taking. I don't know which option will be the most productive. Any advice would be much appreciated!**

She works at a warehouse, and due to Covid-19 her job has less and less orders every week. In March, a tornado came and destroyed the building and they got paid time off for about a week, then they had to relocate to a different state. It was okay, they got paid time and a half the entire time they were there which was about 2 months. They also got “compensated” for an extra week of PTO (40 hours). 
So in May they returned to their warehouse which is here in Tennessee but they’ve had almost no orders so for the past roughly a month, her entire team at work has been getting sent home early (after only working 4 hours, sometimes less than that) every day and sometimes they don’t even let them come in. Because of this, she’s either forced to use PTO or go without pay, which is crazy bc then she’d bring home about $250 a week compared to her normal amount of almost $600. 
Now it’s the middle of June and she’s almost through all of her PTO, leaving her with nothing left for the rest of this year and it isn’t even her fault considering she never misses work except for emergencies, but now she’s having to every single day. 
Just curious if anyone else has dealt with this as well.

Trouble is, I don’t actually know the literal job description.

I applied for the position in November, and got a call last month to come in and talk with a hiring manager. To prep I tried looking at the job posting, but they yanked it off of indeed before they arranged for me to come in. I tried everything I could think of: looking at reviews from old employees, looking at my application on their website, trying to find similar postings, and I got nada. I went in expecting to do horribly but it went great! Talked about salary, the guy showed me some projects he’s working on, and he basically told me I was a front runner right then and there. Didn’t really feel like a good move to ask “By the way, what’s the job description again?”, especially since every time I tried to get out of my second shift job for the past year has resulted in me eating shit.

I’m pretty confident that I know the *basics* about what I’m going to be doing (I’ve been working in my industry for five straight years plus 2.25 years in college), so I’m not worried that I’m under-qualified or that I can’t perform up to expectations.

It was an absolute mess, there was no structure, and I tried the best to my abilities to learn to structure and interface of my company. (I am a data analyst). I then find out that my boss is very micromanaging and called me out in front of everybody in the team for not knowing specific material. Then after that, she called me everyday in the morning to nitpick at my work and pretty much told me how unhappy she is with my progress. She told me that I am learning at a slow pace and that she's ""having second thoughts"". 

Everybody in the company does not get along with her, and this quarantine is not making it any better. She's very hard to deal with and any small mistake that I make she screams at me on a one on one meeting. I have to meet with her every morning through zoom for about 1-2 hours and every time she leaves with a bad taste in her mouth. 

I try to reach out to help from my peers but a lot of them do not respond to assist me, which I totally understand because it's quarantine season and they need to get their work done. Pretty much nobody is training me, and I am left in the fire with no actual material to work with. I try to do things on my own, but it strays me off the wrong path.

They seemed interested in my application but were very sparse shall we say with their communication. They would respond in 2-3 week intervals and always no more than two sentences and there was talk of an interview at some point which never came to light. So yeah not good signs obviously. Finally they ask what my salary expectations are and I respond with what I thought was a very reasonable amount. A week later they respond and quite bluntly turn me down because my salary expectation was too high. This was for a company in a far away country so the standards might be different - fair enough. I expressed that I did not know what the salary standards are over there and what amount they would be comfortable with then. They do not seem to want to talk about it whatsoever.

1157,g6mbna,False,Onboarding,8,How to gain back confidence after being fired twice in a row?,jobs,"So this whole situation started late 2018 when i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, after i was given an offer for a really good opportunity to work at an highly respected company to start Jan 2019.

When i started the job i disclosed my mental illness at the time as this company gave the impression that they care about their employees mental health, and that they had a number of mental health ambassadors around so if someone needed to talk they could have a chat with one of them. This obviously appealed to me at the time as i felt as though i could be open... boy was i completed wrong.

Things started to hit the fan only a few days into this job where my manager caught me crying outside the office, and she told me that i was not capable of this position and that they needed someone strong to be in this position and it was a highly pressured role dealing with various reports and having meetings with senior managers and directors. Now her response did take me back, so i plead with her to give me a chance and that i can make this work.

Now to cut a long story short here my manager was micromanaging me as this was her first time being a manager so i figured she didn’t know how to manager due to being inexperienced. So i carried on doing what I’m doing and then she started becoming hostile and shouting at me for things like spelling issues, fonts not right and not cleaning the email mailbox. 
Now to be honest my mental health through this got worst as i was making mistakes but i felt i could not concentrate as my manager was always on my back making me feel more nervous, and at times every task i would do i felt i would have to run it past her just to see if i was doing the work to her standard. But all this came to backfire on me as i was fired at the end of my probation and one of the major feedback points were that i did not take initiative and that i felt everything i do had to be audited

The second job i started this year in January and from the start i noticed that manager that was trying to train me wasn’t clear in her expectations of what i was supposed to be doing in the role and i found my self having to ask her over and over what i needed to be doing. Once i started getting an hang on what i was supposed to be doing she would say things like ‘ i didn’t say, if you remember i said’ but the thing is i was documenting everything she said and i even told her this but she claimed she could not recall her saying anything i told her she said. So during my time at this job i noticing more and more that my manager backtracks on everything that she says, its almost like she has amnesia and also she would say small things that would offend me like ‘I’m not a senior as I’m not doing senior work’ but when i would ask her for specifics she was say ‘well your a senior you should already know, and its not my job to tell you your job’ so after this i reported her to her manager as at the time i didn’t want to speak to HR yet and her manager advised me that he will go to HR on my behalf and obviously that backfired and i was let go about 3 weeks after that 

Now prior to these two jobs i had a really good career and done my job at an excellent level according to previous employers and coworkers. But I’m not gunna lie these last two jobs really took a hit at my confidence and it had make me question my competency in my career. I realised that the problems at these two roles were me and managers jointly. So during the quarantine i have been doing different courses and researching materials online with relation to my role and to also improve my mental health so that i try and gain back the confidence lost, however i cant help these negative thoughts about not succeeding in my next role. Like what if i get a manager that doesn’t train properly or once that micromanages how do i at least survive probation.

1055,gjvmo8,False,Covid-19,6,Tips for being Trapped for the Pandemic,jobs,"I want to start by saying: relatively speaking, I'm unbelievably fortunate to have a job given everything that's happening. A healthy majority of my friends have lost their jobs, and I know that I'm lucky to have not. This all said...

Before the pandemic, I'd started looking for a new job. My current job had been stagnant, with no room for growth, and it not being in my industry. Then the pandemic happened. For the first month I couldn't do work, because there were so many unknowns. But, over the past month, I've been doing basically two months worth of work, in much less time. The ability to turn down additional assignments or ask to only have meetings to be between 9 and 5 has gone away, with most higher-ups believing I have nothing better to do.  Yesterday I was in a meeting unrelated to my job, but wasn't allowed to leave as I 'surely had nothing but free time on my hands.' Last week, I spent an hour on a video call watching my boss plan a different meeting, and I was kept on the call in case he had questions.

The combination of an overbearing amount of work, the complete disregard for my time and personal life, and the inability to affect any change in my role has really started to take a toll on my mental health. Normally, these would be red flags for a person to leave, but with the job market dried up for quite some time... and I'm feeling incredibly trapped in my job,

Again, I know I'm fortunate (when discussing with friends/family, I've been described as being ""on the negative side of very lucky""), even compared to some co-workers. But spending 60 hours a week working a job that is ruining my mental health, while in a situation that's already mentally taxing...

I'm looking to see if anybody has any tips, thoughts, or suggestions on how to improve (or at least, make bearable) my situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gjvmo8/tips_for_being_trapped_for_the_pandemic/,4,"I’m in the same boat as you - I was starting to submit applications for new jobs right before the pandemic hit. My job has little growth opportunity and I had been feeling trapped for a few months before I started looking at new jobs.

Things have gotten worse with the coronavirus and WFH situation, with the company adding on way more responsibilities due to the increased disorder and frenzy. I receive messages and calls at all hours of the day. It’s gotten out of hand and the “trapped” feeling is just magnified. 

I have tried working on solutions with my supervisor but the attempts so far have done very little to ease the workload and expectations. 
I usually take pride in my work and have a fear of underperforming, so I tend to forget that a job is just a transaction. I dont know if you feel the same way but I hope it helps you out to remember that you won’t stay in this role forever, and in the meantime just go through the motions of your job and find something you like to do to ease your stress when your day is done. For me it’s been Animal Crossing and reality TV haha. 

In the end, since the volume is high and it’s out of your control, and it’s a job you are looking to leave in the future, do you care about your performance? For me, trying to let that part go (caring about doing well) has helped.

Edit: just wanted to add another comment on what you said about being lucky to have a job right now. I understand that feeling and the guilt associated with wanting to leave. There’s nothing wrong with feeling upset about a job that you hate, no matter what the situation is. If it’s mentally taxing and affecting your health, it’s a valid concern. ",2020-05-14 21:35:14

I truly do not want to go through that effort, especially when I'm only working 12 hours a week now due to COVID-19 and will have to lose desk space for other work I will need to do. I have a 1099 job that requires me to physically write notes, and any desk space I have will be gone with the monitor and keyboard  there.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Is this a battle I should just avoid and just get the desktop? I'm grateful to even still have this job, and especially 2 during this time but I feel like I'm risking/sacrificing more for this job that what it offers (less space, exposure to COVID-19, etc., less hours) when there has been no issues working from home so far.

519,dgnp37,False,Qualifications,6,What do I do when I have way more experience than my very bossy boss?,jobs,"So, recently my wife and I moved to my hometown - in part to help out my family, and my parents offered us their house for peanuts (they're building a new one). I've been cleaning for myself for about 25 years. I have a job lined up starting next summer. In the meantime I've taken work cleaning with a guy I've known for years. He started a company a couple years ago. I'm a pretty quiet person, and I don't mind doing things a different way if my employer wants me to. But he.....well, doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He's got huge contracts with a bunch of employees. He's not mean at all, but just says things like 'no, no, no, do it this way'. I should add there is a bit of a language/cultural barrier too. And when I say he's doing things wrong, it's not just a different way - he's putting chemicals that take wax off the floor over time - things like that. If I bring it up, he just sort of interrupts and tells me his experience with it.

 This came to a bit of a head the other night when he asked me how much I'd charge to strip a certain floor. He proceeded to tell me 'no, you charge far too much - market value is half of that at the most'. No discussion, even when I said I've been doing this for a long time and never had trouble with work. 

In addition to all of this, he works like he's in a panic. And he's usually hovering right by me, watching everything I do while he works too. I'll be mopping a floor, and he will come up, tell me to go start the next section and take the mop  instead of letting me finish up. It's all incredibly frustrating for me. 

I can't help but wonder if this is all because I'm used to working on my own or if he's truly hard to work with. I know some other people avoid working with/for him because he drives them crazy. The guy would give you the shirt off his back, but he's just a bit too manic for me. And he has a bunch of jobs. Probably works about 12 or more hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Since I start another job next summer, I can't very well go out and get my own contracts. I'm seriously thinking about taking a full time job somewhere around town, even if it doesn't pay that well, just to get away from working for him. I should add I'm not exactly making much with him. Although I have a suspicion I get paid more than his other employees (some are from his home country, and he tries to give them work usually). Anyway, looking for any advice or thoughts on this stressful situation 

TL;DR - boss works like he's in a panic; has very little experience compared to me. He's a friend of the family, which complicates things. I'm finding him super stressful to work for",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dgnp37/what_do_i_do_when_i_have_way_more_experience_than/,3,"I think you hit the nail on the head - you are going from being your own boss to answering to someone else. None of this has to be stressful - it isn’t on you if he chooses to use the wrong chemical or to charge too little. That’s his reputation and profit, not yours. If he works in a frenzy and wants to take over so you can start the next section, let it go. Your pay doesn’t change based on what part of the job you are doing, so you are ticking seconds off your life stressing about something that doesn’t matter. 

Try to let this go. Use the opportunity to adjust to working with difficult personalities as you will surely encounter them at your next job. ",2019-10-12 00:20:09
131,dvydr6,False,Rejections,3,Job-Seeking friend faking Bachelors Degree & Unofficial shortened name,jobs,"Hi all,
We have a friend interviewing with startups and well funded companies all around US that has the background and experience to do well and this is generally the idea they get when talking with recruiters and interviewers. This is for sales executive jobs btw so we all agree they have references to previous employers that gladly recommend them for sales roles. This is someone who has done a few million $ in sales at minimum over a decade plus.
Speaking with this friend, if they said they have a Bachelors in Business, no one would question it because they can back it up with their knowledge and experience. Here’s two facts that is always a point of discussion why they can’t land a job with this recent run:
-They didn’t actually finish college but dropped out just a couple semesters shy, but their resume will state they have a Bachelors in the school. I’ll note they do have an Associates. It’s now almost a decade since they dropped out and continuing their degree would mean starting from scratch.
-Imagine their real name was Penelope Goldsmith, due to their name always being a topic and being misspelled they unofficially shortened their name throughout all social and professional sites and resumes to Pene Gold (just a random example!) In this case, thousands of people only know them as Pene Gold and only close friends/family know their full name.

So our friend group has a rising suspicion that their interviews are going really well, most go to final steps, but they hit a wall so we’re curious if HR people could chime in:
-In this case you only know Pene Gold, would you be doing research on Pene Gold? Clearly the name brings up official social media’s, LinkedIn with heavy references and all that so the person is real but do you run a background name check and see it’s not a real name and cut the process there?
-Would you be running their name in some sort of college database? Obviously their name is not real and even if you get their real name, I guess in this case it pop up with nothing or that they only have an associates?

We’ve been clashing heads on this discussion for years now and we want to ultimately know:
-Should they go back to using their real name? Pene Gold has no govt/papertrail besides what’s been built online.
-Should they ultimately just remove the college degree from their resume and LinkedIn? Or should they keep the Associates? 

TL;DR:
-Friend unofficially shortened name years back on LinkedIn and social media so now everyone knows them as that unofficially shortened name
-Friend puts they have a Bachelors but in reality dropped out two semesters early and only have an associates. Obviously tied to their real name which no one publicly knows.
-Friend is getting to final stage interviews for $100k+ Sales Exec jobs around US with a lot of interest but they all keep dropping off magically.

2042,cqdjv4,False,Layoffs,5,can I ask to get laid off? help please!,jobs,"So I recently had a normal weekly meeting with my boss. She was showering me with praise during this meeting, saying they are ""so impressed"" with my work, and how how I've been ""instrumental"" to the changes taken place in the department. Then, at the end of the meeting, my boss told me ""by the way, this isn't because of your performance, but we are cutting your hours down to 10-15 hours per week because since hiring a new person in the department, we don't have the money in the budget for your hours."" I think this is a classic case of choosing to hire a new person for crap pay, and try and phase out the seasoned workers who you have to keep giving raises to. Obviously it pissed me off but I try to understand it's not personal and it happens to people all the time. I'm looking for jobs and furiously applying.

The real problem is that I live over 60 miles from the office, and regularly work from home for part of each week, but now my boss is saying my ""new schedule"" will consist of two 6 hour days in-office. I already told my boss at our meeting look, that doesn't work for me, I cannot afford to spend 1/2 my earnings in gas to get there and back. But they're apparently taking away working from home as a privilege (even though I did nothing wrong.)

I'm going to have a frank discussion with my boss this afternoon and explain my dissatisfaction with this arrangement, and also, I really want to ask to just be laid off. The meager pay I'll be receiving for roughly 12 hours of work per week, barely makes it worth it for me to drive over an hour each way to the office. I think they have decided to drop my hours instead of lay me off, because there's still some projects I'm working on for them and they want to get every last drop of work out of me rather than just let me go now. They have to  know that for any adult human being who owns a home, 12 hours of work per week factoring in the distance I travel, is not a sustainable income. 

I wanted to hopefully get some opinions and find out if ""asking"" to be laid off is even remotely a possible thing to do. I am thinking of putting it to be boss this way, saying: ""look, I know there probably was some discussion behind the scenes about if it would be possible to keep me onboard or if I would have to be let go. I'm guessing the choice to keep me on for 10-15 hours a week is the max that was allowed in the budget. For me personally, as I explained, this is hardly sustainable even during the process of searching for new employment. I want to find out if a lay off was ever in the cards and if that could be a possibility instead of the decrease in hours.""

I'm afraid she's going to take that as me quitting, which is obviously not what I want because it ruins my chances of collecting unemployment. And I also fear that if I truly were to get laid off, it would make it a lot harder for me to find a job (being unemployed).

I'm a 25 year old at the beginning of my career and I'm starting to feel like working too efficiently is actually a bad thing. Everyday (particularly when I first started this job), I would come into work and feverishly tackle all of my tasks in the most efficient way possible. Eventually, this led to me finishing my tasks way faster than my peers who were doing the same amount of work, but spreading it throughout the whole day by taking breaks, surfing reddit, or staring blankly into space.

Of course, I thought this would lead to greatness, but actually it seems to have caused me trouble. Because I finish earlier, I constantly end up having to take on other people's work and help them. I didn't mind this when people seemed appreciative (or my boss recognized that I was going above and beyond), but now it just seems like I'm expected to do it.

Perhaps the worst part, though, is that I usually leave at 5ish because I've finished everything. My coworkers end up leaving at 6 or later because they still have work that they procrastinated on. Because of this, it looks like they're working harder/longer (especially because my boss seems to value how long you sit at your desk over how much work you actually get done).

I was thrilled with this, and the interview went very well. They asked me for references and said they'd get back to me early in the next week. On Friday of that next week, they sent me an e-mail saying they hit a budget snag and would get back to me after a budget meeting the week after, and wanted to let me know in case I had any other offers or options in there interim. I said no, and that I was happy to wait, and they said they'd be i contact.

Of course, right after I sent that email, I got another interview (which also went well, but I wouldn't end up getting an offer for) and employer 2 said they'd get back to me the next day. This prompted me to send Employer 1 an e-mail asking when their meeting was and when I could expect to hear back. This was two weeks ago and I have heard nothing. 

Would it be reasonable to now give them a phone call and ask about the position, and if they aren't giving me an offer, whether it was for qualification concerns or budget issues? Or should it be obvious that they're blowing me off? The fact that they emailed me about the budget problem, instead of just denying me, makes me think that they would have given me an offer if there wasnt a monetary issue...but it has been forever since my last contact...but I also know these kinds of things can take forever on the corporate end.

1783,fayh0m,False,Recruiters,13,Absolute insane experience with recruiters. Need urgent help,jobs,"I live in Colorado and I've been actively looking for my first big developer job for the past month. I've had multiple interviews and multiple offers.

I narrowed my options down to 2 companies:

1. A contract to hire position with a technology that I'm excited about - via a recruiter
2. A DoD full time position that requires a Secret clearance - via the actual company

My priority was #1 and I've been constantly in touch with the recruiter. After my interview, he said everything is looking great, yet kept stalling on sending out an offer. He stalled for about a week.

While he was stalling, #2 offered me the full-time offer, which I eventually accepted. This role is contingent upon me getting the Secret clearance done, which could take anywhere from 1-3 months. It also seems to be a complicated process.

I called the recruiter and told him that I have an offer on the table and they need to hear back from me soon, so I asked him nicely to update me and try to speed up the process. He said he will.

Here is a timeline:

Day 1 - told the recruiter about the other position

Day 2 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 3 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 4 - recruiter answered phone call. I asked him about the position. He said it was filled.

Day 5 - I accept the #2 offer.

Day 6 - I find the actual email contact for the hiring manager at company #1 and thank him for his time and ask for feedback. He never replied.

Day 7 - The recruiter for #1 calls me and tells me that the hiring manager got in touch with him and told him that I contacted him. The recruiter then asked me if I would still be interested in filling up the role. I am very surprised. I asked him what happened with the other candidate. He said he might not work out. I ask him to tell me what the offer would entail and he says he will get back to me.

He calls me back an hour later and he said that I MIGHT receive an offer, but it is contingent upon me starting on MONDAY. The next business day. I tell him that it would be a very short time to make a decision and might be difficult to contact #2 and let them know about it.

After all, #2 is a full time position with plenty of benefits. #1 is a company that I was excited about, but it is a contract-to-hire (duration unknown, anywhere from 3-12 months) role. However, #2 could take months until I even start working there if all the paperwork gets done correctly. So here is my conundrum:

\#1 obviously has red flags in terms of its recruiters, but if I actually started on Monday, I can actually have income (I am currently unemployed). It does not seem like a stable position at all, however. I wouldn't feel comfortable rescinding #2, which seems to have a lot of security.

\#2 will probably take months until I can even start working there.

What do I do?

Technically, I could start #1 and get paid and get experience, and quit when #2 is ready. But what if I like it? By that point, #2 would have spent thousands of dollars on me getting cleared and onboarded. I don't think I could rescind #2 at that point. Also, the process for #2 might not take that long.

Do I just play it safe and focus on #2 and getting the process done and hope for the best in terms of the timeline? What if I don't get cleared and waste months without experience and income and miss out on the contract opportunity?

Do I rescind #2 knowing that the recruiters for #1 are shady to say the least and I'm not exactly sure what the actual company is expecting of me ?  The #1 position is also not full time and it doesn't have benefits, but it probably pays the same as #2 in terms of hourly.

The fact that the recruiter is trying to get me to start working on Monday is actually pretty insane. Especially after I showed continuous interest in the job and wanted to speed up the process and he ignored me and lied to me.  But after all, it's about me getting a job and experience.

So what do I do? The clock is ticking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fayh0m/absolute_insane_experience_with_recruiters_need/,7,"I just read your post a few times and tried to figure out what the problem is.

You need income while you wait for your security clearance. I've had a Secret clearance before, the process is slow and riddled with bureaucracy.
 
Accept Job #1. Work at Job #1 as if Job #2 doesn't exist. Once Job #2 gives you a start date, put in your two weeks notice four weeks ahead of that date. Take two weeks for yourself, then start Job #2 fresh and relaxed.

1576,f98h5o,False,Companies,4,New job isn't going great,jobs,"Hey all,

 
Started my current job in November and was given an excellent description of the commission scheme, sales structure and how to really succeed as an outbound sales rep.

 
A week after my start date all the above was announced to be restructured for all colleagues as of January 1st. 
 

Previously we would receive commission on all units sold/hired and would even share commission/points with other sales reps from the supplying branch if we send out the quote.

 
They’ve now changed it to require us to hit 60% of a target to receive any commission at all. If I get 59% I get £0. If I get 61%, I will receive 61% of my commission. If I was due to receive £1000 in commission, I will get £610 for that month. This would be fine as it drives people to work harder…

 
However,

 
We work in regions by postcode/zip codes. I manage 6 very busy areas of the UK surrounding London and was told are “prime areas that generate a lot of revenue”.
For some reason that is beyond me; the company has now started to assign accounts as a single point of contact. Meaning that somebody in Scotland can be managing an account in Wales. The product will come from the Wales depo but all communication will be to the Scottish sales rep and will randomly throw these around however they see fit. 
 

Now on top of that they also allow sales people in our head office to manage ANY AREA of the country and get dibs on new accounts for the first 3 months (even if I have generated the business). So, if a customer is 5 minutes from our depo, the sales person at head office who does not know the area, do not know the customer, do not have free range of selecting prices will be able to STEAL OUR SALES. Freely. No real restrictions to it. Even if I have done all the leg work to win that contract. 
 

I’ve worked in sales for a number of years and I’m all for a bit of competition, but I’ve never experienced such blatant neglect towards the sales people putting in the effort with customer to generate new business. So long as the bosses get units out. 
 

Opinions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f98h5o/new_job_isnt_going_great/,6,This seems like they made the changes for very specific reasons that they haven't made anyone aware of.

1306,aoge3a,False,Onboarding,5,"New Job, some concerning policies",jobs,"Hey all.


Started a new job recently. It's working for a community action group (don't want to say the name, its a small-ish company)

So, the job includes door knocking on high rise, generally low income apartment buildings to talk to residents, which is fine. 

However I was led to believe that this was being done in pairs (it is not)

So for 5 hours a day, I'm alone and being explicitly told my first goal is to 'Get in the Door' of strangers apartments (with quotas). Am I right to be concerned about safety, particularly as a woman? 

I was told there was alot of training, but after about two hours of some situational bits yesterday, I started door knocking, alone. 

Other 'yellow flags' include:

-There is no contract, or clear definition of the role. 

-Pay is ambiguous ""it's salaried, works out to 15 an hour"" but I haven't seen that in writing anywhere, and 32k-something works out to under 15 an hour (what they pay part time workers) 

- I'm worried about the cops being called on me for soliciting in a building. We don't have permission to be in there, and are instructed to just follow a resident when they open the main door. I asked the main organizer if they had ever been arrested or had the the cops called on him while doing the job, and the question wasn't answered. (Particularly anyone with Ontario Law knowledge know the answer to this one?)

- I would learn to deal with this one, but basically the hours are different than advertised. 12-9pm, with some weekends. (I have a much better paying weekend job, with a contract) 

-It is a preformance based job with quotas. (Re they can fire me if I don't meet those quotas) I have worked with quotas before. But I've know what was expected and what was the threshold I needed to meet. That's not the case here, after asking multiple times. 

-Women who work mobile jobs- how do you use the bathroom, or change tampons? These buildings aren't always around a coffee shop or Macdonald, and we aren't technically allowed to leave the building incase we can't get back in. 

Really I'm thankful to have something full-time after 4 months of apply and just scrapping by on other gigs, but the above really worry me. 

Thoughts? Has anyone had a job like this before? 

",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/aoge3a/new_job_some_concerning_policies/,3,"Those aren't yellow flags, they are red flags. They pulled a bait-and-switch to get you in because nobody stays. If you were supposed to work in pairs because of safety issues, then they shouldn't be having you be alone, especially as a woman at low income apartment buildings for a community action group. I've been homeless, some of the people you will be interacting with have serious problems, you shouldn't be alone. Of course you should be concerned about your safety. It's not like you are walking around a wealthy HOA where everybody is well-off and busy with their lives. And they lied about training. 

Super not cool that you are having to do something where you aren't even allowed to be in there. Residents are probably even instructed not to let random strangers in, you might even get them in trouble. And since the organizer didn't answer your question, the answer is likely yes, at least with having the cops called. I don't know what the law is, but you may even be breaking trespassing laws considering you are sneaking in behind residents. And then if you are charged with that, then you have that to possibly deal with when you are applying to another job. 

I know how much it sucks to go that long without a job, but that's how absolutely awful jobs that might not even be doing legal things rope people in. This one is playing games with you and you may get into legal trouble. At least look up about trespassing if you really do not want to quit that badly.  ",2019-02-08 13:13:16

333,8oc4qw,False,Discipline,61,"Misunderstood how many sick days I got, learned about it 2 years in",jobs,"So I had my biweekly 1-on-1 with my manager on Wednesday, the meetings are usually just us talking about how I'm doing on my project, company updates, etc. Never really had an issue in my two years. But this week he kind of awkwardly brought up that I was -73 hours on sick time. Apparently I misunderstood our sick time as 15 days/year but it's actually 10. I had been slowly going deeper negative over time, and neither my old manager nor this manager noticed until now.

He made sure to mention that he knows I'm a good performer, he recognizes it wasn't intentional, and he hasn't heard anything from HR about it. He still said he'd like to talk with the managers one and two levels above him to figure out what to do about it since he'd never dealt with this before. He came back like 30 minutes later and reiterated I'm not in trouble, but to just not mark sick on my timecard until I'm in the green and use vacation days instead if I'm sick.

I'm not upset about the outcome, he sounds understanding. But I am embarrassed and I really dislike the feeling of being in the spotlight like this in the manager chain. This, coupled with the fact that I've been using my 2018 sick days a little judiciously in the past month as I adjust to my antidepressant dosage change.

I typed this all out and I guess I don't have a question because I'm not in trouble and the solution is clear. But anyone with a similar experience would make me feel better lol, because this sucks and it took me from a 3 month streak of loving the work day to dreading it because I'm self conscious that I'm not performing well enough now.

1653,d0l8dp,False,Companies,3,"Leave a company or stay during a ""transition"" period?",jobs,"I moved a couple years ago with my family to come work for a mechanical design build contractor. Two years ago, the company was sold and moved from a family owned business to a private corporation. Shortly after, the original owner died. About a year ago, the owner's son left the company over a disagreement with the new corporation about how they're running the company.

Within the last two months, the owner's son has opened up his own business across the street doing the exact same type of work. He was one of the lead design engineers here, so not a big surprise. He has made it clear he intends to put us out of business. He has since taken with him the following people:

\-another head engineer

\-manpower supervisor

\-service group leaders

And there is already talk of several field employees/more office employees going with, most of them all with high knowledge of this field and our business.

My question is if it is worth sticking around at my company during this transition period. I have several other prospects I could look in to, but I'd like to stay and finish out my projects, about another 3-5 weeks.

My concern is if I do tender my 2 weeks resignation, their MO so far has been to walk people out on the spot. I am unsure if they are paid or not for the 2 weeks.

On top of that, my personal phone, laptop, and car are all currently through my employer, so if I left, that would be one of the conditions of my new employment.

I finished my Masters (English at a mediocre university) in May, during which I had a paid internship.

I finally landed a temp position that runs til February at an office doing stuff I'm interested in and getting paid well enough. I'm pretty grateful, even though it's temporary... It's been a rough, unsteady 5 months!

Going back to graduate school was a great decision as it gave me so much room to grow and try professions other than teaching and working in restaurants. If you're interested and it's an option for you, you could apply to graduate programs, and once you get in, do whatever you can to try and get an (ideally paid) internship somewhere and that'll get you going, for sure. Getting a master's didn't automatically generate a job for me, and frankly, I don't think the degree itself is doing too much for me, though it doesn't hurt. The paid internship I had in the office, and the short term project they had me on after it was over, has been really helpful in job interviews as it shows I have office experience.

I've been unemployed for a few months. I have a good amount of money saved and it wasn't too big a deal. I quit my last job and made a big move across the country, so it was voluntary. Last week, after a while of searching, I received TWO pretty exciting job offers. I waffled between the two jobs for days. Job A was a job in my chosen career path, low stress, okay pay. Job B was slightly different from the path I've been on, medium stress and great pay. After much deliberation, I decided to accept Job B because I thought it might be exciting and to be honest, the pay was enticing. 

Today was my first day. First of all, the job I trained for today is not really the function I was told I'd be hired for. I was offered what I thought was an office position. However, today I shadowed the C.O.O. all day on a job site, being trained as if being on site would be my primary position (using language such as ""you'll be doing this"" and ""when you are in charge of this""). It ended up being an 11 hour day. I wasn't given a restroom break. I didn't have anything to eat or drink all day and even though I thought I was taking a white collar job, I spent much of my day doing labor tasks. Also, I'm a young woman being given a somewhat rowdy crew of men to manage out the door on my first day.

Of course that caused them to doubt the prospects of the job, and my boss who everyone despised fired him for it. 

On the low, I referred him to the labor division who filed a complaint that he was fired for discussing wages. Basically it was an open and shut case as multiple people witnessed it and were fully cooperating with the investigation.

The company offered him either his job back or something like $20,000. Incredibly, he took his job back. I guess he thought he would be retaliated against and could pursue this further, well he was wrong. He just continued to not be good and hate the job until he quit.

I've been at my current company for about 2.5 years.  When I was first hired on, it was so I could help the then project manager expand this new business line.  Long story short, that manager ended up being very hands off, and I ended up being responsible for leading the team, handling meetings with client, facilitating the manager's meetings, and doing the actual technical work.  The PM was fired and replaced, team shuffled, and throughout all of this, the company owner made it a point to tell me how he appreciated what I was doing, and that he saw me evolving into a partner at the company.   

Around this time last year I had to move departments to fill in a vacant position, and everything shifted at this point.  I got little to no interaction with the company owner or other managers, and when we did interact the dynamic changed.  Managers now talk to me like I'm an entry level employee without the benefit of anyone checking in on my status or progress.  I've tried to be patient over the last year and learn more in my new position, but nothing seems to be changing and I'm starting to feel like I'm needed to fill this role, but I'm not a valued member of the team anymore.  

The actual request - I'm going to approach the boss in the next few weeks to discuss what opportunities there are for me in the company, and/or what he thinks I need to work on to get to the ""next level.""   What feedback do you all have on how to approach this conversation?

I'm in an awful job run by a bully. I wanted to move into a new industry Digital PR which is a side step from what I currently do, Digital Marketing. Got in touch with a company who already knew me and very kindly offered me a casual interview. That went pretty well and then I completed a task they  had asked for, to which they replied very quickly saying 'i'd made it really easy for them, that was a great project and you've got the job.' I was ecstatic, I can't tell you how happy I was, I had my whole new life there set in my head.

Unfortunately, here's where I went wrong. I always thought this was a time to negotiate. I currently earn £26k, and I know if I was going on to another digital marketing job I could easily now earn £30k. However, I had expressed to them in my interview before that I understand that 30k might not be possible as I was moving into a slightly different industy without the direct experience, so I said I just didn't want to go below my current salary. 

In their offer, they offered me £26k with it going up to £27k after 6 month probation. I expressed my joy and keeness but asked if there was any way for a 27k start with it going up to 28k. Yes, I got greedy, I hate myself for it now. Also the job they had advertised for was 'digital pr exec' but when they offered me it they said 'junior digital pr exec' and I asked if we could keep it to the original title I had applied for as I didn't want it to appear like a step back in my career.

They retracted their offer. They explained why and I get it. To them they were already taking a bit of a risk on me as it was a different industry that I didn't have direct experience in and they believed they were being very generous to match my currently salary for what they consider a junior role. They said they worried I wasn't thinking of it as a long term job because of my salary expectations.

The thing is, if they had just said we can't go above our offer, I would have said no problem I'd like to take it anyway. I even replied to their rejection after telling them this, in case there was any saving it, but they still said sorry but no.

Hello! 

Background:

I am very soon to be a graduate with a BA Hons in sociology and social policy. In February I applied for a job within my local council to be an admin officer in the housing department which I was super excited about. I didn't hear back and thought I just hadn't gotten it but they phoned me in May for a video interview!

Present:

On Monday, I did the interview with a panel of three and it went quite well, I showed my enthusiasm and knowledge around housing and they seemed to respond. However, I had a feeling I wasn't quite the right candidate.

My gut feeling was confirmed yesterday when I got a phone call to say I was unfortunately, unsuccessful. Yet, the interviewer was impressed with my enthusiasm and stated they didn't want to lose a talented individual, so they wanted to set up a casual video discussion.

This, this caught me by surprise and I wasn't quite sure what to say apart from, yes, please! They asked me if I had any questions already, but I sort of choked as I really wasn't expecting it so I am a bit afraid I came off a bit unwilling, if that makes sense? However, I am so grateful as I was dissapointed not to get the position but to be recognised was immense.


The point:

Basically, how do I not mess this opportunity up and really make the best of it?

Have any of you been in this position before?

1691,axlsuq,False,Companies,10,[HELP] Let go from my job due to 'budget constraints' - 2 months later the company wants me back!,jobs,"So in early January, I was let go from my training position (a few weeks before my pay was legally due to rise), they used the typical 'we don't have the budget' excuse, which I didn't buy for a second. It was a job I worked my ass off in and got really good at, the entire team was dependant on me covering their shifts so they could travel and visit clients. Because it was an intern type position, It took me a 9-12 months before I really started to gain the knowledge and call the role my own, the company didn't really put a big effort into training me - I self taught the functions of the software myself. 

So they threw away all the experience I gained and will now have to train another person from scratch now that they've gotten rid of me. This was all probably because I would have cost them a little bit more, so they'd rather bring in a new trainee instead of paying me a bit more. They probably could afford it, but saw the opportunity to save a quick buck.

A week or two later when looking for a new job, I see my old position being advertised on a job board, the closing gate kept on getting extended and extended by a few weeks every time. I can only presume this is because they couldn't get to replace me with.

Fastforward to yesterday, I get an email from my old boss - saying they want me back and are willing to offer me the full time job that I didn't get last time. Pay is okayish but isn't the best, the company isn't that big and so doesn't really pay people that well in general.

Thoughts? I've been applying for two months now for equivalent but much higher paying trainee jobs that I'm qualified for, some with huge companies. Should I accept the offer or keep plugging away?

2482,3ub6lq,False,Experience,24,How to know your about to be fired in the IT world.,jobs,"## NOTE## Don't think of this as a bible here, more or less this is from my perspective and experience. ####

One thing that is great about IT is it's fairly easy to know when you're about to be shown the door, this often gives you weeks in advance to prepare for it and get as many resumes out into the internet as possible before the axe comes down.

One of the primary reasons for firing is the company owner is more often than not clueless about tech, and often will think of IT as a utility (sort of like an expensive electric bill) combine ignorance with bottom-line level thinking your job in IT is always hanging on by a thread; so the owner might not care you spent all weekend rolling out a dozen VM's or installing VPN's all throughout the state, and this is fine as it's also your job to educate them on that necessity, but still never be shocked when your time is up and more often than not it can be up fairly quickly. With this in mind I'll offer you some very common scenarios that foreshadow your tech demise:

1. You get a PIP

Generally this has nothing to do with your ability, more often than not this occurs due to the hours you work, how tidy your desk is, how often you travel between locations and inter-department communication; you might think these are minor things but since the owner probably doesn't understand everything you do on a day-to-day basis they tend to gauge your performance on triviality and something as simple as leaving too many Linux books on your desk can warrant a negative review. 

The first sign of trouble is the owner now wants you to consult with them on everything you do, be it how you send out emails, to where you are at all times, you begin to feel the sting of micromanagement as everything you say and every location you visit is now logged (and yes that office manager in that remote office WILL report that you got there at 11:15 as opposed to 11:00 when you said you would be there because your owner asked them to) so expect a litany of these issues on your outboarding papers.

2. Your suggestions are more easily dismissed

Remember when you first got there and the owner listened to your suggestion about purchasing a NSA2600 and a couple TZ400's to get the locations standardized and it was a done deal? But now the owner puts simple things on the backburner or you can't push much needed updates as easily and or they require excessive documentation (we'll get to this later) and approval? 

The sign here is that the owner while they still have confidence in your ability to do your job, they don't want to make costly purchases if they know you'll be out the door in two-weeks, and if this device arrives and your no longer there then it just sits in a storage closet and wastes money... No one wants to spend money on equipment if there are no operators for that equipment. 

If you notice the owner seemingly giving you the slight on recommendations that would've been a no-brainer three months ago, it's probably time to start looking on job boards.

3. Documentation Frenzy

Documentation is key to order for any organization, any good IT Manager knows this and should be updating all documentation pretty regularly; however if the owner out of the blue starts requesting a bunch of documentation such as tutorials on how you encrypt laptops or step-by-step processes on how to backup the systems then it's safe to assume that there is doom on your horizon.

Look owners hire you to do this stuff for them, documentation serves them ZERO purpose as it would serve you and your subordinates, the goal of getting all this documentation upfront and right now is so when you are shown the door the next guy to sit in your seat doesn't have to metaphorically re-invent the wheel that would slow business processes down.

If your owner asks for this, you're probably in trouble.

4. The Consultants

Every now and then the owner might bring in a consultant to help with certain IT functions that might overwhelm you such as setting up SQL databases and or some programming that is time-intensive, there is no problem with this but do understand a consultant is a double edged sword.

Consultants can't make any money unless there is a ""problem"" that needs to be solved, and often times that problem becomes you, the consultant will often tell the owner about how cheap his services are in comparison to your salary, he might bring up words like ""best practices"" and begin to cast doubt on your ability to do your job. 

Something as simple as ""the passwords aren't strong enough"" or ""The VM's aren't best practice"" is enough to cause reasonable doubt, even if under your watch there has been ZERO security risks and 99.99% up-time the consultant doesn't NEED to prove he or she is better, they just need to plant the idea in your superior's heads that A) you're expensive and B) your becoming a liability

If a consultant is hanging around longer than what would be expected for project completion, rest assured that he is whispering sweet nothings into the owners ears about how his company can do SLA's at a 30% discount; since businesses are bottom-line this is poisonous to your career.

5. The passwords, and the end of you.

Every now and then the owner might want a password or two for a few systems, this is pretty normal as a owner might want to see all the folders on your shared drive and a domain admin account makes sense for that. 

But if you come in one Monday morning and suddenly the owner wants the passwords for everything, the Wi-Fi, the anti-virus, the VSphere, the help-desk and anything and everything in between, then rest assure that you'll be boxing everything up by the end of the day.

The moment you start handing over passwords is the moment a hired consultant is on the other end changing them as fast as they get them, and within the hour you can count on your administrator credentials being nuked from the system and you can't login to anything... Feel free to take extra-long on that lunchbreak because the moment you return you'll be greeted by a powered off computer and a HR rep asking for your keys.

So what now?

The good news if you see the signs you can better prepare, and don't dwell on it too much. IT is a large field with a lot of demand and supply it isn't uncommon at all for entire IT departments to be swapped in and out year-to-year, you have a blessing of working in a high-availability career.

Should I ride on my remaining benefits or start looking immediately?",jobs,"Hey guys, so as the title states, I'm currently unemployed due to being laid off during the COVID-19 situation.

I was an IT Manager for about 4 years with years of IT experience in my background. I know in many places there have been hiring freezes and whatnot so I haven't personally began to look for new jobs knowing that right now they're seemingly non-existent.  I was laid off late March/early April and I've just enjoyed the stress-free time for the most part.

Right now on unemployment though I'm making a pretty penny while being able to take care of my daughter (we were paying about $210/week so not only am I able to be a father during these times but the money saved for not having her in daycare has amounted to a massive amount of savings -- not to mention that's one less point of exposure).

I know eventually my unemployment funds will run out, but as it currently stands that's going to be months away. I planned on using this time to get some IT certs while this all blows over but I also feel like if I stay without a job for too long it's going to be detrimental.

In your opinion, should I just start looking for work immediately or continue riding this out? I'm not going to lie, the amount of reduced stress as been amazing for my health, but I also feel like back in the older days where if I wait too long I'll have a gap in my employment that could hurt me more than anything (however, given the current circumstances in the world, I feel like I have a valid excuse for not immediately looking for work).

A few added details:

* I'm not hurting for money at the moment, got about a $12k nest egg with unemployment benefits coming in
* LinkedIn all updated with recommendations and references
* I definitely wouldn't mind investing in myself, going as far as to even starting my own little small business but for now thinking of IT certifications
* With unemployment I'm making about 20% less than what I was bringing in with my previous job but factoring in things like not having to pay daycare and a few loan deferments I'm actually breaking even until the funds run out.

368,bob5l0,False,Discipline,1,How to be less stressed/on edge at work?,jobs,"Hi all,

So I am returning to my summer job in a few days, at which my anxiety is returning at full force. Little context: I work at an architecture firm where I'd like to think I am a valued employee (have received compliments about my progress, been given raises, etc). But it is a huge field with lots of drawings/contractors/knowledge that are prone to mistakes.

Basically my fear comes from making mistakes and being disciplined - basically the idea of being given responsibility and letting others down or being punished and being at fault. It's to the point where all day I am constantly shaking in fear of messing up or worrying about the next new task I'll be given and whether or not I will be able to figure it out or mess up royally. I just know if something happened I'd feel so very ashamed and upset at myself. Now my bosses are not bad people and they are not the cause of my anxiety I believe, as it is more internal attributions that cause these feelings. They have never directly given me cause to think that any mess up by me would result in a yelling session or an immediate firing.

Do you have any ideas on how to change my way of thinking that this is simply something I do for money rather than a 9 hour fight-or-flight panic attack for survival? It almost is part of my identity and that if something bad happened that I could never recover or it would be life-changing. My ego is so afraid of looking dumb or letting down others that I am a perfectionist and cannot accept any less, otherwise the worst might happen. I'm always looking busy because I'm afraid of getting a new task which I have a new opportunity to fail.

The best advice I can give you is that even if everything goes wrong and you lose your job, there is still happiness elsewhere in life.  I'd also suggest seeking professional help through counseling to help overcome these issues. This stuff is easier to fix now than later in life when it gets worse. Believe me, you aren't the only one going through it, particularly when you work so hard to get things done. One of the biggest problems I see brewing in the future of work for those of us under 35 is burnout and fatigue. If you've been formally educated and put your finances on the line to get a good career, then you're going to feel stress that it may go wrong at any moment. And it can and will go wrong. There may be a day you walk in and it's your last day. Trust me when I tell you that day may actually be a blessing and you can find something else that will satisfy you more than your current work.

  I worked for Chili’s Bar and Grill for close to two years. I was indisputably the best server on the floor. I could take half the restaurant and not be weeded at all!!!! Very dependable worker who RARELY ever called out. I have an outgoing personality and know how to hold a conversation, so my guest and peers loved me!! But...then in 2018 came along the infamous 3 for $10 meal.

  Choose one non alcoholic beverage , a starter , and entrée for just $10!! That’s a great deal for guest, but terrible for servers. Due to plates becoming so low our turnover rate skyrocketed. Next thing I know my GF ( who I worked with at Chili’s ) and I working working most weeks with either 1 day or no days off. 
Now I know ... if I didn’t like it I should’ve dusted off my resumé and got a new job. But then again I have regulars who take good care of me and the social interaction at work was also good , plus the commute was quick. So I chose to power through these tough schedules , being the fact my GM (Older white man , Archie Bunker type ) promised the bartender position once he hires up again. 

  Well months go by , I’m still not a bartender and come to find out my co worker ended up being  promoted. I was happy for her cuz she’s my friend but everyone knew it should’ve been mine, or at least my GF’s . I wanted to talk to my boss about it but I knew he would just give me some bullshit answer. 
He gave me some bullshit answer one day when I pressed him on the fact he should make the servers work schedule because our supervisor who’s assigned to the role was abusing her power. She was scheduling herself and her brother good shifts , making sure they were the first ones out the door everyday. I was beyond frustrated at this point. 

 Fast forward to this passed June . I was first cut on the floor and business is slow. For some reason there’s not host on the floor , even though my District manager is present , but whatever . I see a party of four at the door so I seat them with myself. There’s the mother , her grown son , his GF , and their son. They just returned from the courthouse across the street and seemed upset from whatever may have happened over there. I tried to remain as patient and helpful as possible while serving them cuz it felt like one wrong word could flip them over the edge , especially the Grown Son. Eventually, the GS and his GF leave the restaurant. I was relieved cuz they were taking foreverrrrr to order anything !!! The Mother ended ordering sausages then sending them back because they were pork ....

I send my GM to the table to assist her. While taking their order the GS and the GF return. My GM lets me take it from here and he steps 2 ft away to the bar behind us.  The GF still ordering like she’s never read a menu before feels like I’m not being patient with her and calls my GM over and says “I don’t want his rudeass anymore!”.  And for some reason I chose to respond back saying “ well I don’t wanna serve you guys “. Then I began to walk away . The Grown Son then shouted  “ how bout you shut up you fat Faggot “ ... I was taken back by this. In my 4 years of serving I never had a customer be so disrespectful towards me. 

They’re just words I understand , and I should’ve just walked away like IVE BEEN DOING FOR 2 years now . But I didn’t sadly ... I walked back over to him. He stood up .. and I pushed him before he could hit me first. My GM grabs the guy and someone else grabs me. It lasted all of 20 secs with no one landing any good clean hits. I ended up being fired the next day for throwing the first hit. 

  Despite the negative things about the job , I loved it. And I wish I could go back ironically . So my question is it’s been 7 months now , is it possible to get rehired or maybe work for another Chili’s ? And is my GM at any fault for this , I felt like he allowed us to fight?

I've been working for a cleaning company as a cleaner for a few months. This is purely a placeholder job until I find something I want to actually do. I have been working as a casual to cover other peoples shifts. Recently I was offered to do part time for 5 days a week cleaning 3 different stations each day. I found the work quite difficult after a week of doing it and sought advice from my supervisor and that this work is making me stressed and if possible when it's available could I find an alternative shift. He said he'd talk to my manager about it. 

On this weekend I get a message from my manager saying ""hey can you cover this train station shift"" the problem was it was my shift and I was confused why'd she'd ask me to cover my own shift. I called her up and asked her ""why do I need to cover my own shift when I've been rostered permanently for this shift?"" She tells me that my supervisor told her I wanted to quit. I said thats not true, I wanted to find another shift but I didn't want to quit it until I could transfer over, and I made that very clear with my supervisor. She said ""oh ok well what shifts do you want"" and I told her what times and stations I'd be willing to do and she said she'd get back to me.

1332,2cfcep,False,[advice],54,"I left my job on July 18 with no leads of any kind and no savings whatsoever. Yesterday, I got an offer at my dream job. Here's how I did it.",jobs,"On June 21, I thought I had found the next step on my career path. Literally less than a month later, I quit. I was working 80+ hours a week for not enough money. It was taking a toll on my happiness and my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I didn't know what to do. I had no savings (besides part of my last paycheck and a paycheck that would be small). However, I hustled and here's how I got a job that I feel I'll love with no help from a network, friends or family. 

First off, I treated finding a job like it was a job. I'm sure you've read this before and it's not a joke. From 8 AM to 5 PM, I searched for and applied to jobs. I wrote a specific cover letter for every one of them. Whether it was the cover letters or the website's crazy antics in regards to the information I had to give, it would take around an hour to thoroughly apply for the jobs. So then, I was turning in 8 applications a day, give or take a couple. I feel that every cover letter I sent was epic. On top of this, I still treated my life the same. I woke up at 7 and cooked breakfast. I went to the gym after ""work."" I even went out with friends on the weekends. By the first weekend, I had had a few phone interviews so I felt going out would be fine as I'd hear back from someone. On top of this, I updated my resume to reflect the skillset that I had garnered or expanded upon in my last job. I also killed a lot of the white space on my resume. I don't even have a G.P.A. on it. I feel like a lot of places understand that a G.P.A. isn't really indicative of anything anymore. I had a 3.003 out of school. Not the best and definitely not the best for some careers (so keep that in mind, engineers, IT, etc.) Regardless, I revamped my resume. Reach out to someone if you're not sure. Do not be embarrassed. I would always try to hide my resume from friends or family when I could've used the help. I didn't want them to know how poorly I'd done in college.

Secondly, I found my job on my state's job board. It's a nonprofit that works to help people find jobs. I don't know if EVERY state has these nonprofits, but I just looked up a few in a few major states. Regardless, I'm sure SOME nonprofit in every state focuses on this. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Why I think this played a major role, however, is because this essentially (in North Carolina, at least) weeded out all the Vector Marketing (sorry Vector people!) and bullshit jobs. Now, if you're in IT or something like that, this may not be an issue for you. But I know plenty of people who are ""qualified"" for some jobs, will get calls back in 30 minutes of applying, and find out that it's a pyramid scheme or uncomfortably close. Regardless, I had confidence that every job that I applied to was a legitimate organization. This meant that I was spending my time wisely.

So I got a phone interview. People put so much emphasis on the actual, face-to-face interviews (and they should), but the phone interview is a very real thing now. You need to be preparing for the phone interview as you apply. If you get a call from a random number, it's probably time for a phone interview. If you're not ready, I can only imagine how hard it is to get to the actual, first interview. Regardless, I figured it was coming and knocked it out of the park. If you get a call from a random number and it's for a job you applied to, IT MAY BE A PHONE INTERVIEW! If you're not ready, tell them you're busy. Do anything that you can to hold them off. Telling them, ""Sorry, I'm headed to a three hour movie"" while you prepare for the interview is obviously reasonable considering they randomly called you. If it's not for some organizations, you probably don't want to work there anyway. 

So I got called in for a first interview. At this point, I had spent the past TWO DAYS studying the organization and practicing my answers. In these two days, I still treated finding a job like my job, but I didn't apply to any new jobs. I simply prepared for this first interview. By the time I got there, there wasn't a question they could throw at me that I didn't have the perfect answer to. I came here to r/jobs, I searched for first interviews, I searched for first interview questions to ask, etc. I studied my answers and how I would say them--at what speed, how I would use my hands, etc. I also practiced my posture so that I could have a confident posture as I interviewed. During the actual interview, I kept careful notice of things like my hand movement and posture and adjusted them accordingly. I kept good contact with all three individuals who were interviewing me. I threw a bit of my personal traits in (like my humor) and made them laugh multiple times. When I couldn't think of an answer RIGHT off the bat, I took my time. I'd sit there in silence for 10 or 15 seconds and gather my thoughts. Then, I'd knock it out of the park. Those of you who aren't necessarily personable, practice it. Practice it for the sake of the interview. I can only imagine how many people have not gotten jobs despite being very qualified for them simply because they seemed a bit stiff or awkward. 

During this first interview, you obviously want to relate every question they ask back to your previous experience or education. This may not work for computer science or engineering, but in a lot of careers, you are going to be asked the EXACT SAME QUESTIONS that you read whenever you Google what questions you may be asked. I can't quite hone in on how many questions I got, but I would say a good 25% were questions I'd heard plenty of times before and had mastered. I had mastered exactly how I would tie them back to my previous experience. 

I knew I killed the first one. I texted all of my friends and let them know that the job was mine. After my first interview, they told me that I'd hear back from them by the end of the week (my first interview was on Tuesday), and that there would only be a second interview if there was another great candidate. On Wednesday, I awaited my offer. Cocky, I know. But I flat-out murdered that first interview. Nothing on Wednesday. On Thursday, I received a call... They needed me for a second interview. Fuck. I had some real, true competition. I was one of two possible candidates. Did I fret? Did I cry and hope I'd get it? Nope. I went back to the drawing board. 

This time, I researched the second interview. I'd actually never had one despite having four jobs since 18 (I'm 24 now). I read that there was a possibility that it'd be a tour and that they'd want to see how I fit in with the organization. I read that the questions would get a little bit more in depth. So I prepared. I prepared my ass off. By the way, the second interview was at 4 PM, and they called me to ask if I could come in for another one at 12:30 PM. Maybe that's their technique... but on my end, it just seemed like a short amount of time. Regardless, I got ready as much as I could. I got more in depth with my answers, and literally practiced how I would speak to people I met to show how I'd fit in with the organization. I went deeper in my research. I went through the first 20 pages on Google to read anything I could on the organization. I could've done more, I'm sure. I knew names, dates, facts, and figures. I knew their outcomes, their budget, their programs, etc. I was ready when it came down to it. 

I went in and was as personable as I could be. They had someone new there to interview me. I had expected the CEO from my research (and prepared questions and answers for her in particular!) but it wasn't her. Regardless, I had practiced everything so many times it didn't matter. I took a tour of the facilities, asked NEW and more SPECIFIC questions to see if I wanted to work there (that's what they're looking for on a second interview, I'd read), and walked out of there feeling like I'd kill that interview too.

But tomorrow, 9 AM came. And no call. I waited and I waited. It seemed like I waited for an eternity. No call. DON'T let this psyche you out. Sometimes it takes time as I learned today. Well, I guess that's obvious. But I just always think they'll call the person who gets the job right away. Anyway, I got the call. Every time I've gotten a job, actually, the person on the other end extending the job offer to me has always sounded somber like they had some bad news for me. This was no different. But I heard the words. ""We'd like to offer..."" I literally teared up. I had no savings. I had reached out to my friends and family but to no avail. I had to continue to make money immediately. And I succeeded when I had to. It literally made me flat-out cry. 

So what did I do exactly? I listened to all of the advice I'd ever gotten. I read long ass bullshit like this. I internalized all of the advice that I'd ever read. I was confident mainly. I answered every question like I'd already had the job. r/jobs had helped me out more than they knew. They'd taught me so much about interviewing and fine-tuning a cover letter or resume. Thank you so much, r/jobs. You helped me find work that is righteous. I'm working for a nonprofit that helps at-risk women. This is an important goal to me. This was also the first job I'd ever gotten where there was solely one position. Every other job I'd ever gotten, there were multiple positions open for the same job title. This one was special. And all the research I did, including here on r/jobs helped me tremendously. 

Stay hopeful. And I hope this information helps someone as r/jobs has helped me.

I have been work for Mid/High Cap companies my entire career so I'm not familiar with working for a startup. I was told that lower salary is expected in exchange for potential future equity in case the company goes IPO.

My questions are:

1. How much roughly (in percentage) lower on base salary do startups usually pay compared to established, usually public, company?

2270,gxgmlx,False,Training,5,Lack of Training is Making Me Feel Inadequate,jobs,"I’ve been at my job for a year and a half now, and I work very closely with my supervisor.  She’s amazing, _however_, she tends to hoard work instead of delegating the tasks that I’m supposed to be doing in the first place, and she’s put off training me on over half of the things she said she would since I started working there.

I know that poor training is practically the norm nowadays, and while I know that it’s not my fault that I’m not being trained or taught to do a lot of things, I can’t help but feel completely inadequate and embarrassed when our coworkers ask me questions or expect me to do things that I have no knowledge in because _I was never taught_.

It’s been a bit more difficult during this COVID situation, because my supervisor is at home with her kids and I’m expected to run the office all by myself.  I don’t do a terrible job at all;  I’m definitely capable of running the office alone and I actually enjoy it, but it’s difficult when I’m expected to take care of things that I received no training for.

There’s a lot of things that I’ve taught myself how to do, and a lot of technical issues that I’ve fixed by myself because our IT people are usually too busy to assist me (which is also frustrating), so I know I’m not completely helpless.  And I would LOVE more responsibilities, but I can’t take them on because she would rather do things herself than teach me, so I feel like my hands are tied.  What is the saying:  between a rock and a hard place?

It really eats away at my motivation.  I honestly wonder most of the time why they even have me there, because I have periods where I have nothing to do while my supervisor is drowning in work.  I have to remind her to delegate tasks to me, but because there’s so much I haven’t been trained to do, she can only give me so much work before I’m left with nothing to do again.

How can I get over feeling inadequate, or like a waste of space and money because I’m not being used to my full potential, so to speak?",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gxgmlx/lack_of_training_is_making_me_feel_inadequate/,1,"First of all, there’s no ‘wasting.’ Most people in white collar roles only actually do work a couple of hours per day.

I was with my previous team for two years and I was a \~rock star\~ over there. I knew how everyone worked and was able to manage my six executives and team of \~70 on my own, which really impressed my new executive in my interview. I was hired with this team almost 3 weeks ago, and I feel like I've been *so slow* since my first day.

Granted, I haven't received any form of training with this team. I was basically thrown in to it from day one, and I feel like I'm learning how my new executive works by her telling me I'm making a mistake or doing things wrong. I'm really struggling with this learning curve, because her working style is a complete 180 from what I'm used to with my previous team, and I almost feel like I'm starting from scratch or having to rewire my brain and unlearn what I'm used to. I also feel like an idiot because I'm having my mistakes pointed out to me constantly. I was told that I was hired because they knew I was a great admin and that I could handle it, but I feel really discouraged after having mistake after mistake pointed out (which is really just preferential stuff of my current exec vs. my previous ones). 

My previous execs would essentially give me a long list of things to do, and then leave me alone to do them + answer their phones. My new exec is *extremely* hands on, requires a lot more ""assisting"", remembers exact conversations and things she asked you to do from two weeks ago, and likes everything to be a certain way. She will ask me questions about her calendar or meetings I've scheduled as if I have her calendar memorized, expecting a quick answer, and then I feel like a flustered idiot trying to remember what her meetings are or when I scheduled a specific meeting for.

She's SO nice and everyone tells me she's a great leader, but I can't help but feel like I'm falling short of their expectations of this ""master admin"" they hired. I think she's used to a level of service that her previous admin provided (who was with her for a few years) and I'm just not there yet.

Before I go, he told me verbally that the company would rehire me after the pandemic‘s over. 

Since then I have been back on the job search again. Now, before you comment “Just get a job at the grocery store bro!”, let me remind you that *OPT VISAS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO WORK ON WHATEVER IT’S RELATED TO THEIR MAJORS OF STUDY*.

Boss has hit me with two huge, complicated, weird projects. What to do?",jobs,"It's obviously busy work. My new contract is a definite two-month contract, which I have been told will be very difficult for them to terminate. The boss even said the contract could not be terminated, no matter what, bu it's obviously so they can find a replacement. (I'm in the EU.) 

Their reason for my firing was not trusting my skillset in a certain area in which I am inexperienced, and in which they promised to help me learn. They provided no teachable moments.

I don't plan on doing nothing during these two months, but you should see the stuff I was sent. It's as it was written by a madman. It makes no sense, is confusing, unorganized, and obviously just pulled from a back closet to keep me busy.

My question is, how do I handle this? I was fired for very sketchy reasons (I had great relationships with my team, I honestly was doing good work, trying as hard as I could, received nothing but praise from my superiors up until the day I was fired -- my line manager, my colleagues, everyone besides the higher-up is shocked and a bit angry by the decision to let me go).

This two-month contract, the boss said, was out of the ""goodness of his heart."" But there's no way any of this work can be completed within the 7 weeks I have left. Plus I have 6 days holiday, as I will have worked 3 months in total (probation month plus these two). So it's really six weeks.

The intern is brand new and only in their 2nd year of college, but people in our line of work have to be extremely detail oriented to avoid expensive mistakes. This type of sloppy work would not even be ok in school.

I've got one nice suit from Brooks Brothers which I interviewed in, but I'd like to get a new one (which isn't quite as expensive!) along with a half-dozen shirts--I'm pretty well stocked for ties still. Does anyone have any recommendations of places where I could get a good deal and the suit/shirts are of a decent quality? I've seen some nice suits in *Banana Republic*, and I walk past a *Jos A Bank* daily which always is advertising some good deals.

I figure that on Black Friday weekend too there could be the chance to get a great deal too...",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dxowdl/new_business_wardrobe_for_start_of_a_new_job/,1,Check out the department stores.

What I suggest doing is taking your monthly salary: (say $1000)

Subtracting bills and rent etc (say $400)

Then divide by 30 to get your daily expenses (600/30 = 20)

So basically you have $20 each day to spend on your shit. So when you are spending money, you know that you shouldn't go past ~$140 a week. And each day you might want to spend around $10 on food, so you have extra to spend on weekends. ",2019-07-09 00:22:56
1117,fpmbjy,False,Covid-19,2,"Refusing unsafe working conditions vs. coming into work - either way, my finances are screwed",jobs,"x-post social work

 I currently have a non-patient care role at an inpatient facility. My governor ordered that all non-essential/non-life sustaining workplaces shut down due to COVID-19. The geographic area I'm in has been hit very hard by COVID, so the shelter in place is absolutely necessary. As a healthcare facility, my workplace needs to stay open to continue to meet patient needs. However, my employer is taking the fact that the workplace is ""essential and life-sustaining"" to mean that every employee needs to continue to do their job physically in the facility. My position could be done from home, but my department's requests to telework have been denied. We got a memo that explained ""all employees are essential employees"" so therefore telecommuting during the pandemic is not allowed. Even though my job doesn't involve face-to-face patient interaction, I frequently walk past patients in tight hallway spaces, my department uses a patient lounge as a meeting room, patients often use staff bathrooms, etc. If COVID sweeps through our patient population, there's a high likelihood I could catch it if someone sneezes at the wrong time. My workspace is also not in compliance with CDC social distancing recommendations, so if my coworker one desk over gets sick, it's likely I would too. Did I mention there are several staff members currently on quarantine? Most likely, they passed COVID along to other employees before the health department ordered them to stay home.

On many levels, the fact we still need to physically come into work is so concerning. Many of our patients have conditions that affect their immune system, so it's in their best interest to limit the number of people in the building to reduce their chances of exposure. For the sake of the nurses, housekeepers, and dietary staff who do not have the ability to perform their roles remotely, it's also important to limit transmission and have anyone who can work remotely to stay home. This has been brought to management's attention, but we're being told it's not fair to have some employees work from home while others have to come in. Not fair?!!? It's not fair to our patients if we don't have enough nurses on hand because they contracted COVID from an asymptomatic billing staff member who was not permitted to telecommute. It's not fair to the housekeepers making $12 an hour if they incur thousands of dollars in hospital bills, all because they ran into a quality assurance staff member with COVID in a tight stairwell. (These are fictional examples, but they have the chance of becoming reality if things don't change). Of course, our safety as employees in telework-compatible roles is at risk, and any one/all of us could come down with COVID when we could have just stayed home and practiced social distancing. I'm concerned about a vulnerable family member of mine whose health could be needlessly jeopardized by my employers insistence that EVERYONE works in the office.

Because of the fact my telework request was denied, I now have a difficult decision to make. Management told me we have the right to refuse to come in if we don't feel safe, however once we roll through our PTO we would have to take the leave unpaid. My job/benefits would be held, but I would have no money coming in. The state of emergency could stretch on for months, so I am very concerned since my PTO will be gone next week. I can't afford to be off of work without income for a prolonged period of time, but I also can't afford to go to work and contract COVID. Outside of work, I have only been going out into public once a week to get groceries and gas, so if I take unpaid leave then my chance of getting COVID would be small. But in the event there happens to be airborne COVID particles in the checkout line, I don't know how I would afford my medical bills without any income. I have enough savings to last me for two months, but that is only if there are no emergencies during that time. My health insurance has a very high deductible, so if I get hospitalized I am absolutely screwed. Given the employees with COVID exposure at work, it seems likely I will get COVID if I return to work, but I would be in a (slightly) better financial situation to handle this.

It looks like we may be headed toward a global recession, so the idea of not working for several months is terrifying. I also have a family member who was laid off due to a COVID closure, and it's possible she could be unemployed for months. I may need to help her out financially in the event there are issues with her unemployment application. Then I ask myself: what would happen if I get permanent lung damage from work-acquired COVID and incur thousands of dollars in medical costs each and every year as a result? Or what would happen if the family member who lives with me gets it? They are in a high-risk demographic and the mortality rate is absolutely terrifying. Ten years from now, I don't want to be thinking to myself ""if only I had stayed home from work...""

It feels irresponsible to take unpaid leave, but it also feels irresponsible for me to jeopardize my health and the health of my family. If only my employer agreed to let us work from home, this could all be avoided! I wish I knew an actuary who could run simulations of all the various scenarios that could happen if I go back to work versus if I take unpaid leave. It seems like there is no good solution, so at this point I am trying to choose the option that is ""less bad.""

&#x200B;

Basically I've found a local company that is looking for someone that does, basically, graphic design. I've been looking to make a career move recently but have floundered in my current frustrations (and being swamped with current work).

&#x200B;

I'm an artist with a focus more in illustration than in web graphics, and I know Photoshop and basic Illustrator. This position doesn't list specific program knowledge, but they certainly use AfterEffects (which I have no knowledge of) and WordPress (also not knowledgeable). The best thing I feel I have going for me is that I really love what I have seen of their   company culture and feel like I'd be a good fit. I've also been an artist my entire life, professionally freelanced for a few years, and have a pretty good understanding of basic design principles (no degree, which they list as a requirement).

&#x200B;

But, I don't want to be one of those horror stories- the ""We hired someone a few months back who got the spot \*\*somehow\*\*, but she really is clueless"" - and put myself in an unstable position as a result. Alternatively, this could be a way into a career I finally feel passionate about (sorry, customer service, I don't think you're it anymore), and the company works a lot with local businesses, which I care about more than I thought I would.

1) is it good that I made it all the way to the hiring committee?

2. It's hard to say if you were or not. Google has a very proprietary hiring system where you are scored on a variety of criteria. You did well enough score-wise to move you forward to HC.  


That being said, Google does do better than most with respect to giving feedback to candidates. I don't think that you necessarily need it; there were probably other factors going on which got them to reject you at this stage. From what I was told by a friend who is a recruiter at Google, it's very rare that you get rejected at that stage - but it is known to happen - probably because they couldn't truly find a spot for you in any group at the company.

My suggestion to you is to simply thank the recruiter for her time and see if you can apply again in 6 - 12 months. Maybe by then you will be able to get through HC.

A little background first. I went to Culinary School and ended up dropping out due to depression and family illness. I have worked as a cook/line cook for 10 years, and have 2 years of management experience. I walked out of my job in early 2013 and spent 8+months searching for work. I finally got a job washing dishes at the local Denny's for minimum wage. 3 days after I got the job, I was contacted by a grocery store that I had put in application in and forgotten about. I went through hiring process and was hired making $8.50 an hour. I was thrilled. Fast Forward 2 months and I am regretting having 2 jobs. I work til 11pm at denny's then have to go to work at the grocery store at 6am sometimes 5am. I am working about 45 hours a week now and maybe get 1 day off a week.

  I absolutely dread going to work at Denny's. I work 4 days (now that they cut my hours) usually only 5-6 hours shifts. The only thing I dread about working at the grocery store is the lack of sleep I have between the 2 jobs. 

  I really want to quit Denny's but I feel obligated to them because they gave me a job after 8 months of searching. I just don't see a future with them, because I realize I can make more money elsewhere. They want me to become a cook for them, but they want me to do the online training on my time.

690,er29od,False,Unemployment,8,Boss threatening to fire me over things outside my control,jobs,"Hello, I am from Australia and I work as a crew member for a fast food restaurant. I have been working here for around half a year now, and I feel like I am an excellent employee. I greet customers/take orders with a friendly demeanor, I prepare food and orders immediately, I am never late to work, I am fast paced etc. I can't see any issues with my performance.


So my issue is my manager/boss has given me a 'last chance' warning for something completely out of my control. When taking orders from customers, the order appears on screens throughout the building regardless if the order has been completed or confirmed. I presume this is to save time so the food can be made whilst the customer is ordering. The problem occurs when a customer changes their mind before the order is paid for. 

For example:

1. Customer orders a meal with a chocolate milkshake. 

2. I enter the order onto the machine, and then tell them the price.

3. The customer then goes 'oh actually can I get that with a vanilla milkshake instead?'

4. I adjust the order and then they pay.


Since I started working here, I have seen this happen multiple times per day without fail. Only over the last few days has my manager come up to me and started blaming me for the order changing. She basically said to me 'the next time it happens, you will be fired'.


I am honestly scared to go to my next shift because I feel like I can be fired at any moment for something out of my control. I would say that she is looking for an excuse to fire me, but it could also be that she just reacting badly to food wastage. I don't know. Either way, is this a valid (although dodgy) way to get rid of me as an employee? Or do I have a case of unfair dismissal if I was to be terminated? Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/er29od/boss_threatening_to_fire_me_over_things_outside/,1,"Has she actually provided a valid way to avoid this happening?  For example, 'Oh, make sure you wait to click this button until they pay.'  If there is a way to fix the problem, then you need to apply it.  I doubt that is the case, but wanted to check.

If she hasn't trained you on this, then ask her directly for how this situation is supposed to be handled.  If she starts yelling at you about the waste, just keep politely asking her how you are supposed to enter the order and collect money without entering the order?

If there is no solution, and she is just lashing out at you, yeah, I would start looking for a new job.  I can't say whether getting fired over this would violate the law in Australia, but I will say that it sounds like a toxic, shitty place to work.

If you really want the job, then you probably have to go over her head.  Send an email or letter to her boss, describe the situation, and ask how you are supposed to enter the order so this doesn't happen, as your manager can not or will not explain it to you.  But this is chancy.  It could backfire, and you'll be gone.  Even if it works, be prepared for that manager to hate you until the end of days. ",2020-01-19 21:04:32

Hello r/jobs, I wanted to get your opinion on formal performance reviews at startups. I've had some exposure to this process at a previous employer, but that employer was much larger (~7000 employees, compared to 20-30) and the review process was significantly more established.

For some background, this is my second job out of school and a little over 3 years into my career. I've been at this startup for roughly 1 year 3 months, and no review or compensation increase has occurred yet. This review coming up is the first formal attempt to do so.

I have a title of ""Lead *something, omitted for privacy* Engineer"", and feedback has generally been informally very positive for my performance. I am wondering how to both prepare for a more formal review, and how to get the most out of it, specifically for gathering as much feedback as possible and approaching it with intelligent questions.

Also, I am in the dark as to what to expect in terms of a compensation/equity increase, and how much I can reasonably fight for.

332,ak9yiw,False,Discipline,19,"My coworker went through my email on at least 2 occasions and forwarded herself a few of my emails, I am conflicted on what to do about it",jobs,"A little background info : I work for a big health care company. I work in one of their medical offices and in my job I interact with many patients a day and I have access to their medical information and have to chart. We have a lot of computers in our department and we use those computers to chart patient info as well as do many other things. My job gives every employee a username and password to log onto windows and that same information is used to log onto our work emails. On certain computers when you log onto windows, you can simply click on the email application and it will open up your work email without entering in a password again.  For my position, there are 2 computers that are primarily used among my coworkers and I, one of those computers i set up to that once we log onto windows, our email will open without needed to enter a password.

So, a few days ago I was logged onto one of the computers because I was working on that computer, i never logged off because i was going back and forth from that room and it takes minutes to log back on. One of my coworkers had come in for a shift for the second half of our day. When she came in she was assigned to work in the room I was originally working in, the one that I was logged on the computer. A few minutes after she had clocked in I went to that room to tell her something and i saw the computer screen was on my email page(I realized i had left my email open because the last time i used it the webpage froze on me and i never got to close it). When my coworker saw me she got startled and made some bs about how she thought she was logged into her email and then said ""i will log you out right now"" I was suspicious when that happened but didn't think anything of it and just assumed she would log me out since she said she would. That day passed and when i came into work the next day I opened my email to respond to a message I was having with a union representative, when i opened the email somewhere at the top of the email it said ""you forwarded this email at 2:06 on January 24th"" When I saw that i right away realized something was fishy, i looked through my sent and deleted boxes and nothing was in there. Much to my luck, our email system allows us to recover deleted emails within 30 days and that option popped up and low and behold i recovered 2 deleted emails. Both of those emails were emails I had with a union representative in regards to my job and both of those emails were forwarded to my coworker who was using my  computer and had my email open when i walked in. One of those emails was sent a week before the other, one on January 18th and one on the 24th. On top of that, this girl had to really look through my email to find these conversations. The first one she forwarded was in my sent box so she had to have looked literally through everything. 

I have no clue how to handle this situation: I have a few options: 1. Would be to report her for doing what she did but i'm certain she would get fired. 2. I confront her about what she did and tell her she was wrong and to never do it again to me or anything else, and just ask her how she would feel if someone did this to her etc etc. 

I understand that people can be curious and maybe if they see someones email open they might read what they see on the page (although this is wrong either way), this girl did way more than that she went through many of my emails to find these emails and she freaking sent them to her self. I don't dislike this person and although i would never ever trust them, i dont no if i feel comfortable reporting them because they might lose their job. However, I am conflicted because my job does require us to report certain things to compliance, for example if my coworker was accessing my medical chart or another coworkers chart she would have to be reported right away. However, I don't know if accessing my emails falls under the same category(of course her doing this is still extremely unethical).

What would you guys do if this happened to you? What do you guys think I should do? Will talking to her be enough for her to never do this again or will it simply make our work situation hostile.

My workplace consists of 2 different buildings with the same trainings administered by different staff (we'll call them Building A and Building B). When I initially started 16 months ago, I was assigned to split my time between both buildings, and completed all of my initial training at Building A; however, after 5.5 months, I was offered to work full-time at Building B, and have been there since the last 11 months. Overall, my workplace consists of frequently being short staffed due to mismanagement, miscommunication, inadequate trainings, low salary, burnout, etc. I have been searching for another job with a better work atmosphere, but haven't been successful in finding another job yet.

During one of my initial trainings, the training was supposed to taught for 3 full days, but ended up being taught for only 2 days due to a snow day happening that week, and subsequent time constraints at Building A. Despite the ""shortened"" training, I felt fairly well equipped with the presented knowledge, and passed. I was initially supposed to complete my recertification of this training 4 months ago, but due to the backlog of trainings and disorganization of my workplace, they decided to do my recertification just last week, after 4 months past the original ""deadline"". The recertification course is intended to be a 3-4 hour course summarizing all of the training from the initial 3 day course that's taken when you first start with the company.  I completed the recertification at Building B (since I now work there full-time), and have been noted to have several deficiencies, which has significantly caught me off guard, especially since the trainings are supposedly created to provide comparable information at both buildings. It is also noted that this training is not completed by my department supervisor; it is by another coordinator within the workplace.

The overall recertification training was only completed by 1 instructor at Building B (no other instructors agreed to show up to assist with the training, leading to mass confusion about recertification training expectations, improper abilities to fully teach material, etc. When I completed my initial training, it was done with 3 instructors present for additional feedback also, etc). I have never completed a recertification course before, and felt that the instructor heavily criticized me in front of the other trainees, and felt that the training was ultimately a very demeaning, humiliating, and discouraging experience for me, which I did not experience with any of my initial trainings at Building A. I also have not been noted to have any other deficiencies by my supervisor related to my job duties, etc.

Given that I completed all of my initial training at Building A, I am not sure if deficiencies are being noted because the trainings really aren't ""standardized"" like they should be between both buildings and I did not learn everything I initially should have, if it's because my shortened 2 day training really should've been a 3 day training when I initially took it 16 months ago, etc. None of my coworkers  or other colleagues have had a recertification or initial training experience like this. I spoke with my supervisor about this situation because I truly feel like a ""failure"", and she assured me that this is a result of errors and inadequacy by the training department that are beyond my control, and that is not my fault. My supervisor also mentioned that there seems to be ongoing issues of training consistency occurring between both buildings also. I am planning to meet with the instructor (with my supervisor present) to discuss my recertification training performance, as well as my previous training experiences, but am overall still feeling like a failure and really upset about this situation, even with 16 months of experience at my job.

I have clouded my mind over the course of 1 year of applying for jobs. I can't seem to gather inspiration to apply anymore. 

I graduated in 2019 (Batchelors in ME), and I joined a Startup, but due to the depressive environment in the company ( very bad management ) I quit within a month of tourment. 

I believe I am a good engineer, I know my fundamentals and I am good with Analysis. I thought it would be relatively easy to get a job. And now, an year in, having given 6 interviews with 250+ applications, I find myself to be unemplyed. Of the 6 interviews, 1 rejected me and the others just did'nt work out due to multiple reasons including Covid19. 

In my most recent application which literally took 1 month, they lead me on with a project (which took me 1.5 weeks to complete), and loved the report I submitted. They thought it was ""great work"" and that I seem to be a good fit for their company. About a month ago, they suddenly stopped contacting me without any reason and don't respond to my emails or calls. It really hurt me because I had done 3 interviews with them and really looked forward to working there. 

Reluctantly, I find myself back to square one, sending out emails and applying through various sites. 

I still persue engineering with small projects, simulations and refresh my memory with the basics. It is a part of me, but it hurts not being able to apply my knowledge. I live with my parents, which makes things even worse, I want to be financially indipendent. 

There are companies I can work in (who would hire anyone instantly), with minial work on CAD and a low pay. I am hoping I don't have to resort to that.

I have dealt with an anxiety disorder for many years now, along with mild PTSD from my sexual assault, and I would like to know if disclosing this will affect me in my corporate life. 

I was given an optional form where I can disclose these kinds of disabilities, and although it states that disclosing this information will not subject me to differential treatment, I would just like to know if this is just for HR's records or if it will realistically negatively affect my position at the company. I am already very closed-off on speaking about my mental health issues and past trauma with close friends, so I feel even more reluctant about speaking about it in a professional setting.
