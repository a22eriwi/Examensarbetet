275,fnr5fc,False,Success/Cheers,204,It took a pandemic,povertyfinance,Well last month we were facing eviction and having an impossible time finding an affordable apartment. Then COVID shut down happened and everyone left my town. Broke leases and moved back home when school canceled. Then apartments got cheaper and I got a bigger apartment than I currently have in an affordable price range! We used our tax return to pay off our previous eviction. The Governor canceled all evictions so we are able to finish our lease and we can pay off the money we owe in back rent instead. The apartment isn't going to file anymore. Now we wont have any negative marks on our credit. We still have money to get a (new to me) bigger couch too a benefit of school closing is students dont move with their stuff.

I hope my title is not misleading. i tried to best explain the concept in 1 sentence, but hour from now i will possible realize an error or un-intentional mis-representation of the issue. So apologies if that turns out to be the case.  

Listen to the episode, it discusses how people in certain types of stress, like financial stress essentially justify purchases without realizing it is a bad idea.  

This can even effect those of us with plenty of money. It is about the mental blocks we create when we feel a scarcity in some way. so this is also a good listen for people in all kinds of situations even the middle class and wealthy. It just happens to focus on financial scarcity.  

Anyways, even if it does not directly solve an issue, i always find it good to understand how our minds work, and then maybe we can catch ourselves when and if we go into these mental states.  

If only to stop us at checkout and make us think ""Hey, wait. Am i doing that mental Justification and not actually making a good choice right now?""

DISCLAIMER: This is hidden brain not some media news show trying to tell you how to think and live. Hidden Brain tends to be an extremely open minded podcast. It simply discusses studies and observations. It is not always delivering absolute facts. Sometimes it is just debating a topic and has no final conclusion. In fact it often leaves many things up in the air and just gives you various sides of the topic to think about.  I am not saying this is some absolute fact and neither are they. It is just an interesting thing to think about and possibly watch out for. If it can help 1 person and applies to no one else.

989,ehp010,False,,183,Poverty Finance essentials,povertyfinance,"I did a top posts of all time search looking for a few good pieces of PF advice. I figure I would start a conversation today regarding some PF essentials. Hopefully this thread will help lay a good foundation to start (or continue) our journey towards financial freedom.  

Things that I learned from this sub and have implemented:

1. Spend less: Pretty obvious but you would be surprised how much spending we do when we are not conscious of spending money. 

2. Make a budget and stick to it: I count calories in order to lose weight on a weekly basis. I applied the same concept to spending money. I can only spend X amount on groceries, X amount at a coffee shop, X amount when I go out, etc. 

3. Get on a plan to pay off debt: Paying credit card debt can take some months, even years, but the more CC debt you pay down (and not add too) the more the debt will decrease. If you stick to a payment plan and are disciplined it is just a matter of time before your cards are paid off. Also, if you have school loan debt seek out forgiveness options. Thanks to this sub I was able to get on a 10-year plan to have my debt forgiven. 

4. Find a low-cost lifestyle: Nights out in the club and checking out the new movie releases every week can crush a budget. Some cheaper options for entertainment I‚Äôve enjoyed include reading at the library (or coffee shop), writing on a blog (free on WordPress), playing fighting games (high cost of entry but once established it is ‚Äúfree‚Äù to play and improve), and not drinking alcohol.

5. Get in shape: I feel it is easier to deal with being poor if you are shredded compared to if you are in bad health. Working out has really helped me with the day to day stress of dealing with denying myself in an effort to save more money. Also, make sure you are getting an adequate amount of sleep. If you suffer from insomnia or struggle to sleep look into remedies (meditation, consistent bed time, exercise, journaling). 

Any other pieces of wisdom will be appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/ehp010/poverty_finance_essentials/,719,"These are all great ideas! I catch up with friends at their house every couple of weeks for drinks and just bring my own alcohol, which I usually limit to a couple of beers.

560,fmtcj1,False,Success/Cheers,69,It paid off.,povertyfinance,"It finally paid off.

Foregoing the fun Friday nights.

Not spending my salary on a new vehicle.

It all paid off.

Me and my girlfriend can afford our normal lifestyle for a year. No matter what happens. A year. I haven't been laid off, but if it does happen we're okay. I'm so proud of us, even though it took sacrifice. We're not scrambling to figure out ""what next?"", because we budgeted and planned for this.

*EDIT* Below I have included financial information. A recent job change has possibly made me not ""poverty"" level anymore. If so, I will remove my post. I dont want this to be a ""pat me on the back"", and would like to share how we have prepped for the ""apocalypse"".

Financial Information:
Job: Inside sales. (27K base, extra 13K if quota is reached)

Previous Employment: Truck unloader

Education: Bachelor's in Business Administration (cheapest state school I could find. Had one scholarship).

Current Debt: 16.5K (All Student Loans).

Rent $736 a month

All Bills: Approx. $200 a month. The season is a factor.

How we did it:
Canned foods, Intermittent fasting to put us at 2 meals max. Paid off my vehicle with double employment. Cheap meals where leftovers gave us 2-3 meals a week. Light prepping in the pantry, so we wouldn't have to shop if something kept us in. MOST IMPORTANT: Odd Jobs. I made some very decent money on ranches, and farms. Hard work but it paid. In some cases I lived on the ranch, did work, left for my evening job, then woke up to do it again. It was how I paid for my car, and a chunk of my education.

573,ale8y6,False,,286,A Warning About TurboTax,povertyfinance,"I went to file my taxes yesterday the same way I have done for several years, with the TurboTax free file. I noticed a few things that I thought I'd share: 

When I got to the section for the child and dependent care credit, the software kept telling me that I don't qualify. I knew that I still qualified for the credit so I googled it. Turns out, when you enter your W2 at the beginning for you and your spouse, it defaults both of them to one persons name (so it appeared that I made too much money for the credit, while my husband had no income). As soon as I went back and assigned one of the W2 to my husband I qualified for the credit, which boosted my refund by $600. 

Because I filed for a specific credit, TT software said I needed to pay the $39.99 as the free software didn't cover one of the forms I'd need done to file. I was already finished by this point and was getting money back so I figured ok, I'll pay it, and that I will just file by hand next year. TT gave me the option to pay this fee out of my refund, saying something like ""no need to reach for your wallet, we can just take this from your refund"". Nowhere on this page did it indicate that there would be a fee to do so. When I was completely done and ready to file, TT asked me to consent to the charges and hit submit. I noticed that the fees suddenly went from $39.99 to 79.99 and I didn't understand why until I searched the internet and found dozens of complaints from last year. Apparently TT is charging an extra $39.99 in order for them to take the original fee from your return with very little explanation and quite deceptive language on their website. I paid the original fee with my credit card and filed without issue. 

I know this is a bit strange and I am not trying to blast TT in general, but I do think it is fair that people be aware of these fees and quirks of the software. Hope this helps someone! 



EDIT: WOW Silver! Thank you kind stranger! 

This is by far my biggest post on Reddit! I've compiled some of the resources suggested but it appears that the most popular free tax filing this year is Credit Karma.

Shortly after the pandemic, my leaseholder went awol. Won't answer phones, text messages, emails, nothing.

Today the property owner came, demanding his back rent. Despite explaining the situation, showing him proof, and practically begging for time, the man was adamant that we had to pay if we wanted to stay here.

Since none of us can come up with $6000 and I'm still looking for steady work, we will all likely be kicked out.

The other three have somewhere else to go. I don't. So for me, it's back to the shelter.

one of my clients has a real estate attorney in my inbox giving me some useful information. Turns out, even if there wasn't a pandemic, the landlord is going to have a Hard time evicting us.

When you eat out, order water to drink. I love this tip, because nobody thinks your doing it to be cheap, they think your doing it to be healthy. BONUS: It is a healthier choice.  

Drink water at home too. Prices aren't nearly as bad for a soft drink or glass of wine when you buy for home, but they are still a lot more than water.  Invest in a filter of some type. I'm using a brita pitcher until I can install a filtration system. Shoot, depending on where you live you might be totally fine with tap water.

You likely don't have a $1,000 emergency fund, and you're close to the worst case scenario. I know it, I've lived it, and I want to help as many people as possible get out of it.

So, what are you to do in this situation? How can you get through all of this when you‚Äôre only bringing home around $600 every two weeks? The answer a lot of people will get when they are honest with themselves is that sacrifices will have to be made. Whether it‚Äôs cable TV, the new iPhone, or your free time, if you are in this situation where you have this little cash coming in AND you have debt, you probably are either deluding yourself that if you keep on the treadmill things will get better, but the fact is that interest every month when you don‚Äôt pay off your cards is speeding that treadmill up, and eventually you‚Äôll fall off.  An overdraft or two, and suddenly you‚Äôre eyeing a payday loan place just to solve the problem. Stop. Now. If you‚Äôre in this situation, let‚Äôs back up the cardiac arrest, take a few deep breaths and give you a rational plan to deal with this:

Gather up all your monthly bills and pay stubs, pull up your online banking, too.

Look at what you spend your money on, and decide what you want to cut.

**Keep cutting until your bills and expenses are less than your take home pay.**

Next, make calls to all of your credit card companies, and ask for lower interest rates.

Add up all of your minimum monthly payments and monthly recurring bills.

Open a new checking account, preferably without a debit card.

Set up your direct deposit to go to two accounts: one for half the amount you got in step 5, and one for the remainder.

You‚Äôve now built a self-funding small emergency fund.

The remaining money should cover your expenses (groceries, gas, etc).

At the end of every two weeks, the night before payday, take any remaining money, and pay it on your highest interest account. You‚Äôll pay down your debt a little faster and start to see some progress.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, and you‚Äôre still having some trouble making ends meet, go back to step two, and be honest with yourself.  Cutting cable TV alone will save you between 600 and 1200 a year. Cutting other things should be on the table.

616,8mjqo1,False,,301,"I make an extra $1,000 or more every month with beer money sites AMA!",povertyfinance,"Hey everyone. I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/?ref=share&ref_source=link) a few weeks back detailing how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through the use of beermoney sites. Beermoney is, according to Urban Dictionary, ""Extra money for non-essential payments, available for spending on luxuries, hobbies, or a fresh pint of your favorite draft."" I use this definition, because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will explain why I chose this as a way to make money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

Since getting married, I have needed extra money for various bills and saving for things we wanted (down payment on a home). Essentially, I was just tired of barely scraping by every month after tax and savings. Because of this, I have been investing more time in all of these sites over the last 6 or 7 months and the cash flow has been steadily increasing as time goes on. I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner (I am 3 months ahead on payments), have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates, and have built my emergency fund to six months of bills. I am now also able to wake up and see that money came in while I slept. It has been rad.

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix, rather than having to listen to another boss everyday, worry about getting fired, and deal with more people. This works better for my temperament and my preferences. 

The tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

921,ae1qmm,False,,243,"Remember a few months ago when someone posted that you can make quick cash by selling plasma? Well, I did it and here's how it went.",povertyfinance,"**TL;DR:** Donating plasma is real - it's legit.  It takes some time out of your day, but is otherwise low-effort.

A few months ago (maybe over the summer?) someone posted that selling plasma could get you some quick cash.  Ever since then I've been meaning to do it, but kept putting it off.  Finally, I decided that the new year was a great time to stop procrastinating.

The first thing I did was a quick internet search to find out which facilities were near me.  There are two in my area: CSL and B Positive.  I didn't have a lot to go on, so I randommly chose B Positive.  It's a little bit far from my house, but very close to work so I thought that might be convenient.

I went to the B Positive website and read all the FAQs and informational pages.  I'm glad I did because there's some paperwork you have to bring with you.  You will need: a photo ID, your social security card, and proof of address.  I couldn't find my SS card, but according to the website you can also bring your W2 or 1040.  I brought my 1040 and had no problems.

The website said that first time donations take about 2.5 hours.  I arrived at the facility at 9:30 am on Saturday morning.  I needed to leave by 12:30, so I thought that would be pleny of time.

When I got there, the place was cclean and brightly lit.  The other clients were a bit rough around the edges, but I don't know what I expected - a bunch of brain surgeons and fighter pilots?  Anyway, the staff was super nice.  The front desk lady looked at my ID/paperwork and set me up as a donor.  You have to have your fingerprints taken electronically and they take your picture.  

Next you go to a computer kiosk where you log in via a finger scanner (hence the need for fingerprints) and your DOB. You have to answer a series of 52 questions.  If you've ever donated blood, the questions are really similar.  If you've ever had sex with someone who had sex with someone who had sex for drugs, in France, with Ebola while getting a tattoo with a dirty needle, you can stop reading now because they're going to reject you.

After I answered the 52 questions, I waited to be called for my physical.  This is the part where I didn't plan ahead.  It took a loooong time.  It was a busy time of day, and I waited like an hour.  Finally, I realized I wouldn't be able to finish before my 12:30 deadline, so I had to leave.  I did come back later in the afternoon, though, and it went much quicker.

So, when I came back I had to answer the 52 questions again at the kiosk, and then waited a much shorter time to be called.  My ""physician or physician's substitute"" took me to a private exam room and did the usual weight, blood pressure, temperature, etc.  She did a finger prick and had to get a tiny tube of blood to check my iron, protein, and something else I can't remember.  She asked a million questions, a lot of them repeats of the 52 kiosk questions.  She marked my finger with some invisible blacklight ink, and explained that the other place, CSL, marks a different finger - so they'll know if you're trying to double-donate.  She checked my arms for ""bruising"" (aka track marks), checked my eye dialation, felt my stomach, and asked my favorite question - ""Do you want a snack?""  Well heck yeah!  So I got some pretzles and a Powerade.  Then I had to listen to some guy read 23 statements about the process of donating and answer ""Yes"" that I understood.  That part made me feel good because I know some of the other clients are probably not the strongest readers, and by listening to the information it was assured that everyone had access to it.

Before I left that room, the physical lady gave me my Visa card and explained how to set it up and everything.  **HERE'S THE BEST PART:** they pay you according to how much you weigh and fat people get more!!!  My time has finally come!

FINALLY, I got to go back to the donation floor.  It's a giant room with rows of recliner-ish chairs.  They kind of reminded me of those zero-gravity lawn chairs you can get.  The chairs each had a USB port and a plug, so you could use your laptop or charge your phone.  There were also big screens throughout the room in case you wanted to watch TV.  I'd say there were about 40 seats?  The whole thing looked very dystopian, but very clean and legit.

I was directed to a specific seat and the person in charge of that section came over and prepped me for donation.  They verify your name and DOB.  YOu can choose which arm you wan to use - I gave from my left the first time.  They rub you down with iodine and then jab you with the needle.  It was a slight pinch, but not painful at all.  Then they start the machine running.  You have a blood pressure cuff on and while the cuff is tight you're supposed to squeeze and release your fist - that's when the blood is coming out.  When the cuff loosens, you don't have to squeeze any more - that's when the leftovers are getting put back in.  The machine cycles through the whole time you're hooked up.  Once you're done, the person removes the needle and puts some gauze on the site (at my place they wrap it liek a hundred times with bright tape, so if you like attention you can definitely get some!)  The they make you sit up for a few minutes and drink another Powerade.  Finally they let you get up and leave.  The donation part probably took an hour all together on my first try.

From start to finish the staff was **incredibly** nice. 
 Afterwards I felt perfectly fine.  I did drink more water as per the instructions, but didn't have any problems.  Later that night I checked the Visa card balance and sure enough there was 50 buckaroos on it!

That was all on Saturday.  Today I went for my second donation after work.  I went straight to the 52-question kiosk and that checks you in.  Your name appears on a big screen in the waiting area - like an arrivals board at the airport.  I didn't wait long at all, then went back for a mini-health screening (weight, temp, blood pressure, finger prick, check your fingers with a blacklight and re-mark you.)  From there I went to the donation floor and got hooked up.  Today it actually took 2 hours from start to finish, but I don't think that's typical and I'm pretty sure it was my fault.  I think I moved my arm and jostled the needle so I was less ""flowy.""  People who came in after me finished before me.  My best estimate is that you can probably get in and out in a little over an hour.

All in all, whoever wrote that original post was right - donating plasma is easy and you get cash money. AND you're helping someone who really depends on it.  There was a poster in the donation room that said it took 1200 donations per year to treat *one* patient with hemophilia.  That's crazy!

167,9o5zcn,False,,454,"Do not underestimate the effect of working a few extra hours a week. Every dollar of high interest debt you pay now will save roughly two dollars in the long run. 10-12 hours extra a week can pay off $10000 in one year by eliminating $5000 in future interest, or take nearly a year off your mortgage",povertyfinance,"Ever wonder if taking a second job or extra shifts is really worth it? Wonder if your spouse working a light job will really help? 

If you have high interest debt like credit cards, the answer is absolutely yes! 

At the average credit card rate of 15% or higher, every dollar you pay now saves 2 dollars by the time you pay it off. So that extra $7.75 or $10 per hour becomes $15.50 or $20 per hour when you take into effect how much it saves you when you put it towards paying off that high interest debt. 

Even if you don't have high interest debt and you have a decent mortgage, over the life of a 20 or 30 year mortgage you pay nearly $2 for every dollar you took out. 

So paying an extra $5000 a year up front from a 10 hour a week second job will end up saving you nearly $10,000, or almost a year of payments for every year you work the second job.

If you work an extra 10 hours a week for 10 years and put that towards the average mortgage, it will save you 10 years of payments for the equivalent of only 2.5 years of full time work. 

So yes, if you work a little extra and put that towards your debt, you can dramatically improve your debt situation and free up years of your life in the future.

152,er1qws,False,,835,Why you need to let poor people buy coffee in peace,povertyfinance,"I somehow found myself in another ""Why don't you just cut unnecessary spending?"" spiral, so I've decided to do some math that I and anyone else can copy and paste as needed.

&#x200B;

Why don't you stop buying Starbucks/Netflix/beer/movie tickets/whatever occasional purchase you use to feel a little better? Won't that fix your financial situation? Why is the snack/trinket/experience worth more?

Let me lead with this: Money has no intrinsic value. You avoid spending money on one thing so that you can spend it on another. That's the reason. You can choose to not spend as much on one thing so that you can pay for something else. If the savings on one thing are not enough to purchase the other thing, it makes no sense to not get the enjoyable thing that you can afford.

The example:

Let's say you want to buy a car. You can get a nice, new car for $25k. We're ignoring trade in value or savings for a down payment in these calculations because poor people don't tend to have significant equity \[update: not because you are poor in this scenario but because we're going to work from zero with our numbers\]. We're starting from the bottom. The average interest rate for a new car loan in the US is 4.21%. This would make your payments $463/month.

Now, let's say that you don't want to get that car loan. You want to avoid that pesky interest rate. It just doesn't make financial sense, right? Instead you opt to ride public transit until you can save up enough for the car. The average cost of a transit pass in the US is $67/month. That's $396 less than the car payment, so that's $396/month out of your transportation budget that you can tuck away.

It will take you **over five years to afford that car**.

That is five years of only going where the buses run while the buses are running. That is five years of dealing with other people's smells and sounds. That is five years of walking to and from transit stops.

This is a best case scenario. What if you don't live in a city with adequate transit? What if it's more expensive in your city? What if you work overnight, and the buses don't go in the direction you need at the times you need them to? What if a drunk person pukes or pees on you? Because that happens.

Given the choice, many of us would just pay the extra to commute in clean privacy for those five years. It's worth it to be able to go where you want when you want. The benefits would outweigh the costs, as evidenced by the number of Americans with auto loans.

**The only other way to compress that timeline is to be able to increase your transportation budget.**

This is why broke people buy lattes instead of investing. It's because if you bought a frappuccino every day, it would take **nine and a half years** to spend the equivalent of a 7% down payment on a $250k house. It would take **almost four years** even for a $100k house.

**You cannot nickel and dime your way out of poverty.**

If you wouldn't sit in someone else's urine stains for five years, leave the poor person buying an avocado alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:  Yikes. Where do I begin?

I thought that the first paragraph explained my purpose clearly enough, but this is a scenario meant to explain a certain type of opportunity cost to someone living above a certain standard. Imaginary scenario guy is obviously not that hard up. I'm thinking it was a certain line that confused people, and I've edited it accordingly.

The daily frappuccino example is a theoretical maximum pulled from a common trope of ""financial advice"" columns. No broke person is buying one every day, but even if they were, that's the absolute most they could save. No, that number isn't nothing, but that's an imaginary peak. The point is that it's not the coffee that's keeping people out of escrow.

But look what people did.

They fought tooth and nail to explain why an imaginary person with the space in their budget should not buy something they want. I've been accused of making up interest rates, never having ridden a bus, never having seen a homeless person \[projection much?\], etc. All my numbers were pulled from national averages compiled in the last year. Some of the numbers were surprising enough to be in headlines. The pee scenario? Pulled from a true story. The struggles of public transit? From my own experience in my city. I've been to cities with beautiful transit that could easily replace a car, but for myself and many other Americans that's just not a realistic situation.

I was just trying to give people a tool to make a point. That point is that it's not anyone's business to police how somebody else makes their way through a long term problem. (And for a lot of people poverty isn't long term but actually permanent. It's just a fact that many people die in poverty. I'm not being pessimistic. It's a statistic.)

If I might get something in ten years, it's up to me to decide whether that's worth chipping away at the quality of the days in between. It's not anyone else's job to pass judgement on that decision.

847,88rhfp,False,,129,Can we ban the suggestion of giving up your children?,povertyfinance,"This is something I saw and even heard in PF, but hoped not to find here. Alas, I've seen one outright suggestion and one allusion already this morning. While I admit that truthfully giving up your child/ren would likely improve your financial situation, people making these suggestions are either not giving this suggestion enough thought or simply making a political point. There are a plethora of legitimate reasons not to consider this option. Medical condition with genetic factors are most likely to be seen and recognized by biological family members, for example. Different studies show that adopted children are frequently less favored than natural children. Older children are less likely to be adopted and more likely to be placed in foster care, which is a vipers nest of its own. Culturally parents who give up their children may be shamed, even by their family and essential support networks. The list goes on and on. No one knows the exact circumstances of someone's parenthood and their decisions to keep or give up their child. This suggestion is often cruel, and almost always pointless.

Edit: I've been up all night and have an Easter Egg hunt to do before I can sleep. Ultimately the point I'm making is that this suggestion is trolling, regardless of the commenters actual intent. Most people who've been around PF for a while have seen this argument before and it plays out the same way every time. It hurts and angers people and accomplishes nothing. It should be considered trolling and gotten rid of when seen. If you have a legitimate reason why we shouldn't push the mods for this, please say so.

Edit 2: Oh, also, we all know that at least like...half the people who say this stuff are just doing it to take a jab at ""poor people having too many kids and living off the system."" It's a political statement made in such a way they think they can get away with it. That's already against the rules.

I guess we just need to examine what is one's true motivations when being on this subreddit. Are we trying to survive or flourish?

I don't say this for political value, I say it because think about the financial commitment (which is one of the main conversational foundations of this subreddit). Your reasons for not giving up children are all reasons to keep this financial burden and therefore not really trying to flourish and live financially. 

I honestly cannot see how one can try and live financially responsible and not consider adoption an option. 

I have a $230 a month car payment, plus $160 in car insurance. If I gave up my car, that's $390 I could be saving. People will shame me for being poor, but screw em.

They are trained in high pressure sales like a car dealership and put profits over health.",povertyfinance,"[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/patients-pressure-and-profits-at-aspen-dental/)

This article sums it up pretty well but I'd also like to share my personal experience. A little background information: I'm 21 and due to not having dental insurance haven't seen a dentist since I was 19. My teeth are in pretty good shape and I have no major pain / visible issues. I only wanted to see a dentist due to the amount of time it's been and paranoia that I may need dental work due to this. I went to Aspen Dental because they offered a free exam and advertised $80 cleanings.

They got me checked in and after a short wait took some X-Rays of my teeth. I waited for a bit more and they got me in the chair where a dental hygienist reviewed my X-Rays and looked in my mouth briefly. When I say briefly I mean she examined my mouth and X-Rays for less than 2 minutes. I'm not a professional but it seems like you would want to do a more thorough examination. She claimed that I ""almost had"" periodontal disease and showed me on the X-Ray where I had allegedly developed deposits that lead to this. I asked her to show me my other teeth and to my untrained eye there was no visible difference and she wasn't able to show me any difference between my ""healthy"" teeth and my ""diseased"" teeth. Though I believed her as I am again, not an expert but I was skeptical as I have brushed my teeth twice a day for as long as I can remember and regularly use mouthwash and floss. I don't smoke or do anything that puts me at risk for disease, but again, I am no expert, so I took this all as truth.  She prescribed scaling and a follow up cleaning for this.

I waited a bit more and the dentist came in and did another very quick examination. The first thing he said is that I should get braces because I have an overbite. I told the dentist that I have had braces and wore my retainer exactly as prescribed and that I used to have a severe overbite and the braces corrected it. He immediately changed his tune and said that I should get braces because my wisdom teeth are going to cause crowding. (This didn't make sense but again, he's the dentist). He also said I need to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed, and get 1 filling.

They then took me to the finance office, where they handed me a ""treatment plan"" for $2,545. I about passed out. I looked at some of the items on the bill. $135 for a toothbrush, $45 for a ""Listerine rinse"" (mouthwash), $87 for a problem related exam prior to the extractions, $450 for each tooth extraction, $16 x4 for each quadrant of the mouth for ""oral irrigation"" (pressurized water). And other absurd charges. I told them upfront that I couldn't afford this, and she offered me financing options, with 48 MONTH and 60 MONTH loan terms. With a 15.99% APR!!!! They wanted me to take the same loan term with a higher interest rate than I do on my *brand new car* . Or a 12 months deferred interest option with *28.99%* APR.

The woman was trying really hard to pressure me into agreeing to one of these finance options for procedures I wasn't even sure I needed. She said all she needed was a signature. She kept claiming it was just permission to schedule the appointment even though the terms on the document were clearly for a credit check. They wanted me to be paying $72/mo for 5 years to get all of this done. My wisdom teeth aren't causing me any pain, grew in straight and in their entirety, and aren't even touching any of my other teeth. A quick google search of the symptoms of periodontal disease showed that I don't have any of the signs, and I certainly don't need a $135 toothbrush. I want to emphasize there's a chance that they are right as I'm no expert, but this is still absurd, even more so if they are trumping up the procedures I need (there is evidence to prove this company does this). She just wanted me to sign the form and they kept trying to disguise it as something besides a credit check.

I worked at a car dealership for two weeks and quit because of how disgusting it felt to take advantage of people and I can assure you they were using the same tactics that car salesmen use.

The sad part is that I didn't get the worst of it, if you read the article I posted above, Aspen Dental has a history of recommending extractions and other procedures when they aren't needed. I'm not saying this is my case because I recognize that I am not a dental expert in any capacity and I don't have the ability to diagnose these things, and I recognize that I may very well need all of this, but these ridiculous charges and insane financing options are predatory and disgusting.

Please avoid companies like this if you can, it's really hard to get dental care in the US without insurance and I'm still assessing my options. These corporations are the source of most dental complaints and the regulations for them are VERY LOOSE, they are not held to the same standards as your family dentists and reports say that many dentists for Aspen and other corporations are unqualified and perform poorly. They bait you with the free exams and try to convince you to pay for absurd amounts of work. These aren't people you want working on your teeth.

Obviously for those with lower credit scores that may be quite a significant bump down if you were to lose 20-30 points. Not saying that you will, but it may be worth calculating. 

The way loan consolidation works for credit reporting is simple. The old accounts are closed and a new one is opened (consolidated account). Stinks, but I essentially lost 50 years of ‚Äòaverage age‚Äô in one day when I consolidated (5 loans each with a 10 year history)!

There are a lot of free sites to get full credit reports now. I recommend getting one report from each reporting bureau at least once a year:
- Equifax
- Experian
- TransUnion

Be careful using certain sites, a lot claim to be free but a lot of them also charge or ask for credit cards. By law, everyone is entitled to one free report from each Bureau per year. 
One of my favorite free sites is Annual Credit Report. 
[AnnualCreditReport](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) 

Once you have a report you should be able to see all your accounts listed, see their age, and calculate your Age of Credit History. Then remove those accounts you would be consolidating and add in a new account with age of 1 month and you should be able to get an approximation of your new ‚ÄòAge of Credit History‚Äô. 

For anyone interested in consistently checking their credit scores and details throughout the year on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, I recommend Credit Karma. Great site with a wonderful app as well. 
[Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) 

At Credit Karma this is free viewing of your scores and details whenever you want. You will see two bureaus (TransUnion and Equifax) where you can click onto the details to see the following (with red/yellow/green highlights throughout which is extremely helpful):

1.) Credit Score

2.) Credit Factors 
- Credit card utilization 
- Derogatory marks
- Total Accounts
- Payment History
- Age of Credit History
- Hard Inquiries

3.) Credit changes 

4.) View full credit report (this may be similar to the Annual Credit Report site I listed above, I honestly haven‚Äôt looked into this). 

For most category / subcategory above you can click on the details to see where in the red/yellow/green scale you fall, and what type of impact that particular metric has on your credit score (low/medium/high). It will show the ranges for that particular metric in red/yellow/green so that you can see what would make you jump up or fall down into another category. 

Sorry for the rant, just wanted to provide some details and free info to everyone to help with any decisions related to consolidating loans or just credit scores and oversight into them!

Have a great day redditors! ",2018-08-29 13:50:51
514,alpzqd,False,,36,I know it's a small victory but I haven't touched my savings during this year's winter slowdown at work,povertyfinance,"Winter is hard for landscapers. Work dries up, and the ground doesn't. Even when you have work to do, the ground is either too frozen or too muddy. You go from weekly overtime to on call. Last week I worked 10 hours.

In the Dave Ramsey typology of spenders/savers and nerds/free spirits I am both a nerd (love to budget, every penny has a job) and a spender. So in past years when the lean times came I would incrementally wipe out my savings to maintain the same way of life, defeating the purpose of my obsessive budgeting. 

This year I decided - here's a radical fucking idea - to change my lifestyle in response to a change in income.

I have a beautiful partner, a tiny kitty üò∫, a full tank of gas, food in the fridge, $28 of ""allowance"" (grocery) money until next Wednesday, bills paid through 2/15 (through 2/27 as of next paycheck), and most importantly my untouched savings. I have books to read and people to have over for dinner instead of going out. I'm still putting the same percentage of my income towards savings and debt. Just yesterday I put a deposit towards a secured credit card (my first CC ever, at 29yo lol) to start trying to boost my ~~""I love debt"" score~~ credit score.

Instead of SAVING as the goal.... my new goal is to not buy things I do not need.

I started with simply RETURNING all of the dumb shit I did not need or use. Or bought thinking I might need or use something... that turns out... I neither needed nor used.

Hardware store: $63+ back -- I planned to grill this summer. I swear I made elaborate plans. I bought a mini grill for $58. And... I HAVE NOT USED IT IN THE 3 WEEKS SINCE I GOT IT. That went back to the store.

Grocery Store: $27 back. Yes, I did return the 42 oz of high-heat grill oil I bought a week back thinking I would grill. I HAVE NOT GRILLED. Returned!  Alongside the long grill tongs.. I did not need either of these things. So i returned them.

Hulu: ~$48 - How did I end up paying $15.99 for this? I cancelled my subscription, emailed customer service, and they refunded the last 3 mos of charges. I have not logged in for that pong. Thanks Hulu.

Netflix: $20. Not as generous, but you know what? I'm happy they refunded 2 mos of charges for something I wasnt fucking using at all when they could have chosen not to.

Was it a smidge embarassing to return an unopened walnut oil bottle to the grocery? A little. But not embarrassing enough to justify not getting my $16 back from this gentrified grease.

You know what's a lot more embarassing? Being $16 short on rent because I was too proud to return some shit I didn't need.

That's my brokeass thought.

&#x200B;

I can't begin to describe what I'm feeling right now. Relief, joy, a drained bank account, but overall happy.

I just submitted the final payment on two of my cards and $450 on the last one, of which I still have a remaining balance of $166. It's still a decent amount of money but it's nothing another paycheck can't fix. But I'm not totally debt-free, I didn't post this in my original post, but I do owe some money to my mom ($1,500 for helping me get back into college, I kept putting it off because I didn't have the funds, nor the saving habits I have now. She agreed to pay for the first quarter on the stipulation that I pay her back and do well in school. Grades are good, just have to pay her back) as well as my brother ($300 for driving me around to the dog sitting gigs) and on the upside, I'll have my own car to drive myself very very soon so I won't have to rely on him anymore. 

&#x200B;

I've set all my cards on auto-pay, with notifications if I go over a set amount (well below my 30% utilization)  the banks will text me about it. 

&#x200B;

To celebrate I'm gonna go out with friends for dinner, and then on Saturday I'm going on a 3 day trip with my boyfriend until Tuesday, gonna relax and unwind and wait for the next paycheck (which will be larger considering one week I worked 41 hours when I was only scheduled for 28.)

Living below the poverty level is hard, but I feel really blessed in some ways, so I wanted to share some things I'm thankful for and let some of you share yours.

1. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - even though the government keeps trying to take these life-saving programs away from us, they haven't yet. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have the blessing of these programs to enable me to have a place to live and health care. 
2. SNAP - Even though I don't eat like a queen, I eat well, and being on SNAP has made me much more conscious of how I spend my food dollars. I don't eat as much junk food, and I'm the queen of stretching a small amount of meat and veggies into a 3-day meal that is also healthy. Knowing that no matter what, I'm going to have food every month is such a blessing to me.
3. My apartment - When I was looking for a new place to live, I thought I'd never find anything I could afford. I can't even remember how I found this place, but I'm so happy I did. Not only do I have a really nice apartment for the money, but there is a courtyard and space outside where I'm allowed to garden. Management is awesome, and my rent only goes up about $10 a year. This place has been such a blessing!
4. My health - while I'm older and have a few health issues, I'm still able to do most things for myself and be independent. Without a car, I walk to a lot of places and really enjoy it. I'm still able to enjoy my gardening, although on a much smaller scale. My lupus is now ""inactive,"" so I must be doing something right.
5. Giving people - I've gotten so much help from loving, giving people. They've given me everything from clothes, food, and furniture to free plants for my garden. I owe so much to the generosity of others. It's truly a blessing.
6. Reddit - I have met so many wonderful, caring, loving people on Reddit; people who are willing to give of what little they have to help other people in need.

Planet fitness is my personal favorite because they‚Äôre often 24/7 so you can do this at times with lower traffic and they also serve pizza and bagels at times. 

Also: if you‚Äôre struggling with finding a job and need one immediately, look into pizzerias or local family owned businesses. A lot of them pay under the table, have a high turnover rate so they‚Äôre likely looking for people, don‚Äôt have the long and drawn out hiring processes and you‚Äôre more likely to talk directly to the owner. 



Edit: wow everyone, I was not expecting this much feedback but I‚Äôm glad other people have used this tip as well. Granted, it depends on where you are and how the gyms in your area function but a little research and calling can go a long way to make sure you at least have a place to shower. 

Edit 2: as someone mentioned (thank you for that) just because the place pays under the table, it does not mean you shouldn‚Äôt pay taxes. Put some of the money aside once you have enough to eat to pay in April. Not only is that fraud (uhm.... duh) but it can bite you in the ass down the line.

And I believe getting rid of the car could help you out a lot. Without serious drawbacks. And if you live in some weird place where you really need a car - think about moving.

And fun fact. These days I use taxi to travel everywhere. I checked cost of the taxi and I compared it to cost of a car, fuel, maintenance etc thinking I would switch cars every 5 years - car is still much more expensive than using taxi constantly. ",2018-09-27 18:18:45

I'm decluttering, and in one box I found a bunch of fabric, including half a roll of muslin I had forgotten I had.

There is enough muslin to make a back for it, and I have an old sheet I can use to back the quilted part, since it won't be showing.

The stuffing on the comforter I have is still fine, but the outside is pilled and worn. I got it as a gift from my deceased mom, so I hesitate to just get rid of it. This way, I don't have to. I can just make a nice duvet cover and still have my comforter with a bright, pretty new washable cover.

947,8hq3li,False,,111,Preparing For A Baby: A Single Mom's Guide,povertyfinance,"At the end of 2015. I found myself pregnant with my now 20 month old son. It was not planned, I was not in a position to rely on my son's father, and I've always been poor. I did have a full-time job, a beater car, and an affordable rental home but almost no cash or resources to spare in preparing for my first child. I thought I'd write up a post that may help other women (or fathers/couples!) in a similar situation and explain some of the things I did or learned along the way that really helped me. 


1) I applied for pregnancy Medicaid. I received this immediately and it covered ALL of my routine ob/gyn visits as well as almost the entire labor and delivery. I  had an emergency c-section and ended up staying in the hospital with my son for 9 days. Medicaid covered almost the entire bill; I ended up owing about $200 after the hospital stay but the hospital I delivered at had a financial program for low-income women (you have to ask!!) so my final out-of-pocket cost was $40. Absolutely amazing considering what it costs to have a baby and I was able to attend all appointments and never thought twice about having to see my doctor unexpectedly for issues along the way. All of my prescriptions during pregnancy and for three months afterwards, were absolutely free so ask your doctor to prescribe prenatal vitamins. You should take them anyway but buying them OTC is expensive so get them free from the pharmacy by telling your doctor you need a prescription because of cost. It does seem though that the quality/availability of care through Medicaid is very dependent on your geographical location as I've spoken with other mothers who did not have such an easy or good time with pregnancy Medicaid. Talk to your case manager when you sign up and ask about your best options. It really pays to do your own research as the system is usually really overwhelmed and your case manager only has so much time/effort/care they can give you.  Also, sign up for WIC and SNAP right NOW. 


2) Lean on your family and friends. Everyone loves a new baby! I was very, very fortunate in that I have an incredible, supportive family. My sister bought me so many gifts that I'm not sure I could of done it without her. My dad assembled so much baby equipment and furniture for me that it was basically a second job for him. Cousins, aunts, co-workers, friends all bought gifts. Do not be shy about accepting them or telling them exactly what you need if they ask. Which leads me to number 3.


3) Have a baby shower. If you don't have anyone close enough to you that will throw one for you, plan it yourself. It absolutely does not have to cost a ton of money. You can make cheap but good foods like cold pasta salad and hamburgers; just host it at your home or in a public park (weather permitting of course) to save on a party hall rental. I know this seems like a social sin to throw your own baby shower but you have to do what you have to do and most people won't care anyway. People will bring gifts so I would highly suggest creating a registry. When I was pregnant , babies r us was still around and they had a million options at a million price points. They even gave you a gift card worth 10% of the final amount of things bought off your registry a few months after your due date so search around online for the store offering the best options for deals near you. Even if you don't have a shower, create a registry at any store that offers incentives. Add the items you're going to purchase for yourself and then buy them off the registry to get the incentives. 


4) STOCKPILE. I knew I would not be paid for any type of maternity leave so I began buying supplies I knew I'd need immediately to have them on hand when I was out of work after my son's birth. This GREATLY reduced my financial burden and the accompanying stress because I didn't have to worry about diapers, wipes, etc. Every month of my pregnancy, I bought at least one jumbo box of diapers and one jumbo box of wipes. I also suggest buying bulk sale items when you come across them and have the extra money. I have not bought diaper rash cream, baby lotion/shampoo/soap, or baby sunscreen since I was pregnant because I still have stockpiles of it and my son is now 20 months. I managed this by buying a ton of it whenever I came across a good sale. You will always end up using it and most products have a very long shelf-life. If an item(s) is very heavily discounted and you know for certain that you will need it but not for 9 months or so, I'd buy it as long as you can store it. It's also helpful to stock up on children's Tylenol and such because when you live alone, there is no one you can send to the store at 2 am when baby has a teething fever. 


5) Buy what you can second-hand and then resell it when you no longer need it. Bassinets, pack-and-plays, clothes, etc. Browse thrift stores and places like Once Upon A Child very frequently because they get new items often and you have to be quick when something good comes in. Buy clothes in sizes 1-2 up when you come across good deals on them because you're going to need them soon anyway. I bought my son clothes all the way up until size 12 months when I was pregnant and never had to buy any the first year of his life. Also try Facebook marketplace, Craig's List, and friends with growing children. Do not worry about fancy equipment like electric bottle warmers or lace dresses, buy basic. If baby is clean, fed, and well looked after, it does not matter if his outfit is trendy or if you have a baby wipe warmer. I had never been around babies so I solicited the advice of a million different websites and almost every parent I came across. Gather information about what you'll really actually need and use vs. what you want or are not sure about.


6) Sign up for coupons. Companies love to throw coupons and the occasional free item at new parents. Sign up for formula coupons (I know for sure that both enfamil and similac offer them) even if you plan on breastfeeding. They'll bombard your mailbox with good sized samples and substantial coupons. Look online for rewards programs like the one Pampers offers, too. Sign up for all of it. This is questionably ethical but I also had my sister sign up for the same coupons using her address and my due date. I was able to use twice the amount of coupons this way. 

7) Find out about subsidized daycare. There may be a waiting list so see if you can get on it now and research the daycares that accept it. Research and apply for every single social program available BEFORE baby arrives. 

8) This last part is mostly for the women who are doing it alone like me. Do not be scared to ask for help whenever you need it. I was and I suffered. I look back now and wish I just would of spoken up. If you need a break (and you will) from baby, please reach out to someone you trust who can babysit for a few hours while you take a nap or do something for yourself. Do not burn yourself out because your mental health and parenting skills will suffer. Look into mommy groups, talk with other women online, see a therapist, whatever you need to do. I have found that most of the women in my situation are desperate for friends who understand what they go through so find some. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. Ever. These things happen, we do what we need to in order to survive, and we love our children. PM me if you need to talk. Pursue child support adamantly. The state will file for you if you receive assistance but you really have to stay on top of them to actually achieve anything. Also, don't rely too heavily on the child support. Think of it as extra cash because if you end up losing it or never getting it or whatever, it won't hurt your finances so badly. Caring for a baby alone is SO FUCKING HARD and if it ever gets easier, I'll be sure to let you know but it is possible to do it. 


Edit: This is getting some attention so I wanted to add one more bit of advice. If you haven't put any effort into it before, it's now the time to construct a plan for financial longevity. For me personally, this meant education. Be honest with yourself about the amount of effort you are really willing and able to put in so that your plans/goals are achievable and grounded in reality. It's great to dream big but don't end up racking up debt in an attempt to get a BA in your childhood dream field of philosophy only to drop out after two semesters because life is hard (it is!) or eventually graduate with hefty loans with no job prospects. Don't put it off either. It's going to be really difficult but it's going to be difficult in our type of situation anyway so try to do something that will put you in a better earning position within a few years.

A little more background information! 

I tried the best I could to not incur school debt, but I was a first generation high school graduate and definitely had no idea what I was doing. In the end, I borrowed ~$30,000 for school loans, which in the grand scheme of things wasn't much, but I'm glad to be out from under it. 

I took the semester off between high school and starting at community college. I worked 84 hours a week and saved up a tidy sum to help me through the first semester. I had a pretty decent scholarship/grant package that paid my tuition for my first 2 years of community college. I worked part-time in my field to gain experience. I transferred to a Big 10 School, and received a similar financial aid deal for tuition, working full time in the summer. 

I used student loans to buffer my paltry paychecks, allowing me to live in an off-campus apartment, by myself, and save my sanity. I also used some money to travel, and to attend lots of work shops related to my field. I worked an AmeriCorps stint after graduation that paid a lump sum toward my loans, but the rest has been diligently plugging away at them.

But I used to ignore people when they said **just set your direct deposit to automatically transfer money from your paycheck to savings** . I thought that just wasn't *me*. I thought I'd inevitably end up taking the money out.

For some reason, I decided in October to try it. I set my direct deposit up to put $150 per pay period into savings. (You could set it to anything you can afford to spare. $10, $25, $500, $1000, whatever.)

Lo and behold, I've actually been able to stick to it. Sure, it's been insanely hard. I ended up with $4 in my checking account for about a week and ended up eating ramen several times. 

But that's okay because now I actually have a decent emergency fund. The thought of my car breaking down or my dog having a medical emergency doesn't give me panic attacks.

824,fd287t,False,,32,I‚Äôve reached $500 in my LONG-TERM SAVINGS for the first time while on disability...,povertyfinance,"... and I have nowhere else to share this and I just need somewhere to put it into the world.
I‚Äôve been on disability since 2015 after two back-to-back psychiatric hospitalizations in 2012/13. Leading up to that I was working 72 hours a week as an STNA in the home health field. I worked every single solitary day for over two years. Although I‚Äôve struggled a lifetime with mental illness, this was the first time I was on my own and free from my abusive parents. I was advised by my at-the-time psychiatrist to no longer work due to a diagnoses of catatonic schizophrenia (now deemed two separate illnesses). It was a very hard thing for me to accept. As a child, my parents involved me with what was happening with finances. They frequently used scare tactics of losing the house vs. food, filing for bankruptcy, and honestly too much for a child to carry. My dad always drove into me with intense frequency that you should ‚Äòwork hard while your young so you can retire early.‚Äù Sprinkled throughout is, imo expectedly, more heartbreak, trauma, and emotional scarring that over 13 years of therapy simply hasn‚Äôt fixed yet. All of that had a huge blow to the opportunities set ahead of me and it was seemingly for the purpose of destroying me. I was given only the advice of, ‚Äúcredit card BAAAADD. saving is GOOD‚Äù and that‚Äôs where it ended. Although it is not entirely bad or wrong advice, I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs just not like that. I never applied for a credit card, believing that I would be doomed for eternity to financial suffering and I would be denied because of my disability. And it‚Äôs all just a bunch of bs to keep me small. I know. What assholes???!!

Well I‚Äôm happy to say that my parents didn‚Äôt break me and they didn‚Äôt stop me. I now have had a credit card for 4 months, a paid off student loan for a year, a credit score at about 680 and finally... the cherry... however small.. is the $500 in my long-term savings. Although paying off a student loan is huge, a good score is... well, GOOD.. I honestly have felt that that long term was stuck. Everything saved was kept short term and depleted time and time again. Even being on the wimpy ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù income I have from SSDI I was able to do all of this. I just wanted to share that with you all. I want to only be a quick reminder that you can do it. We can all do it. Even on limited income. We will not be broken and we will not remain broke.
Thanks guys

984,duj2wp,False,,23,Finally have a savings account in the black for the first time in awhile!,povertyfinance,"So I've been struggling with finances for a long time after having both no financial education given to me when I was younger and a habit of spending myself into stupid holes with crap I don't really need. With no one to guide me and bad habits coming back to bite frequently, I finally had enough. I've been listening to a lot of financial advice videos and podcasts (like Dave Ramsey among others) and have been getting my budget on track for the first time since... 2014, I think? It's been really helpful and I think I'm starting to make progress even if I'm not where I want to be long-term just yet.

Over the last year from August '18 to now, I've accomplished the following:

1. Bought a new (used) laptop that's much better to work with in school (as I am a college student) than my last laptop, and I paid cash for it (about $2,000 with side equipment).
2. Built up an emergency fund on my main bank account to $1,000, as that is Dave's ""Baby Step 1"" before tackling debts elsewhere.
3. Balanced all of my bank accounts so they have (at the time of writing this) at least $300 in savings each, and I'm putting a small amount back into each account every paycheck. I have 4 accounts and for the last several years, typically 2 of them were in overdraft at any given time, so this is a huge improvement. My goal is $1,000 in each account minimum.
4. Beginning to pay down my student loans while I'm still in college, and also beginning to pay down medical debts from six years ago (which I foolishly ignored and let double, so tackling those feels good).
5. Bought a used car for the first time ever instead of having one given to me; saved about two months for that and paid it off in full last month. About $1,200 plus registration fees, and it's very high fuel economy (Geo Metro) and is saving me money against what I used to drive. I pay about $40 per month in gas for it and I'm driving 50 miles a day.
6. Paying all my bills every month including renting an apartment with a friend (instead of living on campus on financial aid or in someone else's house); renter's insurance, car insurance, electric, groceries, etc. and still having enough left over to pay down the older bills I mentioned above.
7. Not spending as much money on frivolous stuff and keeping track of the miscellaneous things I do buy, making an effort to spend less and less each month on things I don't need and put the rest into savings.
8. Currently have enough to pay about 2.5 months' worth of straight bills if I remain conservative with what I spend. Not including separate savings I have which are education-specific (Pell Grant, Scholarships, AmeriCorps service award), I've got about $2,000 to my name outside the car, the laptop, everything I own, and the bills I'm working on. I haven't had anywhere close to $2,000 readily available in over five years and back then I wasn't paying my own bills, was living with family, and only ever reached about $5,500 after working two jobs with seven-day schedules for about 6 months straight, then I mistakenly blew that in about two or three months. So I'm not back to where I was just yet, but I'm still doing better overall and should surpass my goal in 2020 if I stay moving straight.

This feels really good, guys. I know it sounds like I'm bragging and I apologize for that, but I just genuinely feel great about where I'm at for once. I work full-time while in school so I have very little free time, but it's starting to pay off. I don't use credit cards (both out of principle and because the medical debt shot my credit score, so oh well), and I'm only making $17.50/hr, but even that I'm grateful for as it's more I've made in other jobs I've had. I'm feeling like I might actually have hope for the future and be debt-free in a few years. It's a fantastic feeling.

**EDIT:** This became more popular than I was expecting so I should add some additional info for clarification. I'm 25, and this progress has largely come about since I was 24, hence the mention of ""over the last year"". However, everything from the list (items 1-8 stating with the computer) has been from November '18 to now, and August was when I started college after a 6-year gap. This story starts further back in 2012 when my dad passed unexpectedly and not long afterward, I was homeless living in his car. He didn't teach me how to handle money properly; in fact, he was terrible with it and died in debt (which I had to pay off myself at 18) and he ruined a lucrative family business and stole money from his family years before, in essence teaching me what not to do instead of what to do. When he was gone I was on my own, moved in with an uncle who gave me a better example of how to handle money, and in 2014 I started saving up that $5,500 I mentioned with the hope of going back to school that much sooner. It didn't happen, I made a series of dumb decisions, and was homeless a second time. At that point I only had myself to blame, but after some medical crises I moved in with my mom, who is still alive but equally as bad with money as my dad was, and she also stole money from family albeit in a more indirect, morally ambiguous way. So between both of them, I had no guidance and no direction. I spent whatever little money I had from work on extravagances and learned to get by without saving for the future, which is a poor plan in just about every way. In early 2018 my mom was put under investigation for something unrelated and our family structure collapsed. She lost our house (not the first time, and dad had done the same thing years before) and it left me trying to pick up the pieces. For a second time I moved in with my uncle, this time determined to not let his generosity be in vain. After fucking around and accomplishing little over six years since leaving high school, I studied for the ACT and SAT in my hours outside of work, all the while paying for storage for my mom's things while she got her situation figured out. I drove 180 miles to the nearest ACT test facility last summer, got a score good enough to get into college with, and finally went back to school on a shoestring budget, knowing fully well the only way I would afford it was to work full-time throughout. From August '18 through now, that's exactly what I've done, as well as having incorporated a move to a cheaper school in another state to help stay within my budget and pay off bills. So I went from being homeless and dealing with my parents' poor decisions to where I'm at now, and I think that makes it all the better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/duj2wp/finally_have_a_savings_account_in_the_black_for/,738,"Hey, you're working hard and smart.

* Paid several hundred dollars to my partner who has, over time, loaned me money.
* Saved money for deposit on new apartment.
* Paid my share of rent.
* Paid phone bill & other utilities including laundry for the month.
* Saved money for nutrition program that has been highly effective in addressing my current obesity.
* Bought groceries.
* And treated myself to a few nice things on Amazon!

I have money left because of my regular income and I no longer owe anyone anything. THE FEELING IS AMAZING. I'm fully aware that others have larger debts, but that's totally not the point. I just feel... lighter. Ya know?

916,993l7b,False,,140,Borrowing your way out of generational poverty.,povertyfinance,"My whole family has been poor going pretty far back. Recent history is my grandparents were born deaf and discarded by society, and took crap odd jobs to make ends meet. Grandma got pregnant as a teen, my mom also got pregnant at 15, and then I myself got pregnant as a teen. I was pretty uneducated about life in general and most certainly about money, and how much money it took to raise children. I just knew you were supposed to have kids and struggle, that was life and that's just how it is. Graduating high school was optional.

When I got older,  my world view really changed. I was determined to raise my kids middle class so they could have all the things I never did. I was (still am?) pretty illiterate when it comes to money, so I borrowed my way out of poverty. I ran up all kinds of credit cards and loans to fund a middle class lifestyle. My kids got to dress in new clothes (even though they weren't name brand, they weren't hand me downs!), they got to do extra curricular activities. My husband and I moved to a decent school district, bought mid-range cars. We were so deep in debt this whole time. 

Now both of my kids are in college, and they still live at home so we can pay their living expenses while they are going to school. They are the first generation in my family to go to college right out of high school. And I'm proud of that. 

My husband and I are working hard to pay off the debt we've accumulated throughout their childhoods, but honestly I don't regret any of it. Borrowing money allowed us to get to a place where we could live in a regular house, wear regular clothes, buy regular food. And I feel like we broke the poverty cycle - now my kids are in college and are set up to get good paying jobs, and we can help them save money while living at home so they can move out when they are financially ready to. We are trying to teach them about money, and not getting into debt, but it's hard when I don't really know much myself. 

Sorry for the long post, me and my husband were just discussing it so I thought it would make a good discussion here also. I read an article that said movement between the classes doesn't really happen, I think we were able to but probably not in the best way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/993l7b/borrowing_your_way_out_of_generational_poverty/,879,"I would not have done this and I didn't do this with my kids.

Just bought an 11 year old car for $5k with all service records (gov't vanpool vehicle). I'm retired younger than most all people because I was frugal and the kids are doing great. 

To me, and this is my own view, is that you haven't broken the poverty cycle. It's faking it, if it's a facade with all of that debt you still carry. Carrying debt for so many years is poverty. ",2018-08-21 14:26:45

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm not at what anyone would consider the poverty level, but I do have a terrible habit that causes me to live paycheck to paycheck and has put me into some scary situations here and there.

I have money automatically deposited into my savings account every paycheck. I also have a certain amount that I put into a second checking account that my regular bills come out of. My primary checking is for groceries, gas, and some spending money.

So I have this HORRIBLE habit of overspending. And it‚Äôs not because I buy crap because I want it... I‚Äôm just buying things I genuinely need, like an apron so I don‚Äôt ruin my clothes when I cook (I‚Äôm messy and keto involves a lot of fatty foods lol). No, my one big spending problem is eating out. I kind of panic if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast because I don‚Äôt have time to eat lunch and breakfast ends up being my only meal until dinner.

Anyway... about this time in the pay cycle (four days until payday) I‚Äôll have to start transferring money from that savings account to my primary checking account because I only have $11 left or something. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. This is twice a month this happens. Every. Damn. Time.

But this month!!! This month I made some changes. I said no to frivolous purchases (passed on a beautiful robe on the clearance rack to replace my slightly worn one), took my lunch to work, made dinner with leftovers to spare, was a lot smarter about how much food I purchased (from a big family, hard to learn to just cook for two), and got creative with cheaper recipes like different types of salads. The biggest thing I did was say no to eating out. I‚Äôm not actually hungry, I‚Äôm just not planning ahead and panicking when I think I won‚Äôt eat for the rest of the day.

What‚Äôs amazing is that I didn‚Äôt actually sacrifice that much! I was able to spend $50 on new workout pants and bras. I took my boyfriend out for a drink on Easter Sunday. I even bought myself a Starbucks.

And here I am, sitting on $52.81 for the rest of the week!  THIS FEELS AMAZING! Just those changes made a massive difference! I actually kept what I put aside in my savings account (I officially have $405 now). And I don‚Äôt need to spend that whole $52.81. I know I can make some of the veggies from last week go into meals this week and I have lots of deli meat, eggs, and bacon left. So I plan to grocery shop for what I need for the week and if I have any money remaining, it‚Äôs going into that savings account... and then I‚Äôm going to do the same thing this next paycheck.

671,9t2535,False,,164,Some tips from a former bank employee on fees,povertyfinance,"Hi everyone. I really qualify as ""poverty finance"" level myself so I'm not trying to come in here and preach. It's just that I noticed a lot of common 'mistakes' or things people in our situation could be doing to avoid problems and fees at the bank.

1. Read your account disclosure. You know that booklet of tiny text that you got when you opened your account? I know some people view it as 'just another legal thing that is hard to understand' but they are usually written pretty simply if you actually read it. **You can skip to the part that talks about your specific account type.** You don't need to read the whole thing, but do read it in order to know how your account works.

2. Do not sign up for automatic payments. I've seen this go wrong far more often than it has actually helped anyone. They are nearly always impossible to cancel at the last moment if you are close to overdrawing your account. If you do use them, make **DAMN** sure you put them on a calendar with alerts and stay aware of what is coming up for the next pay cycle.

3. Do not habitually overdraft. Almost anything is better than overdrawing your account. Even credit card interest is FAR less than an overdraft fee. If you do the math, that $25 or whatever per charge is worse than a payday loan in almost all cases. I've seen people who had over 300 overdrafts in the last year. At $25 each, that is giving the bank thousands of dollars of free money. There's always a better way than doing that, but it's not like the bank is going to call you up and volunteer that information. You have to ask for help if you *are* in that situation.

4. Understand the posting order of your account. Charges don't always come out in the order in which they occurred in real time. Please talk to a bank associate if you don't understand this by reading your account disclosure and they would be happy to explain it, as it works differently at every bank. But at the bank I worked for, ACH (direct debits) would come out before debit card transactions. So let's say you had $600 in the bank. A $599 direct deposit came out for your rent. Then you did 6 debit card transactions for $2-5 each. You would actually get charged 6 overdraft fees even though you barely went over. There are a lot of situations where our posting order *helped* customers, but also situations where it royally screwed them over.

5. **Free checking accounts still exist.** You are getting ripped off if you're being charged every month just to have your checking account open. Period. Look into local banks and **ask** for the free option. They're not always advertised. And if they don't have one, go somewhere else.

6. Understand how ""opting out"" of overdraft fees works. Federal law requires banks to allow you to opt out of getting fees for most debit card purchases. However, you can still get fees for ACH (direct debits that I warned against earlier), checks, and **subscription services**. Yes, that $7 netflix subscription can cause a $25 overdraft fee even if you opt out.

7. If you do get an overdraft fee for something stupid, feel free to call and explain the situation. However, know that customer service reps are required to *justify* each refund if asked by a supervisor. If they just give you the refund despite the fact that you've overdrawn your account 10 times in the last year, they could *lose their jobs*. So cut them some slack. 

8. Do not rely only on online banking. It sounds oldschool, but keeping a checkbook register is the most reliable way to avoid overdraft fees. Online banking has no way of knowing if you have a check outstanding, for instance. It also has no way of knowing that you added a tip to a restaurant bill until the restaurant processes it. I've seen many people become overdrawn because of this.

I hope some of these tips help. It killed me to see people lose so much money on fees.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9t2535/some_tips_from_a_former_bank_employee_on_fees/,1629,"9. Don't bank at a national or international bank.

I grew up dirt poor. My father was highly intelligent but was a ‚Äú the grass is greener on the other side‚Äù guy. He switched jobs a lot. He had one year in college before dropping out. My mother did not graduate high school. 

I grew up in a run down house in rural California (yes, there is a rural California). The town I grew up near was the drug gateway into Los Angeles. It had one Sheriff. In the 70s and 80s the Hells Angels warehoused their drugs there. In the late 80s 90s they were pushed out by cartels. 

I grew up in a two bedroom hovel. We only had a tub that had fallen through the rotted floor of the one bathroom. We often went without electricity and water. We rarely had trash service. I grew up taking the trash out to the backyard and throwing it into a pile. A pile that became taller than I was. Rodents and cats would tear open the bags and spread the trash around. It was common to find piles of maggots infesting the garbage stack. 

My mother had a mental illness and suffered from severe depression. She had to have a tumor removed that was the size of a basketball. After that surgery she was bed ridden because of her undiagnosed depression.

This all seemed normal to me, because, I did not know any different. I didn‚Äôt know that most people did not have ceiling collapsing inside their homes. I did not know that when it rained not everyone had to grab buckets to collect the rain water that came through the leaky ceiling.

I was pretty self sufficient from a young age. I did my own laundry, and scrounged for my meals. I got myself ready for school. In many ways I raised myself. Like many poor kids I lived on hot dogs and bologna. Most meals consisted of toast with gravy on it. 

College was never talked about in our house. College was for rich kids. School was not even that important. It was just a place that I could get a .20 cent lunch. I was always in trouble for fighting. I took out my frustrations on other people. I had the most detentions and suspensions of all my peers. This happened even through high school. I was threatened with expulsion many times. All of the staff and resource officers knew me.

My senior year of high school I had a 1.8 GPA. I was also missing a few core classes. The school made me take night classes at the adult education campus. I ended up graduating with a 2.0 exactly.

I spent two years after high school working low paying jobs. I was homeless and stayed at wherever someone would let me. I slept on a lot of couches and floors. I got into drugs. I frequented crappy strip clubs. 

After 9/11 I joined the military. I had dyed blonde hair, nipple piercings, and was covering myself in tattoos. I was a freak.

When I took the Asvab I scored two points away from max. This surprised me. It was the first time I had really done something even slightly impressive. I went in as an Aircraft electrician. During AIT I had the highest grades of all of the classes during that training cycle. I was the Distinguished Honor graduate.

While in the military I took a few community college classes. I carried a pretty high gpa and made the Dean‚Äôs List every semester. 

After the military I went to work and college at the same time. I had a wonderful wife and young kids. I worked during the day and went to school at night. It took me another two years to earn an Associates. It took me seven years to get a Bachelors. It took me another three years to earn a Masters. 

Meanwhile I worked as a mechanic. I became a Master Mechanic. I have never made over a $100,00 in a W2 job. In fact I probably made around $30,000 to $40,000 most years.

While going to school my wife and I financed two new fancy vehicles. We ran up $25,000 in credit cards, I took out $30,000 in student loans that was not always spent on school. My wife had to work nights. I had to take online courses. We were digging ourselves a hole.

One day I was switching stations on the radio. I came across Dave Ramsey and listened to him. His advice seemed stupid-simple. I told my wife about Dave and we both jumped in with the goal of being debt free.

We took both of our cars down to Carmax and sold them. Luckily we broke even between the two. We literally ate rice and beans and threw every penny at debt. It took us two years to become debt free. I drove a really old teal Mazda 323. My wife drove an old Mazda Mpv mini van that was this horrible shade of purplish-blue.

Once we were debt free everything became easier. I put a lot of money into my 401k. My wife became a stay at home mom. I kept earning better degrees and found myself making a whopping $72,000 per year. 

We ended up moving and rented out our old house. We bought another house for a crazy low interest rate. Our rental property was cash flow positive.

I started a side business while working for an employer. It is a service based local business. I started it with a partner. I cashed out my 401k of $78,000. My partner was supposed to do the work while I performed the administrative functions and financed the business. My employer ended up firing me for having a side business. His reason was ‚Äúif you had told me I would have wanted to be a part of it‚Äù.

My partner was a liar. 

A year after starting the business I found that my partner had squandered tens of thousands of dollars. He ended up getting a lawyer and threatening to sue me. Meanwhile the business was crashing and burning. I settled with my partner for an amount that I could not really afford.

Everything I had was at risk. At this point I had borrowed over a $100,000 for the business. I could not sleep during the weekends. I remember thinking that my two choices were to go crazy or fix this. I couldn‚Äôt go crazy because I still had young kids.

So, I showed up two hours early everyday and stayed late every night. I focused on ‚ÄòI need to do one thing everyday to make the business better‚Äô. Meanwhile I had a handful of customers threatening to sue me over my previous partners actions. I was getting demand letters every month. 

I just kept moving forward. Trying to do one thing better. Putting out fires as needed. 

Three years later I bought out another small business. Today, we have multiple locations. I am involved as a partner with a handful of new businesses. I directly manage a handful of businesses. I own rental properties. My net-worth is skyrocketing. 

My business debt is paid off except the debt I have against assets. 

I am 41 years old and I consider myself retired. I have managers that manage aspects of my business. I sit in my office and mentor my high-potential, high-value management staff.

So, how did I go from a 2.0 to this? More importantly how can you go from where you are to your own version of success?

Education: people get paid for what they do. People get paid more for what they know. People that continually learn and apply that learning no matter what age they are get paid the most. People that take what they learn and apply it independently of an employer create their own job security. 

Control: control what you can control. Don‚Äôt pay much attention to what you cannot control. I could not control my partner‚Äôs actions. The sooner I metabolized that fact and moved forward the better it was for me. 

Options: most people‚Äôs version of success is based around options. You may think that I should substitute being debt-free for options. The fact is that being debt free just increases your options. What I have learned in my life is that options are the only thing that separates the impoverished from those that are not. If I need to move I can move. If I need to close a business, I can close a business. If I need cash, I can come up with cash. If a business deal comes my way I can pull resources to become part of that deal.

I tell my young daughters that everything they do in life, every choice they make, should be based around which one gives them the most options. With options comes power over the unexpected. Life is not about money....it is about options. However, money usually goes hand in hand with options. 

I love my poor people out there. I just want you to know that you can not only do what I did, but, you can do it better.

613,9r7yhb,False,,124,I'm finally breaking the cycle.,povertyfinance,"To set the stage - 
In 2006, I was broke, freshly transplanted to  major city California, and had 1 job, 30 something hours a week as a baggage handler at the airport.  
I made $11 an hour, and slept on the couch of a friend's apartment.  I never set foot in a grocery store.  Everything was fast food.
I lasted 3 months.  Failed.  Moved back home.
2007 and 2008 had the same cycle.  Pick a state.  Move.  Find a job.  Find a roommate.   Fail.  Move back home.

In 2009, I started college, a cheap university high up in the mountains.  
A Pell Grant was enough to cover all my expenses, and I could have lived modestly.  4 easy years, living on the governments dime while I got a degree.

Instead... Shitty friends, fast food, weed, and booze. A car I couldn't afford but looked good.  New clothes to not wear to the classes I skipped.

In 2011, I failed out.  Car had been repo'd.  Work fired me for missing days.  Bank charged me for overdrafts. Rent came due in a hurry, and I didn't have it.

I had no job.  I was becoming homeless.  
I stayed in a shelter for 6 weeks, working as a dishwasher in a buffet, and server in a dine-in pizza place.  I saved all my money, for 5 full weeks... and blew most on drugs and alcohol.  Its amazing how many friends you accumulate when they're drinking your beer for free.

When the money ran out... The party stopped.  And I failed again.  Crashed hard.

I sold everything I owned, and mom chipped in the rest for a bus ticket.

In 2012, I moved back to my home state (in my late 20's) with $0 in my pocket, half a bag of rolling tobacco, and my skateboard. 
The only good thing in my life... Was my credit was too shitty for a credit card.  So i had no CC debt.  I was truly at $0.

I slept on the living room floor of an old friend's rental house, because the couch was already claimed.
I got on SNAP benefits.
I found a job.  $10 an hour.
I spent as little as possible.
Found a trailer to rent.  Found a better company doing the same work...
  
And for 6 years, I've done my best.  
And it has been hard. 

Like... Grown man lying in bed breaking down crying in fear and stress and anger and frustration, and somehow...
Lasting one more day.  Telling myself... This is not your best.  This is good for now, this is a good today, and I can make tomorrow better. 

I've worked on my own car, taken side jobs, asked for raises and more hours, and accepted any task thrown at me.  
Scrub food out of the floor sinks in the kitchen every night?   Ok.
Work from 5am to 230pm, then go assist from 9pm to 3am on a grease trap replacement inside a restaurant?  Sure.
Drive an hour every day to the jobsite?   You've got it.

 
Now, I'm soon to be married.  Stepkids.  A house in the near future.  A car loan.  A solid job.  A company vehicle.

We paid our wedding off already.  $100 a week each, instead of dining out or going to the movies or buying makeup or clothes.  It took almost 7 months.  

I've learned how to cook for 5 people for $100 a week.  $20 per person for 12-15 meals, since the kids are still in school.  Eggs and potatoes and onions go far.  Pasta is a mainstay.  Rice is a miracle filler.  

We pack lunches and take snacks to work. 
I wait for the sales on brand name cereal and buy 10 boxes for $15. I buy a dozen gatorades when they're 58 cents each through the grocery store app, instead of $2 each at the gas station.  I go to the spanish grocer for cheap produce and off brand cleaning supplies.  

We buy clothes from discount racks, and entertainment secondhand.  Bikes and video games are from CL or Letgo.
Fish and turtles are dirt cheap pets, and you can find a tank for $10 or less.  
A football or soccer ball is maybe $5 at goodwill, and gets the kids out of the apartment and playing with friends.

Our next goal is to stop paying rent, and start paying a mortgage.  We'll get there.

I've been seriously working on Me, for 6 years now, so I didn't repeat the cycle again.  I didn't have a car for almost 3 years.  It took me 4 years before I had an emergency fund.  It took 5 years before the money in savings stayed there.  

And it's working.

It's getting better.

And if I can do it... Me, the loser pothead dropout failure with crooked shoulders and scrawny arms, that used to make your pizza, mad at the world, and deep down... Hating myself for being the situation I was in..

If I can do it...
You can.

We were barely able to make ends meet, working minimum wage part time jobs. 



I applied for SNAP, WIC, and Medicaid. We worked opposite shifts (I took days, he worked nights) so we wouldn‚Äôt need daycare. And we survived the first year. When my son was a year old, I filled out FAFSA and got a PELL grant with additional exceptional need assistance. I quit my job and went to nursing school. When I graduated, my husband went to technical school. 



We are now financially comfortable and able to support our family and pay back into the system. We made it out of poverty by using the social safety net. That was our one saving grace. 



There is no shame in using these social safety net programs. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8owibx/my_journey_out_of_poverty/,854,"OP, IMO you and your husband are precisely the type of people what the system should be for! 

You got married young and had a child too soon (and made some poor choices). But you make positive changes (rather than milking the system).  First responsible thing was working opposite shifts. That eliminates the cost of daycare.  You both then went back to school one at a time to better yourself so you can have higher paying job.  Well done!

But history tells us that mom and dad are incapable of handling money. They have student loans from 40 years ago, and they dont own their house even though they had 30-40 years to pay for it. 

Always see the big picture when it comes to your parents. And ask yourself ""if the bank won't let mom and dad take a loan, then why should I?"" ""If they can't sign, then why should I""

You are not the guardian of your mom and dad. 

You are not responsible for your mom and dad.

Just say no. You have your own life to live and your own financials to take care of. Not their financials.

742,c4af6j,False,,205,I'm paying thousands for dental work now because I delayed getting something basic fixed.,povertyfinance,"I fucked up.

I see a lot of posts about medical costs on here and I just want this story to serve as a reminder to all medical related issues: if you ignore it now, it will cost you later. This happened to my teeth, aka my 'optional bones' according my insurer. I had to get a root canal done because it got infected. I had a very slight lingering pain but 4 days later it hadn't gone away. I was concerned enough to see a dentist asap, and they confirmed a hole in my tooth was heavily infected and a root canal was needed asap. I asked for a quote first. The dentist happily ran the numbers: $250 plus $25 copay. I would also need antibiotics. I decided to put it on my credit card and pay it off with the next paycheck because I didn't want to delay it; infections are serious. Don't fuck with them. I once ignored a fever for a few hours and wound up in the ICU for 6 days.

So I got the root canal done and quite a significant amount of tooth had to be sheered off. It wasn't a fun recovery, but the antibiotics cleared it up and after the swelling went down, I now had a functional - though slightly stubby and short - tooth left over. 

I was told I would need a crown too, to make up for the missing tooth mass, and because they had really drilled deep in there: teeth aren't so strong when they're hollowed out. I asked her to run the numbers again. This time, my insurer denied it. I would be paying 100% out of pocket because I had hit my cap for THE WHOLE YEAR. It would cost $2000. I said no. The tooth had recovered well and I would be losing about 5 months worth of savings for something my insurer declared was purely cosmetic. The dentist warned me against opting out, but I said I'd have to come back later when I can afford it. Honestly, I was willing to wait until January 1st for my insurance to roll over, since it would cut the cost of any work down by half.

Today, two months after my root canal, I was enjoying some slightly refrigerated chocolate and heard a ""crunch"". I spat out what I was chewing on and searched the mess for what I initially thought was a giant grain of salt. Nope, it was a full one-quarter of my damaged tooth. I washed my mouth out and see the gap that's now glaring at me in the mirror. 

The cost of restoration + sealant + moulding + crown + x-rays + whatever, it's going to be far more than if I had just sucked it up in the beginning. Emergency savings are meant for emergencies, but I was convinced by my lack of insurance coverage that a crown was purely optional, just restoring the cosmetic shape of my original tooth. I also assumed the dentist was just trying to con more money out of me with unnecessary add-ons. Welp, I was wrong. And now I feel bad too because my dentist is absolutely lovely and I've just been mentally tainted by the whole US health system (as an Aussie).

It would honestly be cheaper to fly home and get dental work done, and I am returning to Aus in August, but I am not fucking with this again. I found a teaching dental school in my city that quoted me about 800-1200 for a single tooth of work. It's still such an enormous chunk of my savings but I told them fuck yeah get me in asap. I'm not making this dumb mistake again.

Don't ignore small medical issues, they snowball into big medical problems very quickly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/c4af6j/im_paying_thousands_for_dental_work_now_because_i/,1418,"This is a story so familiar to us in the dental field. Do not take short cuts with diagnosed treatment. If you feel like you don‚Äôt trust your dentist, ask for a copy of your X-ray and get a second or third opinion. Also there‚Äôs no shame in telling them you can‚Äôt afford treatment. The doctor can prioritize and work with insurance. 
On a side note‚Äî‚ÄîI‚Äôm so tired of insurance companies. They always deny basic services or drag their feet paying. We had an insurance company preauthorize some treatment because the patient was tight on money and he could only take care of the worst teeth. They sent it back approved. We did all the work and did some for free because Doc is awesome and once she had access to the area she couldn‚Äôt leave the glaring crud on the tooth next door. Anyway they denied the claim (they had no record of the preauth despite us sending them a copy) again and again and again for 24 months. Each time we were having to resubmit X-rays, chart notes, and perio charting.  Thank goodness they were all meticulous and the patient kept calling them as well. 
So if your office doesn‚Äôt fight to get your claim paid, you can keep trying. Insurance companies are contracted with you and if you‚Äôre paying for benefits you deserve to get them.

A few years back I was unemployed and completely broke. Like -$200 to my name. My car insurance was canceled and a few months later when I was working again I was trying to get insurance. The fact that I had lapsed for so long made it nearly impossible to get insurance. Finally I was able to get [Company A] for around $190 a month. Recently I got a different car. I paid $500 cash for this car. I switched it over on my car insurance and they upped my policy to $300 a month. I called to find out what happened and tried to negotiate. I ended up bringing it down to around $250 a month or $1490ish every 6 months. I told them it was still unacceptable as I don't want anything more than the absolute basic coverage. In two months I would have paid as much in insurance as I paid for my car. If my car gets hit to the point of being non functional I am junking it. It's nearly 20 years old. 

Anyway I started shopping around and ended up switching to [Company B]. I got basic coverage through them and it ended up only costing me $487 for six months if I paid up front (around $600 if I paid month to month). I don't have a lot in savings but I felt this was a good reason to use some savings funds. The idea that I'm going to saving nearly $200 a month is a good feeling. Even compared to my old policy I'm saving around $100 a month. I feel silly for not switching earlier. 

TL;DR: Insurance company jacked up my policy to nearly $1500 every 6 months, shopped around and was able to get a policy for around $500 every 6 months.

And as someone who is an avid looker here on Povertyfinance, I wanted to hear your advice.

Long story short, I have an Aerospace Engineering degree with 1 year experience with the current company I work at. I started in production not working as an engineer but as a production employee, then moved to another position as a technician assistant operating HAAS machines, then to the office to work in the quality department as an administrator.
So far my hourly rate is $13.50 per hour. I haven't had a raise in a year or when I was moving up positions. I understand that it's really low for engineers but I had to take that offer last year because I had no experience. 
The company where I work at is currently having some slowdown in production but will eventually be more busy in the upcoming months. 
Should I wait a couple of months more for things to start picking up again or should I do it now? Not sure when it's the right time to do it since it's my first job out of college as an engineer. I have been given more responsibilities around the office as people have seen that I have the skills to do whatever they put me to do 

I currently live in California and not working as an Aerospace engineer but as a Quality administrator.


I love what I'm doing and my colleagues are awesome. Just the pay is what is really killing me since everything in California, especially in Orange County is really expensive and it's really frustrating and depressing. I can't relocate because I need to help my family. I'm single but I'm helping my sister who is a college student and parents who are of old age.

Edit: Im single currently live in California with an Aerospace Engineering degree. Currently not working as an Aerospace engineer but as a Quality administrator making $13.50 per hour. Best time to ask for a raise?

It was enlightening. Heres the top 7 things I did NOT buy

1. Number one thing i wanted to buy, but did not need, was.... ALCOHOL AT BARS. Approximate total that I would have spent was $36. I did make myself many mystery cocktails this week using what was in my bar at home.

2: SNACKS. I used a few recipe sites to find out what I could make at home usong whats already in the cupboards. Turns out, it was A LOT.

3: ice cream. I have a thrifted ice cream maker. I had eggs. I had sugar, milk, and just a smidge less cream than the recipe called for, but this is easily the best ice cream Ive ever made anyway.

4: Uber rides. I walked. I realized most of my rides were under 2 miles. So i walked. I lost 2 lbs this week and saved about $30.

5: cat toys. I spent an hour  hot gluing the feather toys back together and my cats did not notice they were not new.

6: laundry: i have a portable washer. I hung my clothes to dry. Laundry was free mc free all week.

7: books and movies: HELLO LIBRARY!!

ZERO ZERO ZERO DOLLARS.

These are just the 7 things I repeatedly wanted to buy this week... but chose not to buy.

A list of the nonrecurring items of thing I WANTED to buy is fucking stupid, but heres a sample:

UV light for cat pee (just used my nose for free), a laser automatic cat toy (i got a laser on my keychain, and i am not that lazy), a swimsuit (still gonna buy this, but I will shop arpund for prices), a proper bread machine (i have one from a thrift store, but it only does 1 setting. I will check other thrift stores for a multi setting bread maker).

I feel personally so gratified to see a gap in my online bank statement between july 18 and july 24th  with zero debits.

694,hr0cxn,False,Success/Cheers,151,I made it out of poverty.,povertyfinance,"Not to say I don't still struggle with certain things, poverty spend mindset is a killer. But I've never missed a rent payment, I have always been able to pay my bills and buy clothes and food. Some months I'd have nothing left over from spending superfluously. But I wasn't in poverty anymore.

I have had to deal with my personal monetary issues and learn the value of money because no one told me when I was young.

When I was a kid, my mom got 800 dollars from social security, 400 in ebt and 400 dollars a month.She was a raging drug addict and it got worse the older I got so she would end up spending all of her money on drugs and sell her food stamps for 70 cents on the dollar. She was abusive and to top it off the rest of our family was rich. It was just her. We lived in a shitty trailer park.I remember understanding that I was different from the rest of my classmates, I would show up to school in clothes that didn't fit and were full of holes because they were hand-me-downs and all the kids would make fun of me and tell me I smelled like cigarette smoke constantly.

A lot of the time school lunches were the only meal I was getting. My elementary school would give me bags of clothes, coats for winter and stuff like that, I didn't realize for a while that this wasn't something normal.I couldn't go on class trips, sometimes my mom would be too konked out to sign the waivers or we didn't have enough money.I was truant in school because I was worried my mom was going to die, so I would ditch.

Everyone could see that something was wrong.My mom got cps called on her 5-6 times growing up, she would teach us what to say and said that if we told the truth, we would go in foster care and get molested. So we lied and said everything was fine. I hate that I didn't say anything. But I was scared.On my 10th birthday, my mom got so mad at me that she threw pots and pans at my head.I hate my family for never helping. I hate my family so much. I hate them for being rich and entitled and letting us suffer all the while talking shit about us.

But I made it, when I was 16, my mom and I got in a huge fight. She wanted to smash my xbox because I never left my room and I told her that the xbox was a better mother than she would ever be. She called my sister and told her to take me. Thank god.I then spent time living with my sister then moved out when I was 18.

It's been a bit rocky, I have cptsd, anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder so that makes it harder on me. But recently I got an amazing job opportunity, it's QA testing for a big game company, it ain't fancy but it pays really well. I live with my fiance and we just got an apartment together.

It's gonna be a battle but after big important purchases, like a new bed and stuff. I'm going to boost my savings and save for a trip to japan with him.

I had a couple of estimates but they were out of my budget. (House built in 1952, literally no insulation in my attic, just dust) I was looking on my city's website and saw that they offered a weatherization program for low income families. I printed off everything, filled out the forms, made copies of the required information (i.e.: ID, birth certificate, utility bills) and mailed it last week. 

I just got a call from the city and the lady I spoke with said she had received my application and asked if I was just needing help with my electric bill. I explained that my bill isn't high, yet....summer is coming and this is Texas....lol, but that I was actually trying to get assistance for having insulation blown in my attic and just weatherizing my house in general. She said that she saw that I signed that form and that she would be sending it to that department as well....but, that I would also receive assistance with my electric bill and they would send me a letter to let me know what months they will pay and how much they will help pay!!!! 

I was BLOWN away....I had to confirm with her that not only was someone from the electric company going to come out and do an energy review for weatherization but that I was ALSO going to receive some help with my electric bill!!
She said yes and also wanted to let me know that the weatherization appointments can be as long as 8 months out because of how backed up they are. I told her I understood and thanked her profusely.

Here in the UK Aldi have made a big impression on the market.
But I have to say I think there business model sucks.
Every corner is cut to maximize profits, they seem cheap but cost per kilo is often not dramatically different from the budget ranges from the other supermarkets...sometime more expensive.
Quality is definitely an issue...which is why the focus on it in advertising.
Staff worked hard.
The shops stock limited range so consumer  choice is restricted.
Fewer staff....smaller shop...limited choice...poorer quality....
It is not about cheaper food for the masses. it is all about maximum profit for the company.

I moved out when I was 15 and started working, and tried to learn my finances as I went. Last year, I got a couple credit cards and after ending up in a bad place mentally I started buying things to make myself feel better. In June I was facing moving back in with my abusive family because I was 6k in debt (just cards, not my vehicle) and didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay my basic bills, let alone food, etc. 

Also in June, a new job found me. They pay above minimum wage, we are tipped (in a monthly check) AND I was able to land housing through them! 

With no rent/utilities, I FINALLY was able to feed myself and start looking at getting my shit together.  I‚Äôve been working at it since and making progress.

Tonight I got my check that includes my  monthly tips ($1840.00 total). I put $240 in my checking for food and gas, leaving $1600 (!!) for the rest. I paid the remainder of cards for $175, $67, $66, $730 AND put $550 towards a card that has been past maxed out for 6 months at $2300+. 

I now owe less than $1800 not including my car and I‚Äôm looking at being out of debt as soon as MEXT MONTH.

891,bic16u,False,,192,I'm not going to tell my husband about the money I just got.,povertyfinance,"Kind of long, TL;DR at the end. 

For some background, we're poor. Until both of our kids are in school next year and I can go back to work, we're a family of 4 living on just my husband's income. He makes better than minimum wage and we're in an area where cost of living is dirt cheap, but we're still working with less than $30,000/yr. We live very frugally, we only have the necessities and basically every cent we have goes towards bills or caring for our children. 


Because I'm currently a SAHM, I try to help my little sister by babysitting for her so she doesn't have to quit her job. She doesn't make much, but it's better than nothing. She usually pays me by just picking up whatever small stuff I need for the house. A pack of diapers here, a jug of laundry detergent there, you get the idea. 


So, yesterday we celebrated a late Easter with all the kids and they had a blast. Well, my sister surprised me with a basket even though I didn't expect anything. It was so sweet of her, she got my favorite candy and a few skeins of yarn, just really thoughtful, you know? She also gave me $600, which I did NOT expect. I was pretty floored, because that's a pretty big amount of money for all of us. It's not  exactly something we're pulling out of the couch cushions. It's literally our rent and electric bill this month. It is a significant gift that my sister gave me. 


I know I should spend that money on bills. There's always something that needs to be paid, or the car fixed, the kids have birthdays coming up... there's just always much that I could use that money for. And I decided to not tell my husband about it. He's not the best with money. I mean, he's not out blowing rent on dumb shit, but if we have a spare $20, he can't not spend it so I'm usually in charge of the money. 


I have decided to not tell him about this gift, and surprise him by buying us a new bed with that money. We've needed a new bed for years, we've talked about it so many times but it's always at the bottom of our priorities list because we won't die without it and the kids are always outgrowing clothes. I want to do something for us for once. I don't even remember the last time we had something new, just because. And I want a new bed. I'm tired of us working our asses off and waking up sore and not fully rested. We deserve something nice for ourselves for once. And I'm gonna do it. I'm not telling him because he'll remind me that there's other, more important things. But those other things are always there. The opportunity for a new bed, however, is not one I'm willing to pass up. 


TL;DR my sister gifted me a substantial amount of money and I'm not telling my husband about it so I can buy us a new bed instead of spending it on something ""more important"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/bic16u/im_not_going_to_tell_my_husband_about_the_money_i/,943,"Whatever you do, buy it from amazon because you can always return it if you‚Äôre unsatisfied.

Seems the only things that make the front page are images of paid off student loans and images of credit scores. In general, these things aren‚Äôt very helpful. Most people can‚Äôt even implement the methods in such posts... e.g., get a job paying 80k/year, live with parents, etc... because they are unattainable for most.

I would rather someone post about how to find ways to save money or stay sane... For example, my wife and I saved tons of money buying baby things on the Facebook marketplace. I highly recommend over Craigslist.

Edit: As I keep mentioning in the comments (and pointed out above), people should post their successes.

And i hope we all make it someday.**

&#x200B;

I doubt anyone will read this as its super duper fucking long. But i don't have many close friends that i can share my excitement with. So here we go.

I was a very difficult kid as a teenager, my parents split when i was 12 and my older brother and sister had just left for college being only 1 year in age difference. So I was alone to be shuffled back and forth between them. My dad found a rebound pretty quick like 2 months after and spent 90% of his energy on her. My mom developed a bad drinking habit getting wasted every night. My dad was never open to talk about anything so that's kind of how we were raised. I never told my brother or sister what went on hell we weren't close only seeing each other on holidays or a call on a birthday.

I saw what they had through their teenage years and what I got instead and I despised it. I started getting in trouble in school, got expelled quickly in 6th grade 3 weeks before the end of the year (after amassing over 60 write ups, so many suspensions etc) and they passed me anyways.

Switched school districts a bunch over the years back and forth between my mom and dad house who lived 45 mins apart. Getting expelled 7 times, and even expelled from alternative schools. Last time I got expelled from the 9th grade for the 2nd time my family made the choice to send me to a military school GED program at the age of 15. I almost got kicked out of that for getting into 2 fights and had a lot of disciplinary platoon where we had to workout for 2 hours in the morning if we got in trouble. But the leader of the program kept me in for some reason and I got my GED 3 months later right after turning 16.

I ended up still being bad with nothing to do now. Mom moved to another state. And my Dad kicked me out after finding weed at the house (oh btw he had 2 more kids with my stepmom who were 3-1 at this time). So at age 16 I couch surfed with friends. Got arrested 3-4 times for weed, under age drinking, evading police (running from party) ended up having warrants put out on me when I missed court. 6 charges 30 days each run consecutive since I skipped court.  At this time I'm 18 now. I get pulled over while riding with a friend for a headlight being out and they ID everyone in the car and arrest me.

I get sent to jail which I had been before on all my previous charges. Next morning they transfer me to the state prison evaluation center because anybody in my county with a sentence of over 90 days goes to prison to serve time instead of jail. I got to the evaluation center and it's where everyone gets classified to see what level yard they are going to, what gang they're in etc. Everyone in the state who goes to prison stops through this center for 90 days. Anyways I stay in here with 2 cell mates on 23 hour a day lock down (cant let us out cause we're all unclassified), only out to eat then get locked right back up.

It sucked the only person who wrote me was my friends mom who I had been living with who cared about me like a son. She even hired a lawyer to help get me out god bless her. My mom called too actually she was always very nice over the years but lived far away and had her own problems. I dont blame my dad for not contacting me, he gave me plenty of chances over the years and I always did the wrong thing I was and am still very stubborn. So I got out after 2 months time served thanks to the lawyer.¬†

Now over the years up to this point i have had several entry level jobs. Fast food, waitor etc. And i was always a very hard worker every boss i ever had loved me. I had grown out of most of my bad habits but had no way to support myself and was still living with a friend.

&#x200B;

Anyways my moms boyfriend had a job opportunity for me to come work with him in another state as a flagger and he was a lineman. Well i did that and quickly took over doing most of the work while he would drive the truck and flag and show me what i need to do. Which i didn't mind hes older so i didn't think it fair for him to do the hard labor anyways. So i did this for like 5 months staying in hotels there he payed for until we completed all the work on his current contract.

&#x200B;

So now here i was out of work again. He had been paying me $400 a week under the table which to me was a fortune. And i had no bills to pay so i was banking it all. I had a taste of actually doing something meaning full and i didn't want to let it go. Up until this point i had always been the family fuck up. My brother and sister had their own problems growing up but nothing close to what i did. I felt like an embarrassment to my family and a piece of crap knowing it was all my own doing. My brother and sister were very smart, brother became an engineer with a great company and my sister (who i have never been close with, we only have ever texted happy birthday once a year) was in medical school. I never put blame on anyone but myself only years later realizing the circumstances that had stoked the fire of my troubled youth. Even if i was put in a tough situation as an adolescent it was my fault for how i handled it.

&#x200B;

So here i am no job, on a greyhound going back home knowing i have no where to live and that the place is a bad environment for me because of people, drugs, etc.

&#x200B;

Then i get a call from my moms boyfriend 2 weeks later and he says his friend has work down in Alabama. So i take a grey hound bus down to Alabama and start working on a wireless DAS install there. My first time ever doing this work and i started at $12 an hour 70 hours a week. They had an apartment rented for us employees and i was making a killing at my age thought i had it made. The overtime made my checks actually pretty nice and i banked all of my paychecks only spending per diem we got on my necessities.

&#x200B;

So i loved it and started working my ass off. I sought every day to be the hardest worker there i didn't want there to be a single person out performing me. And the guy who got me the job originally was the foreman of our side of the install. And he recognized my hard work and loved me, he put me in charge of running a crew 2 months in. I was leading 4-5 people running coax cable, installing connectors, placing antennas etc.

&#x200B;

The job ended and the company decided to bring me on full time up in the DMV area. They bumped my pay rate to $15 an hour and had a hotel for me to stay at which they paid. We finished a 6 month project at a nearby stadium and since they're a small company the work was drying up and they had to lay people off. They were gonna send me home and i plead my case on why im a benefit to the company and why i should stay. Let me also add at this point they know nothing of my past because i was embarrassed by it and never shared it, as far as they were knew i was just a kid who finished highschool and didn't want to go to college.

&#x200B;

Anyways they keep me on and start teaching me new things. Mainly all the technical side of the industry. I was taught how to test and trouble shoot antenna systems. So me and a co-worker who had been there 5 years longer than me were tasked with testing cell towers for another company under contract. It was pretty new to both of us but i worked so hard on learning all of it and even researching it on my own time.

&#x200B;

After about 8 months the company who was hiring my company to do the testing was requesting only me out to the sites since i did a good job and was very quick. Once i found this out i negotiated a pay raise to $18 and i got a company vehicle that i was able to take home. Around this time my brothers job brought him into the area since he was leading a project at a local military base repairing all of their water system. And he bought a house and i moved in with him which worked great. Paying $600 a month in rent to him. Little did i know this would benefit me so much down the road. I always kinda idolized my brother. He was a great people persons, everyone loved him. He knew how to talk to girls, he was really smart and he always tried to be a father figure to me when my dad was absent.

&#x200B;

I did this for a about 2 years working an average of 60-65 hours a week. Going above and beyond, and never missing a day of work. Hell i didn't take a sick day for 2 years and was never late and worked every weekend they asked me to even if it was last minute. Well i started to get run down after doing that almost everyday for 2 years and asked for a raise and they pushed me to $23. And we ended up losing our contract with that company testing cell towers. They started doing it themselves to cut down on cost.

&#x200B;

Well a big project came up in DC that was over a year long and my boss choose me to run the whole thing. He really believed in my work ethic. I was the only person there from my company that was experienced, we hired on 6 temp workers who had no experience. I trained them all on every aspect of our job and we completed the job ahead of schedule and everyone was praising me. At this point i was turning 26 and was going to be dropped from my dads health coverage. I called my boss and said i really want a raise i need $25 an hour since ill have to provide my own health care. Well he gave me $25 an hour and the company since we were growing picked up a health insurance plan, as well as 401k with match.

&#x200B;

Once the job ended we got a bit slow again but i started working in the office doing wireless communication designs. Designing DAS systems for a major carrier in all sorts of venues. Office buildings, Stadiums, Concert halls etc... And i picked it up really quick. After about 5 months i was doing all the major designs our company got by myself practically, only asking the engineers in the office for advise when needed.

i end up doing this for quite a while at least 2 years and in that time i found a girlfriend and she ended up unexpectedly getting pregnant. I swear when she told me my life flashed before my eyes. I just didn't think i was at all capable of taking care of a kid i didn't think it was the right time. But we decided to keep it even though we had only been dating for 6 months at the time.

&#x200B;

I just keep busting my ass but i knew i had to make more money. The cost of living here is high and although i had amassed 16k in savings while living with my brother, he was moving to another state. His job had moved again and he wanted to sell the house we lived in now. He ended up renting it to me for a discount, and i actually still live here right now (although im moving in feb.) but it was still more money then i had been spending.

&#x200B;

The baby and frivolous spending with my new girlfriend caused me to almost drain my bank account. We hired some new employees that had experience but were from another company. I found out they were making more than me while doing way less skilled work. This kind of made me resent my company a bit, i wasn't mad at my co-workers hell everyone should fight for as much money as they can. But i was mad at the office, i didn't feel appreciated. I was employee of the years 2 years prior (the only time we ever had an empoloyee of the year) everybody at the company admitted i had the best work ethic etc..

&#x200B;

Well a little over a month ago i was contacted by a headhunter. Someone who worked under me at the big DC project years ago used me as a reference. At the end of the call he asked me about my skill set and said he had some opportunities for me. Well he ended up connecting me with a bigger company in the same area who does very similar work. I had an interview with them for a field tech position (commissioning das sites) and at the interview i blew them away. They actually had me come to a 2nd interview the next week instead now i was interviewing for the Design Engineer role and the CTO sat in on the interview. I completely nailed that interview as well.

&#x200B;

And a week later i got an offer for a position 75k Base salary plus all benefits. I talked with my family and decided it was the right move. I didn't want to get into a bid war with my current company and i thought it would be bad etiquette to say ""I was offered XX amount, what can you guys do for me"". So instead i wrote out a formal two week notice and sent it in.

&#x200B;

My company was shocked, my co-workers all said they don't know what the company would do without me. I practically can do everything there. My immediate boss asked if there is anything he can do to make me stay. And not wanting to get into a bid war i said no. Next week i was in the office and the owner says ""What do you need to want to stay here"" I told him the same thing and he ended up telling me to sleep on it and talk to him the next day.

&#x200B;

Well the next day im at the office doing a design and he pulls me aside to talk to me. He says they really appreciate everything that i do and he wants me to stay for all the right reasons. He said he would give me the title of 'Design Engineer' and 85k a year base salary with annual bonuses. I was a little shocked. I knew they would make an offer to keep me, but i didn't expect it to be 10k more. Plus i already have a take home vehicle with them which they pay insurance, gas, maintenance etc. Which i wouldn't get at the other company. So total compensation is like 92-93k a year.

Last year i only made 53k total for the year at $25 an hour. This is a 30k raise and its guaranteed salary. I always thought i was under paid but now i really feel i'm getting what i deserve now. And man it feels good.

Sorry for the super long rant. I just feel really good. Although i never tried to care what people thought of me because i know i'm a good person and work hard. I always felt out shadowed by my siblings, it feels so good to hit this milestone and be able to better provide for me and my family.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/dqjqrb/from_highschool_dropout_to_85k_a_year/,4176,Wow.

285,8asxdk,False,,439,"It's possible to make an extra $1,000 a month working online. A basic beginners guide.",povertyfinance,"Update: I posted a [follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8c9in2/last_week_i_posted_a_guide_on_making_1000mo/?ref=share&ref_source=link) to this post with more info and added revenue streams. You can also check out my post on [using apps to save money and earn cash back](https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperSecretSpare/comments/au5am7/saving_money_online_in_2019/).

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

Time investment required for these numbers: 30-40 hours a week. Feel free to work less or more. 40 hours a week is only a requirement if you want to make over $1,000 following this guide.

Tech required for these numbers: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), and an internet connection. Alternatively, just go to the library a few hours a day.

This is a slightly modified and edited post that I made on another sub. I know that when I was trying to improve my life, working online opened a lot of additional doors for me. I was able to eat when I wanted instead of when I could afford it, I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner, and have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates.

Working online is something that pretty much anyone can do. If you are already browsing Reddit, you have the tools to make additional income. I am including payment proof as well as direct links to all of the sites, so everyone can see that it is actually possible and get started today. These are all legit sites and I have not been scammed or jipped by any of them for any amount. Feel free to do your own research about their trustworthiness if need be. 

This is by no means a comprehensive guide to everything you can do online to make extra cash, nor is this really that impressive a number to make. This does not include some of the more well known sites like swagbucks or earnhoney, as I just do not like them that much. It does not include sites like Rat Race or Appen. It also does not include tutoring Chinese kids with some of the well known sites. This is more a quick overview of how I personally boosted my monthly income by almost $1,000 a month working with six different websites. While I am in America, many of these sites can be used worldwide. Hopefully someone can find a new revenue stream through this write-up.

The times I have invested vary greatly, from one or two hours a day to well over 12 hours a day. I average somewhere around $6.25 an hour (admittedly never giving it 100% attention),  but to me that is better than making nothing an hour. While it may seem excessive some days, I actually enjoy making money and I do some of it while I am at my day job, so it has become more of a time filler than actual work. Everyone will have their own experience but these are what have worked the best for me, either in time investment or having a little fun along the way.

**SwagBucks** ($225) Surveys ‚Äì Majority of countries‚Äì This is more of a catch-all for stuff to do when you want to make and save money. You can do surveys, play games, and watch videos to earn points. You can also get cash back from using SB to visit and buy from different stores. You get paid in points which can be used to purchase gift cards or sent directly to PayPal. Each point is the equivalent of $0.01. Usually, SB will have deals where you can get certain gift cards for less. For example, a $20 Amazon gift card for 1800 SB points. The payout can be slow, but if you don‚Äôt mind running ads in the background, using a plug-in to save money while you shop, or killing time playing a game, SwagBucks can be a great way to earn $20 a month. [SwagBucks](https://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=50837036)

**Mturk** ([$2,400](https://imgur.com/1EPHq64)): This is by far the one I spend the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved. www.mturk.com

**Respondent.io** ([$1,300](https://imgur.com/a/ITb6G)): This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 200 screeners and have been selected for 20 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [www.respondent.io](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)

**Usertesting** ([$600](https://imgur.com/sxUwXW8)): This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. www.usertesting.com

**Redbubble** ([$60](https://imgur.com/wobuyuz)): [My store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/7secondman). After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, clocks, mugs, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. I have only been at this one for about two months, but see the potential it has. It also takes a good amount of upfront work before you see any dividends. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. www.redbubble.com

**PlaytestCloud** ($150): This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal. No payment proof available as it is not all saved in one place. www.playtestcloud.com

**Reddit subs**($400): From test driving cars, to doing homework, to rating businesses, these subs have been a catch all for when I have any extra time to go through them. Honestly, this has probably been the third best pay per hour of work out of everything, after Respondent and Prolific. I just wish there were gigs to find all day. Be careful not to get scammed here. Some people are just... something else. 

Check out r/beermoney, r/workonline, r/slavelabour, and r/jobs4bitcoins. 

Well, that is all I have for now. I hope someone can get something from this. Feel free to share any other revenue streams you may have and feel free to ask any questions you may have. I will answer the best I can.

Edit: This isn't a get rich quick scheme. And it isn't a way to make anywhere near minimum wage online. This post if for people willing to sacrifice free time to make a few extra bucks.

Edit II: Holy fuck, I get it. A second job would pay better. This is for people who want extra money without having to get a second job, are confined to their house for whatever reason, have unusual hours free, or for people (like me) that prefer making a bit extra sitting around in their underwear eating cereal not having to deal with other people.

Edit III: I still understand a part time job will pay way more than this. If you would rather have a part time job, or deal with the stress of deliverables and bosses, have at it. Please stop.

Edit IV: u/gordigor did an [excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/dx25udg?utm_source=reddit-android) on a more passive way to earn around $50 a month.

In the summer of 2013 I was delivering pizzas with a BA in polisci/sociology. My gf (now wife) was bringing home about $400/wk and we were over $15k in CC debt. One day I was offered a job as a hospital security guard, full time pay plus (shitty) benefits so if course I accepted. The only catch was it was the overnight shift but what choice did I have? 

In a strange sort of coincidence, 1 month into that job my wife totaled her car (no injuries). It dawned on us then that with her working days and me on nights we didn't need 2 cars. Huge $$ saver!. 

5 months into the security job I applied for and got a job within that hospital on the adult psychiatry unit (night shift). The increase in pay was substantial and the benefits were SO GOOD that my wife and I got married A YEAR EARLY just so she could get on my benefits! That was 5 years ago and last week I was promoted, same hospital, still on the night shift and will be getting another substantial increase in pay.

We still only need 1 car, my wife has since changed careers and we had our 1st baby last March. $1000 in savings, some CC debt but just looking back it's crazy to see how things have changed.

723,9p5r70,False,,539,Driving trucks to escape poverty,povertyfinance,"Maybe this has been posted before, but I was at rock bottom back in 2008, after graduating from Florida State, with a Finance degree.  I could not find a job that works cover my living expenses, as well as my $56k in student loan debt.  I was to the point of selling plasma, stealing copper to sell, etc.  Then one day, it struck me.  I could let my apartment go, sell my personal vehicle, and hit the road to make some cash.

In 2009, I applied at all of the companies that offered training and took the first opportunity, as I knew I would not be there more than a year.  I made $57k that first year and have increased my salary substantially year after year.  This year I am on track to make $124k, and have made another $35k in the options market so far.  

Your cost of living can be as low as $100 a week, while making $2k depending on the lifestyle you choose.

We were able to pretty much completely ignore it without any negative repercussions thanks to the Service Member Civil Relief Act, a protection my husband is about to lose in less than a month. So, we had to finally deal with it. 

Saved up $5,500 *beyond* our emergency fund. But just for the hell of it wanted to see if we could negotiate it. Which I read was possible, but difficult. I low-balled and my husband literally laughed at me when I said ""We have about $2,500."" he hit back with $2,750!! It was that easy. It was a 5 minute phone call. I was originally going to start my negotiation at $3-3.5k. Glad I didn't! They just wanted *HALF*! 

That extra $2,750 we get to keep is worth much more than the damage a ""settled"" will have on his credit, which is actually somehow quite good. Shout out to SCRA. I'm so happy right now. This happened Friday and I just got the offer in writing. Will be making the payment today!

Take the separate 0.5 cup of rolled oats and put them, dry, in a blender or food processor until it looks like flour. Once at a flour-like texture, add the baking soda and blend for a few second to bake sure its mixed in.

Mix this 0.5 cup of ""oat flour"" into the 2 cups of old fashioned oats. Take a big spoon and really be sure its as even as you can get it.

Add the honey and coconut oil. Then stir until ita like a dryish cookie dough kind of texture.

Put parchment paper onto a cookie sheet. Then use your hands to get the mix into as flat a sheet you want the bars to be.

Put this into a 350¬∞ preheated oven for 20-30 mins.

Once you take it out, let it cool for like... 10 minutes. Then cut it into bars BEFORE it cools completely.

These do well in foodsaver bags if you want to make a bunch of them all at once and store for later.

431,e5mgxm,False,,162,Just want to remind everyone that how much you spend on xmas gifts will not change anyone's opinion of you,povertyfinance,"At least those people whose opinions you value.

Vaguely coherent gift rant: My sister just sent me a gift idea for my grandma. It's a personalized fingerprint necklace. But the thing costs $110... Far beyond my budget. But it started me thinking about my Grandma, and gift giving.

 I think this goes for any Grandma, but she has lived a long time already, and I think she's experienced all that the material world can give her. But yet I feel like most people spend a lot of money on gifts for their grandma. I'm just spit-balling, but I am guessing grandmas don't *really* care about getting new stuff. They enjoy the time spent, the photos, the memories etc. 

Even for my parents, I feel like a weird obligation to spend more money on their gifts than say, my sister's gift. But after thinking about it a bit, it makes no sense. There is nothing they could want that they can't get already, so why should I over-extend myself to give them a gift that I deem 'expensive enough'. So don't try to live up to this fictitious expectation that you've set in your head as an acceptable amount to spend on someone's gift.

People you cherish and love should not give a shit how much you spent on their gifts, and if someone turns up their nose at your inexpensive gift, then that's a good indicator they are a shitty person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/e5mgxm/just_want_to_remind_everyone_that_how_much_you/,2507,"I'm getting my grandma a bunch of family photos (¬£1 per 9 printed) and some local traditional gingerbread.

936,az4be7,False,,282,Can I just have a rant?,povertyfinance,"Would love some like minded folks to understand where I'm coming from. This YouTube video I saw yesterday has had my head spinning.

This guy posted about ""Why he chooses to live in a $50k a year apartment.""

It was not a jealous rage click. Especially when it's not a ""Look at how much money I make. And I'm better than you"" video that seems to be flooded on YouTube lately. 

I clicked because it sounded interesting. I was hoping for a video about features of the apartment. Why it's so expensive. Why he chose it.

He spent 30 seconds on that. And all he mentioned was location, and hardwood flooring and his pool table.

It then turned into a 12-15 minute lecture on ""Don't be poor"".

This man had his parents help throughout all of college. Started working for *Google* at a young age, in some well paying tech position. He said that everyone needs to live at home with their parents. Swallow their pride and just do it until they have enough money saved up.

Which I was letting slide. It was annoying that he was presenting this as something everyone can do. As I was very lucky to live with my parents again in the past couple years. After previously not being able to. Not everyone has that option. And I was miffed that he couldn't see past his own experiences. But moved on. Hoping he'd get back to the apartment. The thing stated in the title.

No. He goes on to say the biggest barrier to living with your parents is the stigma. And people will think you're a loser. This man is so disconnected from how real conversations work that it hurts.

Gems from the video:

""Already have quite a few thousand dollars saved up after just a few months of living with your parents.""

""Anyone can travel. You just have to want it bad enough.""

""If you want to travel. Just live with your parents.""

""All world travellers live with their parents.""

""Doing laundry for one person is hard.""

""You owe it to your parents to take care of them in their old age."" 

No shade to people who plan to take care of their parents. But he completely ignored abusive parents. Parents who disowned  their children or kicked them out over being LGBT+ or atheist or not wanting kids or not agreeing to a certain marriage.

Ignored that people may have their own families. And don't have the resources to spare. Or may not have the financial means to take care of their parents. Or may not be in great health themselves. Or simply just don't have the spoons. Or simply don't want to.

Your parents are not entitled to your help in their old age. It is a nice thing if you can. But don't feel bad if you don't want to or want to but simply can't.

He straight up ignored all of these. We all owe it to our parents. Regardless of the situation.

More gems:

""I get that $80,000 a year is a lot. That's a full time job said for some people."" Said in a way that he clearly believes that 80k is some sort of lower standard for the average American

I watched the video to the end. Hoping for a *tiny* shred of self awareness. Anything. Even just a token ""I understand not everyone can do this.""

Nope. Nothing. So I had to say something. I commented this (which is so much less than everything I wanted to say).

""I understand you mean well. But you presented your life as the standard for Americans. Your life is not the standard. So many people, fellow Americans. Do not have many of the opportunities you have, do not have good family members. Some people are abused by their parents. Some people are disowned for being LGBT+. Lots of people lost their safe and comfortable jobs in the '08 crash. Regardless of education or experience. Millions of American college graduates are underemployed or unemployed. It's incredibly hard to move to a better place with opportunity when you don't have the money in the first place, and a lot of companies don't want to take a chance on you when you don't have any experience and you're not already in the area. You seem to be a very critical thinker, but I fear you were not thinking about other people's situations. There are so many Americans struggling, and your video comes across as dismissive and naive.Ôªø""

This man works for *google*. A company that at least tries to be a little forward thinking and progressive. And he's so uneducated of the situation that millions of Americans are in. For example. This absolutely telling study.

""Nearly 80 percent of American workers (78¬†percent) say they're living paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2017 report by employment website CareerBuilder.¬†""

I was a little skeptical at a survey done by career builder, because I feel like it would be skewed due to the people usually on the site. I found their press release and they shared their survey methodology:¬†

Survey Methodology
This survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,369 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government) and 3,462 employees ages 18 and over (employed full-time, not self-employed, non-government)¬†between May 24 and June 16, 2017¬†(percentages for some questions are based on a subset, based on their responses to certain questions). With pure probability samples of 2,369 and 3,462, one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have sampling errors of +/- 2.01 and +/- 1.67 percentage points, respectively.¬†Sampling error for data from sub-samples is higher and varies.

So yea. That video had me very miffed. And was a bunch of ""Don't be poor"" coming from someone who doesn't understand that he's had situations that many Americans would consider themselves lucky to have. And I did not expect to be slammed with an ignorant person lacking *any* self awareness when I clicked on a simple video.

Lesson learned. Rich people on YouTube suck.

This is an all-inclusive write-up compiling all of my past posts on how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through pretty simple online work. I figured with the holidays coming up, we could all use the extra cash. I am posting again because this is a full-blown compilation of everything, and I am sure there are some people that haven't seen it. Plus, I am including updated numbers from my last post, and a link to the guide I put together with even more stuff (like passive earning, saving money with apps, teaching Chinese kids English, and a lot more).
___
As stated, I put all of this info into an e-book, plus a TON of other stuff that was either written by me, or compiled from others (with their permission). I am attaching a paid and free link. If you're interested in paying for it (much appreciated if you do!), it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126) for under $1.

___
Because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income, I won't pretend you can survive with only this. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will include time requirements to make this money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix. This works better for my temperament and preferences. 

Tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

These are combined numbers over the last year.  Anyway, on to the revenue streams. There are some refs, clearly labeled, as well as non-ref links: 
___
**[Respondent.io ref](https://app.respondent.io/r/brunihurst-171379f42e11)** ([$4,300](https://imgur.com/a/oSpkC5o)): Studies - Most countries - This site allows users to screen for online or in-person surveys and focus groups. The pay is amazing, easily averaging $125 per test. I only average getting approved for the groups about 10% of the time (I have filled out about 400 screeners and have been selected for 40 studies). Thankfully, each screener only takes me a few minutes to fill out. I have made up to $200 with one hour of work doing an in person focus group. Most focus groups are done through webcam, so you don't even have to leave your house. They payout via PayPal 7 days after the activity is complete. [Non-ref](https://app.respondent.io)
___
**[Prolific.ac ref](https://www.prolific.ac/p?ref=O8LEJ7R6)** ([$1,575](https://imgur.com/a/jii6GDW)): Surveys - Most coutries - Based in the UK, this is one of my favorites because they pay in Great British Pound (GBP) which is the equivalent to 1.25x USD. Prolific is similar to mturk in that all you do is fill out surveys. Pay is better than mturk, but the availability of surveys is not as great. The initial questionnaire you have to fill out is a bit long taking me about 20 minutes, but ensures you qualify for every survey they show you and will never get disqualified for not meeting the demographic. You have to hit ¬£5 before you can cash out, but you get this after a few days of watching for surveys. Leave it open in a tab and check it throughout the day. I wish I could do this one all day. They pay out in PayPal anytime you request it and have a balance of over ¬£5. [Non-ref](https://www.prolific.ac)
___
**[Mturk](https://www.mturk.com)** ([$3,142](https://imgur.com/a/AhWXpuw)): Small tasks and surveys - US mainly. Confirmed also in Canada, Europe, & Aus. - This is by far the one I spent the most time on and has been the best earner. This site lets humans perform small tasks that robots still cannot do well. It is owned by Amazon. Downside is there are slim pickings on weekends and when colleges are out on vacation. I typically stick to surveys, but once in a while do batch jobs which there are more of. You have to wait a week for your first payout, which will go to an Amazon payment account. You can the get payouts one time per day after that. Approval for mturk can sometimes be a pain in the ass, almost impossible if you are not from the US, but is definitely worth it in my opinion if you can get approved.
___
**[Secret shopper app ref](https://app.survey.com/account/merch?referral_code=roberthW77D)** ([$485](https://imgur.com/HfQ7PZw)): In-person store evaluation - US only - This link will take you directly to a sign-up page with my ref code. Feel free to delete it before signing up, if you want. You will be taken to the app store where you can download the actual app on your phone. Essentially, you go to stores near you that are identified in the app and take pictures or videos of specific items. I like this one because I have the ability to make a few extra bucks if I am already out shopping. The pay for this one averages about $15/hr. [Non-ref](https://app.survey.com)
___
**[Usertesting](https://www.usertesting.com)** ([$800](https://imgur.com/a/ab5ptaN)): Website evaluation - US & maybe select others - This site allows you to review new websites and apps. The pay is usually $10 per recorded test lasting 10-15 minutes. Sometimes the pay is more, but never less. I average a few tests a week. Some weeks I will get a dozen tests, other weeks nothing. This one is great to practice your feedback skills, which open up a lot of other doors. Pay is through PayPal, one week (to the minute) after the test is complete. 
___
**[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com)** ([$305](https://imgur.com/a/bI5TNO4)): T-shirt creation - Worldwide - After getting rejected by merch by Amazon, I came here. You design and publish t-shirts, phone cases, and about 20 other mixed products, with each sell netting you a few bucks. They are based in Australia, and do pay-outs once a month on the 15th via PayPal. You do all of the uploading and just wait for people to find it with keywords or searches. Great if you are artistic or know how to use any creative software. [25% off ref code for first order over $40](https://www.talkable.com/x/VznBIO). You save $10 or more, and I get a $10 credit if you use this code.
___
**[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com)** ([$190](https://imgur.com/a/SVhmvu5)): Selling goods - Worldwide - Not much explanation needed here. You buy stuff in-person low, and sell online high. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/eBay-Beginner-money-knowledge-inventory-ebook/dp/B07HT4Y9J6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540416148&sr=8-1&keywords=ebay+no+money) is a $1 beginner's guide dedicated to flipping (also mine).
___
**[PlaytestCloud](https://www.playtestcloud.com/signup)** ($190): Video game testing - Many countries - This is just simple game testing. It is super fun, very quick, and you get to test new games before anyone else. They send you tests for different listed devices, you download the game file, and they record your screen and voice. The only issue I have with this one is that you are only able to test 3-4 games per month, at $9-$11 each. Paid almost immediately after each test via PayPal.
___
**[UsabilityHub](https://www.usabilityhub.com)** ([$15](https://imgur.com/a/U4FhJIQ)): App testing - Many countries - This one lets the user take quick one or two minute surveys on your opinion of an app screen. They pay for this averages to about $.10 a minute, so it is nothing spectacular. Just leave it open in another tab and take a quick survey when you hear a new one come available. 
___
**[UserInterviews](https://www.userinterviews.com)** ($50): Studies - US & maybe select others - Similar to Respondent, but with less approval when filling out the demographics for each study.
___
**Reddit subs**($2,300): It is super simple to use Reddit as more than a social media tool or news website. Knowing the right subs to subscribe to, and what to look for, can help you make a few extra hundred bucks  a month. There are a ton that you can find small or medium jobs on, but I am only going to outline the top four that have worked for me.
___
/r/slavelabour: This sub is normally dedicated to doing cheap jobs for people, at cheap rates. I have both had things done for me here, as well as completed a lot of tasks. It may seem daunting at first, with people offering $2 to write an essay (seriously though.. no homework here), but there are gems to be found. Two of my best jobs have been creating meal plans for $60, and [finding the name of a book for $80](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/comments/92k4n0/task_find_one_of_my_favourite_books_80/?ref=share&ref_source=link).
___
/r/WorkOnline: A gold mine of information on different websites to check out, gift card survey opportunities, and other generally helpful tips. I have never made money directly from there, but have gotten tools that have helped make at least a thousand over the last year.
___
/r/signupsforpay: Since slave labour does not allow paying people to sign up for websites, this is where to go to make a few bucks with signups. From connecting your gas and electric information, to signing up with Acorns, I have probably made a grand total of $100 here. Nothing overly special, but $100 is $100.  
___
/r/giftcardexchange: This is one of my favorites, because you can buy and sell all of those gift cards you have/want. Have a $20 gift card from a family member that you will never use? Sell it here for 80-90%. Want to buy Amazon gift cards for less than face value? Get 'em here. I do a lot of buying on Amazon, so this sub has easily saved me hundreds over the course of using it. Caution: Trade carefully. 
___

I know this is a lot of info and a bunch of it is repetitive from my last post, but I wanted to provide as much info as possible for the compiled post. Well, I hope it helps!

Basically, in January of this year, my mom passed away. We aren't 100% sure what she died from but my dad thinks it was an aneurysm. I was 16 at the time. I don't know exactly how much but I do know my dad went into a lot of debt for my mom. I know right now he still owes over 10 grand to the funeral home and is pretty much never home because he's always working over time or on holidays. He worked thanksgiving day and has already told me he's working christmas eve and christmas day for the pay. 
The big problem is he's not paying our bills. We've had our lights shut off once already and he rarely buys groceries. Last night he told me he can't evem afford to buy me winter clothes because the funeral home is apparently calling him and demanding he pay more on his payments. But he refuses to let me get a job and even though I have my license, he won't let me drive my moms car. Ot has been sitting in our yard since she died and its just collecting dust but every time I bring it up, he yells at me and tells me I cant touch it.

I don't know how to help him, or me.  I need a new bra because the one I have now the underwire is constantly poking me .. All of my underwear has period blood stains and are at least 3 years old because my dad is too ""squicked out"" to buy me underwear.  I need long sleeve shirts and an actual winter jacket. I'm still wearing short sleeves and just layering them so I have enough to wear. It just sucks right now

I'm just not sure what to do for him. It seems like every time we talk, he gets upset and just ends up either yelling at me or shutting down and leaving in the middle of the conversation to lock himself in his room. I know he misses mom. I miss my mom too. She made everything better but right now I just want my dad back too. So if anyone has any idea on how I can help him please let me know. Thanks

Edit: Sorry for anyone who has messaged me, my inbox has been kinda flooded. I am going to speak to my guidance counselor tomorrow at school about everything.

It's always the ""I just paid off my huge debt"" posts which simply aren't attainable for a majority of people on this sub. A very large amount of visible posts in my feed are humble brags that aren't achievable for 90%+ of the userbase.

I'm super happy that some people are planning and executing their plans to pay back their debt well. However I feel this subs focus should be more on tips and advice rather than a collection of payment receipt pictures. The former has substance while the latter does not.

Again, nothing personal against all of you that are kicking ass, I'm very happy for you, I just don't think that content is right for the sub and would like to see something done about it. 

Thoughts?

edit: I'm not saying that paying off debts is unattainable for 90% of the userbase, I was specifically referring to the posts that show thousands or sometimes ten thousand plus dollar payments to clear out a loan. Unfortunately even the good natured ""hey I'm so happy I paid off my loan after seven years"" still bottlenecks any sort of actual content on this sub. I'm not against people or being happy or proud or anything, I'd just rather seem a greater use of this space. The endless stream of payment receipts adds nothing.

Since there have been [several](https://old.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9qndmr/last_year_i_was_earning_the_minimum_wage_and_now/) of these [threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/9qf37o/i_just_wanted_to_let_you_guys_know_about_an/) posted here lately, all highly upvoted, I think its important people understand the reality.


But before doing that I'll just preface this by stating: I'm not saying there is anything wrong with trucking or skilled trade work. It pays OK, and the barrier to entry is low enough that it can be a good option for many people. The issue with this topic is the hysterically large sums of money that people seem to infer is ""normal"" for these types of jobs.

The **median annual wage** for  *heavy truck drivers* is $20.42/hour or $42k/year, for *electricians* it is $26.01/hour or $54k/year, and for *plumbers* $25.28/hour or $53k/year. Are those all good wages? In most of the country, yes. Will they get you out of poverty? Yes. But remember, those are **medians,** which means you could very likely make less than that.

Almost no one in the trades or driving trucks is making these large salary numbers that get tossed around here. I have no doubt the people posting are getting paid what they say in most cases - but they are the exception. It seems people are forgetting if you work enough hours in any job, you'll make a lot of money. Truckers making $90k a year aren't normally being paid that much on a per hour basis, they are just working 60 hour weeks most of the year. Work any job that allows that kind of overtime and you'll make good money. And of course there are cases of people in trades making $90k a year with little overtime. They tend to be *in unions* in *very high cost of living areas* (and their wages won't apply to 99% of people in the occupation). 

Finally, most of these jobs are **not** in some sort of ""shortage."" Trucker jobs, for example, are expected to grow about as fast as all occupations (according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Certain regions may have a temporary shortage, but it isn't national and it won't last long enough to drive up wages. Jobs involving trucking and trades are actually very cyclical. During an economic downturn, these jobs get hit worse than other occupations because they rely on commerce or construction activity.

Hi everyone,

I know this virus situation has put many of us out of work, especially as restaurants around the USA are closing. If you're looking for a new job or to supplement your income during this time, I really encourage you to check out Palfish. I've taught on there for about three years and logged 1000+ hours of teaching.

**You need to be a native English speaker, but you don't need a bachelor's degree, unlike all other high-paying teaching platforms. You don't need to speak Chinese, either.**

Mostly, it's playing interactive English games with the kids while correcting their pronunciation. You're provided the lesson materials, so there's no prep work. You need stable internet and a phone/tablet. You set your own schedule for classes. It‚Äôs a real job, so yes, you will have to go through an application process, which typically takes a few days.

Here is a google doc I made with a lot more in-depth info and some overview of what the classroom/lessons look like, if you'd like to read in more detail.

**Quick-start guide:**  [https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/](https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/) 

**If you do plan on doing Palfish, please read the guide carefully so that you pass your interview.**

You can download the app here - I'll get a notification on my Palfish account and I will walk you through the process. (I get a bonus if you join using my link, full disclosure!). Just figured I'd make a post here for those who are affected by this very unfortunate virus outbreak. (By the way, if there's some kind of pop up, it's probably due to it being a Chinese web page. It's safe.)

**Download the app:** [https://ipalfish.i2mi.com/klian/web/dist/m/teacher/invite.html?uid=2226133&channel=30001&teacherregion=0](https://ipalfish.i2mi.com/klian/web/dist/m/teacher/invite.html?uid=2226133&channel=30001&teacherregion=0)

44,cwlknn,False,,470,A tip for the lurkers and commenters here: Go to /personalfinance if you want to be a judgmental prick about money and people‚Äôs problems instead of in a POVERTY sub.,povertyfinance,"Like what is wrong with some of these people?? The vast majority of people who use this sub is specifically because they are POOR/STRUGGLING. We post here for advice, tips, and support. We don‚Äôt post here so we can get X amount of comments from judgmental assholes who say over and over, ‚ÄúJust get a job‚Äù ‚Äúsounds like you‚Äôre the problem‚Äù ‚Äúget over it‚Äù ‚Äúthis is your fault‚Äù ‚Äúwork harder‚Äù ‚ÄúHow is this possible for you to be poor??‚Äù ‚ÄùJust move, I don‚Äôt see the issue.‚Äù


Let me tell you something, because I think I speak for most of us. I work beyond full time. I work side jobs in my free time, including on my lunch breaks everyday. My circumstances are *none* of your business, but my circumstances are still valid. Everyone‚Äôs are, especially if they‚Äôre making an effort to escape them. I was born into a very lower class family, my parents were from poor families. Most of us born into this are already off on the wrong foot. Poverty is a vicious cycle most of us are all fighting like hell to break and get out of. It takes time. It takes effort, which again, the vast majority of us are giving that full effort. We are **trying**, we really are, but living in/coming out of poverty is fucking *hard.* Not to mention that our society does not make escaping poverty easy. It costs money to move. It costs money to learn a trade, go to school, go to the doctor, get mental health help. While of course, it‚Äôs not impossible (we know this), so many people act like escaping poverty is a quick fix. This is untrue.

To add to that, there are different tiers to poverty. Some people are born into it, others fall on incredibly hard times, some people get fucked over by their families or loved ones (eg: taking loans out in our names, ruining credit, stealing our money, etc etc), some people are disabled, some people just make mistakes, learn from them, and are trying to pick up the pieces. And the sad fact is ~~some~~ many people, despite working hard which so many of you claim we don‚Äôt do, are only one or two paychecks away from poverty, just barely staying afloat, and doing all they can. It. Happens. Maybe not to you - and congratulations to you all - but it happens to people every single day. We are living it. It‚Äôs literally all around you.

We are still human. I‚Äôll repeat that: **we are still human.**

Some days, we just really need to vent. That‚Äôs all. It doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt trying. But working hard, trying to be strong, dealing with the stress, it all gets to you. That‚Äôs part of the whole ‚Äúbeing human‚Äù thing. It‚Äôs a heavy weight to carry. That‚Äôs what, in my opinion, this sub is for. Being able to relate and hear others out, and offer advice, it‚Äôs what helps people continue to push through when they feel like giving up, and makes the weight a liiiiiittle less heavy. 

You don‚Äôt get to call someone lazy, make general shitty judgments and overall rude assuming comments about how they got where they are nor why they‚Äôre where they are now, when the *only* thing you know about their lives is exactly what is posted here. 

So if you‚Äôre the type of person to judge and criticize those on this sub who seek out advice or just want to vent, maybe step away from the screens and take a good hard look at yourself. Reflect on your poor character and be better. Having some perspective will make life a little less miserable for you, and maybe you‚Äôll gain a little empathy. We may be struggling, but at least we treat others with respect. Because for a lot of us, who we are and our determination to live better lives despite any circumstances and the holier-than-thou ignorant bullshit around us is almost all we have. The last thing we need is to be kicked while we‚Äôre down. 

We won‚Äôt stand for it. I know I won‚Äôt. Not anymore.

Edit: and to those who have dealt with this and/or are just struggling right now, I hear you. I see you. You are more than your circumstance, and you‚Äôll get through this. Keep fighting the good fight and vent when you need to. Better days are coming!

And of course you will always have people who victimize, or just won‚Äôt help themselves or don‚Äôt take accountability (it still doesn‚Äôt justify insulting and degrading them, but I know there are people who need to recognize certain issues when they‚Äôre in their own way). But just speaking generally, being in a bad financial position doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt trying. Everyone is different, what works for some doesn‚Äôt work for others. Just...be freaking nice to people? Offer constructive advice?

If this is against any rules, please take down.

I started using the app called Mealime in September and it has changed my life. It is a free app, I get it through iOS. You pick meals that you're interested in making for the week and it creates a grocery list for you. Then when you are ready to cook it gives you step by step instructions. It also has an option for picking meals together that use up the same ingredients, so you aren't letting anything perishable go to waste. The meals are using mostly fresh produce and they have the option to change preferences based off of allergies and foods you dislike. 

Before mealime I would have a really hard time grocery shopping. I didn't know how to shop for meals. Instead I would just get random stuff that I thought maybe could feed me throughout the week. Usually this was sweet potatoes and frozen chicken breasts. I would end up not getting enough food and eat out, spending through my food budget, getting depressed, and not feeling healthy. 

Since using mealime, I'm gotten my food budget for the week down to a science. I have favorite meals that I will use consistently, and sometimes i'll feel spontaneous and try something new. The meals sizes you can choose are 2 servings to 6 servings. I'm a single person so I do the 2. Sometimes I will cook for both me and my boyfriend or I will take leftovers for lunch the next day to work. I've noticed how much healthier I've felt, I actually like what I'm eating, I'm enjoying cooking, and I've saved so much money because mealime is forcing me to plan out my meals throughout the week. Usually I'll chose 3 meals for the week, then get a couple things I can make quick on days I'm not super hungry/short on time (Potatoes, quick soups, rice).

Landlords in my town are notoriously scummy, so I would make it a habit to ""post-date"" my rent check for the first of the month to ensure it wouldn't be cashed before it was due. I thought this would work. I thought I was ""adulting.""

But I was wrong. A few years ago: two days before the first, I got an alert on my phone that my checking account had been overdrawn with a negative -$647.12 balance. Panicked, I checked my bank account only to find that my landlord has already cashed my rent check. ""That doesn't make sense,"" I told myself. ""There's no way he could have cashed it before the first. I wrote the first of the month on the check. Somethings wrong.""

So I called my bank's customer service number only to find out that my bank has honored the check and posted it to my account, overdrawing my account to the tune of a sweet $38 free. And trust me, back then, $38 was the difference between two weeks of cheap Top Ramen and two weeks of luxuriously baked spaghetti.

Contrary to popular belief, banks are under no legal obligation to the honor your request to postpone processing a check until the date written on a check. Even if you ""post-date"" a check for some date in the future, the payee can immediately cash the check upon receipt. Why? Once a check is signed, the check becomes legal tender and a bank can process the check at their discretion ‚Äì even if that includes disregarding a check's written date.

The bottom line: Never write a check you an amount you cannot cash when you sign your name. It is up to the individual recipient of the check to honor the date written on the check. While there is a long-standing tradition of post-dating checks, there is no legal requirements for banks or payees to honor your request to post payment to a later date.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/883cqz/lpt_never_postdate_rent_checks_to_your_landlord/,1163,I work at a bank.

I don‚Äôt think most people would consider the amount of money I received to be \*that\* much money. But it shook me a little.

Suddenly, with the snap of the government‚Äôs fingers, I was able to make a twelve year old debt disappear so I could get the piece of paper that proves I did in fact earn the bachelors degree I should have gotten when my now teenage son was a toddler.

Suddenly, I was able to repay two months‚Äô rent on an empty apartment to the predatory property management company Premier. A company who makes a fucking killing exploiting tax breaks for providing ‚Äúlow income housing‚Äù that is substandard and still far too expensive for many of its residents. A company that regularly overworks and undertrains it‚Äôs property managers so empty apartments sit open and they get to extract profit from the most vulnerable in our communities instead of paying their workers to do the job needed swiftly and fill the damn apartment.

Suddenly I had the back up I needed to look at my credit report and call about an unknown $644 medical debt. To call my health insurance and see if they could help bring that down. To navigate the fucking labyrinth of people I needed to tell my story to in order to get the basic fucking information about how this debt was created.

Guys. I am EXHAUSTED.

I know that it‚Äôs controversial to say that when Black and POC folks are being literally fucking trampled. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy. I will be ok. I just had to fucking write something just in case any of you find yourselves, like I did yesterday, just fucking drained after a day of phone calls that felt like whack-a-mole. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I felt like I‚Äôd just been put through the fucking wringer but I think I know now.

Doing the work to repair one‚Äôs credit can be painful and difficult. It can be so hard that it is re-traumatizing. Living in poverty is trauma. Dealing with institutions that systematically make you feel less than and actively separate you from the resources you need to survive and thrive is traumatic.

A LOT of people are struggling financially because of the pandemic, but some of us have suddenly gotten enough money to make a dent in what was previously a hopeless cause ‚Äî our financial well being. It was something so profoundly out of reach that we simply put it out of our minds. No amount of budgeting or sacrificing or side hustling was going to make the money we needed appear because that‚Äôs not how poverty works. You are so deep in the hole that getting out of the hole isnt even a coherent thought that makes sense. You‚Äôre just trying to keep the dirt from completely enveloping you. You‚Äôre just trying to keep breathing.

PLEASE ‚Äî my internet stranger friends who are doing the hard work of requesting your credit report, of calling these collection agencies, of remembering the circumstances around why you couldn‚Äôt pay, of re-living the shame around not having enough money to protect your future self from debt ‚Äî UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO KEEP POOR FOLKS DOWN ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN A LIFETIME OF MISTAKES ANY ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.

There is nothing wrong with YOU because you do not have enough money to provide for yourself, your family, and keep some aside for emergencies.

I of course understand that there are exceptions ‚Äî some people do squander their resources. But the vast majority of us poor folk try incredibly hard to live on an absolutely TINY amount of money. We sacrifice everything we can and then go deeper and sacrifice things we can‚Äôt. We have learned to put a wall between our own sweet, vulnerable selves and the SHAME of not being able to pay an important bill. We forget about it because we HAVE TO. We throw away the multi-colored 2nd and 3rd and 4th notices because we have NO OTHER CHOICE. We hang up on bill collectors because we literally do not have $10/month with which to bargain.

If you find yourself suddenly in a position to do the hard work of paying these companies that have fucked you over, or overcharged you, or that you don‚Äôt even fucking remember why you owe them money any more, and you find yourself overwhelmed, or anxious or confused and you can‚Äôt quite understand why you‚Äôre having such a large reaction to ‚Äújust‚Äù paying a bill... I beg you, be gentle with yourself. Being poor is scary. It is stressful and painful and difficult. You are strong and brave and WORTHY of having ENOUGH.

We are not here on this planet to feel BAD about circumstances beyond our control. Pay those debts, and hold yourself gently while you do it. Take a day off between debts. Allow yourself time to decompress and grieve for an economic and legal structure that incentivizes those with money and penalizes those without. You didn‚Äôt create it and it‚Äôs not your fault that you are at its mercy. I see you. I‚Äôm here. If you need support, please reach out. You are more than your fucking credit score.

I get that you're frustrated and have some real problems, but there are no structures in place keeping poor people down. none. 

if there were structures in place keeping poor people down, then Oprah Winfrey would still be living in poverty in Mississippi and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz would still be living in subsidized housing in Brooklyn and George Soros would still be living broke in Hungary after the Nazis destroyed his nation and Peter Lynch, one of the most successful investors in history, would still be living poor in Boston where the family barely scraped by after his father's death. 

only about 4% of Americans stay in the bottom 20% of earners for their entire adult lives. a majority of Americans are in the bottom 20% and the top 20%, only at different times in their lives. See Economic Facts and Fallacies by Thomas Sowell, a black economist. Over half of Americans are in the top 10% by income at some point in their lives, see Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Immigrants to America, who often face major language and cultural barriers, are about 4x more likely to become millionaires than native-born Americans.

I found a better job, closer to home, with better pay.  I have also chosen to ride my bike to work a LOT (about 8 miles one-way), but it's getting incredibly cold/windy/rainy where I live so I might take a few months off of that!!

I paid off one of my 4 credit cards (it was only a $300 limit but a start) and a $175 collection. I have started to build an emergency fund. I've set aside a modest amount for Christmas. I am finally seeing some light. 65K is going to be one hell if a mountain to tackle but I want financial freedom more than anything. My mental health needs this. My goal is to build a $1500 emergency fund and pay off all credit cards by March 2020. That alone will save me hundreds of dollars a month in credit card payments that I can put toward my car, personal loan, and eventually my student loans. 

I refuse to follow my parents footsteps. I will take care of my mental health. I have this amazing career and I will not let it go to waste. Who ever said money can't buy happiness has never been poor. I dont need money to buy me expensive things I need financial security. I need to be able to buy food, pay my gas bill, pay for my health insurance and afford the copays and deductibles. I dont have any late bills this month and it feels so fucking great.

I know it may not be a deal for many (why I‚Äôm subbed here) but it was a FOUR FIGURE NUMBER.

Edit 2: didn‚Äôt even mention sorry! Through friends of friends I heard about a certification class for security work. After putting my hat into the ring for consideration, about 6 weeks later I was asked to pick up a shift. Within a month I was certified with all the bells and whistles they required (proper ID, background check,  fingerprinting, educational course) and got trained. They liked me and kept me on, they were short handed at the time so I was able to prove myself over those first few weeks just working weekends while trying to figure out how to keep working at the job I had.   It was pet retail with a revolving door of terrible managers, and closing in on the holidays, so they wanted to push me around and say I wouldn‚Äôt get hours if I wasn‚Äôt available for the days I needed off for the new job.  I pretty much called their bluff, and they gave me crappy hours to just be on register.  I had been working for the company for years was certified to work with the animals themself (cleaning cages to giving medicine) but they constantly put me as cashier because I was more efficient and my customer service, I‚Äôll brag, is above par.  So I just waited, biding my time until I got the full time offer at the new job, and then gave my two weeks. They were floored, panicked even? When the two weeks were almost up, my store manager told me the team didn‚Äôt want me to leave and asked if I was interested in picking up hours when I could. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know‚Äù I said as earnestly as I could, catching a little bit of feels despite myself at my team speaking up for me.

And I'm not talking about being a millionaire or even making 100k a year. My life would be completely different if I just made like 50k a year.  I could afford to buy a car.

538,9oiy1f,False,,114,So for the last ten years I've been learning to get by with basically no financial literacy. Because of that i want to make a Poverty Finance Guide with the things I've been learning,povertyfinance,"Hey yall- I've been learning for the past few years that a big part of why I had so many troubles saving and budgeting were because i had little to no financial literacy. I didn't know much about bank accounts, savings, loans, student loans, making a budget, ect. 

&#x200B;

I started dating this amazing woman who didn't grow up poor, and i was astonished to find that a huge difference between our saving and spending habits came from the fact that she was taught about finances at an early age. Where i spend money on food because i get scared ill go hungry she buys what she needs and saves. Where i cant always see how spending 5$here and 110 $ there is bad she counts every dollar, and as such can really save. 

&#x200B;

This kind of inspired me- i started learning about different financial terminology, the basics of budgeting adn saving, and other stuff- the truth is that i learned SO MUCH. I'm still not in the best place financially. I have no savings- I am only starting to pay off debt, but in the end even the small steps im taking is making a huge difference.  so in the spirit of this i want to share what i've learned because maybe itll help someone.

# Banking 101

Ok so, banks may seem like the most basic thing ever- but the truth is for a long time i didnt even want a bank account, it seemed like a useless way to store money that i needed and way gonna use. Plus overdraft fees terrified me. Turns out I was holding myself back quite a bit.

&#x200B;

Important definitions: 

* **Bank:** a financial establishment that invests money deposited by customers, pays it out when required, makes loans at interest, and exchanges currency.
* **Credit union: t**ype of¬†financial co-operative.  They're nonprofit-making money cooperative whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates.
* **FDIC:** The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (**FDIC**) is an independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures. They insure that in the event of a bank failing you get some of your money insured.
* **Annual Percentage Yield** ‚Äì APY is the amount of interest you‚Äôll get on the money you have deposited in your bank account each year. It‚Äôs the amount the bank pays you for keeping funds in their account. used for savings accounts.
* **Deposit:** The cash you put into a bank account, the bank holds this money for you and either holds it or invests it.
* **Balance:**  How much money is in your account
* **Available Balance:** How much money you actually have access to
* **Overdraft**: When you take too much money out of an account and your balance is negative. Banks sometimes have fees for this

SO with all that out of the way...

# Why have a bank account? 

The truth is in today's market you don't always need one. Before when i didn't have one i would cash my cheques directly for about 3$. The teller at the store knew me, and sometimes would let me get an extra 10 or 20$ in advance, knowing that id have a cheque for her later.  As i started earning more though I also realized a few things: 

* Building a credit history:  people need to know you, wanna get an apartment?  need credit. wanna get a cerd? a loan? anything? credit.
* Banks keep money safe: its not safe to carry around 100s of dollars. This seems obvious but the anxiety i felt coming home with cash in my bag was ridiculous. Not only that my apartment got broken into and my computer stolen- what if they'd found my cash too? 
* Its actually more convenient:  Wanna buy shit online? done. Wanna use plastic for everything? done. wanna do literally anything that requires a card? done. 
* You can save:  So eventually the hope is that youre making more money than youre spending. Its used to be that if that happened i would just spend that too. But no- a savings account actually allows you to keep that money away, safe, where you need it for emergencies or whatever. 

Ok so all of that probably seemed really obvious. It wasnt for me and maybe i'm a dumbass, I get that. So finally lets talk about...

# Opening an account

&#x200B;

First- Bank or Co-op?

Big banks have the advantage of convenience and the ability to be everywhere, that said Co-ops tend to be more family friendly, you get to know the community, are much more personal, and usually have better loans. Honestly here its all about preference. I have an account with a local Co-op, which gives me access to a lot of great  offers- but i also have a bank account with a big bank. The big bank u use for checking, the co-op for savings. It works for me. Look at what you have nearby and what they require and choose what fits you best. 

Second you need to choose what type of account, for the sake of this guide we'll talk about checking and savings. 

|Checking account|Savings account|
|:-|:-|
|Used to store money, pay bills, get a card, write cheques|Used to store money long term, save money, build an emergency fund|

So once youve identified what kind of account youll be getting you need to figure out where you want to open one- so what should we be looking for? 

&#x200B;

Checking:

* Look for accounts that have no monthly fees. You dont want to lose money by paying a fee every month jsut to store money in the account. 
* No overdraft fees. Right now theres a wide enough selection that you can get an account with no overdraft fees- protecting you from the RIDICULOUS fees that can come with an overdraft. 
* Good online presence. The truth is nowadays having a convenient way to look at your accounts wherever is super amazing and useful.  Even my tiny co-op has an app.

Savings: 

* Look for higher interest/APY the higher the more they pay you for keeping your money in there
* Look for accounts with no monthly fees. Seriously, youre already giving them your money dont let them keep it. 
* Mobile deposits. For those of us who get paper cheques its nice to just snap a pic. 
* No transfer fees. Most of the time you open a checking and savings account together- you can only transfer money out of a savings account a certain amount of times a month before they start charging you, this is due to federal regulatory stuff- keep an eye on it. 

So now youve found some account you like with banks you think are ok- whats next? 

&#x200B;

To open an account you need a minimum deposit- this varies depending on your bank. Some require just 1.50$ others 25$, others 50$ I suggest writing whatever your deposit is as money lost and ALWAYS keep that minimum there. That said i can never do that, but hey- dont be like me, be better than me. 

&#x200B;

So what now? 

&#x200B;

Thats it, thats this guide. Note that there are many other checking accounts, savings accounts, money market, IRA, and a bunch of other bullshit. The truth is that when your poor that shit is out of our league. just having a good checking and savings account is a huge step for a lot of us- so with this guide i wanted to start there. 

&#x200B;

On Sunday, I went to Aldi and bought $100 worth of groceries to hopefully last me for 2 weeks. 

Sunday night, I made a take and bake pizza from Aldi (I didn't really like it. The crust was kind of doughy and the sauce was too sweet for my liking but considering my roommate caught our oven on fire last week, the doughy crust might be a result of that.)

Monday, I just ate leftover pizza before one of my final exams. Even though I didn't like it, I didn't want to waste food.

Tuesday, I made a simple oven bake Campbell's skillet meal type thing. It was literally two chicken breasts, one potato cut in half and I poured the sauce over it. Baked in the oven at 400 degrees for 50 minutes and it was delicious. It was perfect considering I had 2 final exams on Tuesday. 

Wednesday, I had my last final exam. I utilized my crock pot and made a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. Cooked on high for 6 hours. 

Thursday, had leftover pot roast. Was even better the day after.

And Friday, I made cheesy chicken and rice. Utilized the crock pot again. I have enough leftovers to last me the entire weekend. 


I'm really proud of myself again for not buying fast food. Especially with it being finals week and the end of my school's semester. My roommate isn't paying her share of the utilities (sigh. Cannot wait for March) and while that's stressing me out big time, I didn't give into temptation of buying out as ""treat"". I'm able to pay the utility bills in full this month since my roommate is being a a-hole and refusing to pay her share.

269,cvy12h,False,,240,Dodged the Generational Poverty Trap Today,povertyfinance,"I'm a big student of generational poverty behaviors in my own quest to educate  myself to be more sustainable, but also to share with the low-income people I work with.

So today my sister texts me and says she needs $400 to pay her power bill.

I look at my bank account in my usual knee jerk reaction to her crises and I just paid for my car registration and it had tanked me to just having my rent and bills in the account for the end of the month with only 1/2 a paycheck coming from my new job and I have no idea how much it will be after taxes.  I also have money I can't withdraw in my savings w/o a penalty (which I should've never told ANYONE in my family about.)

I think and think because I don't want her kids to go without power since she is so behind.  So I offer to pay her bill on a credit card I basically have thrown in a box in the back of the garage for emergencies only if she promises to pay me back by the end of Sept.

She says ""oh, no..I'll just get a payday loan!""

So I am ""No, that is terrible, let me pay for it! The payday loan people will take 25% of your check at least! Just give me the info and I'll go online and pay..""

""Its ok...I'll call you if it doesn't work out.""

So...

**She really didn't have a bill to pay - she just wanted me to hand her a stack of cash and let her ""pay"" it.**

I hope other people can sympathize.  I fall prey to my family wanting money pretty easily, but an old mentor told me once, which I should've remembered, ""always pay the bill, never hand over the cash.""

He said he learned this because he used to do it and he'd see his sister or cousin walking around with a new Coach purse or a new TV.  And that is the epitome of generational poverty thinking - soothe the pain and lack of resources by impulse buys and entertainment, vs saving up and using windfalls to take care of things like utilities, doctors, dentists, and so forth.

Because family thinks you owe them..and maybe in some ways we do - but I can't subsidize her knowing she's not going to use it help her kids.

*\[Update\] I love to see people talking about this and sharing our experiences.  The worst think about having a trauma in our lives is the feeling we have to hide it or the people in our lives just won't understand.  When I work with new groups of teens this is the most powerful activity we do - to share our collective experiences and realize we aren't alone.*

*So my big ""confession"" here is that up until I was about 28, I used to panic and ask family members for money.  I'm not saying all the time, but I certainly didn't have a credit card (because my mother told me they were evil) so I didn't have credit.  I lived off my social abilities and whatever I needed, from housing to food I got from real people.*

*Earlier in my 20s, I would steal or take things just ""laying around"" because I ""needed"" them and people weren't using them so it was a waste.  I lied whenever anyone confronted me.*   
 *I lied a lot because I didn't think who I was was interesting enough and when it was discovered I either exaggerated or I had ""borrowed"" something.  And I took advantage of every low-income program I could (as I was taught.)  It got me through college, I have considerable loans I am working on public forgiveness for, and I was able to survive.   And for awhile, as low-income students do, I was on food stamps. I also dumpster dived a good deal and went to the Food Bank for food once a month.  Then I cut out the middle-man and opened a food bank at my college.*

*BUT when I finished my MA I impulsively moved in with my ex and we ran off to Vancouver, CA - I had a breaking point.  I am not sure what did it (it might've been I found out the 5k I sent to pay back my Mom for a car repair was pocketed by my Dad. For three years she was mad I didn't pay her back!!! I'm still angry as hell at him.)*

*I realized when I had been begging my parents for money since we couldn't cover the bills and suddenly I was like NO MORE.  NO MORE asking for money! I AM AN ADULT! I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS!!!!!! So since that day I've never asked my parent, a friend, or anyone for money and I've prospered to some degree.  Even when I had to live on two cans of ravioli and a pack of Dollar General cookies - I kept it together, paid my bills, went to work, and pushed hard to work my way up the ladder. I still have problems - but I've been pushing myself to act like a middle-class person and be more aggressive about my self-interest and my rights.  I was taught to be passive, slip behind the scenes, and fade into the background; when I really was a performer and a fighter.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/cvy12h/dodged_the_generational_poverty_trap_today/,3655,[removed] ,2019-08-27 02:20:51

I had an ok job at an app, got offered a higher paying, closer to my home and way more fun and up my alley job at a theatre company, which I took, and then (after only 6 days, two of which were seeing plays) they let me go a week before Christmas, because ""it wasn't a good fit"".

I can start rebuilding my credit. I can afford to move somewhere close by that's not falling apart. I'm planning a wedding, and I can afford to save for that.

I'm so proud of myself. 2.5 years ago I was homeless and going through the DTs and drug withdrawal in a jail cell. I went to rehab. I got and stayed clean and sober.

591,av9q4m,False,,183,[Poverty Recipe] Endless Bread for under $4,povertyfinance,"I've seen a few posts here and there about ""I have paid all my bills, I have $28 in my checking account, how do I make it last until I get paid in two weeks?"" and this post is an attempt to give you at least one option.

'Biga' is Italian starter dough. In ancient times, Italian artisan bakers didn't have instant yeast like we do today, so they would save a small portion of the dough used each day, and use it as the starter dough the next day. 

You can make biga and keep it on your counter or in your fridge, and it will allow you to continue to make bread forever as long as you continue to 'feed' it, hence the title *endless bread*.

You primary ingredients for biga are all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and warm water.

I use Gold Medal all-purpose flour, which costs $1.98 at my local Walmart for a five lb bag. You can find store brands much cheaper than that, even as low as $.99, but I like GM flour. What brand you use is immaterial, use your favorite brand or a cheap store brand near you, they all work. 
 
Fleischmann's  Active Dry Yeast sells for $1.39 for three packets at Target near me, some places sell one packet for $.99 or less, you only need one packet for our recipe here. If you like to bake and want to get three packets, go ahead and spend the $1.39, but we only need one packet for this recipe.

So, we've spent $1.98 on a 5 lb bag of flour and $1.39 on three packets of active dry yeast, so we've spent $3.37, under our $4 limit. 

Making the biga is simple. 

Open the bag of flour, measure out three cups of flour, and pour into a large mixing bowl. Take the packet of yeast, measure out 1/2 a teaspoon, and sprinkle it over the flour. (I've seen estimates that each packet contains 2.25 teaspoons of yeast, but just measure out 1/2 a teaspoon. This is why we only need one packet of active dry yeast.) If you don't have something to measure half a teaspoon, a tablespoon equals three teaspoons, so 1/6 of a tablespoon is 1/2 a teaspoon. If you end up putting in 1/3 of a tablespoon, or one full teaspoon, don't sweat it. You only need 1/2 a teaspoon to make the biga, but it's not going to be an issue if you use a little more in the recipe. 

Take a wooden spoon (recommended, but any spoon will do, even plastic ones), and stir your flour and dried yeast for 10-20 seconds, just mix them up a little. 

Now pour in 1 3/4 cups of warm water. You do not want hot water, it will kill the yeast. Warm water. Measure temp with your fingers. Think baby bathwater warm. Lukewarm is also fine. 

Stir all of the flour, yeast, and water together for approximately four minutes. You want to incorporate all of the flour and yeast into the water. When all of the water and flour is incorporated, it will make a soupy wet consistency. 

Cover the top of the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 8-24 hours. You will see the biga bubble as the yeast feeds on the flour and begin to rise and fall over the 8-24 hours, this is normal. You can use the biga after 8 hours, but the longer you wait, the more character and flavor develops, so waiting 24 hours is best. 

After 24 hours, you have your starter dough. 

If you don't want to refrigerate your biga, you can keep it at room temperature and use it to make bread every day for the next two weeks, just make sure you leave save some of the biga to act as your starter for the next day. If you refrigerate your biga, you can use it to make bread once a week, and keep it for perpetuity as long as you keep 'feeding' it after every use, hence *endless bread*. 

When 'feeding' biga, you replace what you take. So if I take one cup of biga to use as my starter in a recipe, I replace it with half a cup of water and half a cup of flour. You pour the water and flour into the bowl with the remaining biga, give it a good mix to incorporate it, and voila, your feeding is done. You don't **have** to replace at a 1:1 ratio, I just find that it is the one that works best for me. 

I currently have a bowl of biga in my fridge that is still going strong into its third week. I know of a case where a famous pizzaiolo in California and NY had his biga for going over seven months when he was interviewed for an article several years ago. As time goes on, the new flour entered in with the feeding continues to grow and feed on itself, and you essentially replace all of the original biga. You have basically created a living organism that provides you endless food just by feeding it every day or once a week. 

You can use the biga to make you basic Italian bread, make pizza dough, make rolls. I have used it to make Italian bread, pizza dough, sandwich rolls, and bread sticks these past two weeks.

**Basic Italian bread recipe**

One cup of biga     
3 cups of all purpose flour     
1 teaspoon of salt              
1-1.25 cups of warm water                    
1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking oil                     
    
Take your one cup of biga, and put it into a bowl. Pour half of the warm water into the bowl, let slowly massage the biga in the water with your hand, letting is saturate. Pour in three cups of flour, one at a time, mixing it into the water and biga with a spoon or with your hands. Pour in the teaspoon of salt. Mix it until all the flour is incorporated and you begin to get a shaggy dough. If you're doing it with your hands, this will take one to two minutes of mixing. If you're using an electric mixer, this will take about one minute for the dough to form. 

After the dough has formed, shape it into a ball, and leave it in the bowl for 20 minute. Set a timer, and walk away. After the 20 minutes has passed, spend 30 seconds to one minute kneading the dough with your hands into a soft, supple ball. The dough should shape easily into a smooth, satiny ball. 
     
Top the dough ball with one tablespoon of olive oil or cooking oil, put it in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise until doubled in size. It may take up to 3 hours, that's fine, let it take as long as it needs, if your kitchen is warm, it may rise faster. 

After it has doubled in sized, remove the plastic wrap, punch it down, and take it out of the bowl. Roll it into a ball again, and cut the ball in half. You easily have enough dough for two loaves of bread.      
      
Using your hands, shape the dough into two elongated strips, almost like you're shaping sub bread.    
    
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. If you don't have parchment paper, lightly flour the bottom of the tray so the dough doesn't stick. Put the two dough loaves on the baking tray, and let rise for a second time for one hour.    
   
At the 45 minute mark, preheat your oven to 450 degrees. 
       
After the second rise, the dough will flatten a little and spread out. Put the tray in the oven, and bake at 450 for 30 minutes, or until the crust turns a nice golden brown color. If you think it is done before 30 minutes, remove from the oven, and tap the bottom of the loaf. If it is done, it will sound hollow. 
    
Let cool for 15 minutes, and then slice and eat. It tastes great by itself, but even better with butter or cream cheese. You make this right, you will never need to buy garlic bread or fresh bread from a bakery again.

It's not glamorous and I'm not too happy about the mark on my arm, but it has kept my family fed and able to continue going to work/school. 

Many plasma centers have onsite daycare during at least part of their open hours (I know BioLife does at most locations), and donations typically range from 45 minutes to an hour (second donation onward - the first donation is long because of physicals, questionnaires, getting your profile set up, etc). 

Plasma donation definitely isn't for everyone, and it certainly hasn't boosted me out of poverty, but it helps me feel more secure knowing that even when my bank account is low, I can net $70 a week for groceries and gas. It's also nice to spend an hour just reading browsing the internet, or playing a game. 


Some tips:

-Drink a lot of water the night before. The donation will go faster, and you'll feel much better.

-Don't eat a huge, fatty meal beforehand. It can stop your donation if your plasma looks too milk-like (excessive fat), and you won't be compensated.

-That being said, do eat a meal with protein an hour or two prior to donation. Your blood protein, iron content, and blood pressure are taken prior to every donation. If your iron or protein is too low or high, you'll be deferred for a day.

-Take advantage of promotions and coupons. Plasma centers often run frequency bonuses each month, and first time donors usually have coupon codes available that will exponentially increase your first month's payout.

-Evenings, weekends, and lunch time will always be peak plasma center traffic hours. There's not much way around this if you work a typical day shift, unfortunately. 

-Recommend plasma donation to people; most places have referral bonuses. Offer to split the bonus if it helps get someone in the door, if you want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8z25qe/selling_plasma_probably_wont_pay_your_bills_but/,1299,"I'm not going to upvote this because I'd rather see people get gig jobs than sell plasma.

They often aren‚Äôt shy about how they need money and might not be in the best place at the time. 

What shocks me is when they aren‚Äôt able to take a shift I‚Äôll hear chatter about how ‚Äúthey must not actually need money that much‚Äù or ‚Äúthey have their nails done/are drinking Starbucks/etc. so obviously their financial situation isn‚Äôt that bad.‚Äù

What people don‚Äôt always realize is maybe this person hasn‚Äôt had a weekend day off in months. Maybe this person has a significant milestone that day. Maybe this person was given a Starbucks gift card and couldn‚Äôt sell it. Maybe their nails are always done because that‚Äôs the once a month get together they have with their mom and she pays for it. 

I get where the skepticism comes from but it‚Äôs always important to remember things aren‚Äôt what they seem, and people deserve to have days reserved to be off no matter what their financial situation is.

I started following this sub when i first heard about it and skimmed occasionally. Then one day i saw a comment. OP said (and im paraphrasing) it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you save as long as you save. If all you have this week to contribute is 1$. Then add that dollar. So i said okay okay okay, i went down to the local bank, and opened a savings account and threw the required $25 opening requirement in and never thought about it again. 

So a week goes by and I go to cash my check. And the teller informs me that I had a minus but it was covered by the money in my savings. How much did I over draft by? $24.00 EXACTLY to the cent.  

I never even caught the fucking charge! I never saw it because i never checked my statements. I would have been sitting on an over draft fee of $45. 

It was at that moment that *i got it*. I realized money is no joke, swiping my card loosely without regard or respect is a dangerous game that i don‚Äôt want to play.

251,9qf37o,False,,460,I just wanted to let you guys know about an opportunity.,povertyfinance,"Did you know there's an electrician shortage? Did you know you don't have to pay to become one? (Well. You'll have to pay for books and tools but hey) That you can actually get paid more than minimum wage to work and learn on the job as an apprentice? The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Commitee, or JATC, have an office in just about every major city you can think of. They'll start you off at 50% of a journeyman's pay in your area to work and learn on the job, and you'll get a raise about every 6 months if you're consistent! In my town the JATC would start me at $9.85, and as far as I know that's actually a little! My cousin lives in OKC, the apprenticeship there starts at $15.90!! keep in mind this is a 5 year commitment, it is a career after all. But after those 5 years you have a career. You'll have a long lasting trade that won't go anywhere for a very long time. I'm always reading people being recommended to become a welder, or trucker and that they make killings. Although I agree they make way more money than I do, look it up, those guys are on their way out. their jobs are gonna be automated sooner rather than later. I'd hate for you to take a year or 2 to become a trucker just to lose your job in the next decade. But electricians and plumbers are looking like they're gonna be the last trades to be automated. since electricians get paid a hair more than plumbers, maybe try checking out the JATC in your area and see how much apprentices start at? Your only requirements are a diploma or GED and proof that you passed Algebra with a C or higher in your high school transcripts. If you didn't pass algebra, there's a cute little Algebra test they supply you with to get get that credit. I see people here struggling with minimum wage, or people here who can't afford school. I'm here to tell you guys that I'm in that same boat. And I just found out there's a *demand* for apprentices, meaning they're just begging us to consider it. Tests are every 6 months so if you hurry you might make it to take the January test an start by early 2019. Stay safe guys :) 


Edit: just wanted to give you guys some info off the bat I found was important to know. The first few years are most expensive bc that's when you're buying the most books + all your tools. So expect some money to be needed for that. Also the reports that say you'll be a journeyman in 5 years and the actual requirements to take the journeyman test make it out to be 30 hours of supervised work and 5 hours of classroom schooling a week for 5 years. Depending on whether or not they'll allow you to work overtime this means you can either amp up apprentice work to progress through those 5 years faster or pick up another job to supplement book and tool fees as you wait for those first few raises to kick in.

I basically had a breakdown and realized that the next 3 years of my income were a wash, and my plans to build a savings were over.

I‚Äôve been calling Blue Cross, the hospital billing departments, over and over for 3 months. I had to comb over the Explanation of Benefits and coding on each charge.

I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out. I have been more stressed and anxious about this than anything else in my life. I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.

I feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.

First, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind.¬†

I've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.

When I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...

This has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight.¬†I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it.¬†


I am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please.¬†

To help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.

**Current Funds**:

*Checking Account* - $4117.29 (The base of this is remaining from the student loans dispersed to me in August. I've got ~$350-400 coming in every two weeks, after taxes, from the two part- time jobs I am working. But it‚Äôs never a set amount.)

692,br8zhl,False,,86,Just notified of layoffs. Glad I had started saving for an Emergency Fund,povertyfinance,"After a couple years of being chronically underemployed (lived in a van for part of it) I got a new job with ok pay and quite a bit of available overtime. I've been taking advantage of the overtime and got caught up in all my bills. Then I saved up $1,000 for an emergency fund a l√† Dave Ramsey.

After that I've been putting anything extra into paying off credit cards (first one was 29%!). 

About a month ago I had a dream. It's a common stress dream, so normally, I wouldn't think too much of it. I'm not into astrology, or dream interpretations, horoscopes, etc. I don't look at dreams real closely for ""interpretations"" etc. But this one was just really unsettling to me, and I distinctly felt that I needed to stop paying down debt and start saving instead. 

So for the past month I've been socking away the OT money.

Today I found out my company's contract is getting bought out by another company. 

There's a pretty high chance I will be rolled over into the new company, but I can't tell you how nice it feels to know I have at least a full months expenses taken care of. Even if I take a position elsewhere in the company, I'd have to relocate, and it's nice to know I have enough to at least get me a deposit + first month rent in a new place.

I'm gonna be ok, one way or another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/br8zhl/just_notified_of_layoffs_glad_i_had_started/,1573,"Not paying down credit card debt to save money for an emergency fund is like having a fire truck roll up to a fire and deciding not to put the fire out because they‚Äôre worried there might be a second fire and they want to save water for that.

966,g9n1pi,False,Budgeting/Saving/Investing/Spending,58,What helped me save more money,povertyfinance,"One thing that mentally made me save more money was to open two savings accounts (I was fortunate enough to have enough to put in both to avoid fees). But I noticed that having two savings accounts forced me to match what I put in every week. I‚Äôd make it a challenge to put $25 in both instead of just my normal $25 in one. Now, almost a year later both have grown to $3,000 each and it really feels great",https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/g9n1pi/what_helped_me_save_more_money/,784,"Bravo. Smart choice and really aligned with what a lot of big thinkers in this space (Nobel prize winners) have recommended - ""automatic defaults."" Good job and keep going!

Now, here's some thoughts on how to think about the future value of your savings.

Remember the rule of 72 to give you some motivation to save. Divide 72 by any Interest/Growth Rate and that's the amount of time it takes for your principal do double.

So, taking this, let's say you can get 7-10% (over the long term) in the stock market by picking an index fund and setting and forgetting it. This has generally been the case in the stock market over the last 100 years. If you divide 72 by 10% and divide 72 by 7% you get that your money will double somewhere between 7.2 - 10.2 (call it 7-10) years. So, $1,000 saved today is worth $2,000 in 7-10 years, $20,000 becomes $40,000, etc.

Here's where this math becomes powerful and can really help you see the potential of your future and help reduce your anxiety about money.

If you are 22 and you are to retire at 67 (the retirement age in the United States), you have essentially 45 years before you retire. If you take the number of years it takes your money to double (7 - 10) and divide it into your 45 years earning window, it essentially means you have between 45/10 (4.5) and 45/7 (6.4) ""doubles"" left.

So what? well, doubling (and compounding) math means essentially you take the base 2 and raise it to power.

So,

20 = 1, 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, 24 = 16, 25 = 32, 26 = 64

So, not counting the effect of taxes + inflation, every $1 you save today that you invest in a reasonable index fund (not any single stock) that tracks the broader stock market is worth $16 to $64 to you in retirement. Making it simple, take the 5 doubles. Every $1 you save today is worth $32 to you at the start of retirement! Then, as long as you don't take it out, your money will also continue to grow during retirement. Though, you'll want to dial down your risk as you get closer. But that's 40+ years away for someone like you.

And beware that the rule of 72 works the other way too. Get in credit card debt and divide 72 by your credit card APR and that's - generally - the number of years for your debt to double if you make minimum payments.

Good luck and keep at it! ",2020-04-28 13:20:03

756,abtyq5,False,,107,We finally own a microwave!,povertyfinance,"Let me start off by saying that 2018 was actually a decent year for my fiance and I. We got engaged, I got a job that suits my mental needs more than anything I've ever had, and he got a job that doesn't make him miserable or cause his bad leg (which has steel plates in it) to act up.

But one of our favorite moments of 2018, besides the engagement, was in the final days of the year...WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD A MICROWAVE!! We were using the one his sister had when she was living with us for a short time, but someone broke in to our trailer and stole it. They left behind the Keurig that I've had forever, the tv and Roku that were given to us, and the PS2 that I've had since middle/high school but stole the microwave.

We've been trying to get back on our feet as quickly as possible and because of that, we've never been able to replace the missing ""piece"" of our kitchen and trying to heat leftovers felt like a hassle. But due to some fortunate events, he told me to pick one up the other day when we were at Walmart getting groceries.

I guess there's really no point to this story, but I just wanted to share that little bit of success with you guys!
