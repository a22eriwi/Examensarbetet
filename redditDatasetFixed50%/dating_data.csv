Giving away too much in your description can do as much harm as it can good because it takes away from any mystery towards you which can suck out the fun of what dating actually is, GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. 

Personally I think you should get off your high horse, online dating IS superficial whether you like it or not and I can guarantee every single persons first judgement is based on your pictures, regardless of what your profile says on it. That's just how human psychology is.

924,bo8roj,False,Venting,49,Be cautious ladies and gentlemen.,dating,"I recently (Friday night) met a cute female at a bar.  We talked for a while, exchanged phone numbers and I went home and called it a night.

Proceeded to hear from her the next day (unexpected, drunken night at a bar doesnt usually work out)  and we decide to hang out.   All is great.  Learned that she seems to have her life together, drives a nice little range rover, makes her own money.

Saturday went well and she proceeded to ask me to hang out with a couple of her friends at one of the more expensive places in my area.  It's right on the beach.  I wasn't hungry but decided to go hang out with her and meet some friends.  

She ordered a double margarita (34 dollars) and steak and shrimp (38 dollars)  while I just drink my water.

810,be755v,False,,71,We’re exclusive now!,dating,"I’ve (25F) been seeing this guy (37M) since August/September. We never discussed what we were looking for and what our intentions were so boundaries were not created. He was dating other people which lead me to date other people and it was just very stressful because I did want more.
Over the past month a lot things have happened that made me feel confident he felt the same way too. I originally planned this whole speech to give about the situation and call him out for seeing other people blah blah blah. But knowing me I need as few words as possible to get my point across (because my nerves get the best of me and I end up forgetting what I wanted to say). 
So instead I planned on asking him “what do you think about us being exclusive?” because to me that hits all the points I wanted to bring up. It acknowledges the fact we’ve been seeing other people and it indirectly says I have feelings for him and eventually would like a relationship. I went with that.
It was this past Monday morning and we were on the subway. He was going to work and I was heading to the train station to go home. Doing it in a public place isn’t great but it made me more comfortable for some reason. We’re sitting there and I know I have to do it now. “Can I get your opinion on something?” I ask. He says of course. Then I ask him. And oh my god the look on his face. I have never seen him look so nervous/scared. The only thing he says is “well this came out of nowhere”. I told him I apologize for that but there’s no textbook way to really bring this up. We sit in silence for a few more seconds. I can tell the gears are turning in his head. I tell him to be honest with me, and that if he needs to think about it that’s fine. But then he says “okay, yea let’s do it”. It felt like fireworks were going off in my heart but I remained calm on the outside and just smiled. I think I asked him “are you sure?” about five times haha. He said yes and then kissed me. I could tell he was pretty happy.

I still can’t believe it worked out. I’m feeling so relieved and honestly 100 lbs lighter now that all the stress/anxiety is gone. I’m trusting him and the fact that he knows what this is.

He pinged my DM while I was out of town last month telling me he hadn't seen me in a while and asking if I wanted to catch up sometime. So when I got back, I asked him out to lunch (I'd previously thought he was cute). We ended up having to reschedule to Friday dinner last week, and it was fun - we even went for a few drinks afterwards and I liked a lot of things I learned about him. Unfortunately, he didn't text me much afterwards. Then I got an invite to a Halloween event and was told to bring a date. I pulled together my nerves and asked him if he was free this Saturday night. He said he was free, so I asked if he wanted to my plus one to this thing. He responded saying he had just confirmed on other plans. Ah. Last minute alternative plans. His gentle way of saying no, because let's be real - if someone likes you, they'll prioritize you. To be honest, it stings and my pride took a beating because I was so accustomed to always being the one asked out. But I honestly have no regrets. This was my first time ever asking a guy out. Ultimately it didn't end up great, but I finally understood how it felt to go after someone you wanted versus debating on whether you were attracted enough to someone that wanted you. And it actually didn't feel too bad.

Moral of story: Girls, if you've thought about asking a guy out first but never given it a shot, give it a shot. I won't lie, it's not completely painless. But it gives you a new perspective on how tough it is for a guy when they ask you out and get rejected, you learn to appreciate more the guys that do gather up the guts to ask you out, and it's also really refreshing to actually try going after someone you want.

I've been reading all the comments and I've noticed there are a few comments that suggest that I might be jumping to things in regard to his response. I'll respond to some of those comments below, but for the record I still do think that it was a rejection -  if it wasn't, hopefully this will show some of you guys the variety of answers that a girl will take as a rejection and prevent you from rejecting a girl if you don't mean to!

516,a2s7zi,False,Giving Advice,87,"Reminder: male or female, your lack of success on a dating app is most likely not your fault and in no way a fair reflection of you (or how I deleted my apps and started loving myself and felt happier)",dating,"You don't need me to tell you about the woes many people, regardless of gender and orientation, deal with on dating apps. Feeling like they're not good looking enough, like they're not interesting enough, not tall enough or make enough money, etc. Let me tell you, I've been there so many times before. I've been on and off dating apps over the past several years, all at different times in my life , and for different reasons (looking for something casual, something serious, just out of boredom)

I've had a decent amount of success on these apps (by success I mean simply landing a date with a girl, regardless of whether anything more happened with her after), but I've definitely had more failures than anything. And like everyone else, I'd beat myself up and constantly wonder what I did wrong: did I not choose the right pics? Was my opening line poor? Was I too straightforward? And so on

This bothered me for a long time, because I genuinely thought I wasn't good enough for a lot of people. But this past year I've made a genuine big effort to improve myself, physically and mentally. I'm 20 days away from turning 30, yet I'm in the best shape of my life, I look fantastic and have been dressing better, and I've finally learned what it's like to be a truly confident person. Also importantly: I've been noticing a lot of girls checking me out, smiling at me, etc

Why do I bring this up? Because this past weekend I wanted to ask a girl out that I'd been crushing on, only to find out she has a boyfriend. I wasn't necessarily bummed about it, more like ""Well, I don't really know anyone else I'm interested in, maybe I could get on Bumble and see what's up""

Then I stopped myself, and I thought, I've made all this positive, great progress so far, why mess it up now? I'll probably get on Bumble or Tinder, not get many decent matches, and then be left wondering, again, if it's because I'm not tall enough or not make enough or whatever. I've gotten enough good vibes from people in real life to know I can do better than what I'd potentially get on an app

I know I'm not the only person who's keeping away from dating apps for the sake of their confidence/anxiety, and I also know that plenty more people still struggle because they think they're not enough

But you know what? You are dudes. All of you. Are you a little shy or introverted, maybe awkward and not sure how to talk to people? That's perfectly fine. There's lots of people who are like that. Are you worried you're not good looking enough? You're probably better looking than you give yourself credit for, and if you feel like there's room for improvement, it's not as daunting as it may seem: get yourself in shape and get some new clothes. You'll see how wonderful it all feels

This isn't something that happens overnight either. I've been working on myself since the beginning of the year, and with each passing week I'm still learning new things about myself, about mindfulness and confidence, about positive self-esteem and loving myself. It hasn't all been smooth sailing; I've hit a few road bumps along the way, but something else I've learned is how to better deal with those bumps. Setbacks don't feel so bad anymore; the highs are gradually getting higher, and the lows aren't as low

This can be you, because if I can do it, you can too. It's just going to take a lot of patience, dedicated effort, and persistence. If you stick with it, you'll get there, I promise

But wherever you are right now in your dating life, just remember: don't take Tinder, Bumble, whatever you're using, too seriously. Most of the people on there are either on there for the attention, don't know what they're looking for, or have such ridiculous expectations that they're probably not worth the trouble anyways (if a girl's deciding factor is how tall you are, or a guy decides based on how quickly you sleep with him, they weren't for you to begin with)

These two pics are from the last month or two. They're both probably two of the best pics anyone's ever taken of me (for different reasons):
https://imgur.com/7uDsRTI

https://imgur.com/0ygcDPg

Sometimes when I'm feeling a bit low I look at them and remind myself, shit, look how far you've come, and how much farther up you could go still. And, again, I'm just under three weeks away from hitting 30. I know people from high school (my age and younger) who've let themselves go, have basically given up, etc. I wasn't the best looking or most athletic when I was in high school or college, but I wouldn't trade what I have right now for anything

Again, this isn't something that is unique to me. I don't have any special powers or talents or shortcuts that got me here. It just takes times and perseverance. But I don't have a doubt in my mind that all of you could reach where I am too (if you're not there already) 

Love yourself, and the right person will come around. That's why I decided against installing a dating app: I'm not in a rush, and I have too much on my plate to be worrying about why I'm not getting the matches I want

984,c665n0,False,Venting,170,The Flaws of Modern Dating,dating,"So here's my ***OPINION*** on the flaws of dating in our modern society.

***First off, let me start by prefacing that  I'm a single, hetrosexual  Korean American male, consider myself relatively attractive and relatively fit (whatever) but wanted to put this out there to begin with that so that you are aware of the perspective to which this originates from.***

&#x200B;

One of the biggest flaws in my opinion regarding dating in the modern age is that males overall are basically lost when it comes to understanding where they fall in today's societal role.  I'm often lost as to what if any role I play anymore in today's society?  Where do I fit in?  Does it fucking matter any more?  Whereas in the past, this was more defined (breadwinner, head of household, protector, etc) .

Now before you go crazy saying, ""So the fuck what?  Do we have to have roles? blah blah""  This is not my point.  In fact, this is a whole other topic but rather what I'm saying is that when roles are less clear as they are today and completely blurred as they are today, it's hard to gauge in the dating world the roles we play as males in the dating world as well.

This ultimately has an effect because if the roles in the past were more defined, then the roles today should also adjust to the modern dating world as well.  In other words, if the notion of a male working and providing in families are no longer the norm, then males *making the* ***first move*** or ***paying for the first date*** and all of these antiquated roles, shouldn't they ***also*** be adjusted to the changing times?  Also, the notion of women being considered ""sexually promiscuous"" or called a ""slut"" due to simply desiring sex as much as men do, shouldn't that also be adjusted in today's society?  Aren't we way past the notion that having consensual sex is no longer a big deal at any stage of the dating timeline?  Why do we hold on to certain norms, yet not let go of others?  This is one of the major issues I have with modern dating.

&#x200B;

Second, I believe that due to the age of dating apps and social media, we have been more molded to believe there are ""types"" or standards that must be preexist in order to even have a chance in any sort of engagement whatsoever.  I can not tell you how often I'm amused by Tinder profiles that state, *""If you're under 6ft tall, swipe left""*.  I'm left laughing out loud and amused thinking that this woman's height requirement will somehow magically spawn a connection with her Tinder date than a shorter guy because height requirements have everything to do with a real connection, right?  So with that said, I'm wondering if I were to put down, *""If you have anything less than  B Cup breasts, swipe left""*  is any more damaging or less offensive?

Of course there is nothing wrong with having standards,  but  the reality is that absolutely ***NO ONE*** falls into a ***perfect list*** or set of ***preexisting standards*** that will ever match ***BEFORE*** you even meet someone.  Thus, this endless swiping of lefts and endless non matching continues to pervade our society.

Have you noticed that on dating apps that allow you to pick categories or filter your matches in their search engine come up with less matches when you keep adding more filters?  So by that logic, if a dating app has trouble creating  matches due to preexisting qualifications, what does this say about the modern dating world?  And here we are left to wonder, why is it so fucking hard?

&#x200B;

The truth is, it really isn't hard.  I think if we let go of what we ""want"" because the truth is, what we want is irrelevant when it comes to a human being, because ***EVERYONE*** comes as a unique package full of  very specific and varied experiences and feelings and simply having an open mind of experiencing a person  and connecting with a person rather than checking off standards and ""red flags""  would make the dating world so much easier.

Alas, we don't live there.  We are now in a world of disconnected and entitled people who are more image obsessed, instant obsessed, and status or financially  obsessed.  We live in a world full of unrealistic standards, and ""don't waste my time"", bots, fake profiles, cash money apps before replying, instagram click bait cam girls, ghosting as a normal way to communicate etc.  Thus, in my opinion, the existence of Tinder and how within *nanoseconds* we put our entire self worth in a swipe, is just damaging to our mental well being beyond repair.

&#x200B;

Maybe I will never find my true happiness in a relationship, but that's ***TOTALLY*** ok with me.  Because I want to experience an organic relationship filled with all the ups and downs, including the tears and frustrations. But I want to live without the ***NEED*** of being with someone but rather the desire to experience life together with someone I want to be with and truly wants to be with me.  Because no one person is the answer to happiness.  I am the answer to my own happiness.

This reminds me of how often I used to go to parties and wonder why I wasn't having a good time?  Why when I arrived home after the party that  I was happiest?  After countless parties, I realized that the reason for this was that I was fully expecting the party to make me happy.  I would simply show up expecting all of these mental images to take place and end up disappointed and frustrated if this didn't play out by the end of the night.  ***How utterly ridiculous I had been.***  The party itself is ***only*** providing a venue and the ***opportunity*** for me to have a good time.  The real party exists within me.  ***I am responsible to create my own party and fun.***  Search high and wide and you will never find *""the ultimate fun venue""* that *""epic party""* you saw in that movie.  There will never ever be a *""fun""* venue.  ***I make it fun for myself.***  I can't tell you how many times the most fun I've ever had was telling jokes and laughing outside on a quiet porch at a house  party with a group of people I took the chance with to introduce myself to.  Or the countless times I went on amazing dates and had relationships with girls whom I found interesting and struck up a random conversation with no preexisting intentions or expectations at all.  10 out of 10 times this always happened when I honestly and genuinely only wanted to have a great time and great conversation, nothing more and nothing less.

In the same light, thinking that going on countless dates or even being in a relationship will result in my happiness is just as unhealthy and destructive because nobody wants to be with someone that expects this from them.  This is by definition unfair and unrealistic.  How can someone carry the weight of your happiness on their shoulders?  Absolutely no one should have to carry this responsibility.  Relationships, I believe flourish because both people can stand on their own.  ***Expecting the other person will fulfill anything in your life is just as bad as arriving to a party and expecting the party itself to make your evening fun***. That being said, I believe that ""the one"" does ***NOT*** exist but rather, a random connection that happens when two people randomly decide to make the effort and take the random  chance of wanting to give it a go and see what happens.  Failure is a huge part of this formula as everything is based on a random chance of things working and that's totally fine and ok.  And more likely than not, you will fail of course more often than succeed.  In the end, we have always been the gatekeepers of our own happiness in every situation of life.

819,aldq3p,False,,151,My (F25) experience with online dating as a hetero woman.,dating,"I'll get right to it. I've been using online dating on and off since I was 18. It's mostly been a lot of frustration. As a woman I understand that it's a lot of pressure to put on men to always expect them to make the first move, so I have always tried to get out there and make it known when I am into a guy. However, in doing so I have noticed a lot of common issues that are very likely getting in the way of people finding one another, so I thought I would make this post to hopefully help both men and women when it comes to online dating. Since I am heterosexual, I've really only seen straight men's profiles, so I'll be focusing on the issues that I see from that particular group as well as the quality of communication that I have received over the years:





1) **Profile Pictures** - Many of them are not even of the person themselves. A large majority have only one, poorly lit photo. Even more have only one picture in which they are wearing sunglasses that cover most of their facial features. Group photos that don't specify who is the profile owner. None of these options represents the person well. In my experience, I am far more likely to swipe left on a profile like this. It makes it very difficult to discern what someone looks like and determine whether you could be attracted to them or not. Whether you are confident in your looks or more on the shy side, either way, an accurate depiction of yourself will land you far more options than any of these I mentioned.





2) **Self Description** - I see far too many men's profiles that have ""ask me"" or just ""ask"" in every section. I understand the thought behind this, or what I assume to be the idea. If someone is interested enough, they will just ask, or maybe it's hard to know what to write. I get it. But remember, online dating is about marketing yourself to others. It's your job to do your best to represent yourself well and accurately to attract the kind of person you are looking for. I can say confidently that I immediately swipe left on this kind of profile no matter what the picture looks like. If you can't be bothered to fill in a little info about yourself, I'm not going to pull it out of you. That information is incredibly crucial. When someone does decide to message you, that information has already opened up a bunch of talking points and opportunity to get to know each other better. It's a super important factor to facilitate conversation. It's the combination of both pictures and personality that draws me to a guy. I personally appreciate an 'about me' section that reads like it was written honestly. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to give people an idea of who you are, what you love, and what you want out of life. A profile in which someone has put in some honest effort to convey that information is so much more attractive than ""ask me.""





3) **Omitting certain information** - Ok guys. Let's get real. Things like height, body type, having/not having kids, having a car, certain values, occupation etc. are all very important things when determining a partner. Whether you are totally satisfied with your current answers to these questions or not, I strongly recommend that you do answer them, and answer them honestly. Here's an example. I am a plus-sized woman. If I were to put on my profile that I am anything other than that, I would be matched up with men that don't prefer women of my size. I would then be disappointed that none of my matches are interested in me, and would have wasted a lot of my own time as well as others'. Instead, I answer it honestly and say that I am, in fact, a large woman. So I am matched up with men that are open to dating someone like me, and I have far better luck with dating. Makes sense, right? No matter what you have, where you are in life, what you look like, there is someone out there for everyone. But it's going to be a lot more difficult if you are casting your net in the wrong direction. Tell us the truth about things, guys. It's well worth it.





4) **Communication** - Ok this is a huge one, and one that I don't really understand to boot. It is far too common that when I message a guy first, and I almost always do, the conversation dies off very, very quickly. I take the time to read the profile of the person I am messaging so that I can more easily add to the conversation and make it easy for them to do the same. This is where it's important to have that information available. Most times, I will receive a single word answer to an open-ended question, and no follow up. They respond when I send a message, but with very few words and no attempt to keep the conversation going, never ask questions, etc. Now one might think that they are just not very interested, except for the fact that they often ask why I stopped messaging them, seemingly unaware. It's because I am not into one-sided conversations where I have to do all of the work. It's a give and take. So guys, if this happens to you, compare your messages to the ones you are receiving. Are you asking her about herself too? Did you reference anything that was in her profile? I will admit it is different talking to someone in person than it is messaging over a website, I think it's a little more challenging and that's why conversational skills are that much more important for online dating. Learning about each other is going to be a little tedious and awkward at first, or at least it is IME until you get the usual niceties out of the way. Don't be afraid try and say a little more, it just gives us more to talk about.





5) **Read my profile** - There are a lot of reasons for this, but the biggest issue I have experienced personally is due to my status of being Child Free. I've lost count of the number of times a guy with children has contacted me, and then been surprised or angry when I say it's not going to work out. Had they paid attention to the obvious disclaimer on my profile, we could have both avoided wasting our time. This goes right along with #3. Do not omit the fact that you have kids and expect a CF person to suddenly be ok with it. You are setting yourself up to fail, and not to mention, it's a dick move.




So these are the five biggest issues I've witnessed quite a bit. If you've read up until this point I'd like to say thanks. I hope this helps everyone in their dating endeavors and hopefully lessens some of the more frustrating aspects of it. 



If there is something I left out or if you have something to add, please leave a comment. Thoughts and constructive criticism are welcome.



Edit: I'd like to add that this definitely applies to everyone, gender aside.

I would also love to add a couple of things in reference to taking good pictures. I personally use the lighting in my bathroom to take my best pictures. Make-up lights will do absolute wonders. Some residential bathrooms have them, it's the kind with several large, round bulbs usually at the top of the mirror or around the perimeter. I do my hair and put on my best outfit, then just play around with the front-facing camera on my phone. Truth be told, I will get one really good picture out of every 25 or more.

482,ffrx1j,False,Other,37,reconnected with a girl i met 4+ years ago,dating,"It all started in 2015 when i (m25 then, 29 now) first met her (w21 then, 25 now)  via mutual friends. We both were single at the time. She never had a bf before and zero experience at all, on the other side i already had 2 pretty shitty short term flicks. We started to hang out more often and eventually i had a feeling that this could work out, so i did send that risky text, asking her about what she feels. I'm a pretty shy and introverted person so this was anything but easy for me and the reason i did it via text and not in person. She turned me down, not because she didn't like me but because she  felt more like being just friends would feel better to her. Back then i thought ""fuck yeah, i got friendzoned"" and sadly did not invest that much effort into the friendship anymore. I always told myself it was to get over my feeling to her, but in the end it was kind of a dick and selfish move.

Some months passed and i eventually met my now ex gf of the next 4 years. In all that time i maybe had a handful conversations with her, mainly on birthdays and new years etc. It still felt like there was some kind of connection even when we havent seen in all those years and barely talked. I actually was interrested in keeping closer contact and build up on that friendship now that i'm not single anymore and feelings probably couldn't hurt me. But my gf at the time was a really jealous person and did not want me to have contact or a friendship with a girl i used to have feelings for. So we never met in those 4 years, when it actually could have been so easy since she studied in the same town as i was living in for the past 2 years.

2020 rolls in, i'm a fresh single again and actually pretty happy with that. At first i didn't thought about her but she recently started being quite active on social media (she is a cosplayer) and it got my attention. I asked her to met up and she was in for it without any hesitation. It took us almost 2 months to finally set up a day but in the end we got there. Since then we have met more than once, just the two of us and sometimes with mutual friends and this past weekend she slept at my place because we were out with friends and she couldn't catch her train in time. ""Nothing"" happend, we just talked for hours straight (you know that drunken trashtalk you do) until it was already early in the morning and we totally messed up out sleepcycle by only getting 2 hours of sleep in the end.

I had to get up at noon for a football (soccer) game and told her she could stay in my appartment as long as she wants to. As soon as i left for my game i felt like i probably missed a chance there and couldn't help it but text her about how good it felt to reconnect with her and that i haven't been that happy in a long time. I once again send that risky text asking her about what she feels and if she still thinks of me as ""just a friend"". Even if she did, i would have been fine with it now, i learned so much in these years that i wouldn't have called it ""friendzoned again"". To my surprise she answered almost instantly and hell this fact and the actual response cheered me up like nothing did in a very long time.

She is in for the ""let's see where this is going and if it works out, why not"". Later we talked about the sleepover and what would have happend if i made a move that night. She said she probably would have gone with it, but she is very happy i didn't since we both were still a bit drunk and that i showed a lot of respect for her to not take advantage of that. She thinks it was way better to talk about it before and if i haven't send that risky text, she would have done it later that day.

Now here i am, looking forward to dating a wonderful woman and so excited for what is about to happen in the next days, weeks, months or even years. :)

Ghosting leaves individuals without a sense of closure. Closure, as we might know from personal experience, is incredibly important to many of us! When we are ghosted, we leave even the most casual encounters with a sense of unease and, perhaps, the tiniest bit of what feels like grief. 

I have been working on ending mismatches or flings I have met in person with simple sentences. My most general is, “I don’t feel this is a match.” Generally, it goes over well. Yes, I do have a fear someone will cling and make promises they cannot possibly keep. This is where my boundary setting skills get tested and I repeat that this isn’t a good match and wouldn’t work. 

I try not to bring up any personal things- sometimes it has nothing to do with who the person is, but rather who I am as a person. We’re all trying to find matches, and just because one doesn’t work out doesn’t meant there’s anything wrong with either. It’s simply not a good match. ANYWAYS I got off topic. 

END GHOSTING. Let’s be mature adults! 

Thank you.

EDIT: I’ve gotten enough responses assuming that I’m pissed off that I’m getting ghosted that I feel I should clarify on the post instead of individual comments: first, I am a woman...not a man. Second, I have been reflecting on my own ghosting and realized it’s kind of shitty of me to do. I’m not trying to change anyone, make them do what I think they should do.

341,ez1pas,False,Venting,396,"I (25F) approached a random guy on the train, told him he was cute, gave him my number; here's the real life account of what comes after",dating,"So, a recap: about two weeks go I posted on this subreddit [a simple question aimed at all men - how would you react if a woman approached you in a public space and gave you her number?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eqtj6e/men_in_this_sub_how_would_you_feel_if_a_woman/)

At the time, I had basically been faced with this situation: a really cute guy caught my eye on the commuter train, and I really wanted to approach him. Because I'm painfully shy and felt unable to make great conversation with him/couldn't stand the humiliation of being so publicly rejected, I took a post-it and wrote my number and a flattering little message on the paper. I held it in my hand forever trying to pluck up the courage to approach him, but he ended up hopping off the train before I had the chance to do it.

I instantly regretted not doing anything about it, and I promised myself that if this ever happened again, I would just. Do. It.

Fast-forward to today. I'm on the commuter train. Yet another guy shows up, and I have the same instinct - he's attractive, he's cute, I'm feeling him. I'm looking at him for a while with my sunglasses on, biting my lip and thinking ""Should I really do this?"". At the end, I just think ""Fuck it, what's the least that can happen?"". So I reach in my wallet for the post-it from two weeks ago (hey, might as well re-use it, right?), walked up to him. He was sitting down reading a book. I just said ""Hey, I have something I'd like to give you"", smiling; he just stares at me, surprised, at say ""Oh, thanks"", and takes the paper. I walked away immediately, so I'm not even sure that he read it or looked a it. By the time that I look behind me, he's opening his backpack and throwing the piece of paper inside. He looks at me with this dead serious look on his face, no smile, and proceeds to keep reading his book.

I eventually hopped off the train before he did, feeling absolutely defeated, disgusting, ugly, miserable. I mean, he was nice, he said thank you, he didn't do anything wrong per se. But I guess I was hoping for a more enthusiastic reaction, and his ""I could kill you"" look really demotivated me.

For a few hours I just kept thinking ""Well that's it, you're clearly unattractive and unloveable, might as well just forget about dating altogether"". But then again, I should be proud of what I did; I took a chance by putting myself out there and did something I never thought I could do. It gave me this strange adrenaline, my heart was beating so fast! His response was quite negative, a lot more than what I thought possible, but I'm trying to be positive and I'm still proud of myself. And hey, maybe some day some guy on some train somewhere, wherever I end, will actually make good use of my number, right?

So, TL;DR: followed people's advice from a few weeks ago to approach people on the train. Ended up getting deadly rejected, but that's okay, because I felt a strange rush I hadn't felt in years. Doesn't matter if the world thinks I'm ugly or fat or whatever, it still made me feel alive!

I speak from experience. This has actually happened to me. Situation was a little different. We had ran into one another more than once. She gave me a nice little note with her number. I was flattered. She walked away immediately like you did. I didn’t call or text because I’m not interested in dating anyone and I’m working on bettering myself and my situation. I saw her once more after that and was very nice to her. It was awkward though. There was nothing wrong with her. She was cute and nice. I sometimes regret never at least texting her and letting her know that it wasn’t her. I have trust issues and wasn’t comfortable giving my number when I didn’t really know her.

There was a time right after I was hurt REALLY badly that I wanted nothing to do with the female species at all.. even then I still would’ve been cordial.. my point is.. don’t feel ugly and unlovable and all that.

We have no social skills because we hook up.” (A really great read on current dating culture, people having less sex, declining social skills)",dating,"The Atlantic just published a great article on why younger people are having less sex. It goes beyond sex, though, and looks at the entire picture of how people are socializing nowadays, the problems with online dating and why they don't deliver, and how that contributes to the decline of not just sex, but basic social skills and connection overall. For anyone who is frustrated with not being able to meet anyone, I think the read will help you feel a little better.

I'm linking it in the comments since I can't link it here, but there's a lot interesting tidbits about online dating in particular such as:

>In all dating markets, apps appear to be most helpful to the highly photogenic. As Emma, a 26-year-old virgin who sporadically tries her luck with online dating, glumly told me, “Dating apps make it easy for hot people—who already have the easiest time.” Christian Rudder, a co-founder of OkCupid (one of the less appearance-centric dating services, in that it encourages detailed written profiles), reported in 2009 that the male users who were rated most physically attractive by female users got 11 times as many messages as the lowest-rated men did; medium-rated men received about four times as many messages. The disparity was starker for women: About two-thirds of messages went to the one-third of women who were rated most physically attractive. A more recent study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Santa Fe Institute found that online daters of both genders tend to pursue prospective mates who are on average 25 percent more desirable than they are—presumably not a winning strategy.  
>  
>So where does this leave us? Many online daters spend large amounts of time pursuing people who are out of their league. Few of their messages are returned, and even fewer lead to in-person contact. At best, the experience is apt to be bewildering (*Why are all these people swiping right on me, then failing to follow through?*). But it can also be undermining, even painful. Emma is, by her own description, fat. She is not ashamed of her appearance, and purposefully includes several full-body photos in her dating profiles. Nevertheless, men persist in swiping right on her profile only to taunt her—when I spoke with her, one guy had recently ended a text exchange by sending her a gif of an overweight woman on a treadmill.  
>  
>An even bigger problem may be the extent to which romantic pursuit is now being cordoned off into a predictable, prearranged online venue, the very existence of which makes it harder for *anyone*, even those not using the apps, to extend an overture in person without seeming inappropriate. What a miserable impasse.

&#x200B;

>He had better luck with Tinder than the other apps, but it was hardly efficient. He figures he swiped right—indicating that he was interested—up to 30 times for every woman who also swiped right on him, thereby triggering a match. But matching was only the beginning; then it was time to start messaging. “I was up to over 10 messages sent for a single message received,” he said. In other words: Nine out of 10 women who matched with Simon after swiping right on him didn’t go on to exchange messages with him. This means that for every 300 women he swiped right on, he had a conversation with just one.  
>  
>At least among people who don’t use dating apps, the perception exists that they facilitate casual sex with unprecedented efficiency. In reality, unless you are exceptionally good-looking, the thing online dating may be best at is sucking up large amounts of time. As of 2014, when Tinder last released such data, the average user logged in 11 times a day. Men spent 7.2 minutes per session and women spent 8.5 minutes, for a total of about an hour and a half a day. Yet they didn’t get much in return. Today, the company says it logs 1.6 billion swipes a day, and just 26 million matches. And, if Simon’s experience is any indication, the overwhelming majority of matches don’t lead to so much as a two-way text exchange, much less a date, much less sex.

3,dgizvi,False,Tinder/Online Dating,175,A tinder story,dating,"A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I’m not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn’t know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn’t like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we’re also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it’s just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father’s blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don’t give up.

(this is written as an encouragement, not as insult or put down)

&#x200B;

Through the recent tragic suicide of my ex fiance of 8 years (and me essentially becoming a widower before being a husband, at age 36), in which during the final minutes of his life, he has skype video called me — a call that lasted a full 90 minutes... from 7790 miles away... in 1080p... not asking me to save him.. but wanted my blessing for his final journey in his 3rd attempt after suffering from 4 years of depression... with a plate of charcoal burning on the side and more than a dozen sleeping pills already ingested...  — it got me thinking :

&#x200B;

why did he trust me in dying when many others don’t even have someone who ***ever*** have trusted them in living?

&#x200B;

My body is mediocre, face is acceptable, earn in low 6-figures but nowhere close to being a 1%-er, and definitely not the nicest person around. Am I that lucky, or is everyone else so unlucky ?

&#x200B;

For perpetually single folks, ranging from the uber hot very successful types, good enough all around but lower self esteem, circuit party queens, to so-so quality guys, I think I finally found the common theme that links them, which also points to each of those solving the wrong problem, and the solution I'm proposing doesn’t involve any part of physical appearance or money either —

&#x200B;

**THEIR WILL TO TAKE A STAND**

&#x200B;

The one common theme among this vast array of friends and acquaintances is that, driven by their desire to either maximize friend gain or minimize friend/potential candidate lost, all have a personality that prevents them from willing to take a stand ... on anything.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand doesn’t have to be on political topics. Doesn't have to be as polarizing as #RESISTANCE vs. #MAGA. e.g. Publicly declaring you like Benz over BMW is taking a stand. Saying you like Korean cuisine but not Japanese ones is taking a stand. Packers over Eagles is taking a stand. But saying you like everything and don’t hate anything isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand must involve prioritizing one item over another, and not hiding the preference when others inquire about it. Secretly loving Star Trek over Star Wars but telling others you love both or you have no pref isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

But that also entails the single risk all of the groups appear unwilling to bear — the risk of offending ANYONE. If u like A over B and make the preference public, people who like B may not understand why, and thus may get offended, however unreasonably that may be.

&#x200B;

So, this group of people, fear of losing any potential partying buddies or dating candidates, would present themselves as friendly-to-all, care-free, opinion-free (and maybe even cage-free), while punting all decision-making to someone else (deciding something on behalf of others is also taking a stand, even something as basic as like deciding a place for lunch) It goes back to them being single... because what exactly is dating?

&#x200B;

**Dating is someone willing to take a stand...** ***ON YOU*****.**

&#x200B;

Someone willing to pick you. Someone willing to shoulder the risk of offending his friends who don’t like because they believe you are important, and believe you are worth it. But it has to be reciprocal and mutual - they expect that you also would've taken a stand on him in the process.

&#x200B;

The obvious question to ask is — why would anyone be willing to take a stand on you when all they see is someone unwilling to take a stand on anything? Not just something, but **ANYTHING**, and ***EVERYTHING***.

&#x200B;

Many of them kept thinking others found theirs due to shear. dumb. luck.

Some thought their body isn’t hot and buff enough.

Some thought they’re not rich enough.

Some thought they’re not nice enough.

&#x200B;

So they all waste time solving the wrong problem, and doubling down when the solution doesn't seem to have yielded returns (in their minds : ""....yet""). But it boils down to — maybe, they aren’t principled enough to have principles. Start with taking a stand on everyday life options, like a car, a ski resort, an island in Hawaii, a book recommended by Oprah, a game console (yes, i'm the nut job who loves Nintendo Switch), take the risk of potentially offending one of your 4500 facebook ""friends"" and 6000 IG ""followers"",

“Into Fitness” or “workout regularly” with multiple bathing suit / gym photos or IG tag only = Code for I’m somewhat vein and superficial but I’m also fit and expect you to be as well.

“Go out or stay in” or “Ambivert” = Code for I’m not an anxiety-ridden recluse and I’m also not overcompensating for personality flaws with raw energy.

“Positive outlook” = Code for I know or have known someone with depression and am not looking to bring more of that into my life. 

“Day drinking” with more than one photo with an adult beverage = Code for I’m alcoholic and/or enjoy binge drinking. 

Fluent in Sarcasm = Code for I’m mean and snarky but I play it off as humor. 

These are the meaningless ones that I’m sick of. 

“Laugh” or “funny” = Code for I want someone who can hold an engaging conversation and has a similar sense of humor to me. Who doesn't?

“I love the water / beach / pool / lake / river” = Code for I can swim and am not allergic to the sun.

“Just ask” = Code for I’m too lazy to write stuff here.

It's like this balancing act. Well, before the balancing act it's trying to find someone you share some kind of interest in, be it physical or emotional attraction. If you're lucky, both.

K, then you like each other. You hang out. Then you suppress emotions so you don't scare the other off, so you overthink. ""They haven't responded yet, fuck are they ghosting me?"" ""They're probably just sleeping"" ""If you don't stop thinking about them you're gonna jinx it"" ""Did I jinx it"" ""Oh wait, everything's chill"" ""I just hung out with them it's fine"" ""I like them but I can't tell them because it'll freak 'em out"" ""The sex was AMAZING"" 

Or maybe you don't like them. Then it's... shit, maybe I just don't like them because they're not my ""type"" so, I should consider them. Broaden my horizons. I like their flaws, I can do this. Then you end up leading them on. You never liked them. Wasted time.

Because I can't reply to everyone, I just want to say thanks so much for all your replies, the concensus is more or less unanimouse that **""If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No"".** The *reasons* for interpreting such mixed signals as ""No"" are still worth debating....

PS/ 2nd Edit: I'd like everyone to remember that while many women do give mixed signals and ""lead men on"" the motive for that is not always manipulation!

643,exzcsm,False,Tinder/Online Dating,105,Dating App idea!,dating,"My idea for a dating app (pardon if this is dumb but I'm bored and drinking). You basically log in, create an account and then have to decide if you're looking for something casual or serious right at the start. This creates two separate groups of people and can only be switched by requesting which requires the user to fill out a form. This I think will make the process of switching tedious enough to stop people from toggling back in forth to take advantage of both groups.

Anyways, the profile has required fields. These fields include things such as a 3 picture minimum (at least 2/3 has to be ONLY you and you have to be visible), age, height, gender, career, education and two text boxes - one for a brief introduction and then the second for hobbies/interests. These text boxes will have a minimum requirement.

Here's where I think it gets unique. All conversation is live. You must both be online at the same time to chat. You only see users online at the time you are and these users are in the form of little icons you can click on to view. You basically go through and mark yes or no that you would like to talk to them and it will mark any users that want to talk to you in green on your screen so you know! If you match with them then you both get a notification saying that you want to talk to each other. Once you mark someone as a no they will disappear from your list so you can't see that they are online but you can go to another screen that let's you see everyone you've said no to and basically check any you want to undo.

If you both say yes to the notification to talk, you're brought into a chat room where you get questions based on if you're looking for something casual or serious. It is a specific number of questions like maybe 5-10 and it changes each time. Then you just share your answers and at the end you get to choose if you'd like to keep talking to them. If at any point you decide you aren't fond of the person you can exit the chat and then they get sent to your ""rejected"" group unless you go uncheck them. If you make it through though and both want to keep talking than you get your own chat where you don't have to be on at the same time and can exchange numbers/meet up or whatever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/exzcsm/dating_app_idea/,233,"I quit my job and spent the last 12 months building pretty much this.

196,ckdu92,False,,287,A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates,dating,"**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring ""success"" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily ""we had sex on the first date.""

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, ""I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want."" 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, ""What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?"" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, ""Do you want to get drinks some time?"" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, ""I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!"" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, ""I had a really great time."" 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet.

253,fadjou,False,Other,128,Why I like being single,dating,"Yes, I know this is a dating subreddit, but I figured it might help to share the view from the other side.  (I should probably mention that I'm ASD (formerly Asperger's), so my perspective is different from the norm.  YMMV.)

There's a lot to romantic relationships.  Stages, timings, things you should or should not do or say, etc.  Being single means I don't have to worry about or keep track of any of those.  There's the darker side of relationships--manipulation, abuse, cheating, divorce--that I completely avoid.  There's also the perils of dating that I avoid--getting ghosted, getting stood up, being led on, being used, and being stalked or worse.  Being single means that I'm the only one driving, and have full control over how I spend my time and money.  Finally, there's a strong sense of security and stability when you are the only factor in your life.

While I'm sure that ""the right one is out there,"" the cost and risk associated with being in a romantic relationship just isn't worth it for me.  Maybe I'll bump into someone who'll make me reconsider, maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who find ""the one.""  Until then, I have a career to pursue, a house to  buy, competitions to win, a furbaby to raise, and a host of video games to play (so psyched for Cyberpunk!).

TLDR; Being single isn't a curse.  Just like being in a relationship, it has it's own pros and cons.  You can prefer one over the other, and still be happy in both.

I don’t think women should ever ask men out. If a man really wants to date a girl, he will make it happen. If you look at animal mating behavior in nature, it’s the male bird that puts on a show and tries to win over the female with his feathers and twigs. The inverse is unnatural. Sure you can ask a guy out, things might even work out great. But eventually he will see the girl he would have asked out, and he’ll leave you for her. 

There are other ways to let men know that you like them. Flirting, appearing interested in conversation with them, subtly making it known you are single etc. If after doing that a guy doesn’t ask you out, he’s not into you.

Then I started meeting single people, going on dates, and slowly realized that the people I went on dates/etc with that were still single in their late twenties and beyond were drastically different than people Id meet who were married/taken etc. like, no matter what happened, the person eventually turned into ""ahhhhh this is why she is single"".  Either there was some very quirky about their personality, they looked way worse in pictures, they were attractive but just....not pleasant people. or...there was just nothing....attractive about the person?

Now I have nothing against her personally but I have the feeling my boyfriend has a crush on her. Now him having a crush wouldn't be a problem if it was a celebrity, not someone he knows in real life. He tries to deny it but I don't believe him. I tried bringing it up again today and he said ""what if I did? Would you be upset?"" Then he saw me getting upset and saying I'm the one who he should love. He says he loves me and that he doesn't have a crush on her, that he was speaking hypothetically. He said over and over that he doesn't have a thing for her. 


He's a friendly guy and he was upfront about the friendliness before we were together,  but hes always giggly around her. Like sometimes I just want to hide myself and be preoccupied on my phone because I can't stand it. Went to a yard sale yesterday where things were given away for free. He found a half dry erase/bulletin board he said he wanted for his room.. then later on he decides to give it to his sister, who supposedly doesn't want it and he gave it to the friend instead. Went to Dollar Tree and one of the things he buys is dry erase markers he gave to her.. he didn't buy me anything. His parents also said they heard him ranting outside about what I told him and said it was sad that I don't trust him and that he comes home to me. I have suspected for a while that he's been into her. He said in the past he was interested in her because she likes the music he likes, but that he didn't pursue her because it was his sister's friend. 

It's not even just the way he acts around her, it's social media too. He's always ""hearting"" or ""liking "" her photos even when I've told him the hearts bother me. He did it as recently as last night. He says this is how he is showing support to others, especially as she is a fitness guru. 

Now please before I suspect that I'll be told I'm being possessive,  insecure etc.. understand where I'm coming from. I'm very outspoken and don't hide how I feel.

I'm content with being single, however, I'm actively looking for a relationship, and I'm sure all of us single people know, it feels hopeless.

I currently live with my high school buddy and his girlfriend.  We all have a good relationship with each other, and its not awkward at all to live with them because they're both good friends of mine.  But there are times where they'll cuddle together and watch a movie, and I'll be in the other room, notice them, and start feeling like ""wow, it would be great to have that right now."".  Whenever the other comes home, they're always there to greet them, ask how their day was, and give each other a kiss.  Stuff like that is what I want out of a relationship.  I'm in a band with some other friends of mine, and they are all in relationships, one of them is married, another just became engaged, so on, so forth.  I don't have a lot of friends, but I'm very close to the people I keep regular contact with.  And everyone is in a freaking relationship.

We met at a birthday party and I asked her out. We hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship, but was fine with dating me. We got along great. Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point.

831,8ykopq,False,Venting,69,This sub has been toxic lately,dating,"I recently deleted my old profile on here because I just couldn’t deal with all the toxic people on this sub anymore. I cannot believe how many [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys), [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels), etc. have infected this place. So many disgusting comments getting upvoted and decent, reasonable people being harassed and attacked for saying things like “no, women don’t owe you, or any guy, anything.”

I feel like the user base here is highly skewed towards “thirsty dudes looking for the magic secret to getting laid/getting a girlfriend,” and that unfortunately leads to a tendency for this crowd to default to always take a rejected guy’s side in any situation, regardless of context. Since they really want (and think they deserve… cringe) more chances in their own lives, “give the guy a chance” is always their default answer. I’ve seen tons of posts where a woman describes all kinds of creepy, cringe-y, stalker-y, even rape-y behavior… and oftentimes the mob *stil*l takes the guy’s side and attacks the woman for “being mean to the poor guy and not giving him a chance.” I see this kind of mentality other places around reddit too. Any time the obvious answer to how to deal with a shitty person engaging in all kinds of awful and inappropriate behavior is “don’t put up with it and kick them out,” a bunch of people will complain about how that’s “unfair,” and that it’s “immature” of them to not put up with other peoples’ bad behavior. Or they act like if someone is acting inappropriately and making everyone around them uncomfortable, that it’s somehow everyone else’s responsibility to teach another adult basic social skills (or be a “dating coach”). In light of this, I have to think that a lot of these people rabidly defending “the creepy guy” or “the friend no one likes” in these stories probably *are* “that guy” in their own social lives.

And the anti-ghosting crusade. Holy shit. All these emotionally unstable people act like the fucking sky is falling, the world is ending, and the art of civility and human connection is irreparably broken… because people occasionally don’t contact some random person they barely knew after going on a date with them. News flash, it’s not everyone else’s problem that *you* can’t take a hint and/or have attachment issues. People will often tell (or respond to) these stories where it was *very*obvious the other person wasn’t into them, and then act all confused because “they didn’t say those words exactly.” Then they will inevitably blame the other person (usually, the woman) for “not communicating.” Communication is a two-way street, and if you miss or ignore every single non-verbal way that someone is communicating that they don’t like you and are uncomfortable with you, that’s a failure to communicate and act in a socially appropriate way. As an adult, you shouldn’t *need* other people to tell you those things. “I didn’t know any better” is no excuse for acting like a creep.

And these same people who absolutely lose their shit over getting ghosted and rabidly attack anyone who *dares* tell them that “no, it’s really not that big of deal and you should get over it,” have the nerve to gush about what great gentleman they are and how they would totally handle rejection well… They can’t even take a stranger on the internet saying something they disagree with well.

I see a similar issue with guys posting creepy stories basically outlining how obsessed/fixated they are on some girl, sometimes to the point of stalking, and then viciously attacking anyone who points out that “you know, it’s pretty unhealthy to be that obsessed with someone you aren’t even dating or anything.” They’ll say all kinds of nasty things to anyone who dares criticize them… and then do the same “gush about how I’m such a gentleman and *definitely* not a stalker” routine.

One of the best pieces of advice my boss has given me is “you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself as an observer. You have to see yourself the way others see you.” And these cringe-y guys just don’t understand that. Throwing a tantrum because you got rejected, not called back, or dumped looks bad. Ranting about “how terrible all women are” because of one or two bad experiences in your personal life looks bad. Expecting some kind of gold star or “credit you can redeem for a wonderful girlfriend” for being a law-abiding citizen who is generally polite, has a job, a car, and your own place is laughable.

You match with someone on whatever app/site you're using, agree to meet up, and then they show up looking little like the actual person you matched with.

I've seen so many of these people complain that there's unfair standards, that everyone else is shallow and places too much emphasis on looks, whatever. And they're completely missing the point: you being 20 pounds heavier than in the past isn't the issue, it's the fact that you had to lie and deceive someone into meeting you that's the problem. It also screams insecurity. If you're lying from the get-go the relationship, assuming it happens, will be toxic. Unless the other person is desperate and happy with anyone

I felt trapped and like I couldn't get out, so I just packed up and left one day. I felt lonely and joined a social/dating app. I just wanted to talk to people again, since I don't have really any friends. 

I got so many messages, my app was crashing. So many creeps. I messaged a few back, but it either got weird or didn't go anywhere. But one guy just asked me why I was on the app. I said I was lonely, and he asked to Snapchat. 

I expected him to ask for nudes and all that, but I was surprised when he didn't. He was ice fishing with his brothers and it was Christmas Eve. I like fishing, so we got to talking. 

We talked 24/7 (except when we were sleeping) every day after that.  Snapchat and text every minute were awake. He calls me on my work break every evening. We have soooo much in common. I'm super outdoorsy and he is too. Plus he's cute as hell and sooo sweet lol. 

He's in the next state over, almost 5 hours away. But I jumped in my car and headed over there for a whole weekend two weeks after we started talking. 

I had the time of my life. We went ice fishing for 12 hours, and I had a blast. We went back to his place and smoked weed, and he made me amazing chicken enchiladas. We had sex, which was mind blowing. I had never had sex so good lol. We watched Netflix and cuddled until we fell asleep. 

He came to my place this weekend. I took him fishing on my favorite lake. We hot boxed his fishing shack, and had some risky sex. A warden came to check licenses, and we ended up both getting tickets for paraphernalia. Oops. Went back to my cabin. The generator blew up (we planned on watching movies) so we played cards under the gas lights and drank beer. Pushed the couches together by the wood stove and cuddled all night in our makeshift bed. 

He handled our shit situation so well, and just made the best of it. 

He asked me if I wanted to make things official while we were waiting for our tickets that night, I said yeah lol. 

I'm falling hard guys. He's so nice and respectful toward me, unlike anyone I've been with before. He met my dad, and left a great impression. We share so many of the same interests. Made so many plans to go camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing. Its early yet, and I've been drinking tonight, but holy cow am I hoping this works out.

You don't also don't have to specify that it's a DATE... just invite her out to some event you're already planning on going to or just to simply hang.

also, did you try to do any small talk? you said you knew her for 2 years but how much interaction did you have??

My guess is you talked to her initially when you first got there..

 didn't talk for a long time but thought about her a lot... built up the courage, made a weird intro and just asked her..........which doesn't work.....

the reason you use small talk, is to gauge her interest level..... actually you can use this with anybody.... and through small talk you can seamlessly transition into asking her out or exiting the convo....

lastly, if what she said hurt you because it's true, then fix it... that means take care of yourself in the mental, physical, spiritual, finances etc.... or find your purpose in life... do any of these things and then the shit people say will just be white noise ",2019-06-29 10:57:22

I  have recently moved to Canada and don't know anyone here really and  decided to give tinder a try to see how it goes(in the country i came  from it was really dry to say the least). Anyway, to my surprise girls  were more responsive and were willing t go out(I am not exotic or  anything like that). Went on a date with one girl, it was okay, really  formal, got ghosted after that. Went out with the second girl the next  day and we had a really good connection, touching each other and stuff  like that. Unfortunately she lives in a nearby town and only comes to my  town for work, and got a horrible disease recently that put her in a  hospital. We still chat but she doesn't have time to date, but i will of  course go out with her if she wants. Went out with one more girl, again  something was off but it wasn't bad, but we stopped talking. The final  girl i met at a bar, while the others were all at a cafe, and this girl  was really quiet. It was like i had to pull words out of her, maybe she  was nervous , but she messaged me later saying that i am a great guy but  she had no time due to work lol.

What  these 4 dates did for me is that they gave me a huge confidence boost  and that it's okay if it doesn't work out. But I still need to work on  my first impressions.

Me and this guy made eye contact... Pretty normal but then i looked away and then i looked to cross the road and he was still looking. 

Then we crossed the road and he started chatting to me. Seemed pretty normal. 

Then he was like “you’re really pretty, you must think i’m nice too hehe” i had my headphones in so kinda missed bits of it but then he asked for my name and where i lived. I said east. He said he lived west. 

Then he said “oh you seem really nice can i get your number or something i’d like to get to know you.

 I was like okay...gave him my number. He’s like when are you free. I’m like not until Friday/Saturday. He for some reason won’t believe this although i’ve told him i have deadlines... 

Then he was like cool, can i have a kiss i was like LOL no. Then he was like “come on don’t be shy.” And i was like “i’m alright thanks.” But he just keeps asking, then asks if i can kiss him and i’m saying “no. I don’t do that.  Sorry.” and then i’m like “right, i’m going this way now...” and he’s like “ok hug goodbye?” 

So i was like fine whatever, and then he kissed me on my cheek and i was like a bit annoyed but it’s a minor i suppose... until i realise he isn’t pulling away like you usually would post hug, he does that lingering around thing fairly close to my face and he then says “how about a proper one now?” 

I was like “are you for real?!” Like i’m pulling away quite aggressively and he’s still got me in the hug at this point. And i’m shouting “seriously, get off me” and he’s like “okok haha well i will definitely see you on saturday.” 

No you definitely will not. 

I’ve blocked his number etc. But it’s still grinding my gears that this happened. He genuinely seemed alright at the beginning. 

Not sure how i always seem to attract the nutters/unreliables/uncertain/inattentive/dishonest ones. 

But a guy i just started dating also decided today that it was too soon for him to date after being out of a relationship for 1.5 months (which is totally fine), but he told me to book mini golf for our next date a few days ago and then we hadn’t spoken over the weekend. I told him i’d booked it and he said great can’t wait and then i’ve been busy this weekend with uni work so today messaged like are we still on? And he was like i had a great time with you but i dont think im ready to date or anything yet and i don’t want to waste your time. I said that’s fine but annoying cause already booked it, he kindly paid me back. And said its a shame as i was looking forward to it and it was nice that we both weren’t wanting anything serious. I think it ended on alright terms, he said he just needed to figure stuff out with himself but he enjoyed meeting and talking to me. Didn’t really have anything to say. So that’s that. 

I’m not annoyed that we’re now not going to date, it’s not a big deal and if he needs time, that’s totally understandable and i said that to him. What i don’t get, is that had i not contacted him, when would he have contacted me?  I gave him the opportunity earlier in the week to be like oh no i don’t want to do anything, before i booked the activity. So i just don’t get why that happened, if i didn’t want to do something or i changed my mind, i would let the person know, when i change my mind.

Edit 2/13/19
Sooo went out last night with the girl. Dinner went great, she had a blast. She left her juul in my car last  night and she wants to hangout today and have me drop it off(hanging out the next day seems like a slippery slope, so I told her I would swing by on my way to work and drop it off).   I also have a hilarious NSFW story about the date but Idk if it would ruin the wholesomeness of the post, so maybe I'll just keep it to myself....anyways dinner went great and she invited me to go see hippie sabotage with her, not sure If I'm gonna take her up on that.

sorry for being totally awful at updating this. Okay so it's basically been around 30 days. I've been super busy with work and applying for grad school. Anyways...um life's been great! Having another doctors appointment the end of the month. The ladies have been great! TBH I started getting really picky with the girls I felt worth asking, only cause I really wanted to be excited about talking to the girl. One big issue I ran into was that the girls seemed to be much more interested than I was. One girl I've been seeing regularly, I go over to her place and she's made me dinner and I've taken her on a few dates, starting to know her sister pretty well also. This is bad cause Idk if I'm looking for a LTR. 
Another girl has been a blast hanging out with, but she seems more invested than I am. We are going camping next weekend so I'm thrilled about that. 
Another girl was really sweet, I started up a convo with her about her shirt and then got her number that way, haven't gone out with her, not all that interested. 
Another girl just wanted to be a booty call but I'm not looking for any hookups so that was short lived. 
I've also been interested in asking out a coworker but I've heard from others she has a bf, however she's never expressed that to me. So not sure what to do.
All in all I'm definitely gonna keep this mentality up, I've learned you got to be selective with who you ask, you can't just ask every girl you find attractive cause you need more than just physical attraction to keep interest.

199,d4r8fi,False,Venting,376,The hardest part about dating as a man is that women are attracted to you for being confident. But your confidence is constantly tested.,dating,"There was an interesting exchange I saw earlier this week on facebook. In a group I am in. One of the leaders. A really confident guy that is always happy go lucky, made a post about how girls always want him as a bf. Someone responded about how hard it is really to achieve that, and everyone piled on and made fun of him, calling him cringy and creepy. this sort of exchange happens in all the circles i am in. It would probably happen to me too if I didn't hide my feelings.

The fact of the matter is that we men can't show our feelings. We can't show weakness. We can't show vulnerability. That is cringy, creepy and draws women away. Everyone piles up and boots us in the face if we do.

I don't know how to explain it. Its like the confident guys get propped up and the unconfident guys get torn down. And that is why so few men get women.

And I think. Thats just how human beings are wired to be. It makes sense. We evolved such that strong men are rewarded. There is no escape from it.

I'm sorry. I'm not angry. I don't hate anyone (except myself really). Its just like. I understand more and more why I don't deserve love and I'm trying to process it a lot better.

OK so everything I have heard hear I actually have heard before. There is a lot of:

\- Just believe in yourself it will happen eventually

\- Don't fall for toxic masculinity. Women love vulnerable men

\- Just take a break.

\- Get therapy

\- Workout

\- Fuck you. Your too negative.

\- You wouldn't want the attention anyway. If you actually try you'll get a quality relationship

\- You are better than you think you are

\- Get hobbies and make friends. It will make you happier

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

That no matter how long they spend on these apps or how many times they tweak their profile or opener that they can't seem to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Here's why.

Online dating (apps, sites) isn't really dating. It's really just a way to set up meetings between people. Your profile, at the end of the day, is more like a marketing brochure than an actual representation of who you are. Without developing the skills needed to be emotionally in tune with others (particularly strangers), you will find yourself consistently struggling to attract people into your life long term. How does one develop those skills?

By engaging in social activities that create regular social circles where there are people who consistently show up and new people constantly rotating in. Learning how to make friends with strangers is the first step, learning how to gauge signs of interest through invitations and physical escalation rounds out the process.

Which happened. We met. 
Guy arrives at my house and we have a nice little chat for about an hour. Honestly I think it was going well. No sloppy subjects, no blanks in the conversation, he looked relaxed and so did I. Then he suddenly hits me with:
« Okay. I don’t want to be here. It pisses me off. I’m leaving. ». I was so, so, so surprised. We were having a chat, and right in the middle of it, he just... said that.

&#x200B;

1. it puts average looking men at a severe disadvantage. I’ve spent so much time and effort into tinder and bumble, getting the perfect pictures, sending a ton of messages, swiping right on everyone, etc. fucking nothing. it’s wrecked my self esteem, and it makes me resent those who effortlessly match with dozens of people
2. if you’re and awkward texter, you’re completely fucked. there’s an immense amount of pressure to be charming, funny, etc etc when you start texting your match, and if you’re not, you’ll never get anywhere.
3. it’s allowed women to not have to even set foot out of their homes to find tons of men to date. that’s taken away the impetus for many women to actually go out and meet men in real life.

&#x200B;

I moved to a new city about 6 months ago. I’ve wanted a relationship desperately since I’ve been here, and I’ve tried it all. I’ve spent months swiping on tinder and bumble. total failure. I’ve tried approaching girls whenever I’m out and about, got lots of numbers, but in the end that was a total failure too.

&#x200B;

I also spend a substantial amount of time going to MeetUp events to meet girls. I try to put myself out there and meet as many people as possible, in the hopes that one day I will come across a nice girl who I can pursue. as it turns out, the gender ratio at the vast majority of these events is about 75 men 25 women, and of those women, maybe half are my age.

&#x200B;

to me, it seems that the age of online dating has made the dating world as a whole more isolating and emotionally crushing for average looking men. I’m so fucking frustrated sexually and emotionally I have a hard time thinking straight sometimes. I don’t have money, so those singles meetups in bars are out of reach for me. anything that costs money is out of the question.

&#x200B;

and yet here I am, back on tinder and bumble. why? because apparently that’s one of the only fucking ways to meet girls. I hate it, but I feel like I don’t have a choice.

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you!

That’s more of a you have it or you don’t kind of thing. And a lot of men don’t have it. Men have much less control over that I think. It’s a roll of the dice and a much more difficult skillset to learn if you don’t already have it. So basically I think it’s frequently easier to be boyfriend material than hookup material.

So a lot of guys are boyfriend material but not hookup material. Which sets things up for a lot of confusion and frustration for these guys over why they are apparently not wanted when all the cool kids are hooking up all the time. Then eventually most of them get settled for. I think a lot of these are the original “nice guys finish last” type of nice guys. But it’s not that they’re nice.

From the moment we sat down, she starts talking politics. Oh no. She tells me she's a major Trumper supporter, which isn't an absolute deal breaker, but when I asked her why she supported him, she said ""I like what he's doing with the minorities."" Now, mind you, I'm ASIAN, so I'm just cringing super hard and chuckling awkwardly to prevent a full on verbal assault. 

Then she starts talking to me about the penises that she's seen. She tells me that Asian guys have pretty small penises and that she hopes my ""pecker"" isn't too small. Now, I don't think I'm a small guy, but it definitely made me feel very insecure and a bit curious as to what the hell is wrong with her. I quickly changed the topic to pets to avoid another awkward conversation. 

Finally, as we're leaving the restaurant, she tells me about how guys who participate in gangbangs/threesomes are all gay because they like the sight of other men's cocks. This was not a topic that I was well versed in, so I made another effort to change the conversation. She then tells me out of nowhere that she doesn't like gay guys, and that's why she'll never participate in a threesome with two guys. At that point, I just wanted to get away from her, so I nodded and smiled at everything she said.

As we're getting in our separate cars to leave, she starts smoking a cigarette and then kisses me on the mouth. It wasn't great.

After a guy rescheduling with me for the second time (see how generous I used to be), it came out that he was otherwise engaged.  so cancellations become red flags to others.

After that, make sure that plans are tight.  Date, time, place, activity are firmly set.  No ""calling to confirm / check in"" even a day before / of the date as that sometimes suggests to others that you are not quite all in.  My response to such a suggestion is ""we have everything we need finalized.  If you think something might come up, then let's dissolve plans now and you can call me later.""  Nor should you accept that kind of behavior from your date.

It's sad that she took the opportunity to stand you up.  although these days, I've had enough of this myself and I view late cancellations (day before / of) as the same as being stood up.  If you can manage your schedule and anticipate when you might be extra busy, then you should. Don't double book and don't overbook.  Know your limits.  I met someone who worked in finance who said she simply did not make social plans during evening hours of Monday to Thursday.

932,aq4ej7,False,,109,My super handsome friend is often rejected because of his origins,dating,"One of my friends is originally from Syria (he was born and grew up there, but he left Syria when he was 15). He then lived in Switzerland and moved to the Uk for University. He left Syria with his family long before the war, and so he has nothing to do with it. I have known him since he moved to the UK. He is very handsome and attractive (he looks exactly like Maluma). He has been facing a lot of problems just because of his origins. Since he is attractive and doesn’t have a typical Middle Eastern appearance, people in general and girls in particular approach him a lot in parties and clubs thinking he is Spanish, Italian, or Brazilian. However as soon as he tells them about his origins, they just leave him and their interest in him fades away. He had a lot of problems with dating. Girls would go out with him once and then when they learn about his origins, they would stop talking to him. Same story happens on Tinder. When we go out and socialise with people, sometimes things get worse. Some people would ask him where is he from and as soon as he mentions Syria, people would start asking him questions about the war, when is he going back, and how did he arrive to the UK. Some people were even rude to him and said things like “are you a refugee”, “did you come here on a boat”, and “why didn’t you stay”. Some people and particularly girls said racists things to him like “I don’t do Arabs”, “you’re too hot to be Arab”, “sorry I thought you were Italian when I gave you my number”, and “oh how come? You don’t look like those poor refugees”. He recently decided to not go out anymore, and he is isolating himself and avoiding all social encounters. Recently, I managed to convince him to go out with us few times but I noticed that he was avoiding to introduce himself to new people. If we meet new people in the bar or the club, he would step back and pretend to be on his phone or go to the bathroom. He doesn’t want to face the question of “where are you from”. He is smart, well-educated, goes to one of the best schools in the UK, and speaks English fluently in addition to three other languages. What do you people think?

644,bumz1j,False,Venting,151,Realizing you're the problem,dating,"Hey r/dating. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this rant.

I haven't had a second date in six months. I'm a somewhat conventionally attractive woman, take care of myself, etc. and on dating apps, I get tons of matches pretty easily, and even sometimes in public or when I'm out with my friends, I'm approached and asked for my number. However, it's after someone meets me in person for a date that things tend to go south and I get politely rejected or ghosted.

The pattern tends to go as follows; I match with someone, they seem super interested, we talk for a couple days on the app or via text, one of us asks to meet up in person (I like to take the initiative sometimes and am fairy confident), the date goes okay/good in my opinion, but then I either never hear from them again, or when I try to reach out, I get a polite message indicating they are not interested in seeing me again.

And if this clarifies, some of them I slept with after, some I didn't. 

So, I've come to the conclusion that while I consider myself attractive and have no issues getting interest/matches from people, I have some seriously blaring personality flaws that are really turning the people I'm going out with off. After the same exact pattern happening so many times, it's pretty clear that I am the problem.

I think for one I talk about myself too much, I know that for sure. And I have a tendency to overshare. And maybe I'm not asking my dates enough questions. Or, maybe I'm drinking too much on the dates bars. Or maybe I look better in my pictures than in real life?  I'm trying to figure it out and work on it so I can be better at dating and finally get past the first date.

Anyway, rant over. I guess I'm glad I'm self aware enough to see the pattern, but it still sucks to be rejected so many times and feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. I have tons of friends I'm close with and I get along with my coworkers, but for whatever reason I guess I'm not bringing the qualities that make me likable in other situations into my dates.

Some days, I’m happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can’t have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I’m just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I’ve been with are. I’m torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I’ll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I’ve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It’s like I’m trying to convince myself that I don’t want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who’s actually good for me.

113,go1i6d,False,Giving Advice,272,My dating journey as an ugly guy: from rough beginnings to decent ends,dating,"As an ugly person, it has been painful but also rewarding to accept my place.

It was challenging to accept the truth and consequences of my appearance.  Society places enormous emphasis on appearances.  People everywhere will judge you and treat you negatively based on appearance, no matter how intelligent/educated/nice they believe themselves to be.  So it can be very depressing to open your eyes and see how many people discriminate against you (usually just in subtle ways, thankfully).

The reality of my ugliness dawned on me very slowly.  I noticed how my attractive friends were treated better than me in public-- random people would commonly make friendly eye contact with them or even smile at them, which has never happened for me.  I would be excluded from certain conversations or events.  I saw myself ageing much more harshly than other guys my age.  I noticed that I was usually the least attractive person in group photos.  Needless to say, I struggled to find girls to date, or even talk to.  Eventually, it was no longer possible to delude myself.

I also really struggled with the idea that, even though I'm ugly, maybe I can still find an attractive mate.  I got over that through numerous painful dating experiences and by observing how couples usually have similar levels of attractiveness.  I have learned that, if you want to ""date up"", there is a very low ceiling on ""up"", and that ceiling can only be broken if you allow yourself to be exploited in some way (e.g. maybe they want your money or status, or maybe they are just a psycho trying to hurt you).

Once I got past these painful truths, a deeper truth also dawned on me: that there are girls who, just like me, are straight and also tired of getting mistreated based on appearances.  Knowing that, I found it much easier to find high-potential mates and treat them kindly.  I knew I could treat them the way I wanted to be treated, and that they would appreciate it.  By focusing on that mantra, I was able to not only avoid painful interactions, but also make new friends, enjoy the company of women on casual dates, and eventually, I found a romantic relationship.

There are so many good possibilities out there, even if your appearance isn't good.

And we both learned a lot. 

He swiped right on a lot of guys that I normally swipe left on...and in the following days I learned that a bunch of them were actually super cool, leading me to resolve to be less picky in the future. Also learned that there were some guys that I should just keep trusting my gut and swipe left on. (after about the third creepy message that I got in a short period, my friend says ""damn why do guys feel like they can talk to you that way? That sucks"") 

I also learned that you can run out of likes, which I didn't know before haha. 

I would judge my friend and I pretty similar in terms of looks and datability. However I found that a LOT more women were ""swipable"" than I have experienced with men. Asking the question ""would this woman be cute and interesting enough to date my best friend?"" meant that a lot of women made the cut, which was interesting to me. 

Last thing I learned was how genuinely shitty it feels to use up all your likes and only get one match. He told me that it was something of a miracle that I even got that single match for him. 

I feel like a lot of guys complain about this (especially on this sub) and girls roll their eyes like ""boo hoo, just have some confidence."" Or the classic, be attractive, don't be unnattractive.

You can literally have everything going for you and get absolutely nowhere these days with dating and I think a lot of it has to do with the apps. They're successful precisely because they don't work most of the time, and are specifically designed to keep you on them so they can monetize off your frustration. They're making everyone flaky, indecisive, and non-committal due to the illusion of choice, but they're not entirely to blame, and thats the remaining piece of the puzzle I'm trying to figure out - do I have a character flaw I'm unaware of? If so, nobody has given me any insight as to what it is..

I have never had a problem with women my entire life before my last LTR ended in the beginning of 2016, and I have WAY more to offer now than I ever did in the past. When I got out of that relationship apps were the go-to and I've only had intermittent success with them since. Here's the typical pattern for me; Match with someone, meetup, things appear to be going well, then we talk for 2-3 weeks, possibly meetup a second time etc and then....crickets, OR they convey that there's no 'spark' or aren't 'feeling it'. I'm sure that may be partially true, but not the entire reason for them losing interest. It's just crazy how everyone is trying to judge or replace you before they even give themselves a chance to get to know you, but I guess these are the rules that are in place in the throw-away society we now live in.

This is going to sound like a humble brag but its just me being objective about my situation - I'm a handsome guy (so I'm told) I workout regularly, have a great career making DAMN good money, good credit, a house, a dog. I've got my life together. I'm respectful, educated, driven, introspective, multifaceted, emotionally relevant, not clingy, and I take care of myself.  I've got a satirical / nihilistic sense of humor and I'm decently witty, but I'm also kind of chill and introverted. I've dated, been in LTRs, and FWB type situations with drop dead gorgeous women so I know what I'm capable of, but man it's just been really confusing lately as to why I'm not having any luck. I recently started dating women with kids which I no longer see an issue with given my age, but no luck with them either....what. is. happening?

I needed a new pillow, so I was looking around and ran into a guy. He asked me questions about memory foam and air mattresses. He was going on a trip with some friends. 

I made conversation and kind of threw out a vague “Oh are you going with your wife/gf?” Since he was older he caught on to what I was doing. He asked me why I asked. I told him he was attractive. I didn’t expect him to ask for my number immediately after. Never in my life has this ever happened. I feel very proud of myself. 

Not going to lie I was a bit nervous as I just met him and didn’t know much. We ended up going on a nice date to get some food and go see a movie. He touched me the majority of the movie. It felt so nice to actually have affection. (My last relationship had no affection and was very verbally abusive) 

We ended up kissing at the end of the night. I text him as a courtesy to let him know I had a good time and to give him a compliment. He did text back. I’m not going to read to much into this as I know how dating is now. 

We both aren’t seeking a relationship, but I do eventually want one just not anytime soon. 

Regardless of the outcome I’m very happy it happened. (I’m a pretty positive person, but my assumptions will always go to “Yeah that’s gonna be it.”) 

I’m trying my best to play it kool and not stress if I don’t hear from him at all, but I don’t want to come off as uninterested. Should I just lay low and not text anymore until I hear something? 

Another thing ladies. Just go for it. If you get rejected oh well. Or you might be surprised. After years of off and on OLD I told myself I would never do it again. I’m glad I stuck to it.

When I finally made it on my own in the world and moved away from home, I realized that many factors in my life, including abuse from my mother when I was a child (she is NPD and BPD), have caused me to develop an anxious attachment style — in every type of relationship in my life, including friendships, family and casual things. 

When I first meet someone, I’m chill. They tell me how respectful, genuine and relaxed I am, and they like me because I respect their boundaries... until I don’t and sabotage. 

Most of the time, I push away and ghost, but other times, I become this ridiculous person, insecure and emotional, over the tiniest emotional spark. If I have a NSA hook up with someone, I’m someone else, this calm, collected, cool, mysterious, fascinating person. But then the moment we find we have a lot in common or we vibe well, I start to feel vulnerable and it makes me act like a lunatic. 

It’s really embarrassing and it’s not me. Over years of therapy and medication, thankfully I’ve overcome a lot of self esteem issues, depression and PTSD, but I’ve noticed there are some remnants of anxiety and insecurities I am having trouble overcoming. 

All of my past boyfriends have cheated on me or abused me, and I feel this has torn me apart emotionally. I don’t want to be insecure. 

I mean, my life is insane. I work, I have several hobbies, I have things keeping me busy, and yet I fall into this awful behavior that makes me look bored, desperate and needy. 

I need to kick this crap to the curb, because I’ve met some really awesome people lately, but I can’t seem to “go with the flow” or “take it slow,” and I give off this vibe in the beginning that I’m pretty cool with all of that, and then turn into this over dramatic person. Texting too much, calling too much, overthinking every interaction. Wondering if they even like me. 

It’s so unattractive and embarrassing. 

I have to talk myself through everything, telling myself to chill, that they’re human and this isn’t even a thing yet, and I’m going to ruin it if I don’t shut up and go with the flow like I should. 

I hate to be a walking red flag. I hate knowing at any moment I’ll sabotage something good (before it even begins at times) because of this. 

Can someone help me understand this? I have been in therapy for four years and on medication for two. I guess I just have to keep working at it....",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/emd6qc/i_am_realizing_i_have_an_anxious_attachment_style/,213,You sound like the normal american girl nowadays.

609,cbj48v,False,Giving Advice,122,Online Matches,dating,"I (F24) see lots of guys on reddit and IRL complain about the lack of matches they get, and how many matches women get. The guys i know, plus the guys on reddit also swipe right on every single girl they see to make their chances better. Understandably so, cast the net wide, you'll be bound to catch something. I cant speak for every girl, the the girls i know dont swipe on every guy, they are a bit choosy, hell, my BFF will send me screenshots of guys profiles and ask me what i think, and we'll talk about it before she makes her decision, thats just before she even swipes right, for all she knows, he might not like how she looks. it got me thinking about how women and men play the online dating game very differently.

&#x200B;

If every guy swipes right on EVERY girl, and every girl swipes right on SOME guys, of course women are going to have more matches. It's over-saturated at this point. Also, just because a girl may have 100+ matches, it doesn't meant that shes talking to 100+ guys. 1/2 of them are bots or catfishes, i guarantee it, many dont answer, LOTS are looking for one night stands and hookups, and then there are maybe a handful out of that group of men are are actually compatible with the woman they matched with. i admit, i get lots of matches, and i message them, but not everyone talks to me, because even though they swiped right on me, i'm not their preference. Ive had guys swipe right on me, i say hello, and then immediately unmatch me lol. It happens to us all!

&#x200B;

Not to mention, people have different tastes, i know its hard to not compare yourself to some Calvin Klein model looking dude and think, ""if he isnt matching with every woman, what chance do i have"". But you have to remember, not everyone likes that, people have different tastes and preferences. I'm short, and i am VERY hesitant on going out with guys over 6 feet, because it feels weird to me, i know that guys who are over 6 feet tall are popular online for some reason, but know that not every girl likes it. Yes, online dating is extremely shallow, and i get my ass kicked on it too, i'll be the first to admit it, but it is a good way to meet people, and not every meetup needs to end in a relationship, maybe a friendship can come out of it. If you find yourself getting in a dark place mentally from these apps, take a break from them, its ok, i do it, my friends do it, your peace is the most important part of this

852,8nko61,False,Other,73,Dating in your 30s is weird...,dating,"It's also tough. It's also confusing. You can have a career, financial stability, be subjectively attractive, fit, have enough hobbies to make you a well\-rounded person, be social, put yourself in environments where you'd think you'd meet someone, join all the dating sites and use all the apps... and still, nothing. I'm halfway through my 30s now, and the spot I'm in is where it's like of course I want to meet someone, but at this age, I get easily  exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life. It's almost as if there's more unnecessary stress and less courtesy when all you're trying to be is a human trying to genuinely connect with another human.

This is not being pessimistic either, but just a fact of how eventually dating wears me out easily at this stage. I have friends where the process has been pretty easy, so seeing that doesn't light a fire in me either. One friend of mine who is a girl who never dated in her entire life until two years ago signed up for Match and met a guy within two months. They're living together now and very happy. Another friend of mine married a girl who accidentally messaged him on facebook because he had the same name as a former college friend of hers, and one thing led to another. That sort of easy, effortless strike of luck *never* happens to me haha

I still put myself on dating sites every now and then without expecting much, and always look for opportunities out there in the real world to potentially be introduced to someone new, yet I would be lying if I didn't say there's also those nights where I see that things aren't changing, I get tired by that thought, and really don't care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8nko61/dating_in_your_30s_is_weird/,147,"Part of the problem is that society convinces everyone that they need to be in a relationship.

I’m a 29F who got into this last lease with my ex fiancé (broke off last June) after trading my fully paid car off for it. The lease fell on me as it was in my name and I have barely been able to afford it on my own. Fast forward back to tonight, she asks me if my new boyfriend will be paying for my new car.

I've been going to the gym for 3 years, and today after a long time, my past kicked me in the balls all over again. I left the gym wanting to cry.

Growing up, I was the shortest dude in my class, and I'm still short compared to people around me. I was one of the few Indian kids. I also wasn't very strong. I used to get singled out by the gym teachers in high school to compete with girls, was never allowed to compete with guys on sports events (btw, I don't think women are weaker than men, or that there is anything wrong with having to compete with women, because hey, I'd love to be as badass as so many women I know). I used to get bullied in so many ways.

""Your mother must be scared to look at you"" ""Why are you so pidgeon chested"" ""Don't worry man, you'll find someone""

I used to get valentine's day cards saying ""I like the smell of your armpits"". I didn't have any BO, but people wanted to see me excited, and then watch my face drop.

The girls who asked me to dance at school parties did it because of a dare, and only wanted to make fun of me.

Guys used to push me into girls, and then everyone would call me a creep. As an Indian guy, I'm already very sensitive to girls not feeling safe around me (yes, we have a terrible reputation, and we collectively need to get better). I hated it. I hated being the reason for other people not feeling comfortable.

So I made myself really smart. I got really creative and artistic. I became a student leader. I made myself weirdly popular, respectable, and untouchable just so all of the bullshit would stop. I never got strong, not for lack of trying. I never attracted or genuinely excited anyone.

At the end of college, I experienced heartbreak because the girl I fell in love with after 3 years of knowing her didn't feel the same way about me, and fell for my best friend. So I graduated, and let myself go completely. The only thing I held on to for dear life was my career.

3 years ago, after a medical emergency, I started getting my act back together again. I started from the bottom of the bottom. I started keeping up with my creative pursuits again. I started doing everything I could to be the best man I can. After 3 years, I've only now managed to achieve where most people start.

110,f21nud,False,Giving Advice,310,10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective),dating,"Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a ""cool guy"".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

&#x200B;

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

It’s hard to believe half the year has gone by with lockdowns and pandemics and what not. I had really hoped to make this year a good one, after recognizing what some of my challenges were and having a plan to overcome them. 

I had realized some time ago that a lot of this year may well go by before any sense of normalcy or safety returned. More than that, I’m sort of accepting that this whole year may well be written off. I have tried Skyping and video calls with potential dates, but it just isn’t that easy to really progress anything until you meet in person. 

I say to other singles on this sub, it’s probably best to just accept that this year won’t likely bring substantial positive change to our dating lives. And honestly, that’s ok. It’s a difficult situation that most of us can’t do much about. I’m not saying I’m happy about it in the slightest, but I am saying that accepting it means that we can at least focus on other things.

281,g971es,False,I Need Advice,258,How to stop feeling like/being used as everyone's trophy girl?,dating,"Everyone I’ve ever “dated” (never turned into serious relationships) has only wanted me because they consider me to be attractive, and I guess I’m what’s called conventionally pretty (not trying to sound snobby, it's just what people tell me). Before you say it, I dress conservatively and I honestly don’t sleep around. I don’t throw my self at guys, and I’m not even on dating apps. I’ve only ever “dated” three guys in my life. With that being said, I’ve still had the bad luck of only meeting people who only like me for my looks. They’re not even your typical player types - they start out really nice. But eventually they stop even trying to get to know me or my personality. It’s not like I’m dumb or boring - I have a master’s in Economics and have hobbies outside of that. But no matter how educated/interesting I could be, nobody wants to get to know me for who I am. Interestingly enough, even though I’ve made it clear that I won’t sleep with someone unless I’m in a relationship, these guys still keep inviting me over to only makeout with them, and then they brag about it to their friends.

To me this is weird because if sex isn’t on the table and they don’t want to be involved with me on a personal/emotional/serious level, then why stick around for just making out (its not like we’re high schoolers)? I’m 27, and these guys have all been either my age or older. They could easily not get involved with me and go sleep around with everyone else, so why bother? But I digress. Long story short, nobody cares about me as a person - they only care about my looks. I feel like I’m in a limbo; people want to ""date"" me and I have tons of options, but eventually all anyone cares about is how I look and how I make them look to their friends. I don't even feel like dating anymore, because I feel like its just going to be the same thing over and over again - guys only want to keep seeing me because I'm they find me attractive. 

It all feels so fake, and I feel completely disillusioned. Honestly, sometimes I think it would be better to be average looking/not attractive, because at least then you'd know from the get-go that the person you're dating is interested in your personality (I don't mean that hurtfully). I don’t think most people understand how bad it hurts to only be desired for your looks. I feel like nobody will ever want to be a companion to me. I’m happy and secure in myself and being single, but I’m still very lonely and want a boyfriend who sees past my looks. (Also, when I was in grad school, there were a few girls in my cohort who were like gorgeous. They were in serious relationships with guys who loved them and wanted them, so I know its possible. I just don't understand why it hasn't happened for me yet, especially since I really liked all three of those guys I dated).

I do believe some people probably have healthy, functional, non-committed relationships. But, I also believe a lot of people (In my case, guys), who are looking for a non-committed relationship online are full of shit. 

Yesterday, I asked a guy what was he looking for after having talked for a bit, and he basically said that he wanted someone he could go to the movies with, eat out, go on dates and have sex,  but not dating seriously.

To me, this just strikes me as ""I want someone who will be in a pseudo relationship with me, but without any sort of emotional responsibility and commitment from my part"". 

&#x200B;

Obviously, after I discussed things with him, he threw in the ""I'm open to a serious relationship with the right person and if things go well between us"", which in my experience, is a complete lie. 

There's a huge difference for me between getting to know someone slowly and see where it goes vs. the pseudo relationship with no commitment these men want. 

I think this sentence is thrown out to reel you in, and make you think there's hope it will develop into something later, but it most likely never will.

If you are looking for a serious relationship, or actually getting to know people, don't fall for this bullshit. It leads nowhere. If a guy says he wants nothing serious, believe him.

When you ask him where this is going, or if he wants something more, he will deny everything and act like you are crazy, but will try to convince you to stay.

It’s a Hallmark holiday. Not significant. Just another day.

I don’t think I’ll find anyone significant in this country. It’s all games and lack of commitment. Romantic love is like a unicorn and usually fades after seven years. Even between friends. I’ve found that European girls are fast to commit and have a better idea of what kind of guy they like. If after a decade has anyone considered that their SO may exist in another continent. I think it’s funny how contained men are in the states yet you go to places around the world men are free to love and express. Girls in the states preach for more sensitivity and expression yet we find ourselves constantly undermined and understood and largely under appreciated. I’m talking to all the blue collar guys who can’t get a girl to commit due to pop culture and the popularization of man hopping. I refuse to be a serial dater I don’t think it’s becoming. I also don’t find high count in girls progressive. It’s a bit a red flag for most guys since most guys count are naturally low.  I think dating apps bring the wrong people together.

353,c7j60k,False,Giving Advice,31,I think it's important to figure out why you want to date before you start dating,dating,"For the last couple months, I've made a half-assed attempt at dating. I think deep in my heart, I didn't actually want to date and knew that now is not a good time to date. I am already spending 80+ hrs working and studying a week, and there's just no way I can squeeze out time for dating. Recently in a moment of introspection, I realized that all the working plus studying in the last couple years have put me in a pretty bad place, mentally. I'm not depressed or anything, but I am absolutely burnt out. If I were a steak, I'd be well-done with a black crust. I realized that I wanted someone to date because I wanted someone for me to complain to and comfort me, but I also realized that I didn't have the time or the energy to reciprocate if my partner wanted the same from me. Also, since a lot of my friends are in a relationship, I felt pressured to do the same, but then I realized that while they work to live, I live to work. They're all pretty complacent with their careers (which is totally fine) while I'm more interested in gaining as much experience and making as much money as I can. Trying to date with my schedule would have been a disaster, and dating for the sole reason of not being left behind is pretty dumb. Thus, from the very beginning, my motivations to date were tainted.

What I really needed all this time was to find a way to relieve all the stress and do things that I enjoy. Thus, I started practicing yoga recently, and it's been rather incredible. It helped me with my hip pain that's been bothering me for the last year, and I felt very at peace at the end of each class. I'm also planning a trip to the UK, and my plan is to travel to two new countries per year. I've always wanted to travel the world, but I've been so busy in the last couple years that I haven't even left my home state (well except one trip to NYC for work). Essentially, I want to get to a place in life where I can get up every morning well-rested and content rather than scrambled and irritated. Only then do I think I'll be ready to date.

I think a lot of people view dating as a panacea to their problems in life, but this is almost certainly the wrong approach. Until you're in a good place in your own life, you're not really in a good place to date. Dating is give and take, and you cannot expect someone to care for your physical/emotional needs while you're in no place to provide either. If you're feeling stressed, lonely, angry, or anything negative, then that needs to be fixed first. Otherwise, people will see right through you and your problems, and most people don't want to handle that kind of baggage from the get-go. For example, in the past year, whenever I met someone new, I always found myself talking too much about my job to them because I was stressed and kinda turned a conversation into a personal therapy session. I was shocked when I realized that, and if I could see that, then others must have seen right through me. It's no wonder that I didn't make many lasting relationships in the last couple years. A lot of our misery comes from not being able to pinpoint our problems, and life isn't a romantic novel where a mysterious stranger transforms our lives from a shithole to Eden. If you are in a shithole right now, you have to figure out why you're there in the first place and then climb out on your own.

It's as if lately we encourage highly emotional decision-making in dating and rationality is getting lost. When did it become not OK to have some doubts when first getting to know a new person? Why isn't it OK to question or challenge your feelings about a new person? Serious relationships can develop slowly. Can't it be argued that a slow steady relationship build is preferable to quick and careless, so to speak? Using critical thinking in new relationships sounds good to me, rather than going with highly charged instincts.

As Dan Savage is fond of saying, you won't find the ""one."" You should look for someone who is close to the one and round up.

A lot of this comes from the ""paradox of choice"" that is a hallmark of dating today. So many people here seem to throw in the towel at the slightest sign that a potential partner doesn't meet all of their requirements, because there are so many other people to ""try."" But ask any person in a happy, long term relationship, and they'll tell you there are things about their partner that irritate them. That's just how human relationships work.

My advice: figure out what actually matters to you. What are those things that are legitimate deal breakers?

She seemed really interested and was setting times and just seemed keen on meeting up with me.

When the day we would meet up arrived, she told me just a couple of minutes before that she would be bringing her friends (she said 5)*. At first, I said ""ok sure"" but deep down I was pretty nervous because the whole thing was unexpected.

When the time came, she brought like a whole crowd (and I mean like 15 or so [in total]*) of friends and I have never felt this uncomfortable in my life. I knew that all of them knew that I was trying to date their friend, and I just wasn't mentally prepared to handle that [the girls were giggling when I tried to talk to the girl I was originally interested in].

Just when I thought I'd handled them well, she brought in another group... and another group... [4 groups of 5, 3, 4 and 3 in them, and yes, SHE BROUGHT 3 DUDES too]* it was like they took turns and waited outside so that they could specifically come in to talk to me [whenever a group would leave, the next group would come in like the wave system you'd see in a video game lmao]*. I ended up being thrust into conversations with new people that I just didn't want anything to do with for the night, life's been busy enough with all the work I have and I just didn't feel like having small talk with loads of strangers who I knew nothing about. 

[While I was trying not to seem too disinterested while talking to one of them about the stuff they did, out of the corner of my eye I noticed that girl just... observing me and smiling in a funny sort of may the whole time and actively tried not to get into the conversation even when I tried to pull her into it]*.

[Sooner or later]*, they all just ended up just hanging out with each other [outside, leaving me alone in the place]*, so I just left when I realized that I'd rather be spending my time finishing my work than entertaining this sh\*t.

[I was told later that was the place they hung out alot after work and the time I met her was exactly when they left it]*.

I felt like I was humiliated by her and the whole group who's probably laughing at me for not being chatty or charismatic or wimping out.

I know that some girls like to test how well their next potential partner will integrate with their friend groups, but I just felt like she forced me into a social situation that I didn't want to be in, and I now fear ever approaching any other girl ever in my life. They will ruin your day.

So I asked her ""How do you meet people nowadays?"" she chuckled a bit and said ""I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life).""

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said ""Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult."" then I said ""Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person.""

This is the part that hit me. She responded ""That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them.""

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about ""the one"" or ""the one I'll be compatible with"" she was kinda shaking her head and she said ""We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc...""

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

I hear so many comments about not having a girlfriend from my family and coworkers. Either they’ll ask why I’m not getting dates despite explaining myself so many times, or they find ways to make comments about it in conversation. They act like it’s the easiest thing in the world, they’ll say “just go on tinder” even though I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable with the idea of hookups, not that I would even be able to get them. 

The worst part is that everyone is absolutely enthralled by my younger brother, he’s the little darling of our family even though all he does is constantly pump and dump chicks like some kind of pickup artist. He’s a beefy jock type so it makes sense that he’d have more success. But I just feel like they’re always trying to compare me to him because the rest of the family (especially the men) are a lot more like him than me. It’s always been that way. I’m usually the lightning rod everyone gangs up on. 

Here’s the thing. I’m smaller, I’m nerdy, I’m less outgoing. I like to stay inside and read books or discuss various topics. I like myself though. I don’t want to change. I’m sick of feeling like everyone wants me to though and that to be a valid man I have to attract women and to attract women I have to be a certain way. 

You know, I’ve tried. I’ve approached so many women. I believe I have a lot to offer and that I’m not a loser, so I don’t have confidence problem. Whats bothering me is the endless rejections I have come to expect. I’ve kind of given up at this point because I always just know I’ll get rejected. It really hurts constantly feeling worthless and lonely, after a while you begin to think there must be something mentally wrong with you. But you can’t find the reason and that drives you crazy so you try on all these different philosophies about dating but none of them really ever fit.

Now I just want to be left alone to not date and tell people I’m just not really interested. But maybe I’m the biggest hypocrite of all because that’s a greasy lie. The truth is, late at night all I can think about is how nice it would be just to know that somebody I like actually likes me back.

If you can’t afford it, there’s plenty of free online resources to help maybe evaluate your behavior and reflect if you might be doing something wrong. 

Example: (This one guy I was friends with for more than 5 years...great friend initially but I pity the fool who ends up with him. ) This guy comes from a divorced family where mom left. Christian and very dismissive about women. (I’m guessing his mother got tired of the abuse and just got up and decided to leave all her 8 children. Idk) 

One day said he would just buy a wife. He would take all of these girls on dates to see if they would like them and then when they would start to, he’d drop them. 

One day I helped him move and it was raining outside so he offered to drop me off closer to where there was cover from the rain. He then said, “oh you just wanna use me” and then made me walk in the rain with him. He would brag about trying to use his ex-girlfriend because her family was loaded. He talks about getting a girlfriend like it’s buying a toy. 
Things just got worse with him and he became a worse friend so I just stopped seeing him altogether. 

My evaluation of him is that this guy doesn’t even know what a healthy relationship looks like considering all the abuse he’s faced at home and NOW he’s tired of being alone and looking for someone to project all of those insecurities and trauma onto...when in reality he really has a lot of bad behaviors he needs to clean up.

There are so many friends of mine who many would not consider to be attractive at all. However there demeanor and attitude and manners is what has everyone falling for them. Human behavior never changes. We’re just becoming more lazy and want instant gratification for our approaches.

Leave everything you see. Do the 24 month no contact period.

As long as you have no migraines nor other sensitivity to the burnt steak smell that's everywhere in space, even being Space Ex is better than being reminded of her during the 24 months.

Stop judging a book by its cover. Just cus a girl has her shit together and is presentable and attractive doesn't mean you're not worthy or she'll break your heart. Stop being afraid to go for it and give it a chance. Stop being so scared to open your heart.

People think being attractive makes it easier to date and they are wrong. I'm nothing special but sure you can classify me as ""attractive"" and smart and somehow this intimidates some men. Great.

All I want is to find love. Real love with someone  that means something. Why is that so hard?? Sigh. :(

Whenever we will get into a disagreement or an argument (or even if I am being quiet because I’m tired or grumpy) they will get very upset and get very stressed. This usually leads to them banging their head off doors or cutting their wrists or hands until they bleed. 

I have no idea how to help them and I am feeling very alone in this. I don’t want to tell my friends or family incase they worry for me. I have discussed this with my partner and they have downloaded some mental health apps on their phone but I know that they won’t stop.

I have a high sex drive, and while I haven't been in a proper relationship for 5 years I somehow managed to have longer dating phases or FWBs, so at least I got some quite regularly. Now my last 9 months thing fizzled out in December, and since then it's been dry. I hardly get to know new interesting people where I am, and I suck at OLD. So I had ONE date this year, resulting in nothing as the guy started seeing someone else (no hard feelings).
A few weeks ago I adopted a cat. I got one from a family who couldn't afford keeping her, she hasn't been chipped or fixed. And now that poor thing went into heat and is crying for sex. She is crawling through the flat holding her butt up hoping some male cat comes along and notices her. She's longing for affection and making such desperate noises. This is exactly how I feel inside. 
Lucky her, she's getting spayed next week and won't care anymore. I will have to continue this lonely life.

143,fbq03l,False,Giving Advice,48,Absence makes the heart grow fonder,dating,"... it shouldn’t leave you guessing and worried.

What I’m saying is that I see so many posts from people who are so damn unsure and worried about the person they’re dating. They make themselves crazy because they’re trying to decipher what the other person is thinking or feeling and worried whether or not they’re into them.

But dating shouldn’t be like that. You should be sure about what you and the other person want.

And to be honest I used to think that being unsure and self conscious was just part of the game and I’d be so self conscious about every text I’d send, every word I’d say, every action I’d take.

But the truth is that if you find someone who gets you and wants to be with you, you won’t have to bend and break to know where you stand with them. I know this isn’t some sort of groundbreaking epiphany I’m sharing but I want to share it nonetheless.

Dating should be fun. You shouldn’t have to overthink every step you take. And simply put you should be able to be yourself and not question every little thing you do or say.

Because in the end... if the person you’re dating leaves you guessing and worrying when you’re not actively with them... you should move on from them. 

A person who wants to be with and cares about you will let you know and let you feel it. They’ll build you up and give you the attention you deserve. They’ll answer your texts in a timely manner, they’ll take you out to dates, they’ll make time for you even when they’re busy, they’ll build you up when you’re down...

They won’t leave you on read for hours, they won’t flake on you, they won’t be unsure about you, they won’t make you question their intentions. 

Basically I feel as if we should all listen to ourselves and our own feelings more. How that person makes you feel when you’re not around them will tell you so much more about how good they are for you than when you’re with them. 

It’s not even what *they’re are doing but so much more what you yourself are feeling*. 

If a person manages to put a smile on your face even though you haven’t seen them for a few days... that’s where it’s at. If they manage to make you feel down and question your own self worth in that time... do yourself a favor and move on.

103,g2jlv5,False,Venting,119,I miss innocence/youthfulness in dating/romance,dating,"I don’t know if this is even the right place for this post, but I felt the need to get this off my chest. Im a 27 year old male, have only been in about 1.5 real relationships and a couple of young heartbreaks/unrequited love situations.

I found myself reading the initial messages between myself and the first girl i “loved” when i was 18 years old. Classic case of became best friends, had way too many feelings, we couldn’t date for a variety of reasons (religions, family, etc). Eventually I couldn’t handle being just friends and it blew up.

But reading the messages just left me with a huge void for a couple of reasons. 1. The idealistic view I had of love and relationships at that age that has seemingly been destroyed by breakups and failures and heartbreak and aging. I understand that’s a part of growing up and it is normal to view romance and relationships different at 27 versus 18, but it leaves me with a bad feeling nonetheless. 2. I miss how innocent it was. How pure it was. There was no pretense or alternative interpreted meaning behind our conversations. There was no pressure.

Since that time, among other things, I have app dated a lot. Like >60 first dates a lot. And this has seemingly beaten down the aspects that made me so hopeful and joyful about love and relationships to begin with. It has become so formulaic, even when it is moderately successful. The dates are grossly similar, the conversations blur together. Always preparing to be ghosted at any given moment. Always prepared to throw copious amounts of money on a date with someone I may very well never see at again. And at its best, it just becomes this pattern of going on a few dates, before feeling pressured that its time for intimacy/physical intimacy or to decide if this relationship is going anywhere. 

I guess this is more of a way to write my feelings out then seeking any specific advice or guidance. I do wonder if any of you out there feel the same way and if so how you deal with it.

I’m definitely not a master chef, but women I have over seem to like it when I cook for them! It’s also loads of fun to have them involved in making the dish. I make sure to ask for feedback when I’m adding spices or ingredients, and I like to have them help out with chopping things up or other such things — that way the dish isn’t just mine, but theirs too. 


**Wine.** 

A nice wine selection never hurts. It’s a good way to take the edge off of any initial awkwardness if you’re just meeting them, y’know?


**Scents.**

If you’re bringing someone to your place for the first time, it’s good to have a pleasant smell to greet them when they walk in. I like to have little jars of spices and potpourri, as well as scented candles.


**Having a space of conversation starters.**

I like to make my room easy to comment on. This can range from having books on the nightstand, instruments laying out in conspicuous places, posters, that sort of thing. (Of course, I keep it clean and smelling nice too, but that’s a given.)


**A weighted blanket.**

This might sound corny, but it’s frighteningly effective — I have a weighted blanket, and I like to offer people a chance to try it out, usually after a glass of wine or two. I don’t think I need to explain this one.

Back story: My ex and I dated on and off for 5 years. We had a cute start-up story. We both worked in a King Soopers. I was his barista and he was my banker. I asked HIM out on a date. (Trophy points for me). I loved him with everything I had and he was my world. He was my first real love and I cared for him deeper than I ever cared for anyone. Throughout our relationship, I chose not to see how he was mentally and emotionally abusive to me so much so that I completely lost my confidence and who I was as a person. Manipulation really puts a toll on the soul. He officially left me 2 months ago leaving me feeling like everything was my fault while I was already going through a very dark time in my life. 

Present tense: I have been seeing a therapist to try to understand who I am without him. My therapist and I have been very proud of my progress and I found my fire again! Yay me! 
Today I walked up to someone that I've been flirting with and found extremely attractive. We seem to click well and I needed to see where this would lead. I was terrified. Rejection is one of my biggest fears. Despite this, I walked right up to him and asked him out (shaking but tried to portray confidence)... verdict is, he said, ""of course"". 

People of Reddit: Ask him/her out! Take the leap. Find that courage. Remember you are worth alot, and if the other person cant see that, it's alright! As long as you see it and the good ones will see it too. Good luck in the dating world!

Not that this is some new advice that’s never been dispensed before, or even something clever. As a matter of fact, I’ve seen many people suggest this before. I just want to reiterate how important and effective this is: Go out by yourself!

Go to the bars by yourself. Go to shows by yourself. Go to coffee shops and read by yourself. Go for walks, do this, do that, and do it by yourself.

First of all, it will help you get comfortable in your own skin. The first few times might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’ll pass the more you do it. You’ll notice over time that you’re more approachable, and you will find that you’ll be more confident in approaching others. It all comes down to enjoying your own company out in the open. 

For me, it was going to the bars by myself when I realized how easy it really was to meet people. And also, don’t be afraid of getting friend zoned. Actually, it’s a good thing to think friends first. Value your new friend as a person and not as a potential companion. If you value them and their time, it may turn into something more, or they may be able to recommend you to one of their friends. 

Go out by yourself with the intention of just being social and increasing your social network. This will build confidence and attraction, and before you know it, you may have someone pining over you.

Dating is hard. Not talking about FWB or casual hookups but dating. Finding someone compatible and interesting enough to spend an evening with. Finding someone willing to fight at least as hard as you do when things get tough. Our time is valuable. Or it should be. 

So we try to get out there. Maybe bars. Maybe the deep dark abyss of the online marketplace. Maybe we join clubs or volunteer. And we don’t meet anyone that we connect with. Or we do, but it’s not reciprocated and in an era of instant gratification we find ourselves competing with greener grass that may not even exist. 

But here’s what I’ve noticed lately. 

As a 43 year old female, I’m noticing so many of the relationships around me. 

A same age friend just recently started a relationship with the man she has fallen in love with.  They originally met in high school but timing wasn’t right. 

Another friend found her forever partner eight years ago at age 35. 

Another friend ended a 12 year relationship where she hasn’t been happy for 11 years. 

Another just celebrated her 12th anniversary with the love of her life. She’s 42. He’s 44. 

Myself? I’ve been in a relationship for just over a year with a man who has shown me in so many ways why past relationships never worked. He’s everything I never thought possible. He is my anything but not my everything. We met online a week after I proclaimed to someone that my life is pretty amazing and someone’s going to have to be spectacular to be a part of it. He is. 

So I’m not saying you have to be mid 40’s to find the relationship you crave.... not at all. I’m saying that it took an awful lot of us 40+ years to truly figure out what we wanted and to find the courage to say no when our relationships fell short. In that time, we learned a lot about what we didn’t want. We learned a lot about ourselves. We built careers. We raised kids (some of us) and in the end, we allowed our journey to shape us without giving up hope for what we desired in life. A partner. In every sense of the word.

I (24F) go through weeks where I might get one match, maybe two if it's close to a holiday.

Also, most of the messages I receive are guys ""complimenting"" my body and messaging inappropriate or unwanted sexual advances without any provocation.

In my opinion, and this comes only from my personal experience and observations of others is that if you are still within a year of getting together, you are still learning about who the other person is.

You are learning who they are, which is part of the beautiful game of dating and of life.

457,ec7e39,False,Other,34,I feel like I’m actually doing this right for once,dating,"I’m (20m) having my third date with this lovely gal(21F) on Friday. We’re going bowling! We’ve been going at this slow pace that I’ve never gone before, and I haven’t had anything like it. My last actual girlfriend was unable to go on dates because her family was controlling and didn’t know about me. Her mom tracked her phone, watched her like a hawk. So we only saw each other at school. Her mom questioned her when she saw me at my McDonald’s job for 5 minutes. Another girlfriend I had after her only lasted 3 weeks and we only had one date and then saw each other and fucked 2-3 or more times a day. That was nice, besides her emotional instability. That was when I was living in Orange County. Here, in my small hometown, I figured I wouldn’t meet anyone because there was no one to meet. I was wrong.

I met her when I saw her in the building I’m always in at the college, which is the theater building (I’m a music major). She was panicking looking for her wallet and I helped her look. I did some circuits around the inside of the building and she went to the student center to the lost and found. I kept looking and I made a circle around the building. She came back a while later and I was still looking. I stopped for a minute to practice piano but something just pulled me into looking. I couldn’t just stop. No way. So I saw her in the theater again and she was kind of amazed that I was still looking. We exchanged names and went on our way. Next time I saw her she was working at the local grocery store and she shook my hand, said she actually found her wallet. I told her she could find me at the theater building Mondays and Wednesday’s. We saw each other again soon after that and basically said we should hang out but we didn’t exchange contact info. Next time we saw each other was the 50th anniversary concert at the college and I performed with the vocal jazz group and she sung with the chamber choir. She gave me her number but I think it was a texting app. She never responded. I don’t think I saw her for another 3 weeks and I almost completely forgot about her. I was going to sleep on one of the couches in the theater building  and she got my attention and we added each other on Facebook and that’s when I asked her on a date.

This slow pace that we’re going feels like it’s going lightning speed. That’s because it feels natural, and she’s actually interested in me as a person. For the first date we got coffee. That was really nice but super nerve wracking. I ordered a mint tea with honey and lemon because my voice was shot and I had a performance that night (I was supposed to be on vocal rest but I made an exception). When we first sat down I froze up. I kept opening my mouth but no words came out. I visibly expressed some level of frustration and then I excused myself to the bathroom, splashed some cold water on my face and came back. It was all good after that, but I think my nervousness made her nervous too. We ended up talking for 2 hours and played chess (we didn’t finish though). And I think the staff was lowkey stalking us because they thought the date was cute. When we parted I thought about kissing her, but I didn’t and we only hugged. Overall it went well. Her eyes were quite dilated I noticed and I’m sure mine were too.

Next date we went to a nice restaurant and saw Tom Hanks A Beautiful Day in the neighborhood (I HIGHLY recommend the movie, especially on a date!). When we were at the restaurant I sort of confessed my crush on her by casually slipping in “the crush is real” in another context but implying the double meaning. She did tell me that this was the nicest date she’s ever been on. We were planning on seeing frozen 2 but it was showing too late. When we saw the movie it was top 10 one of the most emotional movies I ever saw. I cried and she definitely noticed. But I had my arm around her the entire time, and when it got to the part in the movie where the journalist was asking Mr Roger’s wife what it was like to be married to a living saint, and her response being that she doesn’t like that word because it implies that that way of being is unattainable. I said “what a beautiful way to be” I looked at her and we kissed. A lot. I put my other arm around her and she held my hand. When it was over I told her about an emotional self growth/self love moment I had. I drove her home and she made me absolutely melt because I walked her to her door and we kissed, talked some, I looked to my left and she moved forward to kiss me on the cheek. Something about that made my knees weak. Before she went in, she came back out and said “one more” and kissed me again.

Melted.

What a beautiful experience. It was genuine, it was a lovely connection, and I could argue that it was a spiritual experience. I felt 100% myself the entire date. I have Asperger’s syndrome and I told her that the first date. She said her brother has it too. That’s an important detail because I spent until I was 16 or 17 with a forever alone mentality, until I had my first real girlfriend that was a toxic relationship, and kinda grew as a person and my self concept changed so radically that I feel like a completely different person. Only recently have I actually considered myself to not be severely socially inhibited.

We’re having our third at the bowling alley and I might take her to a thrift store nearby and the ice cream parlor at the merc if it’s still open. Super excited about that, and she’s looking forward to it too. She’s lovely guys. I’ve got a good one potentially.

53,ebr1nv,False,Giving Advice,197,From experience: Mixed Signals are almost always no intention of actually pursuing a relationship/date. Mixed signals are usually “I like the attention you are giving me” and that’s it.,dating,"I am 35 (male) and I wish I had learnt this years ago. Really “learn it” not just know it. 

In my experience about 99% of the times someone throws you constant curve balls that just means they are playing with you. They are not being mean, their brains deceive them into thinking you know what they are doing. 

Learn this: Even when someone texts you randomly at night, or they go out with you but remain at arms distance, or say nice things about how good they feel around you, BUT won’t become romantic, they are just using your attention.

Become romantic means actively seeking or agreeing to be alone with you at night. Feeling confortable with being alone with you. Seeking or allowing touching and lingering of such touch. Obviously kissing and holding hands. 

Romantic doesn’t mean telling you their secrets. Constant texting. Non flirtatious compliments like “you are sweet” or “you make me happy”. Asking you out on things they want to do but no one would do with them...

Curve balls also include texting you but then leave you hanging when you ask for a date and then changing the subject. Telling you about how awesome you are but then dating someone else. Going out with you, **constantly allowing you to pay** but then telling you they have an early morning and then you seeing in their social media they continued the night somewhere else.

Attraction is almost instant in most cases, if someone wants to feel you and touch you they will soon enough. Don’t waste a lot if time waiting for it to happen. If someone is throwing you curve balls just move on.

I am lost and don't know what to do.",dating,"Since this is a subreddit for dating and my issue is about a break-up, I am not sure if this post is allowed here... However, I think I really need some advice on how to deal with things, since I am completely lost right now. Sorry if it is a bit of a story, but I really feel the need to write this off me.

Around 1,5 years ago, I created post here about how I've met this girl during my roadtrip through the US, after the roadtrip she came over to visit me once again (she lives in another country), and I really started to like her. After this post, we visited each other multiple times, both fell in love and ended up in a relationship. It was great. While it wasn't my first relationship, it surely was different then the ones I've had before: everything felt much more intense: my feelings for her, my happiness every time I saw her, texted her or called her, everything. While normally I wouldn't think a long-distance relationship would be something I'd be interested in (my last relationship before that ended because of the distance), this time it wasn't a problem at all. Everything felt great and for me, it felt like we belonged together.

But ofcourse, no relationship is perfect. Sometimes our personalities collided: while I often say/do things out of emotion, she often did/say things from a more rational point of view and had a hard time showing her emotions to anyone. This resulted in us sometimes not understand each other why the other one did/say something and could cause a discussion. But despite all of this, I was still happy to be with her in the long run. We both worked hard for this relationship.

Last January, the first big issue came. I was at her place and we had a pretty big fight in the morning, which resulted in a break-up. However, I stayed there the rest of the day because I didn't want to leave yet and she didn't want me to leave yet... The evening came and I had to head home (had to drive for 6 hours to get home). Saying goodbye at that moment was horrible. We spend around 30 minutes sitting in my car crying in each others arms, before I eventually drove of. The drive was horrible. I was constantly in tears, couldn't focus on the road so had to stop every time, and even had to vomit a few times. So I texted her how I felt and the situation I was in... and she called me. She was in tears as well, saying we might have made a big mistake. Now, many people are not a big fan of restarting a relationship after a break-up for multiple reasons, but it was obvious here that we both still loved each other and couldn't let each other go yet... We didn't want to pretend nothing happened, so we decided instead of heading fully into a relationship again, we would 'lable' ourselves as 'back to dating' to take some of the pressure off. A week ago I flew to her place once again, and we had an amazing time! No discussions, no fights, everything seemed great.

But then, one week later, she called me. She said she has thought about us and everything a lot, and she said her feelings concerning 'being in love with me' have faded away and she sees me more as a friend. That call broke me. Personally I thought we were heading in the right direction again, but I guess I was wrong. I can't help but blame myself.

Due to the distance, she has send me a letter explaining her feelings. When this letter arrives (it hasn't yet), we will make one final phone call, to give both of us the opportunity to ask questions and make sure no things are being left open. Then, we will break contact for a while. We both don't want to lose each other out of our lives, because we still care too much about each other. We want to continue as friends, but both know that is only possible when I am completely over her and have learned to love her as a friend instead... But thinking about not having contact with her after that call is hard. These last few days were horrible. I can't focus on my work or study (I am a student pilot, so I had to cancel all my flights for this week due to a lack of focus), I start crying in the most random moments... I am a mess. I don't want to sound pathatic, but my heart is broken and I don't know how to get over this... I have the feeling I have lost my soulmate and love of my life, and I can't stop blaming myself that it now is over...

_-_-_-_-_-_-_--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-



Made this today during the time on which I should have been on a date had I not been stood up once again. Figured I'd put my frustration to use with something so that you guys can have a laugh either with me or at me.

In all seriousness though, I am doing my very best to keep any frustration and jadedness out of my interactions but it's getting harder and harder. It's starting to look like I'm going to have to take a break.

Why do girls agree to a date enthusiastically and then either ghost or just not show up? What would be the harm in saying ""sorry I'm not interested"" and unmatching? At least we wouldn't be wasting each other's time!

Since I started seriously doing the online dating thing 2 months ago, I've had 21 girls agree to a date in principle. Of those, 1 has come through. 12 have flaked (even though 10 of those confirmed they were in fact coming the morning of and just never did) and 8 have just stopped replying when asked when they were free. I mean just... why? I see girls complaining in their profiles all the time that they're looking for someone who's serious, that they want someone to finally take them on a date, someone who makes plans and sticks to them. These are the same people who then turn around and mess me around instead of just letting me know they're not interested when I ask them to meet up. 

And I get what people say about why people ghost, but the fact is most of these situations we haven't had each other's social media, numbers, last names, addresses or anything like that. Even if I did blow up and go psycho on them (which I absolutely wouldn't) it would be a matter of unmatching and that would be that!

It's the exact same flow chart as approaching in any other form of communication. If it's online dating that frustrates you, perhaps consider reflecting on what you do differently online versus in person. If it's the ""low"" percentage of success then perhaps consider reflecting on why you hold yourself to such an unattainable standard. ",2019-02-11 20:45:48

506,e2s7d6,False,Venting,239,The apps are wearing me down,dating,"So I matched with a guy on Tinder last night and we talked for like 3, 4 hours. It was a good conversation IMO, and toward the end of it I asked if he wanted to meet this week and he said he could do Friday. We continued talking on and off today, just general chatting because I was working but I wasn't unresponsive. I just went to message him and see how his night's going and saw that he unmatched me.

I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things. I know it was just a few hours but it seemed like we have a lot in common and have similar senses of humor, and I was excited about the date. 

The carelessness people treat each other with on dating apps is just so frustrating and these tiny rejections are starting to wear me down. I took a 5-month break from OLD at the beginning of this year and think I might need another one.

Edit: Probably should have mentioned this to begin with but want to add that this feeling is the culmination of 10 years of being on apps on-and-off and watching people get less and less considerate as time goes by. This particular incident isn't an isolated one; it's something similar happens more often than not when I match with someone. This isn't me trying to say anyone owes me anything if we haven't even gone out yet, but it's hard not to get bogged down by it.

Also I've asked guys out after just a few messages and then had them turn out to be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. I'd rather waste a few hours chatting online and getting to know them a bit than actually spend the time getting ready for a date and the money on drinks only to find out they're a piece of shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e2s7d6/the_apps_are_wearing_me_down/,329,"<I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things>

301,g6mzh6,False,I Need Advice,191,First tinder match came back around after I lost weight and now it's really shaken my confidence. I'm not sure how to get past it.,dating,"I started using tinder for the first time earlier this year after a pretty large amount of weight loss >50lbs. I was feeling confident for the first time in a long while and matched with some great guys as well as some not so great ones. The first guy I actually ended up sleeping with got really weird after the sex and basically gave me a rather soft-handed rejection in the form of telling me he was going to be too busy to see me again. It stung obviously, because I liked him as a person and wouldn't have minded seeing him again, but I just let it go and moved on. 

Spent the following couple months since then making new matches, going on dates, having a pretty good time overall! During that time I lost another pretty fair amount of weight, about 20 pounds. Well, a couple weeks ago that first match and I started chatting again on instagram. Nothing major, in fact it was pretty boring conversation that we both let die fairly quickly. UNTIL I posted a progress photo of my most recent weight loss. 

Within an hour that first match messaged me, telling me that I had slimmed down and was flirting with me, actually fun to talk to again. It only took a few messages for him to ask if I wanted to see him again. I had a nagging suspicion so I asked him straight out if he only wanted to see me again because I'd lost weight. 

He admitted that yes, while he'd thought I had a great personality, was intelligent and fun to spend time with, when we'd slept together,  it turned out that I was bigger than he'd thought (despite having non-edited, true to life full body pics on my profile, AND having gone on a couple dates with me in person) which definitely explains some of the comments he made to me after the sex, as well as the brush off 'I'm too busy to see you again.'

That was a couple weeks ago and the whole thing has really shaken my confidence. I've lost a huge amount of weight but my body is not perfect by any means and it never will be. I've had some great matches lately that I have completely let fizzle just a couple chats into it because when quarantine is all over and we actually have a chance to meet in person, even if the chemistry is great, I'm scared they're just going to be disappointed if I allowed them to see my body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/g6mzh6/first_tinder_match_came_back_around_after_i_lost/,527,How your face?

This is where I almost lost my shit because the reality for tons of guys is a lot worse including a few of my best friends. A lot of my friends are basically invisible to women to the point there they've stopped trying all together. Lets just say some of these guys aren't what society deem as attractive and I'm assuming Girl B also falls into this category. The difference is I wouldn't blame all the women for not being attractive to me or my mates. You can't be angry at people who aren't attract to you.

31,f8dpgf,False,Tinder/Online Dating,83,RCMP saved my embarassing butt after a tinder date,dating,"So I went to a tinder date's condo recently. He came down and to get me so I didn't have to buzz to get in (i.e., fob to get into building and elevator). 

We had dinner and got into it. Now, we realized we weren't a match so after we were done and the alcohol leaves my system, I was hoping to leave without waking him or any pleasantries. I did exactly that. 

Once I got to my car I realized I FORGOT MY PHONE. My phone with my driver's license, credit card, and more importantly, Google map to get me home!  It was 2:30am at this point and I was going through the directory at his building to find his name but couldn't find it. 

I didn't know his last name. I didn't know his buzzer code. I couldn't get back upstairs, I couldn't drive, and I did not have the direction to go home. 

Thankfully, the RCMP (royal Canadian mounted police) station was across the street so I had the most dignified walk of shame to the police. After explaining the situation, one of them just went into the station to get the master fob to the building so I can knock on my date's door instead of getting a full report... Since it was clearly embarrassing and I didn't know my date all that well for them to look him up...

The officers were super nice about it. One of them reassured me that they face different situations everyday and that as long as I was safe and could get home, he was happy. The other officer made me feel better by saying at least now I can have a great tinder story plus a potentially good online review after I get my phone back to tell the world how the RCMP really did serve the community that night. 

The best part was, once they got me into the building and up the elevator, they hid in the corner so my tinder wouldn't see them when he opened the door in his boxers. 

Let me just publicly praise the Coquitlam RCMP pair who got me through a tough and awkward night. Thank you for protecting and serving last night. I've never felt more safe and part of the community than I did last night when tinder opened the door.

Tldr: I left my phone at tinder date, didn't know how to contact him so the police helped out. I got my phone back with a great little tinder story.

740,ayneb3,False,,208,You have more to offer than just your physical appearance.,dating,"Just a little reminder to those who are online dating (or dating in general). The right people well accept you for all of you and the wrong people aren’t meant to be in your life. 

Edit: 

To clarify, I didn’t mean that physical appearance does not matter at all. I’m just saying that there is more to offer than just looks. 

It’s important to maximize your attractiveness: workout, eat healthy, groom yourself, dress nicely, take care of yourself in general so that it increases the chances of getting a date. When you look good, you feel good and people will feel that energy about you. You must ultimately love yourself first and not expect people to love you if you cannot love yourself. You cannot pour from an empty cup. 

I do agree that men have a harder time dating than woman. For the simple fact that woman are generally more desired than men etc and I can’t relate because I am not a male. 

I was just making a point to remind people that you have more to offer the world and the opposite sex than just your physical appearance, but this post turned into a good discussion and I appreciate everyone’s input and comments. :) 

Loneliness and rejection hurt but it’s important to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess too or dating will hurt your self-esteem and will ultimately make you have a harder time out there in the dating world. Remember that rejection isn’t always about you and try not to identify with it too much. Good luck everyone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ayneb3/you_have_more_to_offer_than_just_your_physical/,194,"while I can relate, I also have some thoughts (30F and obese just fyi, no where near a 10 for those wondering :-p )

* Physical looks can be an indicator of good hygiene and if you take pride in yourself. Not all things, because some of it comes down to genetics and psychical features that cannot be changed, but grooming, dressing right, skin care, ect are all important.
* I am at the point in my life where I can accept my self flaws in and all. I want someone who can also look at their reflection and take pride in what they see.
* I want someone who will looks presentable to my family and friends. Not as army candy, but just as showing this person in my life takes good care of himself and therefore, will take good care of me.
* Your personality and intelligence have to shine through in your pics.  There are men that I swipe right on but debate for a bit because I might not be immediately super attracted to them, but something about their pictures intrigues me; they have a cat, they took a picture with a comedian I like, they look like they have friends and are the life of the party, they are  reading a book i find interesting, ect. 
* I think men have unrealistically high standards for women. I have known men who complain about being rejected by women, but they are only going for a certain type. I think it is important to know the ""lane"" you are in and adjust your expectations accordingly. There will always be exceptions to the rule, but overall, this will save you time and disappointment. 
* For example, when i swipe I am looking at pictures thinking; Does it look like we could meet at a bar and have a fun time on a Friday night. Do we look like a couple that that people would expect to see together. I swipe left on many SUPER hot guys on Tinder because I just know that it wouldn't be work out. 
* If you don't want to be judge on looks, stay away from the apps. Try personal ads! A lot of place still run them in their local paper or gazettes (RIP Craiglist Personals). These focus more on writing styles and what you are looking for. 
* However, I can tell you I take a lot from the dating apps (tinder& bumble mainly) then just physical appearances. Does he know how to take a proper selfie A guy who takes a picture from a bad angle and frowning just shows a lack of social intelligence and suaveness.  What activities is he doing? Sense of humor in his pics? How does he dress?
* For example: I think my dating app pictures tell you that I: am obese but dress feminine and in flattering clothes. I can be glammed up or dressed down. I have a bright smile that shows my bubbly personality, I have attractive friends that I like to go out with and be social with. Those are all physical things that you can gather from my profile and I think it says a lot about me and what type of girl I am. As mentioned at the top, I'm not a 10.  I'm a high end estimate of a 6.3 maybe for guys that are even into big girls to begin with.
* Last but not least, I want to be with someone who is attracted to me psychically. I don't wanna be with someone who has to force themselves to see through my personality to like me. I've hooked up with guys who have later told me they just weren't into dating fat girls. and while I appreciated their honestly, I wish they had told me that before they we hooked up.

219,bj9jle,False,,65,Most important character trait in a partner: The capacity for self reflection,dating,"Honestly, out of all the things that terrify me, a partner who lacks the capacity and/or willingness to self reflect has to be at the tippy top. And people don't discuss it enough!

 If you don't know why you do shitty things... you're just going to keep doing them... But that’s only one part of the equation. 

if you're not brave enough to move away from you're current identity, to move into the unknown, to take steps towards self repair, you're going to remain in a ""woe is me"" complex forever. Being upset with your actions is not enough. Self pity is not enough... (Adlerian psychological theory covers this extensively) 

Say you cheated in a previous relationship, my biggest question would be, what did you take away from that? What did you learn about yourself. If you cheated due to low self esteem and a need for outside validation.... and you don't consciously know that... you're 100% going to be doing that shit again because you're flying with blinders on...

 You need to realize that your reactions to what's in front of you are often reactions to dredged up feelings from the past that are being resized to appear congruent to the present.

If you can't accept that you're wrong in certain situations. If you can't confront parts of yourself that are uncomfortable...parts that may be at odds with the idealistic image of yourself, if you're not open to the possibility of having your ego demolished and rebuilt, you're a hopeless cause.

723,d9e1zl,False,Giving Advice,22,Some Things I've Been Doing to Get Over My Ex,dating,"Some things I've done to help me get over my ex dumping me. The basic idea behind all of these is that you should do thoughtful things you would've done for your ex, but now just do it for strangers/people you care about.  Some examples:

1. Randomly bought my roommate fudge and ice cream when he had a bad day.
2. Gifted flowers to some of my girl neighbors, with a note wishing them a great day.
3. Took myself and/or a friend on a date.  I personally like smoothie dates.
4. Danced to my favorite music in my room. Rediscovered old songs, discovered new ones.
5. Volunteered. I started doing manicures for old people at a retirement home.  I've never done or had a manicure in my life. It's been a fun learning process haha.
6. Worked out.  I'm already a pretty fit guy, but now that I have the extra motivation you can bet I'm gonna be setting some new PRs.
7. Dove even deeper into hobbies.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and music production have been saving my ass.

Some inspiration to those with an aching heart that are trying to figure out healthy ways of not just sitting in bed obsessing over their ex.  To recap: **Do shit you would've done for her while you were in the relationship, but now do it for others.**

827,grl63n,False,Venting,37,"You might be the one pushing them away too, even if you are interested",dating,"Allow me to explain i’ve found out through therapy that you can push someone away with other kinds of behavior that’s not outright rejecting, ghosting or fading (even if you like them!). What happens is if i’m interested in someone by default i expect them to not like me back and subconsciously i try to push them away, i’ve observed my behavior and this is what i gathered.

-Overtexting and then pulling back in an attempt to seem chill, this just confuses the other person and makes them lose interest (Hot and cold behavior).

-Not being able to manage my body language, mine is very closed off and guarded, this has been very challenging to work on.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to answer questions or to  engage in a conversation in a personal way that allows the other person to know you better, so i come across again as either not interested or confusing (you can ask a lot of questions, yet not speak about myself and making it seem as if i’m closed off). This could be solved i think, by allowing yourself to let yourself be you, not what you think you should be and if your personalities don’t mesh at least you were honest.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to be physically receptive to flirting, like expecting them to do so but it reads as not wanting to be touched if that makes sense. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with having sex, but shutting off the sexual part of attraction (personally i don’t have sex unless i’m in a relationship), but what i mean is that i don’t initiate flirting making me seem like i’m not interested in physical touching.

-I never state that i’m interested and look for signs the other person doesn’t find me attractive or interesting, then i start backing off with no explanation, making them back off as well and thus making a cycle.

-I’m afraid that the moment that i start liking them and let my guard down i will hurt them/scare them with my affection, this is a big and tough one for me because i tend to get attached quickly (i hardly find anyone that i really like and tend to feel really strong about them) and i couldn’t advice someone on this because i don’t know exactly the reason behind it.

-Thinking i’m not interesting enough and that i should have a million hobbies to be even considered dateable, so it becomes an obsession with being perfect for the people i like and never let my true personality show.

-Trying to burn them out subconsciously by being clingy, then when they back off i feel really insecure and i don’t reach out to them, thus coming off as selfish or without a backbone.

Essentially i’m emotionally unavailable subconsciously, but it overlaps with my desire to be in a relationship, if you’re like me and feel like people pull away from you, really consider whether you’re pushing them away in ways you don’t know.

Even if it goes well and I got her number, the next day she has more than likely forgotten about the interaction and I don't why a girl would have enough reason to meet up somewhere again because of a 10 minute conversation she had with a stranger. Like why would a girl meet up with someone again because of some small talk; does that even happen? 

The only other circumstance I can figure working out is if you see a girl often enough and talk enough that you can maybe get a chance, but once you are not in college, apart from maybe the workplace, I don't think too many situations like that exist.

My boyfriend of 4 months believe it or not we met on tinder. We both had genuine interest, good intentions, and the chemistry and communication was there, and we worked for it. Not everything was perfect; we misread each other, misinterpreted, etc. but we really liked each other and saw potential. 

I had been single for well over 4 years up until him. Lots of “almosts”, flings, short term dating that fizzled out, and a handful of “casual” encounters that were mostly fruitless and disappointing. I used tinder, okcupid, rarely bumble.. 

The day I met him was seriously in my head the last time I was going to use an app. I was going to let it go, and wait for the universe to make its magic. And then we matched, and that was that.

277,chi1a0,False,Giving Advice,176,Probably the number one situation that people ask me about (as a dating coach).,dating,"This has come up so often, and I see it come up here so often, that I felt it would be prudent to discuss it quick.

The number one thing people seem to ask about is what it means when someone doesn't reach out often, only replies when replied to, makes excuses such as being busy, or if they should reach out if the person isn't being very attentive, or has ghosted in some way (or all the way).

Let me make this very clear to all of you: This means they're not interested.

This is literally rule number one in dating: If a person is into you, they will reach out. No matter how busy they are, they will find the time. They will wake up saying good morning to you, and they will go to sleep saying goodnight. The more into you they are, the more they will shower you in attention. Even people who don't normally do that still will for the right person. It's undeniable, and anyone who claims they have never done that to anyone before--well, you've never met someone you've been super into then.

I've seen the same people have huge interest who reach out a ton, who suddenly lose interest and hardly reach out at all. The correlation is almost perfect, and it's basically a 100% thing. I've yet to meet an outlier on this one. I've HEARD people claim to be, then noted them acting this out to the letter. I've concluded this is just human nature, straight up simple end of story.

Everyone does this. I have seen people who never do this suddenly do this, exclaiming that they had never felt that way about someone before. When someone blows you away, you will behave like this. I don't care if you're 16 or 46--you'll do it.

When someone begins to fade, the easiest experiment you can do to find out if they're still interested in stop reaching out. If you feel like you're doing all of the initiating of contact/dates, then stop reaching out entirely. If by 2-3 days you haven't heard from them at all, remove them from the dating app you're likely on, and remove their number from your phone, because they're slow fading and you're about to have your time wasted.

Move on. Talk to 5 people at the same time--or 10 if you have to. Set up a date with someone different every day of the week if you can get away with it. This stuff is almost completely a numbers game. Eventually you just meet people who are more into you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/chi1a0/probably_the_number_one_situation_that_people_ask/,566,"You will know the one. Stop worrying about it. You will be into them and they will be into you. God won't put them in your life until you are ready. Stop listening to other people. Unless they have TRUE love or know who Jesus Christ is, they are just as clueless as you. If you need a wingman to get laid, sure. Other than that, trust yourself. You will have no fear when you meet the one because it will be perfect harmony. Everything will click. You will feel like you would kill someone to protect them as a guy. Women probably will see your children already. I don't know, I am not a woman. I have been close to TRUE love though. It was just a glimpse God gave me to understand it wasn't me that was just a chicken. I just didn't want to lie to women. It was never right. I  found myself though and when I am ready she will be there. I know that. When you become a TRUE Christian, your reward is God. God is LOVE. ",2019-07-25 02:56:25
659,ajrufa,False,,49,You're good enough,dating,"I just realised how silly I sounded the other day, I have started dating someone new and the other day I was thinking why wouldn't he just leave and find someone better and why does he think I'm good enough to date.

But we all have something to offer and things that make us unique and great as people. I have new hobbies which I'm interested in, I love my family and friends a lot, I have a good job which I like to work hard at and I'm passionate about certain projects that help people.

It was so stupid to think I might not be enough, how much more does someone have to be? We are all humans and make mistakes, but most of us do genuinely want to do the right thing and if you're not good enough for someone perhaps they're just trying to get the unattainable and it's not on you.

So unapologetically be yourself and someone will truly love you for it because what is love worth if they only love a persona or idea of you? What's the point in that?

UPDATE: This post is not at all to discourage self-improvement, if you are not happy where you are, then always keep improving and strive to be where you want to be. However just don't be so hard on yourself while dating and act like the other person is on a pedestal and you're not good enough, they're dating you for a reason and if it doesn't work out then your value as a person isn't lowered.

I matched with my “ex boyfriend” from 2nd grade and he (M26) insisted we hang out, since he’s wanted to see me for years now. We met downtown for drinks and caught up, and I immediately felt the vibe was weird. He seemed really nervous and fifteen minutes into the “date” he said we could go back to his place to hang out and play guitar (btw.. he lives with his parents still). The date continued and I could tell he wasn’t picking up on my jokes or sarcasm. 

We went to an open mic at another bar and I said we should go on, since he kept talking about how he plays guitar and is in a couple bands and I do stand up comedy. He was pretty against it and was adamant about not going up, so I said we could leave if he didn’t want to do it. We leave and I suggest we go to a sushi place down the block. 

On the way, he tries to pull a “you have something on your face, what is that” weird, creepy, non consensual kiss thing and I rejected it immediately. The whole night he kept saying I was being “mean” (I wasn’t— I’m seriously overly nice but can be a bit sassy/snarky at times). We finally got to the sushi place and he said he wasn’t hungry so I still ordered for myself and got us a bottle of hot sake. 

The look on his face when he sat down— it looked like he wanted to kill me. Seriously, it looked like he HATED me. But I kept it cool and was asking if he liked the sake, gave him some history of rice wine, kept talking to make it less awkward. He finally said “you’re kinda annoying me.”

I thought he said something about the sake, so I said “it’s an acquired taste.” “No, I said you’re annoying me.” “Oh.. we’ll I’m an acquired taste.” He then condescendingly asked how long my last boyfriend and I were together and if I annoyed him as much. I told him that he was being rude and apologized for annoying him, but he was free to leave if he wanted to since the sushi was for me anyway. He said “yeah, I’m gonna go.” And he left. 

I’m not even upset. This guy had zero, and I mean ZERO, sense of humor. He couldn’t pick up on my sarcasm to the point that he literally thought I had watched only Beavis and Butthead for the last 10 years. 

I think, and my friends agree, that he was just upset that I wasn’t going to hook up with him that night and that’s why he got so upset. But it still hurt my feelings and was incredibly embarrassing to be left at a restaurant. I really don’t think I was being annoying (I’m a phenomenal date—especially first dates). He was just a huge douche canoe. And even if I was annoying, he could have gone about it a different way.

I was obviously pretty upset because he was the first guy in a long time that I could actually get along with and felt comfortable with. All he really said was that he needed time to himself... I can’t help thinking that it was something to do with me?? I’m kind of hoping he’ll come around and we could try again once he’s figure his stuff out... at the same time I only really knew him for maybe a couple weeks, but it sucked because he’s a good guy. Thoughts? Opinions?

We left the conversation at that, I told him he could reach out to me whenever and to take care of himself... so like... that’s it???? Should I still have some hope???? Ahhhhh I'm a hopeless romantic and this one kind of hurt despite the circumstances

332,a32ms4,False,Tinder/Online Dating,203,"My Tinder ""Date"" From Hell",dating,"Quick prequel - was dating this guy for awhile, really liked him. Long story short, he said he couldn't see himself marrying me but still wanted to date (i.e. fuck), so I broke up with him. Little bit of time went by, and I decided to get back into the dating pool via Tinder, even though I hate dating aps.

Matched with this guy ""Chad,"" hit it off via message. Good looking, educated, sense of humor. After a couple weeks exchanged numbers and continued chatting. Discussed meeting several times but our schedules clashed.

One day Chad texts me and asks to Venmo me some money to treat myself to a couple bottles of wine. Sounds awesome, I oblige. Also asks if I'd like to come over to his house after work. Says other people will be there, no pressure if I feel uncomfortable, etc. I actually didn't feel weirded out at all by this point (and I carry), so I agree.

I bring the wine (and my CC), and head over to Chad's after work. He is there, and two of his friends. They all seem perfectly nice and normal.

First weird thing: 4 total kitchen cabinets are completed ripped apart/smashed. This is a newer kitchen, nice cabinets. I inquire about the damage and Chad says he was ""mad,"" so he ""punched them."" Decide not to say anything additional about it. I grab an unopened beer for myself, then a coffee. Everything else is fine until I'm done with the coffee. One of the friends leaves, and a few minutes later it's like someone has flipped a switch on Chad. He completely loses his shit out of nowhere. Throws a metal barstool across the house, screaming like a lunatic child, chucks his phone into the kitchen wall. Remaining friend steps outside to smoke. Chad comes up to me out of nowhere and BITES my leg. I hit him in the head and he stops momentarily and then BITES me AGAIN. I hit him in the head hard as shit this time, and he stops. I ask for the bathroom, he walks over to show me and I don't know how else to explain this, but quite literally hurls himself up into the air in the hallway and lands flat on his back outside the bathroom door. Chad then gets mad that he has hurled himself onto the floor and punches a hole through the adjacent wall. I politely excuse myself to the restroom, in utter shock.

Come out of the bathroom, Chad approaches me and starts crying. Absolutely wailing. Going on about how is father is sick, this is a terrible time in his life, blah blah blah. I'm ready to get the fuck out but am concerned this guy may actually hurt himself and at the time felt some sort of responsibility to try to prevent that. I calm him down some, Chad's friend comes back in. Friend is suggesting we go fishing. Chad says he will, but would prefer to stay at the house to ""get to know me better."" No way in hell.

I agree to fishing so I can ""follow"" in my car and bail. Walk outside, Chad's friend gets in the driver's seat of Chad's car. I walk around and let the friend know I will be following in my car, he's cool with it. I get into my car (door is still open). Chad realizes I am not in his car, storms over and demands/begs I ride with them. Is completely adamant, but I stick to my guns and refuse. He says to ""go the fuck home then,"" and slams my car door shut. He then gets in the passenger seat of his car with his friend, and they drive off.

I sit for a few minutes calming down, processing, and pulling up GPS to go home. Start driving through the neighborhood. Make it around 3 corners and stop dead. Chad is standing in the middle of the road, facing me. He runs at my car FULL SPRINT, and slams both hands on the hood as hard as he can and runs them down like some sort of horror movie scene. He then runs over to my side, tries opening my door and rear door, screaming for me to open them. I decline. He punches my window, then the rear. I slam in reverse and floor it around the corner as he chases me on foot. Slam the car back in drive, and peel out of there as fast as I can. See the friend pulling back into the neighborhood and honk but don't slow down. I heard him yell ""sorry"" as I drive by.

&#x200B;

The next day Chad's friend found me on fb and messaged me apologizing, saying he has never seen that behavior before. Chad also texts me and tries to apologies, saying his friend told him he ""went psycho"" and he doesn't remember anything. I tell him he's lucky I didn't shoot him, and to never contact me again.

I have permanent bruises from the bites.

Please see original post for the story on this.

So I (25F) asked him (37M) to be exclusive a little less than two months ago. He said yes and things were great. Over this period of time we’ve texted a lot and made a ton of effort to see each other. We actually just got back from the Hamptons this weekend. 

Well this morning after we had sex he got in the shower and left his phone unlocked. I really didn’t want to look at it but I was honestly a little suspicious but wanted to rest my nerves by hoping to see nothing. But I was wrong. Still on bumble. Texting a few other women. Even was making plans to meet up with one for a drink TONIGHT. My god I was and still am so fucking upset. I know I had to confront him.

So we’re walking to his work and I just hit him with “you know what, I really don’t like being lied to” and he said “about what?” then I said “remember when I asked to be exclusive a month and a half ago and you said yes? Why did you lie?” he then tries to put the blame on me and says “well you asked me that out of nowhere and I felt pressured to say yes” OHHHHH MY GOD what a big load of shit. I told him that if that was the case why didn’t he bring it up AT ALL within the last month and a half. He didn’t really give me an answer and just said he can’t do this right now because he’s late for work. Then I just said “whatever” and walked the fuck away. Haven’t heard from him since. 

He’s just so shocked he got caught being a shitty ass person.

349,e0ei30,False,Tinder/Online Dating,177,I’ve been off dating apps for 3 months and...,dating,"I’m 23 year old female, and I had been on tinder and bumble for a little over 2 years. Now, I wasn’t very active, but there were days and nights that I was bored and wanted someone to talk to. No harm in that.
But, once I graduated I started to realize I wanted more than just casual conversation; I wanted to find love. 
So I deleted Tinder. I mean, it’s just creepy guys anyway right?
But I kept bumble because it seemed like the way to go. I would talk to multiple guys daily, sometimes we would even exchange phone numbers and snapchats. Some of the guys were douchebags, some were genuinely nice. 
Out of all the guys I talked to, I only met 2 in person. Now, I did get asked on dates, but then most guys would cancel the day (one time the hour) before. 

Online dating for me was a never ending “talking” phase. People wanted to talk daily, but never wanted anything to go past a screen. I had fights, anxiety, even tears over some of these guys.

I was having relationship problems without being in a relationship .

You may say that speaks more to me and my personality rather then there’s, but I think it shows what online dating really is for different people. For me, I was looking for a relationship. I was looking for “the one.” While many guys were looking for “the one...for right now.” They we’re looking for a distraction, not a commitment.
I would complain to my friends saying “no one wants me,” and i had data to back it up. Guys would ghost me, use me, drop conversations, and it felt like I was undesirable.
 
Finally I decided enough was enough. I deleted Bumble. I was free ... so I thought. 

The first week I felt like I was on withdrawal. Who was I to talk to? What if that one cute guy messaged me back and now can’t get ahold of me? What if, what if what if. Those two words rang in my head daily. 

By week two I had started to notice that there were men around me that were nice and caring, but I still was tempted to re download the app because checking it had become so routine. 

By the end of month one I felt completely free. I felt a new found sense of confidence. If a guy really wants to be with me, he’ll ask me out. I’m worthy of being chased and I’m tired of chasing. 

By month two I had started to see my life rebuild. I was putting all the energy I had reserved for boys and put it into my relationship with friends, family, God, and myself. I started creating my own affirmation instead of looking for someone else to give it to me. I even was asked on a few dates with guys I met IN PERSON. 
I guess I realized that I’m special and I should be treated as such.

Now that I just finished my third month I feel like I should get a sober chip or something. Online dating/constant affirmation is addicting. It’s so easy to make virtual boys have power in your life. 

I still feel lonely sometimes, but the difference is I know I’m not alone. I know that these temporary feelings are just that: temporary. 

A right swipe won’t fix them, and that’s okay. 

I just wrote this to share my story and to encourage a young woman or man today. If you feel like a dating app or website is bringing you stress, lowering your self esteem, or gives you anxiety, I challenge you to 2 weeks free of them. 

It’ll be hard, but I can safely say it’s the best thing I’ve done for me, myself, and I.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e0ei30/ive_been_off_dating_apps_for_3_months_and/,475," This is just such a foriegn strange issue to me.

351,beopvr,False,Giving Advice,157,I've tried Reddit's dating advice for a year. This is what I've learned:,dating,"About a year ago, I just got out of a long-ass relationship and wanted to date but had no idea how. So I read a lot of Reddit posts about dating advice. 

&#x200B;

The most common advice was, ""Go to Meetups or any social gatherings and make female friends"". This strategy was based on two things: 

1. Online dating sucks.

2. You can develop your friendship into a romantic relationship or be introduced to someone who is interested in you through female friends.

&#x200B;

So I tried the advice above for a year and found out, **this is not a good strategy.** I went to a lot of Meetups and I can tell you this, Meetup is overrated. However, I was able to make lots of female friends (I had to try so freaking hard), and this is where the strategy starts to show flaws. The chance of developing a friendship into a romantic relationship exists (low), but the problem is that it takes a long time to figure out if it's gonna work or not. It can take years. 

&#x200B;

You can't expect your friends to find your lover for you. Friends are just friends, you can't have another intention. You're on your own!

&#x200B;

So, what you should do? Here's my advice (and this advice is also coming from my female friends). Don't try to be a friend. **Just ask out for a date within 1-3 meetings**. And move on. I know it's really awkward and embarrassing. But this way you don't waste your time. You can increase your chance of being accepted if you build a good friendship with that person, but again, it takes too much time. And the chance is just a **slight difference.** You can ask dozens of people out for that period of time. Do the math. 

&#x200B;

I agree that online dating sucks. But look around you, most couples nowadays met through online dating sites. I know that the chance is very low, but it is what it is. **Unfortunately, there's no better way.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/beopvr/ive_tried_reddits_dating_advice_for_a_year_this/,473,"1.

931,bcps8l,False,Giving Advice,28,Taking Time Out: Thoughts and lessons after a year off from dating,dating,"Hey peeps. So as the title prefaces, after trying out online dating late 2017 for the first time and calling it a day after just two months I [23M] decided that I didn’t like myself, my life and my personal relationships. It was then I decided that I would take a year out from the weird world of dating to get myself to a place that I would be happily single. 

Taking this decision wasn’t easy. A friend just a little bit older than me got engaged at a similar time. It’s too easy to descend into the old enemy, the sunk cost fallacy. “If I just keep trying, someone somewhere will want to be with me”. Sound familiar? It’s something I was thinking near constantly nearing the point of making the decision to have a break. It was becoming an obsession. In the morning I was swiping, messaging and researching so I could become the “ultimate catch”, at night I was upset that it wasn’t happening. In truth, I was losing myself. The ghosting, the chats that never went anywhere, all of the very real issues with dating were damaging my mental health. In reality, I wasn’t mentally ready. My relationships with friends were breaking down, my work was restructuring and in truth, I was lonely.  So lesson 1: don’t lose yourself to a relationship you don’t have yet. Know when to stop. It can be 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, however long since you started. If it’s making you question your worth, stop. You’re worth more than that.

I’m not going to lie, the first few months were difficult. There was so much I wanted to do but nothing was happening. I went to get therapy for issues I’ve had since childhood but I was on a waiting list for a long while. I was trying to force change, just like I was trying to force attraction. I had to learn to just let it happen. Work hard when you need to, but don’t try too hard at the cost of your mental health. I should point out at this point that nothing I’ve done have improved my dating skills. They’ve just helped me become a better version of myself, and get the support network and the skills to look after myself better. This makes me feel better about myself and makes it easier for me to put an honest version of myself out there without fear. I got new hobbies, things that my childhood self would think I was amazing for doing. Your past version is the only person you need to compare yourself to. The best thing is that I gained new friends doing these things. Surrounding yourself with great people gives you a crashmat for potential heartbreak. Cultivate your existing and new relationships. That’s another lesson. 

I also made sure I hit the gym. It’s a cliche, I know. It just works though. You feel better about your body and the endorphins boost your mood. If you’re like me and compare yourself to other people, going to a public gym kick you out of that habit. You get used to people. They’re doing their thing and you should do yours.

I don’t have any fairytale endings like “And now I’m in a relationship!!!” because that was never the goal. I had a date last week that didn’t as well as I’d hoped. I’m still a bit sad about that. The goal though was to build a life I’m proud of. And I am. My career has never been better. I have hobbies that I love and get me around great people. I’ve consistently hit the gym which has improved my mood and body confidence. I’ve got therapy which has helped me accept myself for who I am. Dating is tough, make no mistake. There will be times when you go to sleep sad, you wake up sad and nothing seems to get anywhere you want. That’s the truth. But that’s just some of the truth. You want a relationship because you have love to give. To give love you must have love. To have love you need pride in who you are and what you are all about. Then, it’s just a case of time.

It’s a bit of a ramble, but I hope it shows that when someone says for you to take a break from dating, it’s not wasted time. In fact, I found it to be the most fulfilling time I’ve had in years.

TLDR: Don’t lose your soul to the online dating gods. Take time out if you need it. It may be the best thing you do.

I have been on a few tinder dates and the girls really were lovely but there was just one thing... In the local supermarket works an absolute gorgeous girl who I've had my eye on ever since I first seen her. She is 100% waaaaay out of my league. The conversations at the checkout we have is amazing and everything just flows naturally compared too anyone else I had been on dates with. Therefore it didn't make me having enough interest into trying too find a partner out of the other girls. All I wanted was this checkout girl! 

I didn't know anything about her personal life (if she had a boyfriend)ect...  so I was pretty nervous about what I did next. Chancing my arm I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper and then proceeded too enter the supermarket not even knowing if she'd be working or not. I grabbed my food and sure enough there she was. I could feel my face going red and the nervs proper kicked in. I was thinking too myself ""do I go ahead with this or not"" but hell what have I got too loose? She finishes serving her customer. Turns too me with her usual gorgeous smile and we go about our conversations like we do most days. At this point just as I am about too pay another customer comes along starts unloading his shopping. This makes me even more nervous knowing that this dude is gonna see what I am about too do.

I said ""*her name* I really enjoy coming into the shop and seeing you. I feel like you are such a lovely genuinely nice person. You are absolutely gorgeous and I would love it if you would like too have a drink with me sometime?"" I could tell by the smile on her face that I had made her day. She was so delighted and accepted my offer *RELIEF* 
I handed her my piece of paper and started walking out the shop. As I turned round she was still grinning from ear too ear and the guy who was stood behind me gave me the nod of approval. Felt like the fucking boss!!

67,cjbzwi,False,,370,Can we stop normalizing ghosting as a part of modern dating and recognize that it’s a completely unacceptable thing to do to someone?,dating,"You see so many posts/articles  talking about how it’s common in modern dating, focusing on the victims and talking about how much it hurt... but where are the folks who are ANGRY?? You know, the way we are when someone cheats? We get PISSED!! 

It’s not that different from cheating. It leaves you wondering why you weren’t good enough for that person. You feel used, disrespected, insulted and indignant. And IT’S NOT OKAY. 

JUST GROW THE FUCK UP AND SAY HOW YOU FEEL, PEOPLE. IT’S NOT THAT HARD!!!!

And if you’ve been ghosted.. don’t let them get away with it and don’t feel like it’s your fault in some way... GET PISSED!!

EDIT: 

Taking this from one of my comments to clear this up: It’s upsetting that people are misunderstanding what I was trying to say but this is it. Im not trying to control other people like some commenters are saying because here’s the thing: if this guy were to message me and tell me that this wasn’t working for him anymore for one reason or another, I would understand! And I would say so! And sure not everyone would react to that rejection maturely, but like (one commenter) said you can’t control that. You can only do your best to be honest, mature, and respectful yourself. Not everyone is going to do the same, and if they don’t... good riddance. You did your part and you don’t have to have them in your life anymore. But the reality is that most people are going to understand. Most people have experienced rejection before and can handle it, but honesty and communication makes that a lot easier to process.

The person who ghosted me invited me to his cousin’s wedding and said he wanted a relationship in the future. We slept together multiple times, spent multiple full days together and had a ton of fun, and we talked about how surprised we were by how much we ended up liking each other. Then he disappeared. So no, I’m not talking about some Tinder date you never met that stopped messaging you. 

And yes, cheating is a different level of betrayal. I have been cheated on and I know how traumatizing it can be. I’m sorry if that comparison offended some people but what I meant was that being ghosted is degrading in a similar way.

EDIT 2: Also weird that everyone assumes I’m talking about online dating tbh. I was ghosted by someone I was in a relationship with for 6 months, someone who I knew from junior high in my hometown aka real life. Currently being ghosted by a guy I met in college.

EDIT 3: Also I’m a woman. Not an incel or whatever as people seem to assume. Sooooo there’s that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cjbzwi/can_we_stop_normalizing_ghosting_as_a_part_of/,1219,Lol ,2019-07-29 14:30:46
285,d9a805,False,Other,54,I asked my crush out today AND SHE SAID YES!!!,dating,"I still can't believe it happened! I'm 24 years old and this **is the first time I've EVER asked a girl out outside of a dating app**. I made a post on /r/dating_advice last week under an alt account, asking for advice on ***if*** I should be asking this girl out. What if I'm not her type? What if she says no? Will it be awkward? What if I mess up? But then as I was typing the post out I realized that the only way I'd ever get the answer to any of those questions was to *ask her out and find out for myself*. What the fuck was I doing asking strangers on the internet for? 

And so I did it! I was in class with my crush for all of today and I kept looking at her dreaming of finally asking her on a date. I was going to let her slide by as I always do. I came up with my usual excuses. I haven't shaved recently and I look unkempt. I'm not dressed well enough later I'll ask her when I look better. She doesn't know you, become her friend first. She's busy with class right now leave her alone!

But then at the end of class I noticed that she was staying behind to pack up her bag after talking to the professor. She was walking towards the exit and I was too so I held the door for her and just said ""Hey!"" awkwardly as I let her through. She said some greeting in return and then started to walk down the hall in the opposite direction. 

And then I could just feel something come over me. It was the perfect time. She's all alone! You don't have to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates! It's the perfect opportunity are you going to let her pass you by again!? Do it!!! And so I jogged after her down the hall and called out her name. It was awkward as I've never really spoken to her before! I just introduced myself and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee later this week? I tripped over my words a bit and it didn't come out the way I always imagined it. My heart was pounding and my legs felt like jelly! Still she said YES!! 

I still can't believe it. The whole thing took like 90 seconds. I've gone through 4 years of college and I've NEVER been brave enough to approach a girl in person. Hell I've only gone on like 3 dates in my entire life! I can't believe that all it really required was about a minute or two of pure courage. 

I'm trying not to get too excited as I don't even know her yet (who knows if we're even compatible with each other) but I'm still hopeful! I wish I had done this years ago, I feel so empowered right now!

I was honest about wanting a relationship/looking for something long term on date three. He seemed to be okay with it so we kept dating. 

Come time for the commitment talk, he wanted time, I gave it to him. He seemed confused and I get that sometimes people need more time. But after a couple of conversations, his confusion wasn't about me, it was about wanting to be in a relationship at all. I told him to start being proactive about it, and he did.

Today, after consideration he wanted to stop seeing each other. I feel so saddened, I thought we had a connection. Though I agreed with the decision, and if he hadn't reached it, I would have walked away myself. But it really sucks.

What sucks more and its something he failed to tell me is that his ""relationship that ended badly"" happened only a couple of months before meeting me.

I never stood a chance. I could've been perfect and that kind of experience would have left him not ready for more that soon.

27,gl9lu1,False,Giving Advice,252,I've started calling out guys who ghost me and I've never felt better,dating,"It started when I went on a date with a guy from my gym. He was really attractive, honestly I thought he was a little out of my league. Or maybe he didn't think it was a date (we did meet on Hinge though) but he invited me to meet up at the gym again later via text, and when I pitched dinner or drinks instead, he went silent. Honestly, I'm so sick of that shit. We had friendly interactions and worse, we were likely to see each other again at the gym - not so with Covid but I didn't know that at the time.

In the past I'd've seen this guy around the gym after being ghosted and I would have been embarrassed and felt ashamed, but this time something shifted in me. He's the one who should be embarrassed! How hard is it to say no thank you!So, the next day I politely did it for him. I said something along the lines of:""I'll take the silence to mean you'd rather just be buds. Totally understand.""

By phrasing it out for him it made it easier, so he responded with a confirmation ""yes, just down to climb as friends"" and an apology for not answering sooner. But I didn't leave it there, I added ""Hey, I get it, rejecting people sucks. but on the receiving end it feels better when you use your words, and it makes it less awkward when we see each other around the gym."" He apologized again, and I made it clear we were cool, and it seemed like he left that conversation happier than just ghosting me and I left it happier too feeling like I got a respectful answer and I could see that he didn't actually have such disdain for my invitation or think I'm repulsive etc. And maybe I didn't owe him the kindness, but it felt good to think that with that conversation, maybe he won't ghost girls in the future. Maybe he'll remember what I pointed out, that it's so much more hurtful to have someone you had a nice time with just go silent as opposed to kindly expressing that they're not interested.

Anyway, it's happening again, with a casual hookup this time, and I intend to voice my feelings again. I'm not going to let these guys ignore the fact that I am a person who should be treated with respect. If you date someone or sleep with them, you owe them the respect of a polite response instead of the silent treatment. You don't even have to give a reason, but that dread of sitting around, waiting for an answer, slowly realizing they aren't into you and don't even respect you enough to say so - I'm not taking it anymore. I don't think I've dated assholes, just cowards, and when offered an out they'd probably rather take that out than just go ghost.

So I'm going to be polite and understanding, but I'm going to let people know that it's hurtful and that they should be better. And maybe it'll be a little ripple effect of positivity on the dating scene in my city. And instead of just feeling bad I suggest other people try it too - it feels kind of powerful honestly.

Edit/Update: Despite a lot of people not liking this advice, I had another really positive interaction. I just let him know that I hoped if he didn’t want to hook up again he’d say so and not ghost, which gave him an opportunity to say that he doesn’t and for me to say that I understand, the worlds crazy right now etc. He answered after that and was genuinely kind and I feel like we closed out on much better terms than if I’d just “let it be” or accepted that I’m not owed anything and that’s how it is. Now he doesn’t feel guilty and I am not sitting around, checking my phone, wondering if I’m being ghosted, etc. That dread of not knowing sucks and now we ended on good terms and I don’t have to sit through it. Maybe my approach isn't for everyone but I think it was good for me and my ex-hookup in this case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gl9lu1/ive_started_calling_out_guys_who_ghost_me_and_ive/,1617,"Being ghosted on does suck, I’ve been on the receiving end of it.

458,e71xdh,False,Giving Advice,76,9 SImple Datings Tips for Introverts,dating,"First dates are stressful enough; but when you are an introvert, they can be panic-inducing. You already don’t do well with meeting new people, but meeting someone you know will be “sizing you up” is definitely shallow breathing time. So, as you think about the upcoming event, you start re-living all of the past disastrous first dates you have had—your short, curt responses to questions asked, your inability to keep a flow of conversation going, those awkward “good nights.” And the shallow breaths are now accompanied by that grinding in the pit of your stomach.

While no magic wand can take your introversion away, there are some things you can do to master the art of the first date.

The Preparation  
1. No Drastic Changes  
Should you decide that you want some new shoes or even a new outfit for your date, go for it. But don’t make big changes. Don’t buy a pair of shoes or an outfit that isn’t “you.” And don’t get a brand new haircut.

Here’s the thing about such changes: You will spend the date being very self-conscious because you are not comfortable with such a change. You haven’t had your own time to get used to it, and now here you are on a date. Yikes. The goal is to increase your comfort level, and dressing as you always do will help that.

2. Pick a Dating Event That’s Short  
Meeting for a drink or coffee or attending some short event is usually the best for an introvert. There is comfort in knowing that it will be short up front, and you will have far less dread or stress. And, if thing goes well, that short chunk of time can always be extended into dinner or something else.

It’s much easier to approach the date this way than to plan a long evening, then try to cut it short. Actually, this is good advice for all first dates with strangers, so don’t feel that you are somehow different.

3. Choose a Place or Event You Know  
Going someplace new can add to your discomfort—you won’t know your way around and you’ll be distracted trying to familiarize yourself with the place. If this is the short first date, choose a coffee shop, simple restaurant, or a small bar you already know. You will be familiar with the table arrangements, the location and parking, the menu, and the people who will be waiting on you. All of these things will let you focus on the person you are with.

4. Pick an Activity You Enjoy  
If sitting across from a stranger and making conversation is awkward for you, why not choose a date in which you will be actively doing something? Weather permitting, you could go to the zoo or botanical garden; you could go to a wine or food tasting event or a street fest; how about a bar that has air hockey if you’re good at it? Being involved in an activity gives you more to talk about, and it allows you to “be you.”

5. Practice a Bit  
When job candidates go for interviews, they often practice answering the likely questions with a friend. A first date is a bit like an interview, let’s face it. Get a friend to sit down with you and ask you some likely questions. Practice both your verbal and non-verbal responses, including facial expressions and other gestures until they seem natural. Then, turn the tables. You come up with questions to ask your date, then practice being an active good listener as well.

The Date  
6. Ask Open-Ended Questions  
If you have practiced with that friend, you have questions to which there are longer answers than just “yes” or “no.” Ask them, and practice those listening skills with eye contact, head nods, and small smiles (and laughs if they are genuinely funny). You want that individual to know you have a genuine interest in others and in him/her specifically. Plus, how else do you get to know someone if you don’t ask questions that allow them to open up and show you who they are?

Instead of asking them what they do for a living, ask them what they like best and least about their job. Just don’t keep firing those questions out of nervousness. You won’t your date to feel like it is an interrogation. And if you have practiced the likely questions you will be asked, you will know what to share or not. Oversharing on a first date can be a bit awkward for the other person. Giving all of the details of your last breakup is oversharing—save it.

7. You Don’t Need to Hide Your Introversion  
You may be able to “fake” an outgoingness for a short period of time—especially if you have practiced this before—but you are really only doing that to make what you think will be a good first impression. If this first date turns into a second one, however, and s/he wants to take you to a large social event, your secret will be out. You don’t have to blurt out that you are an introvert, but as you talk about your interests and hobbies, it is likely that that aspect of your personality will come out.

8. Plan Your “Escape” in Advance  
If you’re seeing all sort of red flags, take note. Here are just a couple:

Your date’s talk is all negative about other people—last relationship, boss, co-workers, etc. This is not a good sign.  
Your date treats a waiter or waitress badly and/or loses his/her temper when something isn’t cooked just right—this isn’t a kind person.  
Your date is a narcissist and can only talk about him/herself, never asking you a question.  
An extrovert in this situation might very well be a bit confrontational and announce that the date is over. Introverts tend to bite their tongues and endure the pain for the duration. You don’t have to do this. Set up your excuses ahead of time. Have a friend text you about an hour in and have a signal to text back. Then the phone call can come that presents a situation that requires your immediate attention. Or start feeling poorly and go to the restroom. When you return, explain that you are ill and really need to go.

A fake excuse, mind you, should be used as a last resort; if and whenever possible, it’s best to be honest about things. You can bow out of the date with a simple “I’m sorry to do this, I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed with things and would prefer to go home.” In preparation for this moment, it’s a good idea to drive separately to your date, as well. No need for an awkward car ride home.

And Afterward  
9. Don’t Ruminate  
Introverts have amazing memories—detailed memories—because they take everything in. This is both a blessing and a curse. At work, it is often a blessing because introverts observe and listen before drawing conclusions and often come up with good creative solutions.

After a date, it can be a curse. Introverts tend to re-live every single moment, kicking themselves because they said something stupid or because their awkwardness/anxiety was showing. Give yourself a break. You are exaggerating and focusing on your perceived “bad” rather than on the many good things that probably happened. Focus on the positives of the date and what went well instead. This gives you confidence for a second date or to move onto someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e71xdh/9_simple_datings_tips_for_introverts/,365,Go dutch.

https://imgur.com/gallery/BgUdtbS

I tried every dating app out there and went on countless failed and awkward dates. Just as I was about to give up and call it quits I matched with this amazing woman. 

After chatting for a few days I could tell there was something there. Chatting led to lengthy phone conversations that cemented in my mind that everything about this is right. When we finally went on our first date we already knew we were meant to be together. Now we begin planning the rest of our lives together. 

Don’t give up hope. Exercise patience and wait for the right one. I had sworn off dating apps for a period of time. I just had terrible luck with them.

I haven’t dated someone since July of last year. It’s been a whole year. And it’s not because guys haven’t approached me, it’s because I haven’t found anyone even remotely interesting. And when I do, they don’t seem interested back.

I’m 26, I started a business last year and it’s just now starting to pick up. I’m doing better financially, living in my own apartment, confident in my looks (obviously to an extent because we all have our days), have great friends and family. I’m generally very happy. The only thing that upsets me is feeling really lonely most of the time.

Loneliness is taboo to talk about but we all experience it. I’ve tried online dating and it’s a disaster. The guys on there are mostly looking for random hook ups and I’m not. I’m dating for the long term.

The guys who do want to go out with me seem to be endlessly boring. A lot of them lack ambition, the ability to plan a decent date or basic conversational skills. When I do find a guy who has what I’d like in a partner (ambition, intelligence, kindness, etc), they don’t seem interested in ever meeting me in person.

I refuse to settle, but after a year without so much as dating someone for longer than 3 dates, I start to feel like I’ll never find my person. I won’t date anyone unless they add to my already full life and at the moment no one is making the cut.

929,e5h22i,False,I Need Advice,60,Long Distance (Should I buy the ticket?),dating,"Please hit me with brutal honesty.

I recently spent 5 months in Chile and developed a 4 month long casual relationship with a university student there (I’m also a university student). When I left we discussed her coming to the US to visit me and my family. She’s been very excited about it, and has no doubts we should do it. She cried for hours after I left.

After getting back, I’ve been doubting in more and more. She’d be with my family and I for about 10 days. I also recently went on a date with another girl which ended in some making out and well... hand stuff. I’m not sure I’m as invested in it as she is and I’m not sure I want to drop $600 to have her come here. She also doesn’t speak any English and my family doesn’t speak any Spanish.

Please ask more questions if you have them and want to know more about the situation.

Update:

I told her not to come. She cried over FaceTime again, and I told her it wasn't fair if I wasn't as invested, she deserved more than I could give her right now. She said I thought about the future too much, but I was really just thinking about my present self. Then, she started talking about all the things she had to do in order to start arranging for this trip that I didn't even know about. She canceled a trip with her friends and started to doing an immense ton of work for the passport. I had no idea, and I didn't even appreciate it. I'm a selfish guy and I need to start turning it around. I hope by having this conversation with me, and pointing out the things that she's doing for me and the lack of things I have done for her, that she realizes that this is the right decision because she deserves more than I am giving her and that I'm not invested. I hope this saves a lot of pain and that I don't regret it because she is an amazing girl whereas I have not always done right by her.

234,dal7t6,False,Tinder/Online Dating,261,Some thoughts for guys on dating apps,dating,"In light of the recent Match Group scandal, I think it's time for me to write up some guidelines for guys using dating apps. If you haven't heard, Match Group is an online dating company that owns just about every dating app you have ever heard of. They were accused by the FTC for creating fake profiles to entice users to purchase premium subscriptions. 

Here are some of my thoughts:

* If you've never had a girlfriend or had a woman show interest in you in real life, then forget about dating apps. I have never seen a guy with no success in real life with tons of matches on these apps unless he's catfishing hard. And if you're in a remote area without lots of people to meet IRL, then the apps won't work either because there won't be anyone on there. 

* Never, ever pay for these subscriptions or boosts or whatever they're called unless you already have tons of matches without purchasing them. These things almost NEVER work because the root of the problem is that you're not competitive enough (not attractive enough, not educated enough, not unique enough, etc.). Even if more people see your profile, you will just get more left swipes or get likes from people you wouldn't swipe right on anyways. 

* You need to understand the dating app business model. The longer they keep you on their platform, the higher the probability of you spending money, so it is NOT in their interest to actually match you with suitable people. When you have few matches or low quality matches, you get desperate, and every new match will give you a dopamine boost. They're capitalizing on that addiction. 

* You need to understand the vicious cycle of dating apps for men and women. Men swipe right on everything because they have low numbers of matches and want to maximize their chances. Women become more selective because they now have more choices, which leads to less matches for guys. And the circle goes round and round. Oh, and you also get penalized for swiping right on everyone. 

* Because women have lots of matches from the hordes of thirsty guys, they can leverage their position on these apps to seek validation, find someone to chat with, advertise their Instagram/Snapchat, or sell sex work. I think there was a survey that said the vast majority of women are NOT looking to date seriously on these apps, and they're just curious or bored. 

* For the love of God, don't turn into an incel just because you don't get matches online. I mean, you should never be an incel no matter what, but I see so many guys completely giving up on dating and blaming women because little Timmy only got three matches on his first day on Tinder. Seriously, for all the reasons I've listed above, these apps are NOT a true measure of your attractiveness because on these apps, only the most attractive men are perceived as attractive while guys below that super high threshold is perceived as unattractive. It's essentially a binary view of attractiveness, but attractiveness is more of a bell curve. 

* Dating apps promote convenience, but do they really? Sure, it takes no effort to swipe right on someone, but let's be rational here: what's the conversion rate from a swipe to a date? After the swipe, you have to match, you have to talk, you have to set up a date, and you have to actually go to the date. There can be tons of drop off at any point in that funnel, so when you consider all the effort you spent for that date, are you really better off than just asking in person? And you might say, ""well I'm an introvert and prefer online dating"", but that's not the right excuse. Being an introvert means you don't like to hang around people all the time and talk, but that doesn't mean you can't be confident and ask in real life. 

* A lot of guys turn to dating apps because they don't have many friends or a social circle but still want to date. Thus, the apps seem like their best option, but you need to ask yourself, ""Why don't you have lots of friends?"" Are you really busy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really shy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really unlikable? If so, how is dating gonna work? Or let's talk about the best case scenario where you're a great guy, but you just moved to a new city and don't know anyone. In that case, you certainly should NOT prioritize dating over making friends because if you guys break up, then your social life is back to square one. 

What am I getting at here? Well, here's a metaphor: gambling is fun once in a while, but if you want to make a living, you probably shouldn't stay in the casino. These dating apps are essentially casinos where all the odds are against you and the chances of your success are as good as Jackie Chan not doing kung fu in a movie. I mean, there is now PHYSICAL proof that these companies are trying their best to screw your wallet, and even if they do remove the fake profiles, that's not going to help you one bit because the ecosystem on these apps is already fucked with hundreds of guys vying for one girl's attention, deluding her into thinking she looks like Arwen from LotR while deluding you into thinking you look like Gollum. Personally, I think these apps have done more harm than good on the dating world because they focused on the monetization of desperation rather than building a good product, and I would love to see them all destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom. Middle Earth references aside, if you've used these apps for the last three months without achieving a single meet-up, then these apps are not for you.

Edit: It looks like a lot of people are asking for an alternative, so I'll provide some feedback here. 

* You need to ask people in real life. I think many guys are afraid of rejection or being called a ""creep"", and so they retreat to apps. When you start asking people out in real life, you may crash and burn, quite painfully, but if the apps aren't working out for you at all and you want a relationship, you need to try something else. To ask someone out in real life, it's probably easiest at a bar/club if you see someone giving you signs such as holding eye contact or smiling. Just strike up a conversation with her and feel her out as a person. If she seems like a cool person, then just ask her for her number. If she gives it to you, great. If she doesn't, say something playful and just leave her alone. Obviously, don't ask a woman if she's not giving you any signs at all. That rarely ends well. 

* Make female friends. Make female friends of your friends. Make female friends at your hobbies. Make female friends in general. You don't have to be attracted to them, but it never hurts to have a network that isn't a sausage fest. Women have women friends, and you bet some of them are single. You can ask your female friends to introduce you to their single friends, or they might even set you guys up without you even asking.

* Here's what I think about being called a creep. Women on Reddit love calling men creepy for approaching them, and this has led many guys to believe that they should never even talk to women. WRONG. Let me paint you a scenario that's actually creepy: a woman is talking with her friends and not minding anyone else, and you somehow shove yourself between her and her friends and say to her ""hey gorgeous, I've been looking at you all night"", and when she asks you to please leave her alone, you ignore that and just keep following her around. Yea, that's fucking creepy. If you can't see that, God help you. Most guys here ARE NOT like that. Most guys here are just a bit shy, a bit awkward, a bit inexperienced, and a bit insecure. I'm sure most of you would never do something like that. If you say ""hi"" to a woman and she immediately says ""ew creep"", that's not on you, that's on her. She's a crass and immature woman with no manners and not worth your time. There's probably a lot of women on Reddit that had poor experiences with being approached by men, either being harassed, stalked, groped, or whatever, so now they believe all men are like that. Don't let them poison your mind. I used to think that Reddit was right and that I should never approach women, but deep in my heart, I knew it was not true that no woman liked to be approached. I only used that as an excuse so that I would never have to approach someone and potentially get rejected. I mean, just ask yourself: for all the single women not on dating apps, how are they supposed to find relationships if no one ever approaches them? We still live in a society where men are expected to approach women rather than the other way around, so to conclude, approaching women is very, very normal.

* I want to thank /u/[Bacon_Square] for this one that I've completely forgotten: go somewhere where you shine. What does this mean? If you're good at sports, go play sports. If you're really funny or musically talented, perform at a show. If you're really smart and successful, go to conferences and give speeches. If you're passionate about anything, SHOW IT OFF. On a dating app, the only thing that separates you from the other guy is typically just your pictures. To a much less extent, your bio. For many people, they cannot really show their strengths in a 2D profile. Some of my bosses are the smartest and most successful guys I have ever met, but if they made a dating profile, I guarantee you they wouldn't get more than 5 matches. Why? Because they can't show off their strongest traits when the comparison criteria is pictures and attractiveness. You need to play to your strengths, and if apps are not bringing out the best in you, then you need to find that outlet. Why do a lot of people like celebrities? Because we all admire someone who stands at the peak of society (also because gold diggers). I'm not saying you have to be a celebrity to find a girlfriend, but do you see how making yourself stand out is really attractive? Not to mention you'll meet people similar to you at places where you frequent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dal7t6/some_thoughts_for_guys_on_dating_apps/,632,"I've been lucky. I've had some success with online dating sites. I've met my last 3 serious girlfriends online. I'm marrying the latest one very soon.

But I had an advantage of studying online dating at University before I trying it out for myself 

Just like a CV. You have to sell yourself. Be positive. Pick the photos people will like to see. Ask female friends to pick out your best ones. Always include a cute one with a pet or a young family member. My best one is a photo with me dressed as Adam Ant with my cousin's four year old daughter cuddling me. (She is very cute.)

Don't put photos showing off your chest or your fancy car or motorbike. You will look like a arsehole and will only attract arseholes.

However, the most important part is how you chat to women on it. Don't just say ""hi"", don't take yourself seriously and, here is the key part, learn to take knock backs. As far as I'm concern, it's her loss if she rejects me and move on.

Before you message someone you like, read her profile and look at her photos. If there anything you like? Is there anything you have in common? (Oh, I've been there on holiday as well - did you visit there as well) Did it make you laugh?  Mention it in your message to her. My main key is that I love to laugh, and I try to protray this in my message to her. Girls are more likely to response if you make them laugh. But if you aren't a funny guy, don't worry. Just be yourself, cat fishers will always be found out. 

Oh and try to be unique to every girl. They can tell if you just copying and pasting the same opening comment. The same joke. The same silly chat up line. (However, they do work if they ask for them in their profile.)

And finally, be patient. If she doesn't reply straight away, don't hound her. Even if she is showing to be online. By hounding her, you are just pushing her away. She might be online deleting all these ""hi"" messages or pushy guys. Be a gent, behave and be patient.

129,g6upkb,False,Venting,153,"[Rant] Why ""being happy being single"" isn't always a good thing.",dating,"Sorry in advance for this wall of text, quarantine has just lead me to doing a lot of self-reflection and introspection on things. 

I've spent a lot of time recently reading this subreddit and a few others. The same advice seems to come up quite a bit when people talk about having difficulties getting dates, forming relationships, etc: Work on yourself. Improve yourself. Be happy with yourself single or you won't be happy in a relationship. Be the person you'd want to date. 

Firstly, I'd just like to say that in general this IS very good advice. We should always be looking to improve ourselves as people. Not necessarily just for the sake of dating/meeting a partner, but just to make our lives better as a whole. 

But there's something else I'd like to address here. 

There seems to be a prevailing attitude in quite a few dating advice forums that essentially boils down to ""be okay with being single"". At face value this seems like a good approach; if you're not happy being on your own, why drag another person down with you? But I'd like to make a potential counter-argument to this, or at least partly.

There seems to be two possible perspectives here:

1) Be happy with yourself as a person, while you just so happen to be single.

2) Be happy being single, as a status or condition of your life.

The first one is, in my opinion, very solid advice. And in general I'd say that in most areas of my life I am very happy with how things are going. I've got a stable job, solid group of friends, in good shape, do things that make me happy and improve myself as a person, you get the idea. 

However, the second one can be...dangerous, to put it one way.

I'm a 27 year old guy, and have never had a girlfriend in my life. Never had sex, never kissed anyone, blah blah you've heard this story before. When I was younger it wasn't that big of a deal, really. There was so much other stuff happening in life that dating and relationships were pretty much on the back burner. But going into college, and after graduating, I started realizing something might be wrong. All my friends and peers were in dedicated long-term relationships, or were at least having success when it came to casual dating. I was the odd man out. So I decided to make some changes and did my research. That lead to a commitment to self-improvement, which I'm still pursuing to this day. At first things seemed to be looking up; my confidence improved, I felt much better about myself as a person, and generally had a better outlook on life.

But the one area that remained the same was my romantic/dating life, or lack thereof. I felt good about myself as a person who just so happened to be single. However, I still wasn't happy with BEING single. 

My friends tried to help, and a lot of them took the approach of telling me how great being single is. Not having to worry about arguments/relationship troubles/etc. But to me that always felt like a bit of a cop-out answer. Imagine telling someone who was dying of thirst ""Oh, water? Yeah it's okay I guess, but it's not *that* great."" 

That lack of dating success started bleeding into other areas of my life. What confidence I'd built up pretty much vanished after I was rejected a number of times, and still hasn't come back. It also feels like I'm the verge of having depressive episodes almost every day. I tried to think of other areas that needed to be improved, that could possibly be leading to this back-track in the progress I'd made. But it always came back to my perpetual state of being alone. 

It feels like a constant feedback loop. I can't seem to make any progress when it comes to dating, which means that there must be something wrong with me. There's something wrong with me, which means I won't have any success trying to date/form relationships. This also contributes to a concern that at this point it's too late for me, that nobody will want to go out with a 27 year old who's never had a girlfriend in his life. From an outside perspective, it's easy to see how someone might think there's some serious underlying issues there that would explain this lack of experience.

What I'm trying to say (in an admittedly very verbose way) is this: The advice of ""be happy being single"" isn't always great, at least in the long term. While I like myself as a person who's single, the idea of being alone for the rest of my life is terrifying and feeds back into some of the negative self-talk that has sprouted from a lack of romantic experiences. I don't want to be single; I want to be able to form healthy relationships like everyone else, to have that intimacy and trust with another person but have never been able to experience so far. It feels like I've been missing out on one of the most rewarding things life has to offer, and everyone says ""oh, just be okay with it!"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/g6upkb/rant_why_being_happy_being_single_isnt_always_a/,887,[removed] ,2020-04-23 20:53:27

The quote that pretty much surmised my feelings toward this whole thing came from a Black woman on the app and it nails the head perfectly on this dating coffin:

Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.

4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.

But things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.

* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.
* My dad has been extremely low with depression.
* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.
* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.
* One of my mates died in a car crash.
* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.
* I failed study because of the above.
* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.

I let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.

I booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, ""Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating"". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.

I then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.

So well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.

I did think about maybe just continuing things and seeing how it goes but decided that I am looking for something serious so that wouldn’t be a good idea. I’m about to send him this text, is it ok?

“Hey you. Thank you for coming last night, I had lots of fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can put myself in a position where I develop feelings for someone then get hurt later on.

“Hey, thank you for coming last night, I had fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can keep seeing you when I know that I’m looking for something more.

Well. This feels really lame. At least I got in first, I suppose. Just feels like a crappy response after I took so long figuring out what to say. Kind of feel like an idiot. Though I don’t really know what I expected him to say. Ah man.

EDIT 4: For those asking why it felt lame, I guess I just felt like he was trying to save face, but I could be wrong. Maybe I just expected him to respond with something more thoughtful, given he did lead me on into thinking he wanted a serious relationship. I wasn’t hoping he’d try convince me to stick around; my decision was made when I sent that text. I just felt like his response was kind of just “oh yeah, oopsie”. But he probably said all that needed to be said. I’m just tired of dating ok. Let me be pissed off a little haha.

Don’t even think you can change their minds. It’s such a turn off and it’s obnoxious. 

I had a first date with someone recently, I made it very clear that I was looking to take things slow. I asked him what he was looking for and he said he was looking for a relationship for the long term. Which was great cause that’s what I’m also looking for. He seemed to be totally fine and okay with me wanting to take things slow. He also is aware that I’m still a Virgin and I explained why (basically I had not so great relationships in the past and didn’t feel comfortable sleeping with them, and one had medical issues that got in the way). He seemed to respect that and still wanted to keep seeing me. Well, date one we go back to his place for a movie and he tries mauling me. Very very touchy feely, and I had to tell him to stop. He apologized, said he hoped he wasn’t coming on too strong, blah blah. Well I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and we went out again the next day. Rinse and repeat. Same shit, but even more so. Told him to chill, he apologized and then when he dropped me off at home I got a lengthy text about him coming off too strong again and that he just can’t help it because he found me to be really attractive and blamed it on his “animal instincts” but said if it happens again I can “put him in his place” and he’ll stop again. And I’m thinking, why do I have to constantly tell him to stop when I’ve already told him multiple times to stop, and when I already made it clear before we met up that I’m not looking to rush things?! Well, 2 days later and it’s date 3. Saaammmeee shit. However outside of that our dates were amazing! But now he’s not responding to me anymore and when he dropped me off last time I saw him I can just tell that there was something wrong. I got a feeling. And now, just no responses. 

So I’m assuming all the nice and sweet stuff he said to me throughout the entire time we were talking was just bullshit and he just wanted to low key try to get me to change my mind about the physical stuff cause he was a horny horn dog. And when he realized after 3 dates that it wasn’t happening, he gave up??? IT WAS 3 DATES! Holy moly. Cause everything else was fine. So I’m baffled if that wasn’t the reason for his ghosting. 

So really. If someone says they wanna take things slow, believe them. If casual sex is all you want then go for someone who actually wants casual sex. and not someone who’s also a damn Virgin if you can’t wait more 6 days lol. 

Keep in mind this guy acted like he was genuinely interested in me, met my mom, I met his parents, constantly texting me, wanted to hangout all the time, made plans for the near future once things open up again, told me I made him really happy, was always excited to see me or hear from me... and for what???

Based on extensive research, interviews with my fellow female friends, and personal experience (I'm a girl), I have determined a 100% foolproof way to tell. Ready to hear the secret? Here it is: she is interested but actually busy IF AND ONLY IF she tells you that she's busy *but suggests an alternate day to hang out with you*. Otherwise, if she just leaves her response as a simple ""Sorry, I'm busy"" without a follow-up, she's not interested!

Even worse is when she gives you the second response but you then ask her, ""So when are you free?"" This puts her in an extremely uncomfortable situation because it doesn't give her the option to decline unless she says something like ""Oh sorry, I'm never free,"" which she obviously would want to avoid because it's impolite. So then she panics and says, “uhh, I’m not sure,” to avoid explicitly telling you that she doesn’t want to hang out with you, ever. And you are bewildered by her response and think that women are confusing.

To summarize, here is A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn’t Interested:

Ask the girl the following: “Hey, I was wondering if you’d be free this ______ at ___ pm to get dinner with me?” Be extremely specific! Don’t say, “Are you free in the next decade?” or worse yet, “When are you free?”. It’s much better to say, “Are you free this Saturday at 6:30pm?”.

Option A: She says some variation of “yes”. Wow, that was easy!

Option B: She says, “Sorry, I have five psets and two exams that week, but how about _____? Does that work for you?” Congratulations, she was actually busy but is interested in you! You also gave her the option to decide on a date that works for her, you gentleman you!

Option C: She says, “I’m a bit busy then. Sorry, I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.” Oof, sorry my dude, she wasn’t into you. Do not, under any circumstances, suggest another day. This is because if she was truly interested, SHE’D suggest another date. Wish her the best with her work and go your separate ways.

For everyone out there who’s afraid of rejection (ie, everyone), this is the perfect method, because by suggesting a very specific date and time, there’s a huge chance that she will actually be busy. This means that her response of, “Sorry, I’m busy” will be genuine, but now it gives HER the power to decide on a further course of action. Essentially, you’ve turned the tables and now *she’s* the one asking *you* out! Thus, if she suggests another time, congratulations, a girl just asked you out on a date! If she doesn’t, that’s equivalent to her never having asked you out in the first place, so everything has stayed the same and you have lost nothing.

Maybe he loves you for who you are but is socially embarrassed by your overweightness or ugly features so he uses her on social media to show people he has an attractive female friend as an ego boost to compensate for being with someone who is fat or ugly. Or, maybe you are just insecure and jealous and extremely selfish and you will never be satisfied until he gives nobody else any attention except for you. Maybe both? Anyway, Good luck.

756,c7bmlj,False,,13,So I flirted for the first time,dating,"First sorry for my english, I'm working on it.

I'm a 22 year old man. I used to spend my time at home, doing solo activities without really thinking about socializing with people in the real world. I just had fun on my own because of trust issues towards people.
A friend of mine invited me a few times to hang out with his friends at bars in Paris. The first times I was kind of scared of what could happen because I don't speak that much and didn't want to spend the night being quiet therefore I used to find BS last-second excuses not to go.

 But then I've been to Iceland on a trip with the class (3rd year and about to get my licence degree). We had nothing else to do beside going to bars at night and it drastically changed my point of view. Why would I spend week-ends at home when I can have fun with people ?

So this week I asked my friend if they were planning on going out this week-end and he invited me to come meet his buddies. 
I made the effort of talking to everybody and was quickly integrated in the group (despite not talking much nowadays, I was the complete opposite before so it wasn't that hard afterall). 
At one point this girl joined us and I immediately started to talk to her, asking questions about what she does in life, what she likes etc. Turned out she has a very interesting point of view on some things in life so we discussed for about an hour on deep topics. 
I noticed we had a lot of eye contact when talking, and while sitting, she was replacing herself closer to me from time to time so I didn't miss opportunities to slightly compliment her and imply we should meet again. I really surprised myself at how direct and stressless I was at flirting. I now think it's natural for all men but sometimes we just convince ourselves its not. 
At the end I offered her a cocktail, she said she was very thankfull and we kept talking a bit. Maybe 10 minutes before she lives I asked her number and told her we should meet soon again and she blushed and didnt reply.
What amazes me is how I kept control of myself and how things have gone perfectly smoothly. Really it's no big deal at all. 

This morning she sent me that she "" spent a good night yesterday :3 "". I'm think about inviting her in Paris again next saturday but honestly I don't make it a big deal at all once again. 
In fact we didn't talk at all about relationships and what she expects because 1) I didn't even think of questioning her about that 2) I think it would be too early anyway. I don't even know what I want with her or if I' ready to date someone. What is your advice on what i should do next ?

TLDR : I've never dated girls, never really been to bars talking with strangers, never flirted. But I somehow managed to flirt a bit with a girl I met there. She looks interested, gave me her number and now I'm thinking about asking her out again. I dont foresee any relationship for now but I'm curious where it could lead us.  What would you advise to do next ?
For the guys who think it's hard, just drink a bit its a good way to stay calm and keep control of the situation. The flirting process is easy when the girl is receptive, it even encourages to go deeper in the process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/c7bmlj/so_i_flirted_for_the_first_time/,183,">Why would I spend week-ends at home when I can have fun with people ?

I'm a good-looking Male 35 who have been single my entire life.  Partly because I always had little interest in relationships and mainly because I'm deeply involved in my hobbies. When I was 30 I found out that I have high-functioning autism which explains why I always had difficulties with social interactions, cues and empathy. 

I'm mostly unable to connect with other people on a deeper level. But I can connect deeply with my hobbies: art, music and writing. And I love dogs.

I have been dating but never clicked with anyone. I have also improved socially. But at this point in life, as you get older, I also get lazier dating and I have become comfortable with being alone and with my self.

671,dcj3z4,False,Venting,96,I ended it last night,dating,"I (23F) ended it with the guy (23M) I was seeing for 4ish months last night. He sent a text out of no where asking to slow things down and I told him to call me. We talked for 40 minutes. He wanted to let it organically become a more serious relationship. He thought I was pushing for something serious too fast. In reality I knew we could never be a serious thing, so I was giving him what I thought he wanted. He was definitely confused, as I kept insisting we never had a chance at being serious. He would repeat ""never say never"" and I would respond with ""no, you don't understand it can't work."" I ended it with goodnight and goodbye.

I thought I could date just anyone. I thought it didn't matter if he didn't have his life together (we are 23 who has their life together?), but it was more than that. He wasn't motivated by anything and had no passion in life. He hated his job (bartending) and kept talking about all these crazy next steps. I tried helping him and I wanted to give advice but, I'm in a very different place.

I have my bachelors. I'm currently finishing up my masters degree. I'm looking for PhD programs for the next 4 years... I was stringing him along because I was having fun but I knew that his directionless life was a major red flag for me. I want something serious, but I (edit: realized I) didn't want anything serious with him.

\^\^(Edit: these were the realizations I made after the fact. Not things I was purposely doing. **I didn't purposely string him along because I wanted fun. I thought I really wanted to be with him.** But once we talked it out i became aware what i was doing and the harm it would cause if continued).

This was an interesting dating experience for me and I learned a lot about what I want. I don't really know what to say now. I'm kind of sad it's over. So I posted here.

We go to know each other and we liked what we saw. but we also liked the sex. so when it gets to the point of continuing or ending, shit like this usually ends. For me, it just turned out it was just the sex. We went on a  handful of dates  over the 4 months. I could barely call it dating and it hurt. I cared for him and I wanted to help him move ahead, but i didnt want to mother him at the same time.

I went out to a bar with a woman I met on tinder. Things were going great, we both were having a great time, lots of sparks in our eyes, touching each others hands, smiling, conversation was flowing. So after 5 hours of non stop talk, its getting late and we both have to catch the last subway. So I ask the barperson if we can get the bill. I ask for two of them.

&#x200B;

At this instant, the woman looks at me and she transformed herself. She ask why was I not offering to pay? I'm surprised and I tell her I simply don't usually pay when I meet someone for the first time, it makes me uncomfortable and puts pressure. She then, proceed, and I kid you not, to say out loud: I would have never taken so many drinks if I knew. You had to tell me, its unfair. 

At that point the bartender sees this happening and come over to make sure everything is okay, and she ask him for 1 bill only (that I would pay). He looks at me and I ask him for two, and he leaves a little confused. 

We then talked a little and I tried to joke around to release the tension, and she told me that if I paid, wed go to my place after. 

I kept on joking around and we ended up paying each other her bill, while she was rambling during the whole time she was paying. We went to the subway,and went our own way!

629,ccm4gp,False,Other,40,"We were never supposed to meet, but it felt like we were destined to meet each other.",dating,"TL;DR
I (25M) met a great girl (21F) who happened to have the same school schedule as me and we walked together for a while. We started dating and spent a lot of time together. We expressed interest in each other, almost made it official, but she decided against long distance because she’s transferring to another school. She is a class act and was honest with me about what she was thinking and feeling. It’s hard wondering what might have been.



She (21F) returned to my (25M) university this semester after spending time abroad and is transferring to a school in a neighboring state. We live in the same apartment complex and I noticed that she walked to and from class the same days and times as me. One day I noticed her walking behind me and I slowed down to let her catch up to talk. She called out my name first and that led to several weeks walking and talking together.

I finally asked her out to dinner and I was surprised that she stayed in my car for almost two hours talking with me when I pulled up to her apartment after dinner. Our second date was a movie and she stayed in my car again for over an hour, but had to run in a bit early because she drank too much lemonade. We shared childhood stories, scars, and embarrassing moments over ice cream for our third date.

She told me about her favorite movies and that she hadn’t seen the sixth and final movie yet. I watched 1-5 over the next two days at work and we watched the sixth for our fourth date. I put my arm around her when the movie started and noticed that the tip of her thumb brushed mine a few times. Our fingers overlapped and interlocked as the movie went on. I asked her if she wanted to go stargazing and she immediately agreed.

Two days later I picked her up for our fifth date and found a spot in an open field. We barely missed the sunset, but we didn’t mind. We cozied up and ate snacks while we waited for the sky to turn black and used an app to find constellations. We saw dozens of satellites and wished on shooting stars. She laid her head on my chest and placed her hand over my heart the entire night. “When the Stars Go Blue” by Tim McGraw was playing when I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes, but sighed and said maybe because she is leaving soon. She was reluctant to go into a long distance relationship with such a new romance and wanted time to think, which I completely understand.

At one point I thought I heard her say that she loved me. I took two seconds to consider my feelings for her, and said that I loved her too. I quickly realized I misheard because she said that that was a lot to take in. Instead of backpedaling I said that I think about her, that I care about her, and more than anything I want her to be happy. What else is that except love? She seemed to appreciate my answer because she sighed and held me tighter.

I was not planning to kiss her, but she gradually came closer as the night went on, and soon our eyelashes were brushing. Then our noses nuzzled, and at that moment I knew she wanted to kiss me. I turned to face her and we were drawn to each other like magnets. We made out until 2:30 am and ran from sprinklers twice. We whispered sweet nothings all night, and she told me that she was happy that I treat her special. She confessed that her wish was that we would kiss. She said that she could easily fall asleep in my arms in that field. We agreed to continue seeing each other even though she hadn’t decided on doing long distance, and I assured her that I could go the distance. We kept saying that we had to go but we couldn’t stop kissing each other. We’d just laugh and keep kissing. I fell hard for her that night.

A day or two later I was back at her apartment to watch a movie. I came prepared with a note written in my best cursive, which I haven’t used since third grade, and I folded it into a little boat. I gave it to her after the movie and she loved the gesture. The note said, “Put two ships in the open sea, and, at last, they will come together.” We kissed again for hours and I confessed that she was very special to me, and pretty inside and out. She told me that I was special and amazing for being so good to her. I reminded her again that she could bet on me to go the distance and she said that she believed me.

Our seventh date was the Fourth of July. She wasn’t able to attend a barbecue earlier that day, but I was happy that she came with me to see fireworks. At this point the dread had been setting in for a couple days if it didn’t work, but also the excitement that it just might. We walked around holding hands exploring booths and stopped to listen to a live band. We met up with friends and cozied up for the fireworks. My friends left early to try and beat the crowds but we stayed to wait until everyone had left. We went back to my car because it started to rain and the fireworks continued.

We kissed until we were the last car left. I said that every time I kissed her was like the first time. We drove home holding hands the entire way singing along to every country song on the radio. I pulled up to her apartment at 1:25 am and we kissed goodbye until 3:00 am with the music still playing. She held me tighter than ever before and kissed me slower to stretch fleeting moments into eternity. I got the car door for her and we kissed a while longer in the rain. She didn’t mind because she was wearing my sweatshirt. Every time we kissed I would count to three to let her go, kiss her with each count, but could never let her go on three.

We planned on another movie and lunch the following Saturday but she forgot about homework and a family function. I stopped by her place and tried to talk her into getting a quick lunch, but she suggested another day. We planned on a movie for Monday night and I kissed her goodbye.

She called me Sunday night and asked me to go on a drive. It was either really bad news or really good news, but it felt like the former. Her face said everything when I got into her car. She said that she genuinely enjoyed our time together and appreciated me for being sweet and treating her special, but that the timing was bad because she was leaving in two weeks. She touched my hand and apologized, but I thanked her for her honesty and courage to tell me in person. I reminded her that everything I told her was still true; that she means a lot to me and is very special. I fought back tears but kept my composure until I could go on a drive alone to weep bitterly.

Our time together was brief but it will always be a cherished memory. I meant every word that I told her; that I care about her, and that she is beautiful inside and out. She is a sweetheart and deserves to be treated special. I wish that we could have been together under different circumstances.

This heartbreak hurts differently than the others because we both expressed interest in each other and wanted to be together. It hurts feeling so close to her but being so far. Pure love is selfless so I have resolved to let her go. I had hoped that our ships were destined to meet. I couldn’t help but consider the coincidences that brought us together and I wondered if this was the beginning of our story. It’s unlikely that we will meet again, but I desperately hope from the bottom of my heart that it’s not the end and that life will bring us together at last.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/ccm4gp/we_were_never_supposed_to_meet_but_it_felt_like/,243,This may hurt but... it's not really that she has to go in too weeks.

1. Dating apps - duh. My first choice since the woman can just unmatch if she isn't feeling it. I had some matches and conversations, but they didn't go anywhere. The vast majority of girls on there that are around my age are just looking to party or to stroke their ego, or if I match with someone that is genuine, they just don't respond. I've read up about the stats of Tinder matches, and it's just a giant waste of time from a statistical perspective. 
2. Meetup - as in the website/app. Well, the problem is that I live in Silicon Valley, and 99% of the meetup groups (I shit you not, check it out if you don't believe me) are related to AI, big data, machine learning, startups, or VCs. Like for fuck's sake I already spend enough time at work every week, I don't want to spend what little time I have left talking about work. There are a few ""actual"" social groups on there, and they're either for boomers or they're pretty much dead, as in one event per month with two people going. 
3. Gym - I go couple times a week, but it's not a very good place to strike up a conversation. It's crowded, and people all have their workout routines to go through. It simply does not seem appropriate to approach people in that environment. I've also heard from women that they absolutely hate it when guys try to talk to them at gyms, so I'd prefer not to get told ""get lost creep"". 
4. Work - I spend the majority of my waking hours at work. Unfortunately it's a tech startup which means there is more sausage than Oktoberfest. The few women that we do have are significantly older or married/in a relationship. Plus, it's just unprofessional to date a coworker. 
5. Nightlife - I'm not a club person, but I like going to bars. Unfortunately, most of the bars around here are for people in their 30s and 40s. While I could go to SF over the weekends, I haven't been able to get my friends to go with me (it's a long trek considering traffic), and I don't know how women feel about a lone man drinking at a bar. 

I'm also looking into joining a climbing gym because I heard a lot of young people here enjoying it, and it seems like a better place to talk than a gym.

So yea I think that's enough dating for me for the year.

**Edit**:  Had a few people ask what the argument was, so I've copied my other comment.

I had mentioned how a few people have told me I kinda looked like Obama. She got unreasonably angry and said how much she hated him. Her reaction threw me off so I decided to steer the conversation away from politics. She was too riled up by that point and said I ""have a lot to learn"" and ""don't know anything about life"". 

She's a bit older than me and this was the third time she had said something like that to me. I had already told her once already that it's extraordinarily rude to say shit like that to someone. So I said it again, only this time I added ""I don't have to take this from you, or anyone for that matter"". 

Then I put my jacket on and was halfway out the door and WHAM. 

I'm not a doctor or anything but I don't see how anything I said warrants that kind of behavior.

I think her anger might not have been so much about politics, she might just hate Obama because her ex husband also kinda looks like him too.

I second this. My girlfriend of 2 years still says stuff like this and it really makes me melt. It also reinforces it: because she says I'm meaningful, it makes me want to be meaningful to her even more. 

Being strait forward about stuff like this is scary at the beginning but it'll payoff with the right person. Never had a gf that was this upfront with her feelings and I also never had a relationship this awesome. ",2019-10-24 00:35:05
188,cjy4ko,False,,99,I [25F] went on the most perfect first date and I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to jinx it.,dating,"I replied to a guy who id been following for a while’s instagram story of a meal he was having saying the restaurant he was at was my favorite. We talked for a week or two and he asked me if he could take me out on a date and show me his favorite.

For some reason the day of the date I was excited instead of the usual nervousness. I met him at his job and we took the subway to the restaurant. He ordered his favorite meals (nearly half the menu) and we shared a bottle of wine.

He joked about not liking small talk and I suggested we pretend like it’s our third date instead of our first. We then talked about some pretty serious things like family dynamics, my father abandoning me as a child, our past relationships, and everything in between. 

He then told me he wasn’t looking to mess around, he was looking for something serious that could potentially lead to marriage. Normally I’d be put off by a statement like that but I wasn’t. 

The last two guys I dated were so hesitant they didn’t even want to call our dates “dates”. One of them ghosted me. The other told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship after months of me trying to define what we were. And here this guy was, telling me exactly what he wanted in a matter of fact way.

We left the restaurant but neither of us wanted to go home so he suggested we go for a walk. He asked me if it was okay if he put his arm around me and I said yes. We walked to a street corner and were waiting to cross the street when he pulled me in closer and kissed me. 

I’ve never felt a kiss like that, I literally didn’t care that we were kissing in the middle of the street and there were people walking by and watching. He then got me a cab home and told me he was going away for vacation for two weeks on Thursday but that he really wanted to see me one more time before he left. So we agreed to see each other again tomorrow. 

I just have butterflies all day today and I’m so excited to see him again. I have such a good feeling about this guy, I wish I could explain it without sounding crazy.

EDIT: I knew when I wrote this post, there would be a lot of cynical, Debbie downer comments. I myself am a cynical Debbie downer sometimes. “He’s just trying to get in your pants”, “he’s lying”... etc.

While these may be true, I’m sticking with my happy feelings instead. He has done nothing to show me that he’s lying or that he’s being sketchy. He has wine and dined me without asking for a single thing in return. He got me a cab home and didn’t ask to come over. All green flags in my book. 

So I’m choosing to be happy and excited and bubbly for now. 

And if he turns out to be a horrible, dishonest person, then I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/cjy4ko/i_25f_went_on_the_most_perfect_first_date_and_im/,716,He's lying. You wouldn't believe it if it was truth. ,2019-07-30 21:08:31
259,fbdt9d,False,Giving Advice,182,A little effort goes a long way,dating,"Guys, if you really want to stand out to girls, but some effort into your dates. Actually plan something out. 

I met this girl that’s definitely out of my league on tinder a few weeks ago, talked for a while, and eventually decided it was time to actually go on a date. It was (almost) horrible. We just went to her favorite restaurant and planned for a movie afterward. The conversation was too good and we ended up replacing the movie with pie. 

Cut to the second date, tried for dinner and a movie again. Went to a new restaurant in town, the food wasn’t great  and we agreed on a movie. We went and got our candy to sneak into the theater and saw Fantasy Island. 

The third date, earlier this week, I was over the “dinner and movie” plan. She told me her nights off and I went to work, looking up cooking classes, ice skating, painting classes, all of it. I finally decided on a painting class and signed us up. I told her it was a surprise and only told her to wear short sleeves. 

I met up with her a half hour before the class and started taking a walk away from the studio, talking about her likes and dislikes, how she felt about surprises, etc. We basically walked in a giant circle and ended up at the studio that was right next to date #1’s restaurant. She believed that all the work was just for a reservation at the restaurant again before I took an early right into the studio. We had fun and are just waiting on the call for our work to be ready. 

We had dinner afterwards and she told me she had never had anyone put in the effort that I had put in to surprise her and have fun with her. She was impressed that I even made the effort to find something in our small town on a random Thursday night. 

TL;DR - made a reservation at a painting studio, surprised her with it, had fun, had dinner, she told me that no one had ever put in the effort that I did for her.

Edit: for those of you saying it’s a one way street. After the first date the “almost horrible” part was that earlier that day, my card information was stolen and my card was declined.

While the media is bringing only negative, toxic news to your mindset, I will tell you how you can come out of this crisis more sociable and with more confidence than before.

When was the last time you were forced to sit at home with plenty of time, no restaurant to go to, no activity to do outside and no distractions?

Right now is the perfect time to look at your life and ask yourself:

Am I happy with my life?

Do I feel fulfilment in my relationships?

Do I feel lonely?

How would this crisis be different if I had a person by my side whom I care about?

Sometimes life gives you a chance to review the way you are living. Don't take it as a thing that is ''bad''. You have the opportunity to self-reflect and set some goals - Don't waste it with binge-watching Netflix. 

The choice is yours. 

Do you want to come out of this crisis the same as before? Nothing will have changed. Except that you will have watched every series on Netflix.

Or do you want to come out of this lockdown smarter and more confident because you finally set plans and asked yourself what exactly is bothering you about yourself and your life?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/fn2bhw/𝐇𝐨𝐰_𝐲𝐨𝐮_𝐜𝐚𝐧_𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐞_𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫_𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐞𝐭_𝐚𝐧𝐝_𝐬𝐨𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥_𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞/,393,This was just what I needed.

34,es2cek,False,,43,r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric.,dating,"*I didn't want to have to create this post but unfortunately with the direction I've seen this sub go I'm forced to say my piece.*

There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted soap-boxing plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included black-pill ideology and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of things with you. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose site of what dating is really about.

44,ho1yrf,False,Venting,214,My WORST Date Ever!,dating,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. You know the drill. Also, I'm on mobile. 

I thought I would share a funny dating experience with you all, maybe some people will get a laugh at my expense. Enjoy! Also, buckle in, cause' this isn't a short story. 

I (22f) went on a date with a guy (25m) a few months ago (pre-Covid). He seemed nice enough over text, and we had some similar interests, so I agreed to a date pretty quickly. I suggested a quick coffee date for a first time, but he was really insistent on ""taking me out for dinner, on him"". 

I'm a laid back gal, so I said, sure, let's go. We sit down at this Mongolian restaurant. Waitress comes by, and I order soup. As this is happening, he is talking OVER the waitress trying to take my order. At one point, the waitress literally stopped speaking to me, turned a full 90 degrees, and just stared at him with her lips together. I don't blame her. 

He laughed like it was a joke (?), THREW his menu up in the air for her to catch, and said he was ordering for me. She caught it, cause she's a great waitress, and simply turned back to me to take my order. Wanting this date to end already, I just order a bowl of soup (I hoped I could eat it quickly, pay, and get the heck away from this man). 

At this point he's ordered, although he said that his ex was ""the kind of bitch that can't take a joke."" I have no idea if that was a dig at me, his ex, or some combo of both... 

THEN, he starts going ON, and ON, and ONNNN about his ex. He called her every colourful name in the book. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind the use of the c-word in a crowded restaurant filled with children. I asked him to stop swearing so loudly, and he basically blew me off saying I was ""being ridiculous"". The angry eyes of the other diners didn't strike me as ridiculous, but okay. 

My soup finally arrives (let's be real, it had probably been 10 minutes, but every minute was agony). At this point, he hasn't done any of the following: 

A) introduced himself in person; he just sat down with no introduction
B) asked me anything about myself
C) Stopped his monologue about his ex long enough to breathe 

I use my food arrival as an opportunity to cut him off, and to change the subject. I ask him about our common interest - video games. I hoped maybe he would answer, then I could answer, but instead he stands up, and tells me we're going on a walk. 

I point at my soup, which is hot, but growing colder by the second. I ask if I can at least, finish part of my soup before it gets cold. He denies this request, and holds out his hand for me to grab (what a gentleman *eyeroll*). So, I call our extremely patient waitress over and ask to get it packed up. Keep in mind, his order is still somewhere in the kitchen, so I don't understand why he wants to leave without it. My BS-senses are tingling, so I tell him I have to use the washroom. 

Before he can say anything, I literally SPRINT to the ladies room. I call my best friend, and tell her to call me in 3 minutes with SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to get me out of this date. She's chucking a little, and I can't blame her. I'm a grown, adult woman standing in the toilets of a Mongolian restaurant begging my friend to get me out of a situation I put myself in. 

When I get back, his food has arrived and he has now, apparently, decided to stay (?). My soup is a bit chillier now, but tasty. He speaks super briefly about video games - but then goes right back to talking about his ex, what games they used to play, and, of course, what a bitch she is. 

I gently stop him and say, ""Hey, I'm uncomfortable with this line of conversation. I understand you dislike your ex, but surely you have other interests?"". He takes this as an opportunity to tell me about how his ex stalked him, and apparently stole something from him (?). 

At this point, the clouds part, and an angelic voice in the form of my ringtone sings out across the restaurant. It's my friend, telling me she... Oh no! She what? Broke her ankle falling down the stairs at her house? Oh god! I, of course, being the good friend I am, rush to help.  

I tell him I have to leave, it's an emergency. I stand up, but so does he. He says something about me trying to ""escape the best date he's ever had"". I chuckled, and tried to move around him, so I can get to the exit (and my car). 

He stops me with his arm on mine. I pull away, but I'm pretty small, so I'm not even sure he noticed my attempt. He tells me he NEEEDDSS a ride home, that he lives on the other side of town, and could I please drive him. At first I'm saying no, that I have to go, that it's an emergency. I even offered to give him a 20$ for a cab (anything to get away!). Then he points out we are in a bad part of town (he's right) and if I want his ""dead, lifeless body"" on my conscience. 

Ugh, fine. I agree to drive him home, against all better judgement. The drive is quiet, for once. I've resigned myself that I will not be able to get a word in edgewise, but he seems to realize he's being ditched. I don't really care, he isn't a very nice person. 

As I pull into his driveway, I put the car in park. I turn my head slightly to look at him, asking if he has everything (I do not want this man to have any excuse to contact me again). Keep in mind, my body language is screaming that I don't like him. I'm leaning away from him, despite facing him, and my face has morphed into a nasty scowl. 

This FUCKER had the absolute balls to try to kiss me! Read the room, buddy. I shove him back but he pushes against me anyway, kissing me on the lips. I bit him, hard, and told him to get the hell out of my car. He calls me a ""fucking tease"" but leaves. Thank god. 

I did make it home, and yes, my friend made a MIRACULOUS recovery. 

The story ain't over yet folks. 

About two weeks later, he's been texting me non-stop (I'm talking 3am, 4am, 5am texts). Finally, I simply text back that I'm not interested. Well. 

He first starts insulting me, THEN he apologizes (keep in mind, I'm getting about 30-40 texts all within 5 min during this convo). Then he starts trying to BARGAIN with me to sleep with him. He says things like ""I'll never bother you again, but I really want to f*ck you"". And ""Please, just have sex with me. Please?"" 

I tell him to, frankly, get bent. I now realize that he's a ""NiCE gUy"" to the extreme.  I blocked his number. 

Well, that's my worst date ever! One for my history books, at least.

So I've been seeing this girl (lets call her ""S"" )for a month now and I haven't made any moves yet because something in my gut told me to hold off until I felt like she was more comfortable around me and what not. Tonight I picked her up, bought our tickets to see Black Christmas (which was ok, but not great), and then proceeded to go to a bar across the street. I don't drink because it just doesn't taste good to me so I don't mess with it. We have a seat at the bar and the bartender comes up to us and says to S ""What would you like to drink?"" S then says ""I'd like a cranberry vodka."" The bartender then turns to me and she ask me the same thing and S says ""Oh he doesn't drink, which is so weird. I've never seen him put any alcohol in his body."" The bartender gives me a look that screams ""leave this chick alone cause she's probably crazy"". She hands S her drink and I say to her ""Damn, why'd you have to out me like that?"" in a jokingly voice. S says ""I just find it weird you don't drink and it's awkward when we go out and I drink. We can't keep hanging out if you don't drink cause it's awkward. On top of that you didn't even pay for my drink which shows your not interested in me. You also haven't initiated anything."" So i'm sitting at the bar like ""Is this chick nuts?"" and say ""If i wasn't interested in you I wouldn't ask for you to go out on dates every weekend, so I don't understand what you're talking about. Plus I haven't made moves because I don't even know if you're interested in me and I know how you get, so i'm not taking any chances until I know you're ok with that. I'm trying to not step over your boundaries. If it's a problem with you that I don't drink do  I need to leave or do you want me to stay?"" S pulls out her phone and calls her friend to pick her to take her to another bar because ""I was going to leave her"". Never said I was going to leave, I just asked did I need to leave because me not drinking bothered her so much. I have to drive home and she was my date so it's also somewhat my responsibility she makes it home safe. I said "" You know that's actually pretty rude you would call your friend to come pick you up when we are on a date and after I said we could go to Indian Queen, but you just assumed I was about to ditch you after you're the one who complained about me not drinking."" She then said ""Well you made it seem like you were gonna leave me. It's not the first time it's happened."" I told her stop comparing me to other guys she's had bad experiences with because not every guy is a fuck boy, smh. She didn't like when I said she was being rude and tried to cut me off during my sentences but I wouldn't let her. She then threaten to leave the table and walk away. I told her ""Go ahead I won't stop you."" I sat at the bar and waited for her friend to pick her up and then I took my ass home. This the 4th dates and not ONCE this month has she said Thank You. Never in my life have I encountered such a rude individual who claims that all the men she meets are fuck boys most of the time. Now I can see SHE is the issue and never takes responsibility for her fuck ups.

TL;DR: A girl stormed out on our 4th date because she was mad I didn’t buy her alcohol (when i bought everything else) and was annoyed that I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the bar when she knew i wasn’t a drinker.

This has been the case every single time.

However, other people seem to have me as their exact type. This would make me happy as a clam if I felt even the slightest hint of attraction for them. I couldn't date or sleep with them if I tried because there really is no desire on my end.

538,fknuu9,False,Tinder/Online Dating,118,Tinder date did a runner after dinner,dating,"I've been out of the game for about a year now, just enjoying living on my own and not thinking twice about having a partner. However about a month ago I decided out was time to put myself back out there and signed up for Tinder. I got a couple of matches immediately and the chat didn't really go anywhere, but after about a week I got a match which seemed really promising. We talked for a few days via the app before swapping phone numbers, talked about everything and agreed we'd meet up after another couple of weeks. She was incredibly sweet, seemed really genuine and most exciting of all, keen to meet me and see where it goes.

I suggested going for some dinner, just a casual place I know that does really fantastic Italian food. Then we'd go just up the road to a nice pub. She was happy with this and felt comfortable enough to let me pick her up rather than meet me there (I told her to give my name/number/photo to whoever she liked to make her feel more comfortable etc).

I picked her up on time, I had bought her some flowers which she seemed to really appreciate (said that no one had ever bought her some on a date before) and the chat in the car on the way to the restaurant was cool, no awkwardness etc. Dinner was lovely and she said that she would definitely go back there. I paid for dinner and we left to go to the pub for a drink. She wasn't expecting me to pay and said that she would get the drinks as she didn't want to feel like she owed me anything which is fair enough.

We made our way to the pub and parked up somewhere I could potentially leave my car if we decided to stay for more than 1 and we needed to get a cab home. She asked me what I wanted to drink and said she was going to toilet then will go to the bar. She asked me to go and find a table at the other end of the pub (the quieter end). I text her to say where I was sat and she text back immediately saying ok, be there in a minute.

15 minutes later I'm still sat there like a spare prick at a wedding. I got up and walked round the pub to find that she wasn't there anymore. I text her to say ""have you seriously done a runner??"" and she messaged me back after about 5 minutes to say her ex was at the bar and she panicked and left. She had mentioned during the date that her last relationship ended badly and that she has a restraining order against him. It sounded plausible but I still wasn't convinced. Why would she not text or call me to say ""I'm outside, let's go somewhere else"" etc?

I don't think I've ever felt this humiliated. Especially since we talked about our worst ever dates earlier in the night, and to think she couldn't bear to spend a whole one with me! I don't understand how I could have read the evening so differently to her.

* If you stop using the Internet and go out and join some activity or group, you'll automatically meet someone right away because that's where all of these hidden gems of perfect matches have been hiding all along.
* You also haven't already thought of that and tried that a dozen times, and realized doing so was filled with people you weren't into, were not your age, and attractive people who have their shit together never join these kinds of things.
* Guys who aren't succeeding at dating *must* be coming off as desperate. That's the only explanation!
* All women have an endless line of suitors, all of whom are male models, and they never feel lonely or sad with dating and hookups.
* If you say you're lonely and feeling down, someone who knows nothing about your life assumes you're clinically depressed and tells you that you need to go to therapy because heaven forbid anyone vent something that's not positive.
* Online dating works the same exact way for everyone, regardless of gender, location, race, and age, so if it's not working for you, ""there must be something wrong with you"" or that your profile must totally suck even though you have a Master's in Writing and are a professional photographer who knows their way around words and pictures.
* Just move and get a new job some place where there's more people. That will fix everything, even though you've already done that twice or more, and only found yourself among more people your age who are taken and married, so now you feel even more single than you did when you lived in a smaller area.

This isn’t a post asking about what I should do because I know things take time and I’ll have to be patient. What I’m struggling with is the loneliness. I also know how to deal with the loneliness, i.e. have a hobby, find things to do, etc. and I’ve been doing all those as well. 

But the loneliness I’m talking about is one that you can’t shake off no matter how much concentration you’re putting into whatever you’re doing.

The kind that creeps back in after you’ve had a good time with friends or finished a good game session.

Mutual friends hooked us up in Nov. 2018. Started off kind of awkward but it got to going pretty great for a few months. Then her replies slowed drastically, she became evasive and full of excuses. I wanted to confront her about it in person but after weeks of BS I finally said something over text and then she quit talking all together. I figured she had ghosted me, cool, another one 🙄. But a couple weeks went by and she reached out to apologize about how she treated me and said she wished we hadn't met yet because she really liked me but just wasn't ready for a relationship. We talked it out a bit and I came to the conclusion that it was done, we both didn't want the same thing at that time. Which, is understandable, it stings but at least now I knew and there's some closure, which is seemint rare these days.

Couple months go by and she reached out again wanting to hangout, I accepted. I did really like her, and I hadn't yet met anyone else. Went well for a couple weeks before she became evasive and had off excuses again. We went down the same road as before and it ended pretty much the same way. This cycle happened 4 times last year. Each time she seemed more sincerely apologetic. 

At any rate we broke it off again right before the holidays/new years. She tried to start it up again near the end of January. Essentially I asked her what the hell she actually wanted with me because it obviously wasn't a relationship (Which I'm pretty sure I made it clear that's what I wanted) or even just sex (She always turned me down when I tried to get intimate) and I was done being strung along for no reason.

Didn't get a reply and haven't heard from her since. And it shouldn't piss me off it at this point but it kind of does; literally two days after that she is officially in a relationship on Facebook with some new dude, taking pics together and posting them on all social medias. Which is something she never did with me. Always taking pics of us but never posted any of it. 

Now, I'm not nieve enough to believe she had just met this guy in two days time, but her sister (who was on my side and thought we were great together) had always told me she was never seeing anyone else but had been on dating apps in between, as was I. But it's still definitely a blow to my self esteem to be told not ready for a relationship after a year of this and then as soon as I deny her, boom she's in a relationship. ",2020-03-14 20:23:19

I've been single my entire life and at 25 years old I am starting to become afraid, afraid at the very possibility that I'll be alone forever and never find anyone. Everyone always says to be positive, focus on yourself, it'll happen when it happens, but I'm starting to believe thats just something people say to make you feel better so you don't lose hope.

I remember seeing a therapist when I was 20 and about to enter my junior year of college and we talked a lot about this. He told me ""It'll happen when its meant to happen."" 5 years later and it still hasn't happened. Not for lack of trying either, I hang out with friends, go out whenever I'm invited somewhere, been on every dating site/app for the past 5 years, joined sports clubs to meet new people, and it still hasn't gotten me anywhere. Now I'm just at a loss on what to do and I'm staring to worry, like really worry.

I've gotten some dates the past two years from online dating, but almost all of them ended after the first date and It takes months of swiping, liking, and messaging girls to even get the slightest prospect of a date. The most recent girl I went out with that I met online, we dated for a month and I thought I was finally gonna get laid, I was almost positive I would. But she had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn't ready to have sex yet, and I respected that so we held off. A few weeks later she ended things. That was almost 2 months ago and I haven't had any prospects since. 

Every person I know who has or had a girlfriend (Which at my age, is pretty much everybody) has met their girl at school, work, or through friends. None of these have worked for me. I'm no longer in school, I don't work with any girls at my job, and my friends don't introduce me to any girls. After college I joined a bunch of coed sports leagues hoping to meet some people, maybe a girl, but nothing has really happened with that. I'm starting to look at other options like volunteering or joining a class, but I feel the odds of actually meeting a girl there who is single, my age, and we're both attracted to each other is incredibly slim. I also don't want to join something for the wrong reasons. 

I try to look at the bright side of it all everyday, but it is just so hard sometimes. I know I have to do something different, but I don't want to cold approach strangers or join a group I have no interest in. Like, just last night I wanted to go out in the city with my friends and maybe talk to some girls, but none of them wanted to do anything but sit inside, play video games, drink and smoke weed, so I had to just stay in with them. So that is just another lost opportunity lost. Pretty soon the work week will start again and unless I want to bother people at the grocery store or gym I won't be meeting any girls. 

Sorry for the long post, I've had a lot on my mind and just needed to get it out. If anyone has had a similar problem and got out of it I would love to hear how you did it.

Doesn't really sound like you're all  too afraid to be desperate enough to date for ""the wrong reasons""

Why exactly does she have to be your age ? Have you seen that ""old"" man date a way much younger women , some of them work just fine.

Hoping that someday you'll find that 100% match relationship (just like those good looking men/women with parents that throws money at them that resulted in them being social and having more experience with dating and knowledge of social dating related stuff ,, and also with other genetics ((brains/aesthethic))  that lead to them being more romantically/sexually capable of getting more options ) is a pretty damn difficult goal to achieve.

I haven’t really had a girlfriend since high school and even that wasn’t a super long term relationship. 

I’ve got a great career and lots of great friends, but one area of my life I wish was different is my love life. I think part of the reason I don’t really have one is I’ve been focusing on my career and stuff so I kind of put it to the side. 

But now that I’m ready to start looking, I don’t really have any confidence at all. I’m overweight which certainly doesn’t help (I’m looking to improve this as well by losing weight and getting in shape, but that’s a different conversation). I have Tinder/bumble and I do get matches but nothing ever comes out of it (mostly my fault). I’m great at talking to women over text and Snapchat but I never actually make the next step to go on a date or hang out with them even though they always ask “when are we going to hang out?” And all that kind of stuff. I don’t know why I just never go to that next step, maybe because I’m not truly interested in them?

I also have never been the type to go out of my way to talk to strangers. If I’m in a bar with friends, I really just talk to my friends and never have the balls to approach a girl at all. Is this some sort of social anxiety or something, or just shyness? 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice from those of you that have been through this kind of thing because whenever I bring it up to friends, they always just say “you’ll find someone!!”

I'm also going to a university for a mechanical engineering degree. I am part of a running club, and automotive engineering club, and a comedy/improv club.

I work out, and am a half-marathoner. I am white, 6'2"", 200lbs, and have long, curly hair with a light beard. I have been told that I have ""no bad features"". I play guitar and bass in my free time, draw, record my own music, and love Star Wars and a lot of post-apocalyptic horror.

The number of different women I've dated + cuddled with + fooled around with is 31. Of those, 11 of them were willing to go on a second date. Of those, I took 6 of them up on their offer. With 2 of them, we couldn't agree on a relationship or FWBs. One led me on for three dates and broke my heart. With another two, either of us broke it off after the second date. However, I only met one of these 31 women at my school.

I am extremely shy, to the point where I broke down crying in the bathroom during a company party two months ago because I realized that I didn't have any friends there. I didn't make any friends throughout my entire high school life, but it's gotten better since then. However, all of my friends of both genders like me, and say that I'm fun and interesting to talk to.

* I ***LOATHE*** dating apps. They're boring, tedious, time-consuming, and brutally competitive. I also find that I meet much better people in real life than on apps.
* Although I prefer bigger/chubbier women, I'm not particularly picky about looks. I've liked and have dated short, tall, skinny, athletic, chubby, SSBBW, and everything in between.
* My views are close to the center and I actively avoid politics - so I don't hold any toxic/extreme views.
* I have a somewhat low libido, so it's not like I only care about sex. I would much prefer a genuine, wholesome relationship.

Two nights ago, I went to the hot tub with some of my buddies and drank a few beers.

672,gixzh5,False,Other,92,Opinion: We're facing a generation of singles,dating,"Presenting my points as to why in the next decades, I believe that more and more people in the current young generation born 1990-2000+ will be single and unmarried in their 40s and 30s:

1. **Overchoice:** Scratching the 8 billion humans mark, you can just pull out tinder and get a pool of choices, compare and pick from any of them. There's just so many! Overchoice tricks us into not compromising. There's so much of 'the good stuff', *surely* you don't need to sacrifice your requirements, and there's always more fish in the sea, no bother fighting for a relationship!
2. **Social Media and Porn:** I've put these two in the same category. They both distort our view of potential partners, and over-sexualise our ideas of relationships. Important as well, they higher our standards. Your girl next door is neither an instagram model, or just your sweet sexual release. And a relationship is much more than something sexual, sexual attraction or infatuation, but we don't seem to think so these days.
3. **Mental Health:** This comes in with less force than the first two, but it also holds some weight to it. We are all notoriously depressed, it's a XXI century thing at this point. Instant gratification, addictions (to food, to social media, to youtube), porn, technology... they can be no good. But for whatever reasons you want, our declining mental health as a society is complicating relationships, turning them unhealthy and painful.

And for the above reasons, I believe our generation is doing quite a crappy job at dating, and many will enter their 30s quite single as a  △ .

She told me she was planning to keep the baby, doesn't believe in abortions and all that stuff. When she got back she revealed to me that it was all just a hilarious prank and gave nothing but a half assed apology after I told me how she made me feel over the week.

The first day I was panicking so hard I was vomiting and on the verge of tears, I genuinely thought she was pregnant. Obviously I told my parents and friends because I have absolutely no clue how to deal with what I was going through. By the end of the week I finally come to terms with what was going on and accepted that I might have a child.

442,dmizzz,False,Venting,121,What the fuck is wrong with people?,dating,"I've posted about this guy I met last month a few times so I won't go into too much detail but I am passed the point of feeling sad and onto being pissed off and just disappointed. 

I met a guy in early September and we hit it off very well in messages. We hit it off even better in texts, he was so attentive and sweet, and this was before we even met. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is. We met and he could not have been more excited and expressive about how he felt. When we parted ways after our first date, he told me he already missed me. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is.

So this kinda stuff continues. He tells me to leave a goddamn toothbrush at his house the first time I stayed over (and 2nd time we hung out) because he just *knew* we would be spending a lot of time together. He can't wait to introduce me to his friends, he wanted to wait to sleep together because he didn't want to rush and ruin things, etc. etc. Hindsight is 20/20, and maybe this all should have been a warning but I guess I thought it was genuine excitement. Even though I was a little like ""WHAT""...I felt very similar and I ate it up.

He got distant and cancelled plans that he set up. I try not to read into it and didn't mention any concerns until it was twice in a week. He assured me over the phone and in person when we saw each other again that he was still just as interested and he just got busy and stressed. I left it at that. He made another plan. Then cancelled that plan. He didn't talk much the week of that and went away for the weekend. Sent weird, confusing texts and at that point I was like, ok what the hell is going on??

I got no straight answers. I told him very clearly, if he isn't interested that he needs to be fair to me and just tell me so. I thought we both enjoyed hanging out and that we wanted to keep doing so and get to know each other. I got no response to that so I took that as my answer that he wasn't interested in dating me. I then later on was told that I was wrong in thinking that. 

I took a few days to not give any energy to the situation and came back to see what the fuck was happening. Why he can't just say what's on his fucking mind like an adult. If you act weird and someone questions it, just say what is going on. He tells me that we should meet up and talk and get on the same page. I let him know if it's something he can say over the phone, there is no need for a meet up. Because the whole ""we need to talk"" thing is making me think it's because he doesn't feel the same way that I do. Once again, I am told that I am wrong and he wants to explain things. 

The day comes to meet up. I am anxious as fuck and wondering if this is all even worth it. But I'm very curious as to what he has to say. An hour before he texts me that he is not coming. That he doesn't feel comfortable. That I was being too serious before. That he scares easily. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK is wrong with people. So you come on strong, get distant and weird and I question it and that's me being too serious about things? A big part of why we clicked is because I thought we were on the same page about dating. How the fuck am I going to get to know someone if I don't spend any time with them. Okay, cancel on me once or twice, things come up and life gets hectic. I get that. But again and again, yes I am going to question if this is something you want to pursue. I gave him multiple chances to say he was too busy at the moment to date. Or he lost interest. Or he met someone else. Be a fucking adult and tell someone that. Playing games and sending cryptic messages for weeks is not the way to act. ESPECIALLY when the weeks before that was nothing but great conversations and great dates and future fucking planning. 

What is wrong with someone like him? What the fuck could not be said. What is so fucking scary? How do you tell someone you think you need to talk, then tell them you need to talk BEFORE YOU TALK? What a colossal waste of my time, my energy, my feelings. 

I did like him, too. Through most of that shit I still liked him. And I'm not going to say I acted cool and collected the whole time. I eventually lost my cool and send some long winded texts. But nothing crazier than all the shit he said to me when we met. Yet, it comes back on me. And then I start to wonder if I did something wrong along the way, that scared him off. But fuck that thinking, I liked someone and I wanted to spend time with them. I thought that is how you date. 

I told him that there was nothing to talk about and I didn't want to speak to him again. I can never bring myself to send the classic ""you're an asshole. You wasted my time. You lead me on,"" etc etc texts because it's not my style and it's not like it will resonate. The crazy part is that I have been out with other guys since I met him. I ended up not connecting with anyone like I did with him, but I still put myself out there because it's too early to know for sure about anyone in 1 month. That's why I said I wanted to get to know each other to figure out if it could be something. 

What the fuck.

548,9wcqao,False,Giving Advice,63,"I’m a member of the US Army, let me help you protect yourself against relationship fraud.",dating,"Background: I am U.S. Army infantry soldier with four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I was lucky enough to see some cool stuff in my life. We always had a camera on hand or some combat photographer who traveled with us. I collected hundreds of photos during my travels.

I become a recruiter temporarily for the Army. This is known as a Department of the Army Selected Recruiter (aka DA Select Recruiter). It’s a 3 year commitment and then you go back to your job. Part of being a recruiter is having a social media presence. A professional Facebook page or something like that you can post your recruiting stuff to and photos of your “Army story”. I had hundreds of photos of on my FB page. I’m now back at my normal job and no longer a recruiter so I deleted my social media page.

I first found out my pictures where being used for scamming a few years ago. A nice older lady contacted me (50’s). She has had a relationship with a fake me for sometime. She couldn’t believe I was actually a real person. The fake me was in Iraq and then recently moved to Africa to fight terrorist. The fake me needed money after a few months because I was almost out of food because the “bad guys” destroyed it and I was running low on bullets. Thank god she was smart enough to look further into my pictures and found the real me. I looked up my name and 11 fake accounts popped up in Facebook. The name was usually slightly misspelled or maybe Rank was different or first name was different. Some where easy to delete and others not so easy and Facebook refused to delete them for sometime. Even having friends and family report them did no good.

It end up getting to the point I would have to search my own images and variations of my name monthly. I’d have those accounts deleted and wait another 30 days to do it all over again. The scammers then moved to other social media platforms. Dating websites/apps, Instagram, and so on. To many for me to look into so I just waited until another women would contact me letting me know she has been dating the fake me for sometime on whatever app. My pictures are all over the Internet now and used regularly. I have even seen a fake Department of Defense Military ID used to make the scam more believable. I’ll add a link to it later once I find a good place to host since r/dating doesn’t allow pictures.

So now I’m here to maybe answer some questions and give you advice on how to be safe from the fake me. 

1) Every service member has a base. Normally those bases are local known as CONUS (continent of the US) and a few have some OCONUS (outside the continental US). CONUS would be like Fort Benning GA, Fort Drum NY as examples. OCONUS would be like Germany, Italy, Kuwait, Alaska, Hawaii are common ones. Other services would be similar just different locations. This leads to #2

2) Regardless of service NO ONE is stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan or any combat zone permanently for multiple years. Deployments usually last 1 year or less depending on service before they go home to their main base mentioned in #1. Navy do like a 6 month deployment on ships, Army rate now is 9 months to a year, Air Force maybe 3-6 months and so on. It all depends on their mission, but no one is deployed for multiple years to a combat zone, not even the super super secret Special Forces guys. CIA May be different but those guys wouldn’t tell you they are CIA or even have pictures on the Internet. If your in the other branches feel free to add in your deployment length. 

3) We don’t need anything. The military takes care of us well. They will never leave us high and dry starving in a foreign country. If a “service member” asks you for money its automatically fake. If he is real and stateside and asking for money he is a looser.  You should stop contact them immediately because he isn’t someone you want in you life.

4) Fake ID, I recently have received a fake ID card of me. It’s laughably bad but to an untrained eye it may look very real. No person in the military will send their CAC Card (Military or Department of Defense ID) to a strange lady. If they do then once again they are an idiot and not someone you would want to associate with.

5) People in the military while not deployed have normal lives. I goto concerts, shop for groceries, wash my car, wear civilian clothes. I don’t live Army 24/7 and wear my combat uniform or dress uniform every waking moment unless deployed. If he shows up on a Saturday night wearing a dress uniform for a date he’s a fake. Our work hours are normally 6am to 5pm on average. There might be some slight differences in time depending on duty but that’s a normal service member schedule. A Military Police Officer or someone working as a nurse might have odd hours but your average person has a pretty set schedule unless something “special” is going on. Only time besides deployment someone might wear their uniform 24/7 will be if they just entered the military and are going through boot camp, basic training or a military training school, those are only temporary though.

6) Other service members can’t look up anyone else record. Don’t call your local recruiting station and ask is this person real. There is no database we have access to that will give us that information. Only thing you can do is if something seems wrong have a friend who is a vet or service member tag along on your date and shoot the shit with him (valor check). It’s kinda bad taste but better safe then sorry. OR you can do it yourself by asking for their military email. It’s not top secret to give it out. For the Army it usually looks something like First.MI.Last.mil@mail.mil. Notice the .mil at the end and not gmail.com? If I was wanting to be a douch and use my military status for the ladies why would I care if someone sent me an email to my easily accessed military email account? I’d be like sure.

Please vote this to the top and spread the word and maybe save a friend from heart ache or financial ruin. I know my grammar sucks and I probably have some serious typos. This is what late night reddit posting on a phone looks like.

755,a1lblp,False,Other,284,"Average guys are screwed, the numbers are working against us. But there's hope--I think it's all about self-love.",dating," 

I saw this on the showerthoughts reddit and it's absolutely true: ""Tinder is the self esteem booster app for average looking woman and self esteem destroyer for average looking men"". That's true not just about Tinder but online/offline dating in general. If you are a minority guy double worse--this isn't whining. It's reality backed by research (look up Dataclysm and Chris Rudder's research on OKCupid that was publicized on FiveThirtyEight, Time, etc) . Thing is it's what people *say*, and what they *actually do* are different. And that applies very much to dating too, especially as there will be exceptions that give advice based on their one special situation without acknowledging general trends OR they will fall into the ""do as I say, not as I do"" trap. 

Online dating is basically tall white guys or non-white guys with supermodel looks getting matching and meeting 80% of the women.

Now that said: That's the game. It's what attracts women initially fair enough, we're not entitled to any one specific person. People are attracted to what they are, so I don't begrudge women for being into tall white guys. Now this is not about women-hating, that's a dark place to go into. Biology and social norms/preferences are hard to overcome.

So I think we average, not super extroverted guys need to realize we have to approach this differently. My advice or 2 cents is to change the approach and just work on the basics:

\- **Gym** (because you'll look better AND it's good for you)

\- **Wear clothes that fit**

\- **Find one or two hobbies that you like, and go all in unapologetically**. It's easy to get insecure about your intersets--for example, I'm not into NFL or UFC at all. IDGAF about either, and it can make one seem meek when in the company of the boys chatting about it. But oh well.

\- **Be a little more social than your comfort leve**l. Just a little more. No need to become a hi-fiving woooo\~! bro at the bar. Just means maybe saying yes to more invites. Inviting someone you haven't before to do something social.

I think doing these four things can help us average guys just be more happy and comfortable with ourselves. Because being miserable or waffling in self-pity or having this resentment in us then becomes a reinforcing cycle. I think the problem is we compare ourselves too much, and also we set ourselves up to fail by playing a game that's not for us. Perhaps we should just optimize ourselves, and work at self-love, it might help our dating life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/a1lblp/average_guys_are_screwed_the_numbers_are_working/,185,You had to post this thread twice.

It's supposed to be a relationship-oriented app. It's not like I'm on Tinder and getting mad that nobody there wants a relationship.
   
Ghosting is barely half the issue. I'm just burned out from talking to someone, even going on a date or two only for them to say, ""I'm not ready for a relationship."" I think, above all else, that's the most insulting thing I hear. Because it means, ""I'm actually not ready for a relationship but I also want to be on dating apps and get attention from people"" OR ""I don't like you but I don't want to tell you that I don't like you"". Hell, one time I was having a really good conversation with someone, only for them to ask me for a picture of myself (I mean, we met on a dating app, so she knew what I looked like already?)

436,df2u2r,False,I Need Advice,177,"I [21 M] have absolutely no idea how to meet new women without potentially creeping them out, how do you meet strangers these days?",dating,"So I really struggle with dating. I’m 21, a little socially awkward, not entirely ugly but I’m a short ass, which doesn’t help me with tinder or other online dating apps. I don’t really like them anyway, I do get some matches, but they never go anywhere at all. It feels so hard to get to know someone that way. I’ve come to realise the big issue for me is that I see hundreds of women who catch my eye, but approaching them in a way that is sensitive to the fact that they deal with creepy, shitty guys day in day out, and managing to break past that barrier and get to know them is basically impossible. Because of this, I just never try get to know girls I think are attractive. It just seems like a crazy idea to me at this point. I should probably mention to begin with that I completely understand that women tend to have their guard up around guys they don’t know for a very sensible and understandable reason. It’s the creepy pieces of shit who go out their way to terrorise women that are the root cause of all this. it’s completely normal to feel like this. I feel however that this is a problem not just for me, but probably hundreds of normal, everyday guys out there, who mean well but just have no idea how to approach women while being respectful of how weird it is to be approached by a stranger.

Like, how the fuck do people meet each other these days man? It’s a mystery to me. After school finishes it just becomes seemingly impossible to meet anyone to date. In class at college I try keep to myself, and try not to sit next to any girls I find interesting cause I don’t want to be that creep that sits trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get a degree. I wouldn’t want to date a co-worker, for obvious reasons. Online dating completely sucks as a way to meet someone unless you’re intrinsically good looking, especially for guys. Average looking guys just dont get that many matches, and women get too much to the point that they have to be pretty picky about who they want to match with. It’s kind of a broken system. I’ve never been the type to try have a drunken hookup with some girl I meet in a club, again people just aren’t that attracted to me until they see a glimpse of my personality, and that can take time, and it’s hard to get that across shouting over the music at some stranger you don’t know. That leaves the same group of girls I’ve been friends with for years, who I see most weekends and have had some flirtations with over the years, but I know that none of them really see me as dating material. I’m at a point in my life where I need to meet some new girls and start dating, but I’m completely stumped as to how to even go about it.

It basically leaves a few options that all just seem crazy. Basically, just approaching any girl you find interesting or ‘sliding into the dms’ of someone you kind of vaguely know, which just seem ridiculous to me. Like no girl wants to be approached by some random guy when they’re going about their business, and no girl wants some stupid reply guy filling their dm’s up with stupid hollow attempts to get to know them.

I really just don’t have a clue how to meet girls. I’m not a completely lost cause; I’m not some fedora wearing neckbeard. I’m a little socially awkward, and it can take time to get to know me, but aren’t we all like that? It’s just that the girls I know well have known me for so long they see me as just a friend, a drunken hookup at the very very best, and me being a little socially awkward means that meeting new people is something I overthink to hell. I see what girls put up with all the time, with random guys approaching them on nights out and hopelessly trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get on with their day, and I never want to do that. So, my question is: how the fuck do you meet people to date? It sounds simple, but it’s completely beyond me. I just wish it was as simple as seeing a girl you’re attracted to, saying hey, and getting to know them. I wish the world could be that friendly, but everyone has their guard up these days (for good reason) and it just doesn’t work that way man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/df2u2r/i_21_m_have_absolutely_no_idea_how_to_meet_new/,383,[removed] ,2019-10-08 17:01:23

She was this giant pretty cute 6'1"" tennis player who could most def crush mere average built 5'9"" boy like myself. We vibed (so I thought) from DMing each other so I asked her out on a dinner date at a Japanese restaurant. When I saw her in real life, she was just as expected; tall. We had a really friendly dinner but there was an issue with the order. She ordered beef teriyaki dinner plate but instead they brought out chicken teriyaki. When it arrived, by her looks, the waiter immediately recognized the mishap so he promised he'll bring the correct order and left the chicken teriyaki since the wait time was long. Without hesitation she started digging into the chicken teriyaki and by the time the beef teriyaki came out, she was already finished with it. She then started inhaling the beef teriyaki like Kirby swallowing all the innocent waddle dees while I was half way done with my dinner plate (guess I was doing most of the talking since she was too busy focusing on eating but damn that was a spectacle). When she finished her second plate, she looked at me straight in the eyes and let out like the loudest burp I've ever heard. Then in a cutesy way she was like ""Oops I ate too fast"" and sat back rubbing her full stomach. In my mind I was like ""What... the... fuck"". If this was all recorded in like a video, you probably can see my hair get blown back due to the sheer force of that expelled gas oof. I was too shook and didn't know what to say at the moment so I just blurted ""bless you"" as if she sneezed haha. Guess she found that funny to as she was laughing too. Anyways I paid for the bill and when I was driving back near campus so we can hang more, she gave me this lame excuse of how she needs to get back to her dorm because her roommates get drunk and she usually takes care of them. I could've nudged her to ditch them just for one night since I wanted to get to know her more but I obliged. After dropping her off, I texted her that I'm down to hangout again but never got any response thereafter.

TLDR; A girl I took on a date ate 2 whole dinner plates and burped at me, to which she later ghosted me after I paid for her dinner bill.

147,dw0zq1,False,Giving Advice,169,Let's stop with the victim mentality in dating,dating,"I have been going on way more dates as a 25 Y/O woman and I've gained way more lessons and experiences in the last year than I did in all the 7 years before when I started dating guys. Something I've realized is that there seems to be a normalized victim mentality when it comes to dating and I think we need to collectively challenge  this. On this sub I see lots of posts about ""I hate being dragged along"" ""If you don't like me romantically LET ME KNOW so I can move on"" etc and all these posts basically enforce the idea that the power always has to lie in your romantic interest and not in you. Well I realized something recently: Our sole responsibility as individuals is to take care of ourselves and be happy period. It's not to figure out why our partner is withdrawing from us especially if they won't communicate like adults, whether they're interested, whether they're not. In dating situations I've found myself asking more about How they make me feel and whether I like it instead of whether I'm good enough for them and it's been life changing. When I was younger I would pine and wonder about a guy's interest now I only go for guys who are full on after me If I have to guess I'm out. I approach my life in general with an abundance mentality and I've noticed I'm getting more positive male attention this way. I always make it clear what I want and how I want to be treated. If I notice things are changing I ask about it once. After that I dip tf out and move on to the next or stay single, they can explain when they want but I'm out at that point. Don't accept long response times, late night only convos, disrespect, lack of clarity, feeling led on. This is the only soul and body you'll ever have. Why are you allowing anyone to do you the disservice of guessing and pining because they are not brave enough to let you go and are choosing to ghost? Take your power back, let yourself go.

EDIT: This post is not encouraging ""selfishness"" or ""callousness"". It's about integrity and self respect. If you know what's makes you happy then that's is what you should go after. I'm not saying ""Walk away from anything as soon as a little problem arises"". I'm saying notice it, communicate with your partner and both of you meet each other in a good middle. If they cannot work with you then with self respect, walk away.

269,e9364z,False,Venting,329,Today's disposable dating culture,dating,"I'm a pretty open minded and modern guy [M32]. Or so I thought. But since I've been dating for the past year or so I've realized I actually got pretty conservative views about dating and relationships. Maybe I cause a shit storm with this one, maybe not. 

From my experience,  the dating game today shuns commitment and encourages disposability: if this one doesn't feel good there's always next, and the next, and the..

I've for example met a woman my age who had never been in a real relationship. To be honest, I wouldn't want to be her first partner, knowing how much there is to learn in order to build a working relationship. 

I've gone through a 8 year relationship, the breakup (3 years ago) and the following anguish. Looking back, it was one of the best thing that ever happened to me.  Learned so much about myself and now I know how important it is to put effort into a relationship, in order to build it strong.

What I am coming at is that many people are so into the disposable dating culture that they've forgot (or never even known) that a real, deep relationship takes a lot of work. And the work never really stops. Yet for this exact same reason it is so much more fulfilling than those one month going-out-but-never-really-getting-to-know-you-cuz-I-just-want-to-have-fun. To me this communicates insecurity and fear of commitment.

I feel like this is one major reason why people are so disconnected from each other and themselves. A proper relationship, which by definition always ends in tears (either death or break up), will teach the partners much about themselves and each other. It won't be easy, but in the end it will either be helluva lot better than being alone or it'll be another valuable, yet painfull life lesson. No commitment = no stakes = no winnings. A bit shaky metaphor, but you get my point.

How do you feel about this? Do you believe in keeping your options open and dating with low maintenance or would you rather put mutual effort into it and see if something long lasting can be born out of it? Why?",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/e9364z/todays_disposable_dating_culture/,576,"Here’s what I think. 

Mens dating strategy: Unlimited access to sexuality. He’ll basically will do anything for that. 

Women’s dating strategy: always wanting a better guy then she currently has and since all men want sex she will get approached and she can literally pick the one she likes. That makes her the gate keeper to sexuality. 

And this basic principle hasn’t changed except for the fact that with birth control she doesn’t have the risk of potentially having a kid afterwards which takes a lot of time and energy. Basically making marriage and any other form of long term relationship obsolete.

And yes too be honest I find the thrill of flirting with a new woman is always better than with one I’m having a long term relationship width. ",2019-12-11 06:03:05
681,cz298d,False,,69,"If dating makes you upset, you should focus on youself.",dating,"TLDR; 

When you enjoy your life enough to be happy while alone, then you become selective. If you find yourself in a hurry to date someone, you should figure out where that internal dependency comes from as it isn't healthy. Anyone can be happy with themselves, you just have to learn. For women afraid of wasting their biological ""clock"": It would seem very selfish to your kids to be in a possibly unhappy relationship just to birth said children.

Long version:

Oh I can smell the hate coming... When I'm on tinder I get a decent amount of matches, probably around 1 match in 5 swipes. But I only swipe out of bordom. I don't swipe just to swipe, but more for finding someone unconventionally attractive. Im the type who doesn't like to date ""hot"" crowd but more along the lines of ""beautiful"". The problem is that my deffinition of beautiful is defined by a feeling I get, almost a love at true site feeling. I've felt it twice my entire life so I know I can find it again.

Now some may say I have high standards, but im happy with my single life. I can hear the angry reditors calling me ""lucky"" or explaing how ""you'de never understand"" but this should apply to everyone. Im in no hurry to get in a relationship. I enjoy college (the studying part-I dont party) and I'm always so busy with activities and self improvment that being alone isnt lonely. So for me its not a standard but more of a ""I have plenty of time to find the right one"" so I don't rush and thus.. I swipe (:

Tinderies message me first all the time asking to go out and we'll do just that. Ive been ghosted (ive never ghosted a soul) ive been told they weren't interested, ive even been preassures/tricked into one night stands (no ones fault but my own). I dont take it personally as ultimately I wouldnt wanna date someone not interested in me anyways. 

Everyone is so upset with online dating not because its bad but because it doesn't fall into their own narrative. Most people on here (not all, but most) only get upset at online dating because they're in a hurry to find someone. When you're happy with yourself and you love yourself, dating isn't a priority and when it isnt a priority you become more successful in your dating life. Its an oximoron, sure, but I find that men can sence desperate woman so they take advantage, and women can sence desperate men so they run.

Dating should be taken slow, it should be done in different ways: online, in person, out at parties, etc.. When you live in a world where selectivity and choice is easy, you should be able to take advantage of it without feeling bad for those you selected against. If you're a guy who is upset because you got a match but no message, its your choice to take it personally and hurt your ego. I don't advicate ghosting or trying to hurt someone, but at the end of the day everyone needs a frame and a barrier to fill that frame.

I wasn't always happy being alone. I was raised by a single mother who dated several men as I grew up, each more abusive than the last. Her dependency issues rubbed off onto me and I always belived I had to date someone to be happy (sure these issues went way beyind that). But honestly, I taught myself that I can be dependent on myself. I can be so happy with my own accomplishments that I may as well be another person. The best thing is, this drives you to accomplish more! Now I hear more reditors calling me ""self-absorbed"" a ""narcasist"", but do we really live in a world where truly being happy with who you are is boiled down to selfish-self love by those who havn't felt it?

Since 2013, I've tried to put myself out there (I.E. OkCupid); nothing ever came of it. Over the successive years, if there is an app, I probably used it. In all that time only four first dates, with nothing after. Last year I decided to take a hiatus from the apps.    
    
Being a regular at a local gym, another regular decided to play matchmaker and introduced me to a mutual friend last Monday. It was non-stop texting until last Thursday (went out to diner) then radio silence. Taking the higher ground I sent a follow-up on Saturday with no response. I only found out from the mutual friend the ""nice guy"" excuse. I would have accepted hearing it from her directly instead of acting immature and avoiding it (We're adults here).   
    
Taking a stab at the apps again, by god they all look the same and quite frankly boring and unoriginal. Within minutes I uninstalled.

I'm 180cm, so I'm a tall woman. I don't discriminate in height, most of my boyfriends were shorter than me.

That I'm a really interesting person and attractive but they can't have a girlfriend who is taller than them or would be taller than them with high heels on. Then they wouldn't look 'man' enough.. 

So, if it could be of any consolation, the discrimination goes both ways. :) 

And to be honest, I don't even care that much. I want a confident boyfriend, someone who isn't superficial or has a fragile ego.

I am not physically fit or attractive I have a relatively attracted face but objectively my female friends have put me at like a 5/6 I’m as they’d put it “Fuckable but nothing on Ryan Reynolds.” 

I offset this with my personality, now the issue with online dating is how can you use a personality to hook someone in a few paragraphs/A photo.

What’s worked for me is embracing my flaws, I’ve got a picture on my profile of me imitating fat Thor. I’ve got one where I’m in a fucking dragon onesie screeching like a fool. They are fun photos and I’ve gotten more conversations out of those than any of my professional pictures, which I also have on because I’m dressed up and look nice. I tell people I’m a massive nerd in my bio and people ask about those hobbies. You don’t have to be Ryan Reynolds to get matches, but you do need to create a hook that makes someone WANT to talk to you.

I’m not saying it’s perfect or guaranteed, but I’ve gotten more success out of going all out and embracing my flaws and making jokes out of them than trying to hide them.

For some reason, when a guy has a lot of cheddar, women can see it without any special clothing or a luxury car. They just know when they look at you. I'm not sure why, but they definitely do. I get about 85% of my dates from offline, without even trying. 15% online. Online requires more effort because you have to meet the person twice: once online, and then again offline. Plus a lot of women online are just there to bullshit people. Makes sure to use a dating site where BOTH genders have to pay. If the women get on there for free its 90% bullshit.

594,bfnt6i,False,,47,Just cut someone off and I feel awfully sad about it.. but it was the right choice,dating,"I met this guy on a dating app and we quickly became close, talked a lot and met up a couple times over the span of a month and a half.

the problem is - he kept letting me know that he was still on the fence about us because he had feelings for another girl as well, and was trying to make up his mind between us two. he even brought it up in the middle of sexting! And it obviously ruined the mood. 

nevertheless I found him genuine in that he was always 100% honest with me, and I believed he really was a good person despite the fishy situation with the other girl. but recently he started showing the obvious signs of starting to lose interest (barely keeping up with the conversation, avoided talking about meeting up, I always had to initiate the talking.. you know the deal).

I knew this was probably because he was already leaning towards the other girl, but I was annoyed that he had resorted to this mild ghosting, instead of letting me know the truth.

I initiated a conversation with him yesterday and we actually had a nice talk unrelated to his situation, but I still felt like something was not right. It just wasn’t the same anymore and he still seemed painfully distant.

today I decided to take that step and let him know that I needed to break contact (I don’t like ghosting and I rather let people know I won’t be talking to them again, even if it’s awkward) because I could see this was clearly not going anywhere. 

I went completely against my feelings here, I did feel a lot for him (still do), but I couldn’t deal with this anxiety any longer. I just feel like I was being strung along and now I realize that he probably only wanted me to hook up and sext. 

His reply was a quick apology and wished me well. I can’t help but think he let me go very easily and this dampens my mood even more.

I feel really fucking sad right now but a part of me knows it was the right decision. all I can do now is let time pass and take these feelings away.

I've gotten quite confused regarding this girl \[23F\] I've dated recently. I'm partially looking to vent, and partially looking for the opinion of internet strangers, as I deem I cannot see clearly as of now.

For some background, we're living 3 hours apart, but we both frequent each others' city and we both were even before we started dating. We've started talking \~a month ago, talked a lot through phone & texting, and had a date a week ago.

I felt the date was a success, we connected really well, both of us were chill, no signs of that typical ""first date stress"" at all. We also had sex both in the evening and in the morning, which leads me to think that she is attracted as well.

That's where it gets confusing, as I got the ""let's stay friends"" card from her in a few days. Unfortunately, I'm used to this, I might be too much of a NiceGuy ™, but this is a separate topic. However, this shocked me this time, as I genuinely thought we had a great time, and even before the date, both of us were very clear about that we are looking for something serious.

I've told her in a very polite, yet direct way that I'm not interested in being friends and that we should stop talking to avoid being hurt. Mainly my way of crawling back to my cave, when things go south.

At this point, obviously, I still could not fully understand what went wrong, but thinking that we've discussed this all, I've closed this with simply telling myself ""Not at the right time/right place""

Not even 2 days go by, I get a text from her saying she is confused, missing me and cannot understand her feelings and wants to meet to talk about this, to ""find some other solution"".

How would you decipher this? Is she being pushy on staying friends? Am I misleading myself for believing that this is her way of stating she ""changed her mind?""

I've agreed to meet up and to continue talking (possibly only until the date), but we could not find a closer date than \~2 weeks from now to meet up, which really sucks, as I'm honestly afraid of getting hurt once again in a situation like this... on the other hand, I'm also afraid of wasting an opportunity due to being afraid of getting hurt...

Nope. Not ready. 

So I took the cue and have started dating around while still seeing this main guy. And honestly it has shown me what I like and don’t like.

These people show up in practically every post and instantly try to shift the discussion toward them and how bad things are for men. Doesn’t matter if the post was written by a woman about a woman’s perspective on dating, these foreveralone types will always just marginalize their concerns and say “but what about men??” or “but men have it harder”.

* Dating is difficult for EVERYONE of both genders.

* Women don’t have it easy simply because there are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with them. In fact, those very guys are the reason WHY it’s difficult, because if you want a serious relationship you have to figure out who is serious and who is just pretending to be sincere to get in your pants

* Stanford University reported in a 2017 survey that online dating is the MOST POPULAR way for heterosexual couples to meet (39%). So the rhetoric that “average men” have no chance in online dating is a delusion that guys use justify their bitterness.

841,aj11aj,False,,159,Tips for guys based from my experiences,dating,"Before I get destroyed, Let me preface this by saying this is MY opinion. Yes, I realize everyone is different. And yes I know guys prob do the same thing.

1) what girls say and do are different 

“I like when a guy constantly messages me. It shows he cares” (or some variation of this). No, they say this but when it happens they get scared, feel you’re going too fast, you’re clingy. And then they hit you with “I’m not ready. Still healing from blah blah blah.”

2) let the girls be the ones that move the relationship along. Just enjoy dating/sex until she brings it up. 

Don’t ask/say “What are you looking for?” “I really like/love you,” etc. See point #1. Sometimes girls might just want to have sex/fun at the moment but  feel like they can’t say that as an answer. In this case they will end it if they feel you want more. (She might change her mind after a some time being with you).

3) Tex her first (THE FIRST TIME). After that wait for her to initiate the conversations for a little bit.  Otherwise you’ll come off as desperate and she’ll be turned off since you’re an easy target for her. Once things start to get serious then start initiating texts/calls at a reasonable pace. (Also, don’t reply too fast (wait an hour or 3). But this is a per case scenario.

4) Have options! She sure does. This also helps you not obsessed (clingyness) over 1 girl. 

5) have a life outside of her. Hobbies! 

At the end of the day girls like their freedom and they like what they can’t have. If you’re constantly talking to her then she will feel trapped/smothered. 

I’m sure I have other tips but these are the ones on my mind right now. I’ve started having way more success since implementing these! Good luck!

870,8cllmi,False,Giving Advice,24,Some important advice for lonely singles,dating,"I've been spending the past 2 months trying to get over a girl that broke my heart. She played me for a fool and used me for emotional support and intentionally kept me around while she was out chasing another man and as soon as he was willing to take her back, I was last weeks garbage. I felt distraught and like thr whole world was against me. I couldn't trust people, I couldn't sleep right, and every day I saw her was like a kick in the head. She had me under her thumb no matter what and I lived day to day praying that she would reconsider.

But then I realized something...my self-worth. I started thinking about how a woman that would intentionally play with people's emotions like that isn't someone that deserves my love and affection and certainly not my time. I realized that anyone who rejects me is missing out on something amazing and any girl that breaks up with me is losing the ""greatest good they're ever gonna get"" (5 points if you get the reference).

I also realized that I can't live my life trying to be someone that I'm not. I sat around trying to become the ideal man and ""Chadify"" myself in an attempt to make my chances with women better instead of just being myself and loving me! I love anime and retro video games and terrible movies and netflix comedies! Nobody can take that away from me and anyone who tries is a waste of my time. I refuse to hide my loves for the sake of those who didn't appreciate them to begin with.

It's not always easy to make a move and change your life or your mindset, but all it takes is one change to turn around your entire life. Today, I went out and got a haircut and a bunch of new clothes, completely changing my look. Now, I love the way I look. I ended up texting a girl that I think is cute that I work with asking to get lunch later this week and lo and behold, she was pretty happy about the idea. That's just an example of how being confident and going after what you want, whether it'll work or not, is incredibly important.

This is for everyone who is going through some pain and feels like nobody likes you or that you'll be alone forever; first, there are people that like you that you'll never know about unless you talk to people and read their body language. Second, it just takes time. Don't rush it and don't put people up on pedestals as though they're unattainable. You never know who may have a hidden crush on you!

Long story short, love who you are. Love what you like. Embrace it and even display it! More importantly, don't let people walk all over you!

Often many men will put beautiful they see/meet on a pedestal and act completely different from who they actually are, which only pushes them away. You wouldn’t change the game plan that got you to the championship, would you? Be yourself and know that you yourself are enough to shoulder your own happiness. Girlfriends aren’t meant to be your happiness, they are there to enhance it. You need to wake up everyday, look in the mirror and have the mentality of “you know what? I’m a F****** catch and anybody would be lucky to have me”. 

Adopt the mindset that your life is a long car ride, many people will hop in and hop out of your car but guess what? No matter what you are always the driver, never let anybody take you out of the drivers seat to your glory. If people want to get in? Make sure they are worth it. If they want to get out?

ORIGINAL POST:

Take it from someone doing it right now. If you are dating and meeting new people you may get with someone whom you click with either sexually or have fun BUT not  necessarily want a relationship with.  

Not wanting a relationship “right now” only really means “not with you”. 

Yes there are occasions where this isn’t true and the person doesn’t want to be in a relationship period, but most of the times it means they are waiting for someone else (sometimes someone they haven’t met but an archetype different than you). 

The best you can do is not waste your time and move on or accept it will go nowhere and enjoy it.

As for me I am pretty open towards the beginning what type of relationship I see myself having with the other person so there are no confusions.

During the walk we were asking each other arbitrary questions the whole way up until we got to her place where before we parted I asked ""So... last question of the night.."". She then said ""Uh-oh"" and I started to panic a little bit and said ""Oh man, by your answer that tells me I maybe shouldn't ask it!"" and she said ""No, it's because I already know the question!"". I was a little taken a back but simple responded ""Oh? Well... what's the answer then?"" and she then grabbed my coat and kissed me.

318,c31z9n,False,,130,A scientific look into why some men leave after sex,dating,"Maybe you've heard men say ""Women get so attached after sex"".. Or maybe you've heard women say ""After sex, he seemed not as interested"".

I wasn’t going to post this but I think that it might give some insight even just a tiny bit into why some men “leave after sex”.  I’ve seen many posts about women wondering why the man only wanted sex and everything was fine before sex etc on here so I just wanted to give a little bit of “biology fun fact” type of information on the male and female brain during sex. **Im not an expert by any means** but I am a biology enthusiast going for her doctorate now (not a biologist though) so I’ve read up on this a little bit enough to post this information here which might give some insight to some situations which I think could potentially a tiny bit helpful or interesting.

—————————————————

**Edit: DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert biologist specializing in this topic.** However, the studies I've read and information on hormones is public information. Do your own research please as well. 

**My point for this post was to give/add a different perspective on sex on this subreddit.** There are many variables and every human is different. There are also different situations and nuances. 

—————————————————

**TLDR:** When a man and woman have sex, oxytocin is released. Women feel this “cuddle hormone” and men don’t because their high level of testosterone blocks it. A man's vasopressin (lust and attraction hormone) that had been building up for the woman prior also drops after sex. 

This hormone allows women to feel closer and good about her relationship with the man. Whereas the man hasn’t felt that at all, and due to the dropped vasopressin and not feeling oxytocin, he will move on to spread his seed. 

Only when a man has true feelings for a woman and he makes the decision to commit/be vulnerable/let his guard down with her, his testosterone drops enough to feel oxytocin. This is when the man and woman both feel oxytocin and bond and both “make love”. Oxytocin gives feelings of trust, love, etc.

**PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO by an expert biologist who says everything I'm saying with references and study data:**  **Dawn Maslar’s Ted Talk** - which sums this information up perfectly in short video form (called: ""How Your Brain Falls In Love"")

—————————————————

**Longer Version**

This is the cuddle hormone and for women, it skyrockets during sex. This hormone comes out when a woman is giving birth and having sex etc. it makes the woman feel bonded to the man and more trusting and closer to him (and her baby during pregnancy).

The high level of testosterone in men blocks the effects of oxytocin. He does not feel those same effects of a closer bond with the woman (there are exceptions, more on them later).

In fact, vasopressin in men builds as he feels sexual attraction for a woman like when dating her, seeing her, being in anticipation, etc (lust, attraction, affiliation hormone). But immediately after sex, his vasopressin buildup for the woman drops. And testosterone blocks oxytocin.

So therefore after sex, the woman is feeling closer to the man and good about the relationship. 

Whereas a man's vasopressin buildup for the woman has dropped and he hasn’t felt the effects of oxytocin at all. Due to biology, if he didn’t have feelings for the woman, it is in his nature to continue to spread his seed elsewhere. 

**HOWEVER, THIS IS THE EXCEPTION: when a man HAS FEELINGS for and/or LOVES a woman** and decides he wants to commit/be with her in his mind, his **testosterone levels DROP when he lets his guard down and makes the decision to be vulnerable to her**, allowing him to feel the same in love, bond, trust feelings of the oxytocin hormone as the woman does during sex. 

Due to the lowered level of testosterone, oxytocin is now able to work and that is when a man is able to “make love” to the woman and feel all of the oxytocin hormone.

Some people act like they're nice and polite and ""a good listener"" like it's some kind of huge plus, when in reality it's something you should always be doing without thinking about it. 

Like look at it this way - I don't act like wearing a shirt when I leave my house makes me some kind of good person, I just do it.  Decency should be the same way - things like making sure the other person is comfortable with the place you're going, not pushing things on people they don't want to do, manners, not leading people on, letting people know you aren't interested instead of ghosting them - you should do these things because they are the right thing to do, not because you expect something in return from them.

And let me be clear, you can be decent and still keep your boundaries.  Like for example, if a guy doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he can decline that if a girl suggests it and it doesn't make him an asshole, but it does if he does it anyway and expects something in return for it.

It all took a ton of work. nothing came into my lap.

I'm the kind of guy that believes ""you just know"" and you need to find a women you are truly excited about, and the ones I have been have never been into me (or never longer than a few weeks) and its been 12 years, I think I know where I stand and its safe to say its probaly not going to happen.

and I'm already pretty much optimized. I'm in great shape, good job, good social circle, etc. I do love myself and I am striving to be my best self.

I'm overweight by a lot and although I'm working to change my life for the better I'm still nowhere what you'd call attractive because of my weight. I've been like that my whole life and because of this and a lifetime of bullying I have next to no self-esteem/confidence. As a result, I've never been on a date in my life. I've never had the confidence to put myself out there as I hated myself so much, I couldn't imagine someone liking me. 

Like I said I'm working on myself a lot and that includes mental health as well. I've recently started putting myself out there and exploring the dating world, online anyway. For the last 3 months I've been on all the apps, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, PoF, etc., but haven't had any biters that weren't malicious scammers. Until this week. 

On Bumble I found a girl who, as far as I could tell, incredible. Cute, works in my industry, same taste in comedy, sports, just a ton of stuff in common. And unbelievably, we matched! We messaged back and forth all week, first on Bumble then via text. Things were great. Because of the pandemic, we couldn't exactly go out to dinner, so I asked her if if shed be interested in having dinner over video chat. Again, she said yes! I couldn't believe it. I spent the night/next day prepping the space where I'd sit, setting up lights to make things look better and testing microphones and cameras. I even found a playlist of ambiance music you might hear in a nice restaurant to have slightly playing in the background. I had everything set. And when the time came.... nothing. 

I texted and asked if the time still worked for her. Nothing. I called to see if everything was okay. Nothing. I waited for an hour to go by before I finally gave up and ate my meal alone in my sad setup. Still haven't heard anything from her. 

I don't know if there's much of a point to this post, if not just a way for me to get my feelings out. I just don't know what could have changed in 24 hours to change her mind. I feel like such an idiot. I'm around family right now and all I can do is put on a smile and pretend like nothing happened even though I'm on the constant brink of tears. It feels like a huge smack in the face, a reminder that all the progress I've made ultimately means nothing. I hate myself as much as ever. I don't know why I put myself through this.

329,f1tcsb,False,Giving Advice,143,10 Lessons Learnt from dating over an year.,dating,"Female's Perspective : I read this list everytime I start talking to a guy.

1. Everything is temporary, the attention, they complimenting you, those words or acts of validation, they making you feel special.
Atleast in the initial days/months.

2. Don't try to built a rapport right away, it kills your rationale. Slow and steady always wins.

3. In reference to online dating - Be the same as you appear to be on chats or maybe a level up. Appearing bold and fun over screen is much easier than in person.

4. Stop being nice. Show your considerate, loving, accomodating self after someone is hooked to you emotionally. 

5. Sleep with a guy on the first day, only if you are okay with him not calling/texting you the next day. Men say a lot before taking you to bed and forget everything the next day. 

6. I don't care about you attitude goes long way. Be selfish, think only about you. Don't be mean or rude, but altering your ways or believes for someone doesn't work. Men will only value you as much as you value yourself. 

7. Know the red flags men show you and act on them when you see. Moving away from wrong people as fast as you can is the key to dating. 

8. Be a good kisser/in bed - educate yourself, tips tricks take you long.

9. Men often drive the conversations in and around sex, if thats not what you looking for just ask good questions in return. You should drive the nature of conversations you want to have. If he stops responding, he was never in it for you.

10. Date with an intention, if the guy says casual he means it, you can't turn it around. And if he doesn't say it, he definately means casual.

I was in a relationship with someone who I ultimately settled for because I was just so lonely and I wanted to know what it was like to be “in love” and to have a long lasting relationship.

But I was wrong. I thought I was in love, I tried to convince myself I was in love.. but I wasn’t. I watched the other couples in my life and I knew deep down that we didn’t have the same love they did. They fit perfectly together, always sat next to each other, were protective of each other. Sometimes I would even forget my SO was in a room. I would compare him to other guys. And I felt so so guilty about it but I told myself to push down those feelings. And I did for a long time.

When I finally got the courage to break it off I felt like the worst person in the world. I felt selfish. I felt disgusting. But I had to remind myself that I’m a human being. And sometimes it’s okay to sort out your feelings and act accordingly.

But I also felt free. I felt like I was giving myself the opportunity to find real, true love. The love people write about. I want that for myself. Right now I’m lonely, I miss what I had with my SO, being held and told I was loved. But I’d rather be lonely and looking than loved and settling. I’d rather go on 1000 crappy dates trying to find the one for me. I’d rather agonize over asking someone out and wondering if they like me.

Upfront, he told me he was looking for a serious, monogamous, committed relationship. But we had never defined the relationship before.

Well, we were talking about holiday plans this year and meeting each other’s family. He was open to meeting mine but a little hesitant about me meeting his because his family lives farther away and isn’t that close with the ones still living. But I thought to myself “wow we made it this far, I’m just going to confirm I’m his girlfriend :)”

So I say “haha I guess I’m your girlfriend now!” after talking about these travel plans. Totally expecting him to say “of course :)” or something like that.

 I don't feel that it's right to have a first date at someone house and especially if you are looking for something more than a hookup.

I understand that it depends on how comfortable you feel with them, etc but I'm supposing there are boundaries. I.e. not sharing your whole life story on the first date, not asking them to move in after the second date, etc. These are extreme examples and common sense that goes for anyone you meet for the first time, I suppose but I'd specifically like to focus on dating boundaries. How long is casual dating and after how long can it be considered serious? I suppose it depends on if you've decided to become exclusive but is there an average timeframe? 

I've never dated before and would like to be mindful of it. 

Also please list the green, yellow and red flags for dating men and women. What are some things that you should discuss/talk about to find out if your views, goals, etc. are compatible? 

Also, after dating, are there relationship stages? If so, what are they? What are the boundaries? What are some relationship flags?

Sharing any lessons learned while dating /being in a relationship would also be appreciated.


Edit - Thank you for all the upvotes and comments. Although I understand that the experiences are different, follow your gut, etc. Please refrain from offering generic advice. 

Even if everyone has different experience, expectations, etc. I believe there will be a set of red/green flags or experiences that are common to most if not all. So please focus on sharing those.

1.) I really love it when you set up a date and then tell me you have somewhere to be in a couple hours. This way, I'm free to have fun without feeling like if I smile too much, I'm inadvertently inviting you back to my place or obligated to have sex.

2.) Thank you for complimenting me on something other than my looks. It sounds really vain, but if you're a little bit pretty, that's all guys tell you. It sometimes feels like the rest of me doesn't matter. But when guys tell me I'm funny or a great conversationalist, I feel like they really like Me (and not a temporary thing that makes me lucky).

3.) Thank you for asking questions. I so appreciate someone who is interested in me and not just what I can do for them. I always notice even if I don't say much.

4.) Thank you for not giving me all the power. I love it when guys are confident enough to argue a little bit. I don't want to feel as if you think I could break over the slightest 'no'. I like a little bit of teasing. It makes me feel more equal.

You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""

This is a post I just need to make to vent and get some advice here. Sorry for the ramble, I'll try to keep it short. I met this girl through work, she reached out to me because we had a work related phone convo and she felt I was special. We instantly hit it off, talked over text and the phone like crazy all day. We eventually met in person for the first time and had an amazing time. We didn't have sex but I went down on her and honestly gave her one of the most intense O's i've ever seen someone have, not to toot my own horn. But I felt pretty good. We cuddled the rest of the night before I had to go home. We live over an hour apart. All along the while, she makes me laugh and feel great. I honestly thought everything was perfect. I try to be reserved at first but I was getting these ""she may be the one"" feelings even after a week. Maybe the fact she let me eat her out on the first date was a red flag that she was just looking for something more casual.

But this whole time she kept complimenting me, saying how great I was, how she is glad nobody has taken me off the market.. all the things you want to hear from someone who seems like they want a real relationship.

She asked me out on a 2nd date, and well during quarantine there isn't a whole lot to do, so we ended up waiting in line for several hours for some food at a packed drive thru that is always packed and takes hours. She didn't even like the food, but knew I'd never had it before so we went.  We got out of the car and danced together, we sang together, held hands, kissed.. I mean what did I miss here?

Why would someone do all that if they didn't feel anything? -- She starts telling me how she has trust issues and is afraid of being hurt, how she never has had a good relationship and doesn't know how to take care of it, etc... And normally she would just ghost or tell people to fuck off, but she really cares about me. She said she really wanted me to know that she was going through this because she felt I was special.

So I let her have some space while she does that, but she just pulls away.

Wtf mate? I just don't get it. Asked her what was up and we talked on the phone. I asked if there was something I could do to help her through this trust issue and she said it would help if I could tell her how I felt. So I put myself out there and was just honest. Told her I was crazy about her, how I want to keep getting to know her and go out more, how much I enjoy talking with her.  She ends up saying that Everything about me is amazing. That I treat her like a queen, that she is always dying laughing around me, that she always looks forward to hearing from me or seeing me.. But just ""something"" isn't there. Like there is no spark...  But she really feels I am special and cares about me.

So I had to tell her that I just can't really continue like that then and think we shouldnt talk much anymore. She keeps saying she is sorry and we hang up..

I am confused. I know I should just love myself and not care, but everything seemed perfect. I am normally pretty good at spotting my mistakes, or seeing signs they aren't interested.. But she gave so many she was. From all the affection she was giving, to playing love songs in the car while we waited, to touching me, kissing me, grabbing my hand to hold. Was I too nice? I wasn't unconfident, clingy or anything of the like.. Just said sweet things.

I seriously hate dating. I don't know what it is about me that pushes people away, but I am reserved at first and can take a minute to get to know. That doesn't ever seem to create any ""spark"" at all for people and I just am lost. If you suffered through this. Help. I'd be glad to elaborate or answer any questions.

We walked around town and sat at a pub for 8 hours straight and it literally was like the best date ever. We hit it off great, had a lot of fun (some great dark humor) and great conversation and we both felt both a physical attraction as well as a more serious connection on a more personal/emotional level. Time flew by, and it was the best date I ever had. We planned a new date a week later to the Belgian natural history museum, and were just walking home to her place at around 3 or 4 a.m., where we would watch some porn (for some reason, we wanted to discus the graphic details in some explicit Anime/Hentai movies). Anyway, as we're walking to her place, we ended up talking about the one time she had intercourse with another girl. She said it was a great experience, but a one time thing. She said she certainly was not lesbian because lesbians/gays have a disease, according to her. I was shocked. For some time I kept questioning her about this, and turns out she strongly beliefs non-heterosexuals have a genetic disease, are worth less than others and in an ideal world they should be dead. Then, she went on by trying to justify her homophobia (or convince me of it) by saying ""of course I think this, I also am racist because I am smart"". Isn't that a great line of reasoning (btw, she actually is smart as she is a PhD student just like me). Turns out, she felt people from other races were worth less and should have less/no human rights in order to make them become extinct in the future. She was not kidding.

Anyway, I felt sick in my stomach upon realizing she was homophobic and racist. I sat down for 2 minutes on the street as I was quite shocked, then said something to her and just walked away. Now, I feel like an idiot for really liking this girl, having like the best date ever only to realize she is so sick in the head. I mean, I really cannot stand homophobia or racism.

The kicker is that that is the easy part. When you meet her in person is when your dancing monkey act had better be spot-on. Unfortunately, my act definitely needs some work (on my first date of my life I asked a girl if she had any neighbors while I was holding a knife). I'm always super fuckin nervous. That's too bad, because it's all about first impressions, and I'm someone you've got to get to know first. If you suck at job interviews you will suck at dating as well.

Anyone else feel the same way? I'd really love to have someone I could spend some time with. Shit, but dating? No, way, dude.

Thing is. You’re not going to be compatible with everyone you meet. Not everyone will be into you. But that’s fine. Because it works the other way too. I mean, you’re not into everyone you meet, right?

If online dating feels like a drag, give it a break. It does feel like an endless swiping and messaging cycle sometimes. 

But always be you. Don’t conform or change who you are to try to get someone to like you. 
You will meet someone who will like you for you. She’s out there, and there’s more than one.

402,d4zx7r,False,Venting,120,I told someone I like them for the first time in my life,dating,"Yep I did it. 90% certain they don’t like me back but I did it anyway. I need to move on with my life and having this crush is not helping me whatsoever ahahahahah

I told him I liked him and literally left so now I have to wait for an answer - I know I’ll get one he’s a good guy. 

God I just want him to reject me quickly so I don’t have anything to think about anymore!

Edit 1: idk if you guys who commented get notified when I update a post but here’s what’s happened so far

Saw him Wednesday/Thursday in class and our relationship hasn’t changed at all! I’m a cuddly touchy person so he touches me a lot for instance on Wednesday if I needed help while working on the desktop, he’d come over and basically plop his arms around me to get to the desktop - he even put his head on my head.  Another time we were listening to a lecture and I was falling asleep (I was sitting in front oh him) when I rested my head on the back of my chair he picked my head up with his hand and put his arm under it. Thing is, we haven’t talked at all about this whole me liking him thing, and we don’t text much of at all (he leaves me on seen actually) and last Thursday I asked him if we could chat and he avoided it - but to be fair to him he could’ve been busy like he said idk.

Honestly I’m so confused. I have no idea what to think. I messaged him today to tell him we should chat on Monday at lunch at that lunch was on me. So hopefully all goes well. I’m pretty certain that if he was sure about me he’d have already said something, so either he’s unsure or doesn’t want to let me down.

I have contingency plans for both situations; if he’s unsure I’ll suggest we could try dating - no pressure, or if he’s not interested then I’ll ask him to be more wary when it comes to touching me and teasing me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/d4zx7r/i_told_someone_i_like_them_for_the_first_time_in/,425,"I told a girl as much last year and went on two awesome dates before she started ghosting me and got with another guy she once called a creep.

279,dqwf6p,False,Other,200,You do need significant others.,dating,"I wrote this out as a response to a very common comment I see in subreddits like this one where the commenter tells the poster that they shouldn’t need a significant other to be happy and that their sense of self worth should be higher. I understand that some people can function alone, but the average person cannot. Anyway, it’s a long post, but I think it’s worth saying.

Insinuating or explicitly saying that people should be happy alone is a lot of bullshit that metaphorically blind people perpetuate. The truth is that finding a significant other is an enormous part of the average person’s life; it is a constant in every culture around the world. In fact we are driven by a biological imperative to look for a significant other and in this sense, it is truly a necessity. Perhaps not in the way that water or oxygen is a necessity but more akin to needing a warm and safe place to call home. Ultimately we are slaves to the chemical signalling that drives our human machine.

Furthermore, what really is self worth? It seems like a common misconception is that self worth is determined solely by oneself in a vacuum (metaphorical), when in fact your sense of self is an object moulded by all the feedback from your environment. No one is born who they are and it doesn’t matter if you think you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread unless your environment gives you feedback to let you know it’s true. And as it turns out, one of the most rewarding feedbacks you receive from your environment is the affection of a significant other. It is validation of what you might have already hypothesized about yourself, but could not have possibly known to be true until verified. My point is that we really do need affection and significant others in our lives; the way that we are treated in society is important and determines how we fit in and function.

I understand that these things are complex issues without black and white answers. In fact, these things probably fall into a bell curve somewhere, but what we understand so far about humans tells us that the average person does in fact need a significant other/s as a necessity and cannot function alone. Functioning alone is actually a joke; everything we know about our biology tells us that we weren’t designed (metaphorically) to function alone. So can we please stop telling each other lies and minimizing the real frustrations that people post about. Maybe then we can actually solve problems and move forward instead of pretending like everything is perfect.

EDIT DISCLAIMER:
I understand that I am posting an edit to this post long after the thread's burial; originally I started going through the various replies and worked on writing an edit to further clarify and offer rebuttals to arguments posted in the comments. However, I was quickly overwhelmed and ultimately it felt like replying would probably be more work than it's worth. However today, I came across the document I used to write my responses and I wanted to delete it without letting the words go to complete waste. So below are my edits to try to respond to some of the concerns in the comment section. 

Edit 1:
It seems like there is some clarity required as to the definition for *need*; the definition that I used was based on human requirements that would cause large (subjective) amount of pain if left unfulfilled. It seems to me like a lot of the commenters to this post would only consider something a need if it would cause death if left unfulfilled. Herein lies some fundamental problems.

Edit 2:
With a more established definition of what *need* means, we can now look at some of the concerns regarding individuals that continue to argue that one does not need a significant other in their lives to be happy or fulfilled. Again, when concerning the average person, the want to have a significant other in their lives is a need because it is biologically driven; when left unfulfilled, it causes a great deal of pain (to the average person). The systems that drive humans to want to be with significant others is similar to the systems that reward us for eating calories and nutrients; evolution has shaped our biology to feel pain and happiness as a mechanism to control our actions to move towards the larger goal of the survival of our species.

A caveat to this argument though is that while companionship is a need, there are no laws in the universe that say that each human person will find at least one significant other. The world of biology does not operate this way at all and in fact natural selection is a key factor in ensuring the survival of species in general. So unfortunately, it is definitely possible that you can search your entire life for your significant other and still come out empty handed. The natural world doesn't care about pain and hurt feelings. However, this aspect of human interaction can be seen as a key driving factor for trying your hardest to stand out and excel as an individual.

I understand that all of these statements make it seem as though procreation is the ultimate goal for human individuals. While I'd be at a loss to argue against that since logically there can be no goal greater than existence itself, I want to stress again that this only applies to the average person; it would be entirely possible for individuals to live happy lives alone (I have known one such person), but it definitely cannot be the norm since if everyone decided to live alone, it would ultimately lead to the demise of the species and thus breaking the fundamental goal that our biology is attempting to optimize.

Edit 3:
Answering some of the comments arguing against my post requires a deeper look at human purpose in life. A lot of people draw purpose from religions and also create their own purposes and goals for their lives; I understand the appeal and while I would never try to take it away from anyone, the truth is that religions are all based on things that cannot be directly observed or proved and self prescribed purpose is by definition made up. I am of the opinion that there is no observable purpose to life in the large scheme of things; we exist, the universe exists as we see it and nothing more. But at the micro level, biological beings do have an observable purpose, especially if we allow form to dictate function. We observe through out the animal kingdom that life's purpose seems to be to continue to ensure existence, that is to say that each species seems to be optimizing for its own continued survival. And since humans are also animals, one of our most fundamental concerns in life is to ensure the survival of our genetic material. Again, this would only apply to the average person, since deviations from the norm cannot account for the larger goals of the species.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dqwf6p/you_do_need_significant_others/,561,"The fact that so many people liked this post is scary.

Dude 10 years ago you could still grab a girl’s ass at a bar and it would genuinely work to your advantage most of the time, even if she didn’t like it, another girl would see that behavior and be attracted to it.

Girls would actually fixate on YOU even if you just had one ‘box checked’ because Men were still seen as providers [not disposable]. It was not full on like the 50s in 2010 at all of course, but rather, ten years back were the final days of male-socio-centricity [at least until the next ‘Reset’ when they can not fend for themselves without male protection].

But in 2020 the younger females are completely emboldened with the belief they do not need men. I dare you to find a single, Western female that answers affirmatively to the question “Do you need a man?” Many are even convinced that they are just as physically capable as men and are reinforced in this falsehood by the (((culture))) while being kept from the consequences of this belief by the (((Government))). And as long as the current zeitgeist remains, My deepest most sincere advise to you is 

1. DO NOT TRY TO FILL A HOLE IN YOUR LIFE WITH A FEMALE OR EVEN FEMALES. Focus on specifically on improving yourself and do not chase girls at all. 

2. **DO NOT JOIN A DATING APP**. The very nature of dating apps reduces the value of a man to absolutely nothing, and unless you are very good looking you are likely to get demoralizing results for a myriad of reasons, including, but not limited to, algorithms that decide to **only** match you with severely obese woman, which Hinge will do. The kind of girl you imagine filling in the hole in your life doesn’t have a dating app because she’d be someone who wants to take care of/bond with a decent guy. 80% Dating app girls mostly want artificial attention from beta orbiters whom they have no intention to date/sleep with and only match with the top 10% of men (a study has shown), and this behavior that is relevant to the majority of female dating App users makes Tinder the equivalent of:

“Yo M20! Let’s go to this party tonight. There’s going to be 100 chicks and 100 guys. Yea, all the decent 4-10 on attractiveness scale girls will be put into a group and then all the duds [obese, ugly, tatted up debt slaves] put in another group. Since we’re not top dog 10 percentile Alpha, apparently us 90 guys are only allowed to wade through [or can expect to match with] all the duds while team Alpha gets to algorithmically parse through all the high sexual market value women. The party doesn’t sound fun? What could not be fun about being at this party watching 10 guys bang 80 chicks while us 90 guys quibble over these 20 Chelsey Clintons.

60,hqjbls,False,Venting,596,I’m surprised at how normal it seems to be to expect sex relatively fast,dating,"The other day I read a comment from a guy saying that if a girl hasn’t had sex with him by date 5, he assumes that she’s either not interested in him or not interested in sex in general and moves on. This seemed like quite a leap to me, but I marked it as an outlier and moved on. 

Today, there was a whole thread about it where many people agreed that it was a huge problem to not have sex/sexual contact by the 5th date. Is this view really that common? 

I’m someone who usually likes there to be a good emotional connection/building of trust first, and to me it seems a little wild that this is supposed to happen by the 5th date. If the dates started with the person as a total stranger,  I feel like you’re still just at the tip of the iceberg with getting to know them by 5 dates. 

I don’t know, I was just shocked by this consensus, and it seems like a wild leap to say that someone’s either asexual or not interested if there’s not sex by 5 dates. I will also say that as a woman, many guys will see you as “easy” for putting out too soon in their eyes, so it seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of situation.

Edit: after reading the replies it seems like as a woman, it can be easy to feel like a guy’s just in it for the sex/not in it very seriously if he pushes for it too much/too fast, but as a guy, it can be easy to feel like the girl is not interested/not in it very seriously if the girl’s not having sex after a bit.
