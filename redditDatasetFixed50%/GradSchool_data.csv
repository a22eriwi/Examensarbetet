One is really tempting and the program seems really good but only issue that is keeping me from accepting the offer is that  it doesn’t have health insurance. I checked their website and they do not even have subsidized health insurance at all for any graduated students.

It's often out of the hands of the actual program. That's more of a university-level decision. 

Really, you have to consider the cost of living. If you are getting 30k and rent should be less thank 1k.... that's likely easy. If you are moving to a costly area ::cough:: UCLA ::cough::, well.... good luck. You would need additional reassurances to ensure the next 4-6 years are comfortable.

317,d7pjj3,False,Professional,1,Citation and Common Knowledge Advice,GradSchool,"Hello World!

I am working on a cumulative/ e-portfolio project and I am wanting to include some “research” or “detailed notes” excerpts from my archive into a section displaying some of my previous projects. 

The majority of what I want to display doesn’t include traditional references but are from a professional online “course/training” from work as an intern.  

Though they are notes, they are delivered in a way that is highly detailed and formatted including diagrams and drawings that differ slightly from the original source, but the information is the same. 

TLDR: 

What I am stumped on is that in the field this would be common knowledge and I don’t want to professionally put out work that isn’t “mine”. However, the information obtained from the source is very concise, and I don’t want to muddle the work to claim it as my own. 


Question: How do I go about this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/d7pjj3/citation_and_common_knowledge_advice/,1,"Cite the original source, as well as the online training source, but do not present something that is not your work as yours. ",2019-09-22 12:05:57
256,d58brg,False,Professional,80,On a scale from Leslie Knope to Jean Ralphio...,GradSchool,How douchey do you think it is to have diplomas framed in your office?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/d58brg/on_a_scale_from_leslie_knope_to_jean_ralphio/,139,"I appreciate the humor in your OP and I like that people are encouraging you. Let me give you another opinion though from a Bourdieusian cultural sociologist: 

Nothing says ""I don't belong"" or ""I'm really educated!"" like preemptively proving that you belong or are highly educated. 

In other words, whether you should do this or not really depends on your field (in both senses) but the higher status the field you are in, the less you want to hang up your diploma. Briefly, putting up your diploma shows that you think of the diploma as a significant accomplishment. But for an ACTUALLY high status person (not just a nouveau riche, or equivalent) getting such a credential is no big deal at all. 

So, by hanging up your diploma, you are basically sabotaging your own symbolic capital - the capital/advantages that come along with 'looking the part' and acting as if succeeding in a given field was perfectly natural and unconsciously achieved. Hanging it up might impress people - but it will only likely impress people with LESS cultural and symbolic capital than you (and therefore the people who can benefit you the least) because everyone with more capital than you will likely have the same or better credential anyway. 

Your diploma does not distinguish you from people with more educational/cultural capital than you. Rather, it distinguishes you from people with less. However, the important point here is the GROUP THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN. 

(All of this is not completely unrelated to why people like Steve Jobs wore jeans and T shirt to investors meetings where gazillions would be discussed etc... 'all in a day's work for someone as comfortable with this status/world as I am.' It's the overdressed people who out themselves as uncomfortable, like they don't REALLY belong there.)

Of course, I am not saying all of this is NECESSARILY true (as different fields have different logics). But this is one answer that I didn't see in the comments and wanted to share - after all, you have an advanced degree now! 

In summary: I'd look to see what your role models and mentors do and follow them. ",2019-09-16 23:09:32

329,a8pbq0,False,Professional,8,"I will soon be the last remaining ""senior"" lab member, being pressured to stay after graduation as a post-doc. What would you do in my situation? Help!",GradSchool,"In short, due to coincidental timing, a **huge** portion (~2/3) of my lab will be moving on by the end of next year either due to graduation, retirement, or opportunities elsewhere. All of the departures are on good terms and I legitimately like all of my coworkers. However, this includes the PI of the lab who planning retirement. Due to my experience in the lab (4+ years here), I seem to be a candidate for eventually taking over the lab. Indeed, at this point, the PI has already taken two steps back and offloaded many responsibilities to me (even though I am still technically a graduate student).

However, a few considerations:

* I enjoy the work, but over the past few years I've come to discover that I do **not** enjoy journal writing. My original plan was to enter industry, not become a post-doc.
* Is it normal to be concerned about the future of the lab? Since the departure of two post-docs (who have gone to form their own labs), I seem to be left holding too many of the keys.
* The funding situation is excellent, with the next several years already secured.
* The pay differential is worth considering. Personally, I would take a lower paying job to have a better work-life balance, but my University seriously gives post-docs ""the shaft"". The cost of living in my area is insane, and industry in my area *easily* compensates over double to what my University offers.

On one hand, I sincerely want the work that my lab performs to continue. I think the work we do has legitimate value to society in terms of potentially impacting lives. On the other hand, there are some ""cons"" associated with staying. If I stayed, I would: assume a mountain of administration duties, have to rebuild infrastructure to replace lost personnel, manage the remaining students, potentially teach a class once my PI retires, and of course all this with a post-doc salary.

709,bjxt2t,False,Finance,13,Supporting two people on a grad student stipend: Does our budget seem reasonable?,GradSchool,"I originally posted this on r/personalfinance but figured you guys may have some useful insights as well. 

Hubby and I are moving to San Diego this fall where I’ll be starting a PhD program. It is fully funded with a $34k (pre-tax) stipend, and I also will have subsidized housing through the university. I have no debt but he has $35k in student loans at 4.2%. We expect he’ll be making decent money once we move there, entry level jobs in his field are around $50-60k and the area’s job market is quite strong. We also have $20k in savings.

Our plan is to basically live off of my stipend and put most or all of his income toward debt payoff and savings/investments (and maybe the occasional vacation once his loans are gone). Here is our proposed monthly budget based solely on my income:

Income: $2833

Taxes: $300 (estimated based on an online calculator; I will not have to pay SS)

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities/internet)

Groceries: $500

Eating out: $100

Car: $0 (paid off, though it’s pushing 150k miles so not sure how much longer it will last)

Car insurance: $150

Gas: $75 (I will commute by bike, he will likely drive)

Phone: $50

Gym: $45

Health insurance: $0 (I’m covered by my university, he’s on his parents’ plan for the next year and hopefully his future job will offer insurance)

Fun/misc expenses: $300

Total expenses: $2620

Based on this budget we should have enough to live on via my stipend, with a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. His loans have a $200 minimum payment so we can always tap into our savings if he ever loses his job for a while. 

I’m not local to the area, so I’d like to know whether our proposed budget has any flaws or things that I’m forgetting?

I’ve been kicking butt all year- fellowships, travel awards, research grants with 2 more large ones pending. I ‘thought’ I made strides towards my research agenda this year, until last week.

Presented the beginning stages of a paper and pretty much got roasted (so it felt). I’m not going to lie- the people who even took an interest are tops in their field and provided amazing feedback, but dang! I fully expected it to be brutal, but not THIS brutal. I left feeling that meeting like I’m the biggest loser in my department and not grad school material. More importantly like I’m an absolute waste of time on their end. It’s been about 5 days and still can’t bring myself to look at more than a sentence of the written feedback they gave me. Not even the notes I wrote down during the meeting. 

I’m sure it’s equal parts imposter syndrome and just graduate school burnout in general. 

What has helped you get your head back in the game?

****Edit: thanks all for your posts and comments, but I think the main question I’m asking is getting lost in the message so I’ll ask it again: What has helped you get your head back in the game? You know, self care tips that have worked for you?

- yes I know I need to ‘suck it up’ and grad school is tough and life is tough but this also doesn’t mean that I am expected to dismiss how I feel. Further, this isn’t my first bout of rejection. Like I said before- this is a combination of imposter syndrome mixed with just general grad school burnout that is making it hard for me to find the energy to push through. I know what has happened as a good thing, but it still doesn’t dismiss the fact that  I feel like garbage about it. That in itself is my issue at the moment. Techniques for limiting burnout/imposter syndrome. 

I don’t expect to have a hand holding session by my professors, either. Thankfully one of the reviewers has been amazing with constructive feedback, so this isn’t really a hazing issue. It’s 100% my issue. We have those hazing a*hole professors here too, and you learn quickly who to steer clear from.

569,fdul3t,False,Research,1,Keeping up with many projects or focus on one,GradSchool,"Hi everyone. I didn't know whether to use the Research or Admissions flair. Let me elaborate.

My background is CS and I'm conducting research on deep learning models (this is so common these days Inactually feel kind of weird saying it). Anyway, I told my advisor on Monday that I'm going to opt out of my integrated program and graduate with a master's, and also apply to PhD programs abroad this year.

He advised me that I should really try and get a publication with me as the first author out before applying, as it's not typically expected that master's students have their own publications (unless you're going for the ""top schools"") but that it would really help me make a difference, and even if the submission doesn't work out it'll be good experience.

Long story short, I'm currently involved in three research projects. I'm starting to think that focusing on one and dropping the other two will be a good idea so I can focus. The projects to be dropped I don't really see myself doing long term anyway. The submission date is less than two months away btw.

744,a1c5rb,False,Finance,0,"Free food etiquette, ""from the other side""",GradSchool,"I am also a grad student and I like to eat. I have attended events where free food was a big part of my motivation, and I often eat my fill. And I like providing people with food and hate food waste.

However, now that I have been helping my advisor organize a conference at our school, we unfortunately had to ""kick out"" a few people who came just for the food and did so in a stupid, arrogant and/or disruptive way. So I would like to give some guidelines to new students at my school, and generally everyone interested in free food, to increase chances of actually getting food and avoiding getting kicked out and awkward situations. Of course, this is open to discussion and criticism, but here's what I've come up with from this experience:

\- If the attendees are paying to attend the event (e.g., it's a not-only-internal conference), you most likely can't just enter and help yourself. Don't try to lie your way in, or at least not in a stupid way - don't say you are an organizer / an organizer's student, because these people asking you who you are at the entrance are likely to be the organizers' students themselves or to call and check. There may be a back door through which you still can enter...

\- In any case, if you intend to mix in with the attendees, dress appropriately so that you don't stand out too much: at least it needs to be clean, without visible holes, and fancier than old sweatpants+sweatshirt. The standards may be higher if there are important guests (e.g., professors) from countries with higher clothing standards, such as most of Europe and Southeast Asia, and some organizers care to not be embarrassed about that. \[I am in Israel, where this especially needs to be said, but this should also be an important notice for many students in/from some other countries such as the US.\]

\- Eat politely and moderately enough to not attract attention. If there is only a little food (compared to the number of people present), don't try to stuff yourself, but only take one serving (until the attendees have finished eating).

\- Don't say anything offensive or controversial; if someone tries to make small talk with you, usually the best strategy is to get them to talk about their work.

\- If it is a sort of a sit-down meal, if tables and chairs are provided especially for the event, most likely the chairs and cutlery are counted and extra people will be noticed, and a problem as some of the actual attendees won't get a sensible place to sit. I just sent such extra, unregistered students (and some registered students who brought them) to eat in the hallway, where there happened to be some more tables and chairs, as we had a plenty of food so the only problem was sitting space, but some organizers may be less accommodating.

\- Usually the safest, easiest and most reasonable strategy (especially if you can't dress and behave properly and/or are in a totally different field of studies) is coming right after the meal, i.e. right after the beginning of the following lecture, after the attendees entered the lecture hall, and helping yourself to the buffet leftovers. Politely asking the servers, cleaners and such staff about leftovers should also be fine (unless you are in a place where the local law forbids it). Obviously, don't try to fill leftovers containers while the attendees are still helping themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/a1c5rb/free_food_etiquette_from_the_other_side/,25,,2018-11-29 00:25:42

This would, of course, be dependent on me actually finding a lab job of some type- if I'm going to take a year off, I should at least gain some relevant skills.

My goal is to become a professor at a PUI, but that's feeling less and less realistic every day and I'm starting to feel like I'll never have a career that I am passionate about and where I feel valued in my workplace.

To handle this, you likely need to add a line in the introduction mentioning what others in the field have already found on this topic (and where the gap of knowledge is), and in your discussion where you compare your findings to other papers. Sometimes you confirm previous work and sometimes you contradict previous work. If you contradict someone else's paper, it is good to discuss why this may be (e.g. we used X instead of Y, changing the context of those findings). Even if your work agrees with previous findings the discussion allows you to highlight what your study adds to the field. ",2020-06-07 09:22:36

I’m leaving this here because it’s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. 

We need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!

I'm a grad student; I have an assignment I'm not clear on. The prompt is to take a significant event from a year my parents or grandparents were born. Then, explain the events using the same source material, from three different historiographical approaches.   
In class, we discussed Ranke, Foucault, E.P. Thompson, Hume, Marx, and The Annales School. Yet, I'm still kind of stuck. As for the event I'm using, it is when John Glenn orbited the earth in 1962.  I wanted to use Foucault, Thompson, and Ranke. But I'm having some difficulty understanding their work. Thanks in Advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ge4kjt/historiography_im_kind_of_confused/,3,"To make sure you have a good understanding of each approach, try first summarizing each in a sentence. Then, under each summary, add bullet point details that are important for elaborating. To really impress your prof (and this will likely be required in your papers at some point anyway), be sure to note how each school of thought responds to the others. Imagine Ranke and Braudel have a verbal battle to obscurity; how would each take the other down? Conversely, also note when schools agree on a certain value. Historiography in the Twentieth Century by Iggers was very helpful for this.

I can't tell you how to best go about this, since it's your project, but based on the event you chose, I don't get the sense that the approaches you chose will be easy/a good match--I do think it's possible, though. I bet Annales would work well: place this singular event in the context of varying lengths of time. Feel free to DM if you have specific questions about the varying schools of thought.

I'm an incoming immunology PhD student. I have about two and a half years of being in a lab under my belt, with about 60% of that during undergrad (so I only had one thing I was working on) and 40% of the rest spent as a post-bacc student. 

How normal is it to have multiple projects - and if you have more than one, are they in the same realm as your main one or are they in different areas? 

I had multiple projects assigned to me during this start of my post-bacc program and I was never fully invested in them besides the first one. I'm wondering if it was because they were in completely different areas (my main one studying in vivo autoimmune stuff and another being in in vrito allergy stuff) or if I was just at project management. If the latter is the case, is there anything that helped you with project management? 

While I'm here, does anyone have any good intro to computational immunology resources they'd like to recc to a newb? I know I can google this (which I fully intend to do), I just wanted to see if there was a jumping off point that anyone especially liked.

290,dl5yjd,False,Professional,3,Gap Year (pre-grad school) Employment,GradSchool,"First post, I hope this is allowed as I am not in grad school yet.

I have just completed my Bachelor's in Political Science in June, which I did really well in. I am hoping to pursue my Master's in polisci in September 2020. I'm currently taking a year in between, and I'm essentially wondering how important the work that I do in between that time is - for future employment as well as for grad school? In terms of title, job description, etc.? Or is this the period where I can just say screw it and take a job solely based on pay, not content?

I have been working at a tiny research-based NGO since July as a researcher. The NGO's mission is definitely interesting, but the pay, environment, and my manager is bad. I do nothing 95% of the time, it is extremely mismanaged. My title is great, job description is great, and it 100% looks good on my CV for the career I want (especially because prior to this, my experience has been mostly admin). It is also only a 30 minute commute (although I don't like working in the suburbs, it's convenient).

I was just offered a different position downtown, where the commute would be 1h30 each way (very long... but I'm also excited by the idea of working downtown). The company is what gets me though - fantastic environment and office, great perks and vacation, and it pays 10k more (which isn't a lot, but it's the difference in me being able to afford buying a car vs. not, for example). Right now I'm paid next to nothing.

Problem is, it's writing-based  which is sort of connected to my field, but has absolutely nothing to do with research. If anything, it's more on the comms and marketing side of things. It's definitely a step away from what my current job looks like on my CV (even if I don't *actually* do much - the description sounds like a really good first step for someone who does want to go into academia and research). The new position, although it has to do with writing, can't really be BS-ed into being connected to my field at all.

I appreciate any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/dl5yjd/gap_year_pregrad_school_employment/,1,I think the question may be if you need the grad degree to do what you want to do.

Just glad I have less than 2 months of that. ,2019-10-21 19:56:57

It's simply a willpower/motivation thing. If I put a gun to your head and tell you to work, you'll work for 24 hours straight. If you have facebook open, your phone on the table with whatsapp etc. then it's never going to work.

Procrastinators usually perform in ""sprints"" where they crunch before a deadline. That is not an effective strategy long-term. You need to learn to do it every (work) day.

Behaviorism is pretty useful here. Just like you were trained to poop in the toilet instead of in your pants and perhaps trained to brush your teeth, wash your hands etc. you can train yourself to do work. Consistency and establishing a routine is key. It's a lot easier to just stick to a daily routine than try to come up with some new behavior.

I went to the army and we woke up at 06:00 every morning, had 10 minutes to put some clothes on, use the toilet and be ready to move out for food. First week was chaotic and sucked, 11 months later we'd have time to chat and mess around and browse reddit on our phones. Things like making your bed, going to eat at specific times, cleaning your barracks every day, cleaning your gun etc. just became habits that you did and didn't feel terrible anymore. To the new recruits we seemed like gods of war because we could put up a tent in 15 minutes, get a fire going and fall asleep on a pile of logs and branches (better than cold uneven ground). It's just habit and having done it 100 times before.

Years later and I can't wake up at 06:00 to save my life, even a little bit of pressure from a hurry turns the whole morning into a chaotic mess and I haven't made my bed for a long time and I clean my apartment maybe once in a few months.

722,b1hg5t,False,Finance,3,Accepted to an M.A. but received almost no financial aid. Meeting w/ Director of Admissions next week to ask for more -- any tips for preparing for that conversation?,GradSchool,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I was recently accepted to a fantastic program that I'm so excited about (2-year M.A. in School Counseling). Unfortunately, I received little to no financial aid. My family and I are on OK footing financially, but with a baby and my impending loss of income, I was definitely hoping for more money than this.

&#x200B;

I have a meeting with my school's Director of Admissions next week. I'm willing to defer admission for a year if it comes to that, but I'd really like to start in Fall 2019 if possible.

&#x200B;

What are my options in terms of asking for more aid? Has anyone navigated this tough conversation successfully?

&#x200B;

Background info:

* I am a minority male who would be entering a field dominated by white women. I'm not exactly looking to throw down the race card though, yikes. Is there a way to tactfully highlight the value I bring to this profession?
* I do not have another acceptance letter to ""compare against"", though I don't even know if that's a thing for grad schools....
* School costs \~$36k per year including books, fees, tuition, etc. I received a $2,500/year award that's given to every person in this program. No aid beyond that, from the school or from the government.
* I plan on going part-time (< 20 hours/week) at my current job to help cover the costs of school. My job would pay more than any graduate assistantships on-campus.

589,duf6jr,False,Research,8,At what point do you decide that you've researched enough?,GradSchool,"I'm only in the first semester of my master's program, so I haven't gotten too heavy into research, but I do enjoy researching for my papers, even when it doesn't need to be that much

Creating the outline helped me figure out which areas I needed to know more about or in a more detailed way. That process helped a lot with breaking ""researching/writing"" down into much more manageable tasks. Like, instead of my to-do list saying ""read more papers about children's writing,"" I had a bunch of items that were like, ""find out when children have good enough motor skills to form letters"" and ""read more about the role of reading comprehension in early writing"". Sometimes when I sit down to write, I still get to a point where I needed to find a reference or two for a point I want to make mid-paragraph, but that felt much more manageable to me than just figuring out when I know ""enough"" to start writing.

192,egchz8,False,Academics,7,Information about Masters in CS/Visual Computing at Saarland University - I asked some questions I had in mind to a few students and thought I'd share their responses for other prospective students.,GradSchool,"I had got an admit for Visual Computing at Saarland, and I'd asked around about the university to a few current/past students. Just thought I'd share their answers for everyone who might be thinking of pursuing a Masters here. Note that some of the information is specific to CS/Visual Computing, and may not hold for other programs. I've numbered the answers, where each number corresponds to a specific student's answer. I've copied their answers verbatim, except fixing typos and removing personal details.

**Q1: As a Saarland student, do you have a chance of getting to work with  researchers from MPI and DFKI, while being a Masters student? For  instance, do a lot of students get to do their Masters theses at  MPI/DFKI/any other research cluster? What does this depend on, your  grades/the program you're attending/networking with profs?**

**A1**: Yes. As a master's student, I am involved with MPI-INF as a research  assistant (HiWi). Yes, there are plenty of masters students who do their  thesis with these institutes.

**A2**: Yes, you can get work there. I know countless people who started working at DFKI close to the start of their studies, even when they weren't good at coding yet. I also know people who worked at the Scheer Tower, CISPA, or others. It should be absolutely no problem to  find a small side job during your studies. For theses: usually, professors will openly suggest topics and you  talk about it to them OR you have a topic in mind, talk to a professor  about it and he will either connect you with people who know a lot about  the topic or do the supervision himself. It is mandatory that your  first supervisor is a professor (being a professor is something more  unique in Germany than in in the US, it doesn't just mean ""lecturer""). I  know people who did their theses at DFKI combined with their side job, I  know some who did it just with a professor and I personally did mine at  a company, working together with one professor. Lots of possibilities.

**A3**: Yes, for instance I am doing my master's thesis in MPI and I know of a lot of students who do it in either DFKI/MPI.

**A4**: Yes, grades matter but so does prior experience. It can help if you've taken a course with the prof. in question but isn't strictly necessary. If you're going to reach out to someone it's also important to write a nice motivation letter describing your research interests and to make connections to what research is being done in the department, i.e. send a targeted application and not a generic one.

**A5**: Yes - grades are important - how you performed in their classes - you can go talk to them.

&#x200B;

**Q2: What do most Saarland graduates end up doing? Do they go on to do a PhD  at one of the associated research institutes, or move to industry? I did try to learn this from LinkedIn but it seems skewed towards research.**

**A1**: Research. Masters students, for some reason, do not seem to be very  motivated to pursue positions in the industry. I am not one of them, and  I hope to go back to the industry as soon as I am done.

&#x200B;

**Q3: What's the student:prof ratio like, in Visual Computing (VC)? I mean, are profs usually responsive to individual queries/project discussions?**

**A1**: Not sure about ratios. Some lectures have a lot of students, some hardly  have 20 students attending them. Really depends on whether it's a core  course, whether the subject is easy e.t.c. Professors have office hours  during which you can approach them. As far as I have noticed, they encourage discussions.

**A2**: I don't know the exact ratio but it heavily depends on the courses.  There are courses with hundreds of people but also some with only 20-50.  It would be interesting to know where you're from. University here is  QUITE different to the UK/US. Brits and Americans have told me that in  their home countries, it's more like school, there are more resources  (because of the higher costs) which means you can go to the professor  any time you want and they will always be able to help you on the spot. In Germany, university expects you to be more independent, meaning  that you're expected to work through things yourself. Obviously you can  email your professor anytime and go to office hours and whatnot but I've  often heard complains from (especially) Americans that they felt like  they don't get enough support. The job of a professor in Germany is  research + teaching as opposed to only teaching, so they often have a  LOT on their schedule and are therefore more busy. But obviously, you  will find professors who are very communicative and some who are not. It  all depends.

**A3**: I don't know the exact number, you can check the visual computing page for the number of profs. Some professors are very helpful/responsive some aren't. Usually the ""in demand"" professors are less responsive especially if you send them unsolicited (also not very well drafted) emails asking for thesis/hiwi, etc. You can check online for general rules of emailing profs, there are some good posts on Quora/StackOverflow.

**A4**: As a general caveat, I completed the masters a few years ago and things have changed a little since then, mostly that more students are applying/getting accepted and the course selection/profs have changed a little. It depends on the course, but usually the ratio is OK and in any case all profs/tutors usually have a one-hour weekly slot for office hours and it shouldn't be tough to get an appointment to discuss whatever you need to.

**A5**: Depends - if you have a good profile - yes.

&#x200B;

**Q4: Do you happen to know anything about the courses and the quality of teaching in the VC program?**

**A1**: VC program has a lot of overlap with the computer science program, though VC is more restrictive in the sense that you *have*  to take some mandatory lectures. Quality of ""teaching"" depends really  on the professors. The courses, including the assignments, are usually  designed well, and the assignments will contain material not covered in  the lecture. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

**A2**: I do not. I would think that at least some of them would overlap with normal CS courses. For those I can say that some people say that CS courses at Saarland University are a little more theoretical than at  other universities. But CS here has an excellent reputation and I've never known a graduate who did not get a good job afterwards.

**A3**: Again, just like at any university the quality varies but there are some profs who are exceptionally good at teaching e.g. Prof. Weickert.

**A4**: The quality of the program and the courses are very good.

**A5**: I was in VC program - I changed to CS - it has a rigid structure and is quite math heavy.

&#x200B;

**Q5: It's stated on the VC program site that students can take core CS  courses and go on to get a Masters in CS. Do you happen to know people in CS who've done this successfully? I was wondering what the experience is like.**

**A1**: I know students who switched from VC to a CS degree, because they found  the bucketing system in VC (i.e, you have to complete x credits in topic  y) annoying. Computer Science do not have any mandatory courses, and  hence you are never forced to study a topic you do not like.

**A2**: I do not. It's not that uncommon to take courses from other specializations though. A friend of mine did a bachelors for both  ""Medieninformatik"" and normal ""Informatik"" (CS).

**A3**: I know some people who have switched halfway through, it isn't complicated. Some people do it because the course requirements are less rigid for CS and you need slightly less coursework because some credit points go towards your MSc thesis presentation. If you're asking about getting a double degree, you might have to take some additional courses and do a second thesis.

**A4**: As a VC student you can transfer to CS if your grades are good, the courses you can take as a CS student and a VC student are more or less the same.

&#x200B;

**Q6: In general, what's the work/life balance like? I understand different  people have different paces and lifestyles, but assuming that a student  doesn't slack off and doesn't party much, is the pace of teaching  manageable? For instance, do you see people in CS/VC struggling to keep up?**

**A1**: Depends on the quality of the student, and more importantly, the choice  of lectures. You would have an easy time coping up with HCI  (Human-Computer Interaction - it is a core course) if you decide to take  that course. But instead, if you are taking a mathy core course like  optimization, naturally you will find if a bit more challenging.  Personally, I think that the coursework is very manageable. If you are  having a hard time, there's no penalty associated with dropping out of a  course. And students tend to do this a lot - they usually sign up for a  lot of courses, realise later that a) they don't like it or b) they  like it but do not have time for it, and this is very normal behavior.  For instance, I attended machine learning lectures this semester (core, 9  credits), realised that I have too much on my plate and there's no way  I'll find time for all the things that I am doing. Also, the ML course  this semester was offered by the math department, and I am not a fan of  their notations and love for theorems. So I stopped attending ML  lectures, and signed up for an ""elements of statistical learning""  course. The topics are *very* similar to the ML course, but it is  just 5 credits (hence less work load) and they don't care much about  proofs. The point I am trying to make is, Saarland is very flexible. I'm  sure you will be able to find some combination of coursework that you  would be able to cope up with.

**A2**: Obviously extremely different from person to person. There are courses  that are known to be difficult and others that are known to be easier. I  think most people struggle with math the most, although this might be  more for the bachelor's than the master's degree. I think it should be  fine if you apply yourself a little bit. Semester breaks are long in  Germany (2-3 months twice a year, if you don't take seminars during that  time), so you always have some time to relax and cool down.

**A3**: Yes, it's manageable. Finding people to do assignments with helps. Often you are encouraged to hand them in in groups.

**A4**: Depends on the courses you take, but yes, people do struggle if they  take more difficult courses, it depends on your priorities, what type of  courses you want to take, how fast you want to finish, etc.

**A5**: I didn't have a work-life balance - especially during my thesis - it's all work - for me it was...but it's manageable.

&#x200B;

**Q7: For administrative tasks and filling paperwork, do you need to know fluent German?**

**A1**: Yes. You must know German. But I don't speak any German. I managed anyway. So will you ;)

**A2**: I'm gonna say no because of all my American friends surviving despite  not being close to fluent in the language. You should prepare yourself  for LOTS of annoying bureaucracy at the start though. In the first few  weeks, there's gonna be a LOT of annoying paperwork that has to be done.  But people are usually helpful enough and if you struggle too much,  Germans you will meet will help you out with translating.

**A3**: No. Although I was already fluent in German, so I can't speak to this much. Isn't a barrier as far as I can tell from friends.

**A4**: You can get by without knowing German, you can use Google translate and all but in some cases it may be difficult.

**A5**: No no, you will get help - so don't worry.

&#x200B;

**Q8: I read that Saarland dormitories have a long waiting list. Do you happen to know how far back you need to book a slot, to have a good chance of  getting it?**

**A1**: The waiting period is a semester. I ended up getting a one-room apartment (studio?) in the city.

**A2**: Yes, they are always at full capacity and especially during winter  times, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot if you don't apply  extremely early. The majority people live in so-called WGs  (Wohngemeinschaften) which just means shared flat with other people  (usually other students). This is the most cost-efficient option if you  don't generally dislike people (and also you will make friends much  easier).

**A3**: No idea, but it's tricky to get a place and it's best to start as early as possible.

**A5**: That's tough - don't rely on it.

&#x200B;

**Q9: Do you have any specific website recommendations for student apartments (shared housing) in Saarbrucken?**

**A1**: There are a lot of WGs (i.e shared apartments). I sort of wanted to live alone, and hence got my room [here](https://www.studentenwohnungen-saarbruecken.de/unsere-wohnangebote-fur-studenten-saarbruecken.html).

**A2**: The most common one by FAR is [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). The optimal places for students are St.Johann, Mitte or  Alt-Saarbrücken. St.Johann covers much of the city center and also  includes the ""Nauwieserviertel"" which is basically the student's quarter  full of pubs. Mitte is also in the city center but usually more  expensive and Alt-Saarbrücken is a little quieter, further away but  really cheap to live in. Dudweiler is also extremely close to the  university but it's VERY far away from the inner city and anything..  exciting. But they have a nice climbing gym at least.

&#x200B;

**Q10: Are there ample computing resources available to students at Saarland?  For instance, for deep learning experiments or rendering, one would need  access to GPU servers with high RAMs, often for a prolonged duration  (long-running experiments/simultaneous experiments). Are such resources  readily available to students?**

**A1**: Yes. I took a high-level computer vision course (offered by MPI) on my first semester and the course involved a project, and all students were given access to decent GPUs. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were P100s. Basically, you SSH into MPI/University resources through a VPN.

**A2**: We had this at the Computational Linguistics department to train language models etc. and our department is soooo much smaller. So I would definitely think: yes. But that's a question you could ask the Studienkoordinator.

**A3**: Not sure about this. The deep learning boom took off when was already a research assistant in the computer vision department.

**A5**: I would assume..

&#x200B;

**Q11: I've heard that the style of teaching math is rather ""dry"" in German  universities, with less emphasis on proof motivation and visualization,  and more on terse theorem-proof sessions. Would you say that is true to a  large extent, or is this dependent on individual profs?**

**A1**: That statement is true, but fortunately not so much in Saarland. But  then again, I avoid proof-heavy math courses like the plague, so I might  not be the best person to answer this. The assignments do sometimes ask  the students to prove something, and I sometimes do get get annoyed  with this.

**A2**: Yes, that's what I hear a lot too. Math can get rather dry. My math  courses were nothing like CS courses, so I cant compare them with mine.

**A3**: Depends on the professor, and I don't know what your reference point is here, but some do place a lot of emphasis on theorem proofs, and some don't.

**A5**: That's true - I think.

&#x200B;

**Q12: Is there any academic advantage/disadvantage in enrolling in one semester over another, for VC?**

**A1**: Nope.

**A2**: In my experience, the winter semester is the 'normal' one to start for  MOST pograms. That's when you have most of the introductory courses,  etc. But i can absolutely not say if this is the case for VC I'm afraid.

**A3**: Depends on the courses on offer, but one nice course for the first semester which I believe is offered in the summer is the Image Processing and Computer Vision course. Ultimately, I don't think it matters too much.

**A5**: Not really - not imo

&#x200B;

**Q13: How does the process of getting MPI to approve you doing your Masters  thesis there work? Is it like, you get good grades in a set of courses  related to the work of a researcher in MPI, contact him over email  asking for a RA position, then have an interview with them? Or do you  discuss your interests with one of the profs at Saarland, they recommend  your name over to a researcher at MPI, who then contacts you for an  interview?**

**A1**: In my case, I just went to the lecturer at the end of the course (i.e  the last lecture of the course) and straight up asked him ""Is there a  way I can contribute to your research, preferably as a HiWi?"". He said  yes. By this point, he was familiar with me (I was a regular in the  class), and my assignment grades were good. He asked me to email him,  and mention that we talked after the lecture, and that was it. He read  through my resume and offered me a HiWi. Usually, if the  professor/lecturer does not know you, you go through an interview - I  didn't have to since he knew me. Getting a masters thesis at MPI follows  a similar pattern - turn up for lectures offered by people from the  MPI, get okayish grades at least, and then walk up to the professor and  ask. If you seem motivated enough, the professor will usually be happy  to have you as a thesis student. *Some* departments, like D2 at  MPI-INF (Multimodal computing and machine learning) are quite in demand  (everyone and their grandmother wants to do a thesis in ML+CV) and thus  has a GPA cutoff - 1.5 or better. That's an unfairly high cutoff, since  unlike the US, Germany does not have grade inflation, and you have to be  really good at giving exams to maintain an overall GPA of 1.5 or  higher. However, regardless of your GPA, most departments will offer you a thesis if you do reasonably well in their particular course and show sufficient motivation.

&#x200B;

**Q14: How easy is it to make the switch from VC to CS (Do you need to maintain high grades?  Does it depend on CS student strength at the time?), and when can it be  done at the earliest?**

**A1**: It's quite easy. You just have to fill out an application form. Yes, you  must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and you can switch only after the  first semester. Getting 2.0 or higher shouldn't too difficult.

&#x200B;

**Q15: If I decide to take courses at a slow pace, can I stay and study beyond the normal duration of the program?**

**A1**: Yup. You have a whopping 6 semesters to complete your coursework (i.e 90  credits). And then you can take another semester to do your thesis, I  guess. There's some restriction - for example, you *must*  complete 9 credits by the end of your first semester, 30 by the end of  the second, and so on (I forgot the exact numbers). But yes, you can  take more than the normal duration of the program. Also, there's no  ""normal"" duration of the program. Most students I know take 5 semesters -  4 semesters for coursework + a semester for the thesis. But I took more  courses than recommended, and I'm set to complete my coursework by my  3rd semester. I'll probably do the thesis on my fourth semester and be  done with the whole thing, or skip my fourth semester altogether to do  an internship somewhere, though I don't have any internship offers as of  yet. But then again, I was fine with filling up all my free time with assignments and the HiWi job, and not working so hard for the exams. Long story short, how fast you  want to graduate depends all on you. If you go all in, and enroll for  courses during the semester breaks as well (yes, some courses are  offered during the break), then you *can* be done with your  coursework in almost two semesters, and move on to your thesis. That  puts the earliest graduation date as 3 semesters.

&#x200B;

**Q16: What is it like to do a HiWi job at MPI? I mean, what does your day to  day work look like? Do you actually get involved with the prof's  research and get to publish stuff?**

**A1**: This varies *wildly*. I think I won the HiWi lottery though. I  somewhat contribute to the research (i.e helped build a research  toolkit). I am not micro-managed, and my working hours are very flexible, and I'm on friendly terms with my advisor (we get a beer  together once every few weeks). But as far as I understand, what I have  is an exception and not the norm. An overwhelming majority of HiWi jobs are web dev stuff that  do not usually lead to a publication. However, if you do a good job,  you dramatically increase the chances of getting a thesis there, or in  any case, your advisor might be able to give you a recommendation letter  based on your HiWi.

&#x200B;

**Q17: Of the courses you've taken so far, what courses did you love? Also, are  there any courses that you'd blindly suggest to avoid (prof irregular,  teaching unclear with fast pace)? Of course, interests vary across  people, but I'm just trying to get a general idea of the department's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to teaching.**

**A1**: I'll give you a short summary of the courses I took last summer semester:

a. IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) - well structured, you  get a very good understanding of image analysis (sobel and gaussian  filters, fourier transforms, optical flow etc), and the lectures are interesting.

b. (HLCV) High Level Computer Vision - Offered by MPI. Lectures are *bad*  \- they're not boring but there are 200 slides per lecture and yet the  professor (Bernt Schiele) finishes early. I remember explicitly asking  him ""do I need a deep learning background for this course?"" and he  smiled and said, ""not necessarily, you should be able to pick things up  during the course"". I did pick things up, but only because my team put  in an insane amount of time on the assignments. HLCV basically drops you  at the deep end of the pool, and you either sink or you swim. But the  assignments and the project was worth it - I am quite confident with  pytorch now and the background I got really helped me with the other  courses. Once you go through HLCV, you can go through anything. Dr.  Schiele also explicitly mentioned that ""If you survive the first 2  assignments, you will survive the course"". I would heavily recommend  this course, but be prepared to slog.

c. AI (Artificial Intelligence). Waste of time. I took this only  because it was just algorithms, and it was a core course (9 credits).  This was supposed to be my ""easy course"", and though the assignments  were easy enough, the exam was a Kobayashi Maru. You are given 2 hours,  and until you write (and think) really fast, you can't complete the  exam. Given enough time, I could have scored a lot more. Makes me wonder  what they are trying to evaluate - my understanding of the subject or  how fast I can churn out algorithms? I ended up getting a 2.7 for this  easy subject, but I won't complain since I got my 9 credits without  working much for it.

d. TNIR (Topics in Neural Information Retrieval). My favorite course  last summer semester. The assignments involved reading actual research  papers and writing an essay comparing and contrasting them. Had a lot of  fun, and since you read a lot of research papers, you get a good idea  of the research field *and* a sense of accomplishment towards the  end of the course. But this can  be quite dry if you are not into NLP/IR.

e. German classes. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Q18: If you do an internship at a company in the last semester, whom would  you work with for your thesis? A prof from Saarland or a company person?**

**A1**: For doing your thesis with a company, you have to get a professor from  the university to co-supervise you. Not sure if professors like doing  this. In any case, you can do an internship without it being a thesis -  you get 6 credit points for doing a ""praktikum"" - i.e an industrial  internship. The main reason students would like an industry thesis is  that they get paid there, while no professor would pay a Masters thesis student at the University.

&#x200B;

**Q19: I hear Saarland has a gym (Uni-fit). Do you happen to know how much they charge students?**

**A1**: Oh yeah, I use the uni-gym. It's around 20 euros a month for the students.

&#x200B;

**Q20: Is there anything else you wish an international student knew before joining Saarland?**

**A2**: Travel! Saarland is basically in the heart of Europe, you can get to  so many places. Paris is only 2-3 hours away. There are lots of German  cities to visit, too. There is so much to see and you should take  advantage of living so centrally in Europe. All my international friends  said that they loved how easy it was to travel through all of Europe. About studying here generally: never stress too much about  university, there is so much other stuff in life. Take time for your  hobbies, relax and to make and meet friends.  I consider some  international friends I met as some of my best friends to this day.  Don't see studying abroad just a cheap option to study but also to  broaden your horizons.

I am not sure if my department administration will let me do this anyway, but before I even ask I just want to do a sanity check to see if this is something I necessarily want. In particular, I'm worried about:

1. Security of funding -- if the startup does not pay me and the work I do for them will contribute to my dissertation, will my fellowship funding be safe despite restrictions on ""outside work""? In particular, I'm currently on an NIH T32, have NSF GRFP on reserve, and hope to get an NIH F31 and/or F99 in the future.
2. Managing the collaboration -- I've generally been advised that it's not a good situation as a PhD student to be the ""glue"" of a collaboration. While my advisor has indicated interest in the topic and would be happy to advise me on the work I do with the startup in addition to what we're already working on, should I expect the typical drawbacks of ""gluing"" a collaboration?
3. Career prospects -- I am very firmly hoping to land a tenure-track academic position in the long run, but obviously understand that it would help to have industry relationships to fall back on.

I’m not far along at all. I should be most of the way through my research proposal and have my committee at least mostly established. Instead, I’m still trying to figure out what to do. I only have a vague idea of my project. I really get little to no support from my advisor, who is very busy and seems to expect me to be far more independent than any other advisors appear to expect from my peers. 

The worst of it is that despite this, I’d expect myself to be further along. I’m not farther along because I don’t care. My interests lie in marine and estuarine ecology, not freshwater, and turns out I’m not all that interested in doing research. Academia kind of just annoys me at this point?

I’ve already had some mental health issues the past year or two that are of course affecting this, but despite the fact that I’m doing better mentally and emotionally now with medication and healthy life habits, I’m as uninterested as ever. 

What I’m considering right now is switching from an MS to an MPS. There is an all coursework option, or a professional option where you do an internship and present a capstone on it at the end. The benefit of this would be 1. Doing something I’m more interested in obviously, and 2. Since it’s within the same school, most of my credits I’ve taken should apply easily. Otherwise I could apply to a different state school. Downside is many deadlines have passed so I would have to start in the spring, or narrow my options to those with later or rolling deadlines.

The major downside to this is losing my TA assistantship. I’m in state, and could take on some loans, but that doesn’t help my day to day situation. I’d have to find some sort of part time job to pay for rent, my car, etc. Or take out some extra loans to help fund that.

PI claims that funding situation is tight, with no room to budge or delay, so it must be done. “No mercy situation” PI says. “Stay safe, bye!” was the last thing PI said in our online meeting this morning. 

Moreover, PI applied for a special permit so that our group can continue to go to campus to perform experiments, as PI referred to them as so-called “critical operations”. Waiting to hear how that turns out. 

Stay safe, but also risk your health and possibly life by not staying at home for the sake of more research, because pressure from funding sources is a thing. What kind of dystopia is this?

I think how the university has handled this situation is very reflective of how the state as a whole has handled it. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has actually been very on top of everything and quite frankly has probably saved a ton of lives.

Getting to the questions:

* Did you feel any different getting your Masters and being in seminar, discussions?
* For those of with your Masters, do you identify as a professor, or still an instructor? I know some professors, faculty argue you can only be a professor with a Ph.D., so just curious how you handle it, or if it's an issue for any of you at all.

I was initially considering hiring someone but then learned about an alleged industry of computer-based transcription services.

I am wondering if this is too good to be true because the quoted costs are significantly lower than hiring a person.

Do any social scientists or other scholars have any experience with companies like Happy Scribe or their competitors? 

There are 2 languages in my interviews. Some are exclusively English, some are exclusively Tagalog and some are a mix of the 2 languages.

But I am still interested in English only services because maybe 40% of my interviews are exclusively English. If the service is real and still affordable with an option of English only, that means I could find an individual to help me with the remaining 60% that are in Tagalog. 

I had a translator for some of the interviews but their English is shaky. I got to the point where I was conducting interviews in Tagalog myself but that is after I memorized the questions and also groped my way through asking definitions of specific words as the interview unfolded. The point is, I will eventually need someone or some service to translate from Tagalog to English.

I recently subscribed to this community. I started a month ago a little early for a masters program in geology. I strongly feel as though I will want to pursue a PhD but was waiting to see how much I like research full time before then. I think I will decide maybe October or November. 

I am debating applying for fellowships whose deadlines are late this fall. However I am not sure it is worthwhile- I likely will not have published or presented by then (though will have some preliminary results and data, I hope to definitely present this spring). And, I am very new in the program. 

However I did present a little in undergraduate, was extremely involved in extra-curricular activities (a trend I plan on continuing), received several scholarships, graduated with honors *et cetera*. I know my project, and am really starting to focus in on my career and personal goals. 

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to take the time to really make a good application? And if I plan on getting a PhD, should I just wait till next year when I am more competitive since I'll still have a long time to go yet? I am already funded through an RA and full tuition waiver.

Regularly, I come across opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) that I would be very interested in applying but all of them require 2-3 academic references (letters of recommendation). As a result, I have not applied to any of them because I am hesitant to ask my professors who have taught me for less than 4 months for references. I’m pretty sure they don’t know my interests outside of their classroom and would likely say no if I asked.  Plus, I don’t want to ask them every single time I come across an interesting opportunity and want to ‘save’ their references for those critical opportunities.

How do you go about asking professors with whom you don’t have a super established relationship with for academic references? What is the general norm in the academic world in terms of how many times you can ask a professor for a reference?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/9zfl73/asking_professors_for_multiple_academic_references/,5,"A letter of reference doesn’t have to know you personally, they just need to be a testament of your professional life and work ethic.

If you’re in grad school, your courses should be relatively small and your professors will have seen you complete projects at a very advanced level. The professors you mentioned would be fine writing a letter.

If it helps, the best way to approach a letter writer is to explain what it is you want and why you believe you should be the one to have it. This will give your letter writers something to go off of.

Here’s an example 

“Hello, I’m XXX. I am really enjoying your course this semester and have found it interesting, challenging, and fun. The course has helped me grow as a [insert field here] scholar. In order to expand my horizons even more so, I am applying to [insert fellowship, internship, etc.] This opportunity is for students who blah blah blah. I am applying because I want to do/be/create XYZ. As someone who has seen me work in this area of study and are capable of giving an honest testimony of my professional work ethic, I would be really honored if you could write a letter of recommendation?

I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience.

Complete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:

.



I love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don’t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I’m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. 

What I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can’t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit.

The first was a tiny lab with a somewhat micro-managey PI, and the second was too high-risk in its research focus and had very long graduation times. 

My third rotation, which just started a week ago, felt like it clicked immediately. It’s a huge lab (like 40 people, around 15 are grad students) with a strong social bond. Extremely well funded and a very translational focus (my preference). The PI is supportive, obviously a bit busy, but according to his students he makes enough time for them, plus they all help each other deal with issues.

My project is fascinating as well.

What are some other factors I should consider before committing to this lab?

Con: At the end of the day being on a committee does not mean the application will be read differently. Those institutions that rely on service work will stick you with that service work anyway. It will mostly be empty time because committees really work in practice at the board level. The rest is just there. You will also learn to see the stupid bureaucracy of academia first-hand and how meetings are just to do nothing. ",2020-03-04 14:25:59

159,ea6cbg,False,Academics,32,Need Advice on a Participation Grade,GradSchool,"So, I'm in an online Masters program where a lot of the course is based around forum discussions with classmates, projects, and quizzes. In the last week of the course, we have a final assignment of providing the top 5 names of classmates that we believe contributed to our learning in the class.

For every classmate that puts your name down, you can receive 7pts. There is no cap on how many points you can receive, however, the syllabus allotted 40points (or 4%) of your total grade to this portion of the class. So, if you get all 40pts you get an A on this and any additional points you receive is just extra credit. Yes, I know that 7 doesnt go into 40 equally, no idea how they came up with this...

For me, I was only put down by one person, so I received 7 pts (lost 33pts) bringing my grade down from a 92% to an 88.7%.

My biggest question here is, in a grad school program or ANY program, how can 4% of my grade be subjectively judged by my peers to have this much of an impact overall in my course? I tried messaging my professor about this and they didnt view this as subjective so now I'm really stumped and just overall dont feel that this was appropriate. She stated that this was always on the syllabus and having meaningful and impactful discussions with peers is essential for grad school. I dont disagree but I received perfect scores on all of my discussion posts...

In every other category of the course I received nothing lower than an A- but in the end I was brought down by subjective judgment from my peers because no one wrote my name down as having an impact on their learning...

This is ridiculous. Do you know how many students in this class are probably friends that put each others names to get points? Going from an A, not to an A-, but to a B+ IS a huge grade jump for a system that rewards friends for putting each others names. As a current instructor I think this is entirely unfair and would NEVER do this. Students very rarely are able to accurately assess contributions to learning or engagement, and most of the time, esp. for online classes, THEY DON'T CARE. It is far more likely they are putting friends names or random names than carefully considering who has been effectively participating (especially when many of them themselves probably haven't been).

181,esnwmo,False,Academics,5,Pursuing a master's/PhD in I/O Psych as a business major,GradSchool," 

I'm  graduating in May with a degree in Human Resources Management. While  I've enjoyed this field, I've found myself more drawn to I/O psychology  and social psychology, wishing I majored in this field instead. When I  graduate, I will have 9 - 12 hours of undergraduate psychology  experience under my belt (research lab, general psych, and social  psych). I didn't enjoy school til this last semester, and as a result  (and losing my father), I have a 3.15 GPA.

I  spoke with a professor today who took the time out of his day to tell  me his career path, how he went from business, to I/O psych, and finally  to social psychology. I believe that if I were to pursue an extended  education in psychology, I would certainly need a PhD to make $100k or  more.

I'm trying to figure out how I should go about getting a PhD - some options are below:

A)  Work full time & have my employer pay for grad school - perhaps  online? I'm worried about being overwhelmed and sacrificing the quality  of my education if I go this route.

B)  Go to grad school ASAP, and take on student debt. Potentially work  part-time at the university, and receive tuition assistance of some sort  due to being an employee of the university.

C) Pursue a PhD program (though I doubt I could get into one due to not majoring in Psych as an undergrad, and my GPA).

My  biggest concern with doing a PhD is the amount of my time spent doing  this. I don't want to take a long break from school only to go back, and  I don't want to spend more than 8 years on a PhD. Ideally, I'd get my  PhD over with in the quickest time possible, so working while pursuing  it may not be ideal either. My school (University of Tennessee) does NOT  have an I/O master's program, but I would be interested in going to  MTSU for a master's in I/O... Another silly question I have: Would I get  my master's in I/O, and then my PhD in Psychology or would it have to  be I/O Psychology?

I was accepted for Fall 2020 to multiple programs for a 2-year MS in Health Administration. I am currently choosing between CSU Northridge and USC (University of Southern California). The schools are equally accredited by CAHME and both have great post-graduate employment rates.

I am holding back from accepting USC due to the cost. I would have to take out about $90,000 in federal unsubsidized loans at about a 6% interest rate. At CSU Northridge I would require NO loans and am being given $6000 in grants a year for a total of $12000. The degree would cost me under $10,000 easily.

Is the prestige of USC worth the student loan debt? How has your personal experience with student loans been?

They need a ""trial"" cohort to go through the program in order to gain accreditation from American Psychological Association, and brochure says the program will be free to this trial cohort.  

So I apply, and I got an interview.  Interview went ok, I left feeling it could go either way.  Since my interview I have found out that the program would not be totally free- I'd have to pay for roughly 4 credits per semester at least until I get done with classes (could be as little as one year since I got my master's from same school in same department).  My estimates come to about $4k per semester including tuition, fees, and books.  I don't know how their partial funding would work when it comes time to do dissertation.  Also, if I get accepted and do this, they will have a program rule that students cannot work more than 20 hours per week at our everyday jobs.

If I were to get in, does anyone have ideas for how I could come up with the $4k by September?  I work full-time now so I could haul ass and work a ton until then, but free money is always preferable so that I can save a ton to help with living expenses should I do this.  I've started doing google searches but so far most scholarships are already being given out.  I'd look into assistantships but that would mean quitting my current job, and I'd rather keep that since it's in the psych field.

348,ackv1a,False,Professional,6,How can I help a labmate give better presentations?,GradSchool,"My fellow PhD student gives poor research talks. I feel some impetus to help him improve, but need to balance this with how much time and effort I use to help him.

&#x200B;

I thoroughly enjoy giving talks, and since entering higher education, have been actively improving my abilities in this area, e.g., through asking for brutally honest feedback from an audience after a talk, reading books and literature on the matter, attending workshops (Alda Center for Communicating Science), and entering pitch competitions.

&#x200B;

When my labmate gives a presentation, I know he knows the topic thoroughly and has great mastery of the science, but it is also clear he does not know his audience, what their background is, and what is an appropriate level of knowledge for them to possibly learn that day.  His slides are messy (black background, full of small text), and narrative hard to follow.

&#x200B;

Sometimes we are asked to give joint presentations to the same audience, or ""split time"" on a single talk. I have started to decline this requests, as I don't like trying to merge my talk with his.  This hurts me, as I truly love talking about my science. (I kinda feel bad about this.)

&#x200B;

How much ""authority"" do I have to give him unsolicited advice on his presentations? In the Spring, I worked with him for hours on getting him to clearly understand his audience and make adjustments to slides for 1 talk. I don't have the time or energy to do this for all talks. We were tasked with giving a joint presentation later this Spring which I am already not looking forward to.

- Realize that there are different ways to give a good presentation, and what works for some people may not work for others. You should be prepared to justify your advice.

- Even if you've been asked to give feedback, there's an art to doing this well. I like to focus on my experience as an audience member rather than the speaker's presentation skills (no ad hominem attacks). An example: ""I found it difficult to follow the reasoning on slide X; it would be great if you could explain concept Y"" vs. ""You were confusing on slide X; you should have explained Y"". If you need to point out something potentially embarrassing/damaging, do it tactfully (perhaps in private).

- If you are both practicing for a joint presentation, you could suggest taking turns to present and give each other feedback. Also, give praise when appropriate; don't just focus on the things that need improvement.

* The student who burst into tears when told they couldn't use their laptop during the exam. ""But how can I answer anything without Googling it first?!"" 

* ""Will I get extra time for this?"" No, you will not get extra time for having to produce your ID in order to verify you aren't cheating. Just as you will not get extra time for asking to go to the bathroom, asking questions, or requesting more booklets.

The people complaining about ""90% rent burden"" are sometimes unfortunate cases where it's all they could find, but more frequently it is people who choose to live alone.  I've lived 3 different places in Santa cruz, and the first one put me at ""70% rent burden"" so you know what I did?  I took out a 20k loan.  My peers should be ashamed of themselves.

To the general public:

1). We take home $2,100 cash after taxes for a maximum of 20 hr work weeks (and the chancellor just offered 5 yrs guaranteed funding and 2.5k/yr housing supplement)

5) We have access to emergency funds via slug support

However, my current honours thesis supervisor appears to question my visits to other places (3 in total) as it seems I do not wish to stay. Thus I have the following questions:

1) Does visiting labs for potential graduate study different than an undergraduate open house?
2) is it a waste of time for the professor to meet with me in this case where I might entirely be entering the lab in the upcoming year but has a general interest in their research?
3) Does the reputation of the school (note not the lab) matter for ones academic journey?

Seeing that I'll be new to a country - USA, I'd like to know what to look out for and not to screw myself over from these people. 

Please advise on:
1. What to look for in lease agreement
2. What to do if the equipments and service mentioned do not function and are not repaired when asked
3. How to claim the deposit back without it being taken away.

Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/caxmyg/housing/,1,"I lived in a ghetto apartment that did the same thing to me. They charged me a cleaning fee and I asked the office staff if they were going to replace the carpet if I paid the fee and she said no, then I get a bill in the mail for $300 to replace the carpet. I didn't pay it because I do not owe it.

When you move in, you will be given a form to fill out in which you are to document the condition of the apartment when you move in. I would go over every inch of that apartment in explicit detail and note every crack, scratch, wear mark, stain, discoloration, and anything that is not otherwise pristine and perfect. You might need additional paper, because the form they give you does not often include enough space. If you have to send it back to them in physical form, go to the post office closest to you and send a certified letter. This will require someone to sign for it and you will get a receipt, so they cannot claim they never received it because you have a receipt showing that the Post Office delivered it to their mailing address, and someone signed for it.

While you are doing this, take pictures of everything and then send them to yourself. Save them in a dropbox folder or something so there is at least one backup location.

As far as what happens when equipment is not repaired, put in work orders and call the office. You'll need to check your local laws, because in some places, residents can pay for a third party to perform services and then bill the landlord. I had a roach infestation in my apartment because the next door neighbors were hoarders, but the landlord took forever to send an extermination team out there. It was only after I threatened to call an exterminator myself and then deduct the cost from my rent that they sent someone out immediately. Work orders and follow up emails are a paper trail, so if they fail to repair things that could impact the living conditions of the apartment (i.e. heat is out for an extended period of time in winter) then that would help you in the long run. If you're worried about dirtying the carpet, you can buy plastic placemats or rugs on amazon for relatively cheap. Because of my experience, I'll never live in an apartment with carpet again.

Your landlord also just can't refuse to return the deposit. They must notify you regarding the reason they are withholding your deposit. If the reasoning is not justified, or you have evidence to the contrary, you can probably sue them in small claims court, but this can be a long process and you should make sure the evidence is in your favor before pursuing this route.

You should also not be afraid to discuss problems you're having with professors you become close to, because they might know something or know someone to talk to. That's how I found out about a tenant resource center in my town.

I've written three manuscripts, and I've actually quite enjoyed the process for each one of them. But something I've learned is that I just totally hate what comes between completing the draft and seeing it in print. Every time for each of the three papers, it's looked something like this:  


First there were the numerous emails sent to co-authors over the weeks prior, begging for at the very least a response to my email giving their consent to submit, much less feedback on the manuscript.   


For the few that did provide feedback, there was the painstaking process of incorporating their comments when they directly disagreed with/contradicted each other.   


Then there's the teeth pulling-like process of making sure every minuscule t is crossed and i is dotted in the exact specific way outlined in the numerous pages of the journal's style guide. Level 1: centered and all capitals. Level 2: Freestanding flush-left boldface. Level 3: Paragraph-initiating boldface. Use et al in the literature cited for more than five authors. Add ""a"" and ""b"" to citations for works published by the same first-author in the same year. Kill me now....   


Then there's the re-reading the 70+ page document ten more times looking for mistakes, only to spend several more hours shoving the files through the journal's clunky submission portal and having to re-upload the thing another ten times when I find some other teeny tiny bit of something that needs tweaking while checking the rendered PDF.   


Each time I was finally able to hit that ""Submit"" button, I've had this overwhelming feeling of just wanting to be D.O.N.E. To never see that document again and be able to MOVE ON WITH LIFE.    


There's that brief period when it's going through peer review when I'm blissfully ignorant about all the ways in which my godforsaken manuscript is being ripped to shreds. All of the hairs that the reviewers are going to split about things that more often than not do not matter. All of the countless hours I'll have to pour into crafting pages and pages of verbiage arguing about the tiniest hills reviewer 2 has elected to die on. Repeating entire analyses that take weeks to run on the beefiest servers available just because some reviewer didn't like the way one of the fifty variables was calculated.   


Does this get easier? Or at the very least, does it ever start to not feel like individually plucking out leg hairs? Do other people enjoy this and maybe this career path just isn't the right fit for me? Anyone have words of wisdom or perhaps tips to make this feel less painful they'd be able to share?

559,ei72rc,False,Research,10,Failed Dissertation Defense: Need help with writing resources,GradSchool,"So, yes, I am that 1% who failed the dissertation defense. As I am picking up the pieces and trying to organize the 7-page document with 89 line items of changes, I am hoping to reach out to other grad students to try to find more resources for a successful re-defend.

First off, let me say this: I take 100% ownership of the failure. I put together the committee. I hired my editor. My name is on the paper. I also pushed for a compressed timeline. I did the defense. I was the CEO (so to speak) of this study. It's on me.

I also see this as an opportunity to make it even better.

&#x200B;

Here's what I think happened...

My committee is made up of a chairperson who is in my program of study (education policy), a person in the education department and then an expert in the field of study. When I got to my defense and I finished my presentation, things quickly went south. I was hit with questions about what the purpose of my study was, and how it didn't line up with my presentation or paper. Then my grammar and writing got picked apart. Finally, I was told I was going to have to re-defend.

The biggest thing was that my expert was expecting a much different paper based upon my proposal. However, my dissertation chair was the only one who was allowed to edit and comment. I ended up going with a conceptual framework based upon the chair's feedback, and the expert panelist wanted a model. Secondly, they picked apart my grammar, saying the writing was terrible. I did send it to an editor and have been working with an editor for the past 2 years (I am dyslexic and have some issues with sentence structure). However, it was still sub-par. Finally, the system is flawed. This particular program only allows the chair to give feedback and edits. The other two committee members do not get the paper until prior to the defense. So if your expert is not the chair, they might not see it until 7 days before the presentation.

&#x200B;

So, here's what I think I need (I am open to all suggestions)

1. A new editor (possibly found one)
2. A professional dissertation advisor/writer. Does this exist? Is there somebody that I can hire to help me look at my data and help me organize my writing process?

My current program's structure doesn't work. The proposal is supposed to be our first 3 chapters (intro, lit review,  methodology), but depending on what you find during the study, this could mean an entire re-write. The paper was disjointed in the end. The lit review didn't match up well with the findings.

3) Resources for better sentence structure. It's been 30 years since I had to do sentence structure. As an adult, is there any resources for basic sentence structure and writing?

&#x200B;

Anyways, just writing this all out has helped me organize some of my thoughts. Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

I think I would call it a ""dissertation coach"" or ""tutor"" not a writer. I get what you're saying about wanting help with your writing process and someone to guide you and that can be totally fine. You want to avoid the word writer though because that makes it sound like someone will do the work for you, which can count as cheating.

I'm sorry you have to do your paper again. How long is your timeframe this time around? It sounds like your paper may not have been terrible but that your presentation and paper didn't line up, is that right? My first step would be to talk to my advisor about next steps: rewriting the paper from scratch? Rewriting the presentation? Rewriting both to have the same theme? You could loop in an editor in these talks, too, but I wouldn't hire an editor to do any work until you know you're on the right track because you don't want to perfect a paper that you're just going to have to re-write.

I'm a dissertation editor with about 10 years of experience. I would be happy to provide you with a quote and a sample edit but I would be hesitant to do much without seeing the comments on both your paper and your presentation. I'd also want to make sure we had a solid plan going forward and would hope that your advisor could be looped in on the plan or reviewing each chapter, because I wouldn't want you to waste a bunch of money and turn in a nice paper that would just be rejected because of content. We can talk about what to include and work on strategies for writing and organizing but there's only so much help I can offer with content, since my expertise is in clarity, commas, and cohesiveness (and APA style, and semicolons and blah blah blah) not arts education. I can point out areas that don't make sense and make sure you follow a theme and prove points... anyways, if you're interested, let me know. Other good places to find editors are the Editorial Freelance Association or ACES The Society for Editing. There are some other associations as well. What's nice about those is that the members are usually at least lightly vetted for editing experience so you know you'll get an experienced member and you can search for experts in certain types of editing, like academic/dissertation editing and some might even have an arts focus.

My boss doesn’t care when I come into lab as long as I’m getting stuff done, but I prefer to get in by 9.

My PI throws me under the bus to my committee and, without offering me any advice or direction, will be the first one to say, ‘I told you so.’",GradSchool,"Hi everyone, I feel so lost. My committee always rips me to shreds. Mostly it’s just one of my committee members, but everyone else silently agrees by not offering counterpoints or helpful suggestions. Worst of all is my PI, who not only agrees with the committee member that is annihilating every last shred of my project without offering possible directions to go, but also goes out of his way to tell me he has felt the same way for months, but wanted to wait until I had a committee meeting for everyone to find out.

I’ve pioneered several technologies in my lab and have acquired a lot of data (nothing really publishable since all of it seems to be negative data [aka a bunch of things don’t have effects]). However, scraping together a publishable unit seems daunting. I don’t want to spend more time here only to publish in a lower tier journal. 

I already have my Masters from when I defended my oral prelim. I don’t have a paper showing the wide range of techniques I have (techniques I was hoping to leverage in finding a career in genetic engineering). However I worry that staying here for 2-2.5 more years will hurt my career prospects.

I feel like I have no feedback. Until it’s too late. I sincerely think I’m not cut out for science or experimental design.

Should I cut my losses and leave with my Masters or is trying for a publication that showcases my technical abilities (even if it’s in a shitty paper In a shitty journal) worth it to get a subpar PhD?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cc64w2/after_5_years_i_feel_no_closer_to_graduation_ive/,118,"Are you required to publish to graduate? If not, stop worrying about it. (It will look better if you can publish, but there's no point in accumulating stress about it unless you are required to do so.)

Do you have enough statistical power in your data to claim negative results? Convincingly demonstrating that something does not work is difficult, but valuable, even if people don't get excited about it.

My program generally advises people to stay a year or two longer if it yields a PhD or an additional publication; the post-doc clock starts immediately, and is limited by universities and major funding institutions in my field to prevent interminable post-docs.

I also have a complicated, messy data set without crystal clear results.

I am struggling with how to build a dissertation out of what I have. I have learned that one's dissertation need not be ""publishable"" although that does make the process easier. It does have to be based on the work of the author (as in, one cannot staple in a 4th author publication, but the contribution to that work can be incorporated).

I was recently able to get my PI's attention and discuss what the chapters of my dissertation might look like, and he provided some useful insights. He indicated that writing up what I have spent my time on is a viable option, even if it is not publishable (or not publishable in a high class journal, or is only publishable in a methodological journal). We are supposed to be learning how to independently conduct research, so the lack of feedback is somewhat expected, but you might find it helpful to speak to others who have graduated, take a thesis workshop, etc.

My department coordinator set up a meeting with me to help me find resources to graduate. Maybe your department can also help you find guidance outside your committee.

An overly ambitious project that I can show is technically feasible will become a technical chapter in my dissertation; I plan to explain how one could actually do the project by modifying some aspects of the design to greatly speed up the data collection process. I spent a lot of time on this, but it just didn't yield a scientific result because the project was poorly designed. Ironically, my PI's attitude towards this project changed from enthusiastic to negative over time, but he still wants me to include it.

Although I get very frustrated and negative about my situation at times, I keep trying to remind myself of positive interpretations. My data was collected under inconsistent circumstances beyond my control, which is less than ideal. However, whatever I do find should be fairly robust due to that inconsistency. Also during this analysis and result-searching process, I continue to learn new and interesting things, which is something I enjoy (despite being annoyed that I would prefer not to conduct science this way). Furthermore, as I am interested in maybe pursuing data science as a career, finding a few useful stories in my data seems like a valuable training exercise, which will make a good story about overcoming adversity and finding value in a mess for later.

One student in my program discovered after 5 years, that all his data was noise due to faulty equipment. He graduated 2 years later after even more research without the noise problems, although his mental health suffered a lot.

As a last resort, you might be able to reform your committee and even switch labs and get a new mentor. After an advisor in my program basically ruined the life of his nearly finished grad student (by abruptly rescinding the position, and therefore the visa, of this student's lover roommate and fellow lab mate), this student was allowed to transfer to another lab and finish. Rebuilding the committee is a fairly nuclear option, but it might be possible (although you mentioned below that this might be problematic -- at my school in this circumstance, the recommendation is to speak to the dean of students, who hopefully is not an old drinking buddy of your PI).

You might also write a draft of a paper and give it to the PI. Publishing more is better, and it is harder to say no to a manuscript than a nebulous plan. Finding famous people who have published things in less-than-stellar journals might also lubricate the process, in case your PI's ego is in the way of a lower tier publication.

A workshop I attended suggested looking up dissertations from prior lab members. This can provide an idea of what the PI considers acceptable for graduation. (If you have never read a dissertation before, it is worth doing. Some of them are surprisingly rough.) We have a ProQuest database of dissertations on our campus. ",2019-07-12 04:28:20

754,8g263m,False,Finance,13,Loan my way through Grad School to avoid work?,GradSchool,"Greetings /r/GradSchool,

I'm going to be entering grad school this fall to attempt to get my Master's in Computer Science, and I had some questions about loans that I can't get a consistent answer on.

Essentially, I want to focus my time and energy on school and really make it count.  I'm going to have to take out loans to pay for tuition and most likely to supplement my cost of living (since I will no longer be able to work full time while going to school).  The question then becomes:  should I just get loans to cover my entire cost of living for the duration I'll be in school (~2 years)?  I (optimistically) plan on having a decent career coming out of school, so significant student loan debt seems worth it, but I'm not sure how others feel about it.

I've talked to friends who have been/are in grad school, and their experiences are varied.  Some have taken out significant loans even during undergrad (I currently have 0 student loans), and some paid out of pocket while working during grad school (albeit, in a program that might not be as intensive as the one I'm going into).

How much is too much?  Or should I plan on working half-time during the semester?

I'll also note that I'm dismissing any possible scholarships or internships for the sake of simplicity and covering my bases.  Essentially I'd like to know that I have everything covered going into school, and anything I can take off the top I will as I go.

Thanks for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8g263m/loan_my_way_through_grad_school_to_avoid_work/,3,"I took out the max loans the first year of my Master's, in an effort to try and avoid working so I could focus on my studies.

1. **Everything is last minute**; the grad school has set a guideline on the structure of the dissertation (e.g. to pass, the student needs to have X chapters completed e.g. from Introduction to Conclusion). After I submitted my dissertation to the SV for review, the SV said *""i need  chapter Y to be split into 3 chapters instead of just a single chapter "".* It was a total nightmare at the time because for the entire semester, the SV never said anything about splitting chapters! I had 1 week to redo everything - I'm also a part time student working full-time : /
2. **Late feedback**: it took 6 months for one of my papers to get any feedback - literally, out of the blue, totally ... out of nowhere, I got an email from the SV asking me to rewrite parts of the paper that was sent 6 months ago - and asking me to send it for publications.
3. **Superficial feedback:** I feel whatever she's highlighting or wanting to correct was based on just ""glancing"" through or ""skimming"" through the document - not really reading them properly.
4. **Students complaining:** one of my peers is also having the same problems with the SV. The other students did not have any of these problems with their SV.

The field/lab portion of the study have relatively low sample sizes as they were completed entirely by myself over the course of 2 months during one summer (through an NSF REU program). Without going into too much detail, the field study was plagued with issues outside of my control and ultimately the data and hence the manuscript feel lackluster and ambiguous. However, besides cleaning up the discussion section and some basic formatting, it’s a completed manuscript.

Now my advisor has suggested we completely remove the field study from the manuscript. It was not intended to be a standalone study and without the field experiment, it loses any context that MIGHT make it meaningful. Not to mention that I’d have to rewrite most of the manuscript if we proceed with the lab study only. The whole thing feels like a garbage fire and the edits I’ve received are minor and almost entirely stylistic. I’m not making real progress and don’t know how to get the guidance I need to make progress and this feels like a huge waste of time. 

My advisor and I only communicate via email due to geographic distance and the longest email I’ve received from him in the past year has been around 5 short sentences. This is by far the worst research I’ve ever done, and it doesn’t feel valuable or publishable, but I nonetheless feel obligated to press forward with it because I’m not the only one involved and my advisor seems to think it’s publishable.

This project will be just the first step towards hopefully many many more. And you're likely to have things go wrong and have to set down ideas and progress again in the future. Many many undergrads don't publish their REU work. The purpose of these sorts of programs is less to produce publishable research and more to give undergrads a taste of what research is like. If your advisor thinks the field study isn't publishable, he's probably right. Which doesn't mean it was a failure. It means you learned a lot and your field research will be better once you start your PhD field work. Maybe you can use the unpublished findings to apply for funding to do it better once you have the time down the line.

I am a graduate student at an evolutionary genetics lab that works with flies. As any live animal we need to take care of the flies so we try to recruit undergrads for general lab maintenance and fly husbandry, in addition to those duties, from the large scale crosses we generate a lot of data with phenotyping under the microscope. They also help with data entry which includes entering all of the phenotyping information in excel. 
Sorry for the long intro but it's important for the context. 
So new volunteer students training is a big deal. There are two grad students who are responsible for training undergrads. 


My question is how should I approach a new student dealing with a conflict? 


Today I approached a student who was late for data entry with the excuse I didn't know it was for me as you didn't adress it by name plus also didn't return her biosafety training even though repeatedly reminded her (which is the only way we can let them in the lab. So it was also a safety issue.). 
I was frustrated and upset with this student so I asked to return those things if she wants to show us that she is willing to work in the lab. The language is apparently very negative because I was fed up. But I let my advisor know by including her in the loop. However, she did handle the situation in a completely different manner than mine which undermines whatever I stated. 

I believe that we should be communicating our issues and I should be able to tell the student if I am not happy with her work. As the graduate student we are dealing with the research in the lab.

I am now aware my attitude is all wrong I am second year graduate student that needs to learn how to approach to these things.

Sit with her and figure out an explicit due date. Don't put the onus on an inexperienced student to figure this out. 

Maybe you were being undermined, I don't know. If she's never had experience in this setting, you've now shown her that any mistakes she makes will get her reprimanded.

677,e8tx08,False,Finance,2,Grad school under reporting costs by $8k+,GradSchool,"I’m in a competitive medical program that requires a certain amount of clinical/immersion hours. The program itself is fairly expensive and many of us are using a combination of traditional loans to pay for the courses and grad plus loans to help supplement our income and pay for living expenses etc as it is nearly impossible to work full time and maintain the grade point average required to stay in the program.  Our financial aid also does not include our summer courses even though the amount of courses over the summer is considered full time by federal guidelines (over 6 credits considered full time and our summer courses average 9-10.) I spoke with financial aid about the summer courses and they had no idea that the traditional loans don’t cover them.

We just had a meeting to discuss the process of signing up for and paying for (!) immersion hours which costs $8,000 and is not covered by financial aid. I think this is unfair and ultimately our school is under reporting the cost of attendance by tens of thousands of dollars per year (including summer course) and doesn’t report this cost for immersion hours. 

This school is in an already expensive state with a high cost of living and state and federal income tax so working part time doesn’t cover all that much in the way of expenses. Lots of hospitals offer something in the way do education costs but it is not competitive and many offer less than $2k per year (less if you’re full time.)

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is.  The vast majority of us in the program are taking out loans but they basically don’t cover the cost of tuition because the school isn’t reporting accurately.

Regarding summer, you CAN take Stafford loans (if you're not already at your annual maximum) and gradPLUS for summer semesters, your school just needs to certify your enrollment for the summer and make the request. If someone in your finaid office tells you that isn't possible, talk to someone else until you find someone that knows how to do this. But it CAN be done.

A lot of financial aid offices are a combination of some very junior people who only recently started working there and a few very senior people who know all the ins and outs. You need to find and talk to one of the more senior people so they can tell you how to do all the things a more junior person might try to tell you aren't possible. ",2019-12-10 17:46:00

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director of aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

&#x200B;

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would be a precursor to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm

&#x200B;

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals & going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'

historical note for myself: 'were you asking a clarifying question in order to gain understanding?'",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gzddli/longterm_relationships_within_and_after_grad/,0,"Two processes I would say trump creative problem-solving are learning to love actively and perseverance.

Learning to love actively keeps both people in a relationship able to constantly support one another, which improves quality of life both for each individual as well as the couple as a whole. Active love could be creative but is often made up of mundane things that matter little to oneself but a lot to one's partner.

Perseverance despite difficulty allows the relationship to be longterm. Without it, there is no hope of a future. And, the longer it is practiced, the more equinamity and perspective a person develops because they begin to see the large bumps in the metaphorical road as small bumps over a long course. The more difficulties a couple passes through together, the more confident they become that they will be able to surmount other challenges in the future.

Creative problem-solving is useful but I don't see it as the most important quality to come out of a relationship. Rather I would say it is more a sense of agape, of old, familiar, altruistic, and well-humored love. ",2020-06-09 01:48:02

221,gljikk,False,Professional,4,What are my options when I graduate?,GradSchool,"Hi everyone! I am in a masters program right now in electrical engineering studying neural engineering. I am trying to decide whether I should stick with this or BME when I graduate, switch to something with clinical options like clinical psych or an MD/PhD, or switch to a completely different field. Like many of you, I would love a job as faculty, even in a community college just to teach, but the chances of that are slim. I’ve had multiple internships in electrical engineering positions in industry and hated all of them. While it’s possible it was because the work was boring for someone with just a bachelor’s degree, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to work in industry. That being said, if I get my PhD in neural engineering, are my options really academia (unlikely) or industry? Are there any other options for someone with a PhD in this field? Are there any other related fields I could switch to that would give me more options, especially either in teaching or some type of human interaction (hence the clinical work idea)? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, but there isn’t really a neural engineering sub so I wasn’t sure where to ask this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gljikk/what_are_my_options_when_i_graduate/,0,"I'm a recently graduate EE PhD with focus in neural engineering and now have a TT faculty position. Do **not** go into BME unless you want to become a medical device salesman. Find an EE lab with an emphasis on applications rather than theory. Try and get into a top 10 school. Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Penn all have outstanding relevant programs. If you're not that competitive, aim for a school that's made a mark on the field. University of Utah, for example, developed the Utah Electrode Array, the only penetrating microelectrode array approved for human clinical trials, is the origin of the original neural amplifier, and is home to 2  prominent neural companies (Blackrock and Ripple). UT Dallas is also in a good situation for a lower ranked University with Abbott neuromodulation being local.

If you get the above, your dreams of academia are possible. The competition for TT faculty is lower for EE than probably any other field. This is because EE PhDs make so much money in industry, why would you accept *half* as much to teach? It's insane (I am TT EE faculty, btw). In fact, many EE faculty don't even do postdocs, which are required for virtually every other academic field.

The next step is to tailor your PhD to the job you want. Teaching oriented colleges want to see industry experience, so get internships in the summer. They also require that you have teaching experience and would prefer if you had experience training undergrads in research and projects, so try and become a senior project advisor during your PhD or mentor undergrads in your research lab. See if your institution has any ""teaching higher Ed"" courses or similar. Mine had an emphasis for phds seeking TT jobs.

Make sure you talk to faculty at other institutions. Connections will be king. I applied to over 20 positions, got interviews from all 3 where I or my advisor new someone, and only 2 of 20 where I didn't. Applying to faculty positions is hard. It took me more than 8 hours per application. Wasting time on applying to places you don't know people, and thus have a low chance, is painful (but necessary). 

If  you don't land an academic job, there are government jobs. Federal jobs are incredibly annoying to apply to, but there are some really cool positions. It is best if you can find a mentor to help you figure out how to apply to the fed jobs, because they are weirdly particular. 

There are also the national labs. National labs fall somewhere between industry and academia. Berkeley national lab is particularly interesting and it specifically has no classified research and had a neuroscience division. Engineers there will usually work as solution innovators for various other departments. I spent 2 years at one and worked with neuroscientists, physicists, biochemists, and others.

A bit after the deadline, NEU accepted me to their MS in Robotics program, but it was too late. Further, the total cost of NEU (tuition + housing) was looking like it would be about $20k more than WPI - a bit too steep for me to consider doubling back.

But then today NEU sent me a letter saying I was awarded a substantial scholarship. Now its looking like the total cost of NEU is going to be a $5-10k less than WPI, depending on housing expenses.

Some questions:

Is doubling back on accepting an offer bad? Am I massively burning bridges or raising red flags or anything here?

In my own financial interest, is it possible to use this offer from NEU to ""haggle"" with WPI, especially since there's like a $25k difference in tuition? Or is that idea just as fucking stupid as it sounds?

* Since I'm going for MS in order to transition from one professional field to another (from radar EE to computer vision CS), I'm not sure how much weight I should put into evaluations of professors and labs and research and such

* Also since I already have a few years of professional experience, I already have a life in Boston. I wouldn't mind Worcester, really, but most of my friends are in Boston, I've become used to living here, and I think I would be a little sad to leave knowing I had the option to stay.

* NEU's Co-Op program + summer internships also could provide financial income to cover even more of the cost that I'm not sure I could cover while at WPI.

I went to WPI for my undergrad so I have some mixed feedback I can offer. I also studied biomedical engineering so I’m not as familiar with the robotics program, although I know it is highly regarded both internally and externally. With regard to the curriculum at WPI I can say they absolutely do a great job of teaching you real and applicable skills that will make you stand out from graduates at other schools when you rejoin the work force. After WPI I went to brown for my ms and I had far more practical lab skills than some of my peers from other schools. 

At the same time, the graduate program is simply not a priority at WPI. All of the aspects that sets them apart are focused on the undergrad experience. I also know they are going through a bit of turmoil right now with their president and the treatment of professors with many having already quit and others searching for jobs because the school is in massive debt to fund its seemingly annual expansion projects. 

That being said, the name also carries clout in the field of robotics (I believe they were the first school in the country to offer a robotics program) and especially in New England. They also have a strong alumni network in the area and in my experience higher ups in companies from WPI love to hire WPI graduates. Although the same can probably be said for NEU. 

I hope this was helpful and didn’t add even more to you confusion! In terms of going back on your acceptance, don’t worry about it. You have to do what’s best for you. You’ll lose your deposit but if you think you’ll be happier in Boston with your network of friends then I’d say it’s worth it.

* If you have multiple, high-priority deadlines that overlap, how do you handle them?
* What's a project you've worked on that has had problems, and how did you solve them?
* When have you felt pressure to complete a difficult task, and how did you handle it?
* Describe a time you explained a complex analysis to an audience who was unfamiliar with the methodology. What did you explain, and how did you do it so they could understand?

Other than the last question, I think these are pretty general and could apply to most positions at most organizations.

166,emapp1,False,Academics,10,Should I take 4 math classes at the same time?,GradSchool,"TL;DR - I am a ""registered"" masters student in math, but I take undergrad math classes since my bachelors was in bio. In my bio bachelors, I took multivariable (including Stoke's theorem) and one class that combined intro to linear and intro to diffQ class. I took a gap year between undergrad and grad school, so I forgot most of math.

In my math masters, should I take real analysis, intro to proof, vector analysis (intro to linear algebra + stoke's theorem), and linear algebra (intro to some advance concepts) at the same time? 

Apologize for the long read in advance. I appreciate and welcome all constructive feedback. Thank you for your time.

========================================================================

My undergrad bachelors included classes A100 and A200. Not actual course numbers, but I modified for simplicity stake. **I took both A100 and A200 at the same time.** 

A100 - Multivariable Calculus that include Vectors, Partial derivatives, Lagrange multipliers,  Double and triple integrals, Spherical and cylindrical coordinates, Surface and line integrals. Divergence, gradient, and curl. Stokes Theorem and it's derivation to Green, Divergence, Fundamental Theorem, and General Stokes. 

For the midterms- I got a 

1. midterm 1 (vectors, PDE, lagrange) I got a 82,
2. midterm 2 (double, triple integrals, spherical, cylindrical, surface and line integrals) I got a 65 lol. Double and triple integrals are my weakness. This midterm was dropped.
3. midterm 3 (divergence, gradient, curl), I got a 85. 
4. On final (Divergence, gradient, curl, stokes theorem) I got an 88.

I forgot most of my calc 3 vector analysis knowledge. I got a B in the class though. 

A200 - A combined linear algebra and DiffQ class -  introduction to ODEs and linear algebra, Gaussian elimination, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvectors, eigenvalues and the diagonalization of matrices

1. Midterm 1 (ODEs - separable, non homogenous, homogenous, etc) I got a 91
2. Midterm 2 (Linear Algebra part - Gaussian elimination, RREF, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvalues). I got a 78 lol. I knew the concepts but damn the linear algebra symbols were tricky AF. This midterm was dropped.
3. Midterm 3 (Diagonalization of matrices, using linear algebra to solve ODEs, 2nd order) I got a 92.
4. Final (Combining everything with an emphasis on the midterm 3. Also more linear algebra symbols). I got a 87. 

I got an A- in A200. Class was curved and average was like a 85. I got an 88.5 in the class as a whole and got an A-.

&#x200B;

**This was my undergrad math classes. I took these 2 classes at the same time. My undergrad bachelors math was harder than my current undergrad classes (B100 - B5000) classes in terms of depth, homework, and problem solving.** 

===================================================================

Now the undergrad classes that I'm taking for my masters. 

B100 - Multivariable calculus  - Vectors, infinite series, Taylor's theorem,  partial derivatives, multiple integrals. I took this class and I got an A. 

***This multivariable class was so much easier than my bachelors A100 class. There was no vector analysis and stoke's theorem. Just basic vectors and infinite series and multiple integrals. I still suck at multiple integrals though.***

Now should I take 4 math classes at the same time?

1. B200 - Matrices,  determinants, general vector spaces, basis and dimension, eigenvalue problems, first order ODE linear equations, vector field theory, theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. **B200 looks like a combined A100 and A200 class. So my 2 undergrad math classes combined to one**.
2. B300 Intro to proofs -  Basic proofs in set theory, logic, mathematical induction, relations, orders, functions, Cantor's theory of countability, and real number system 
3. B400 Real Analysis  Sequences, properties of continuous functions, derivatives and differentials, functions defined by series, integrability and integrals, convergence of function sequences. 
4. B500 Linear Algebra -  Vector spaces, basis and dimension, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, solution of systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, Jordan form, and image processing 

&#x200B;

Should I take all these 4 undergrad classes at the same time? 

Some things to consider:

1. My undergrad cumulative gpa was a 3.23. I went to an engineering school to study bio lol. The math was so much harder and more applied with some sprinkles of proof and theoretical. 
2. My quant GRE was bad too. I didn't study and got a 159 or 79%. I am still surprised I got into a math masters program lol. 
3. My advisor told me that I don't need intro to proof before taking real analysis. He wants me to take real analysis so I can be better prepared for grad level math which I'm going to take in the Fall of 2020. 
4. Time management wise.
   1.  intro to proof only meets Mondays and Wednesday. 
   2. Real Analysis meets Tuesdays and Thursday
   3. Linear Algebra meets Tuesday and Thursday after 2 hours after Real Analysis is done.
   4. Vector Analysis with some linear algebra meets Mondays and Wednesdays after 2 hours when intro to proof is done.

I don't have any other time commitments. It also takes me 1 hour to commute to school. I still have some struggles with multiple integrals and changes of basis. 

&#x200B;

Do you think it's worth it? Given the fact that I took some DiffQ, Linear, and Stokes theorem class (but I forgot it in my gap year), can I take 4 undergrad math classes at the same time? Should I drop intro to proofs?

I outlined the Results based on Chapter 3's findings. Decided to use the method of ""Causal Mechanism"" through qualitative research method to find if factors are significant or insignificant. What I have done so far in Chapter 4 is to outline the articles i found supporting IV1-4; outline the articles found disputing IV1-4; and justify based on that if it is significant or insignificant to the DV.

In 25 years of time, the entirety of the US university system has produced two results in plant biotech.  That's it, two results in a quarter century, and one won't even be on the market for a few years.  I tried to work with so many people to do something about that, I could have done more, but there was a grand total of zero interested in doing their damned job.  They're either incompetent, or paid off corporate shills, and po-tay-to po-tah-to at this point.  And God forbid you talk about anything that isn't a corn/soy monoculture.  Eventually, I dropped out of my PhD program because, first off, that particular place was a mess (they sent me to a ill equipped research station in the middle of nowhere that never should've been built, which was a little detail they neglected to mention when I accepted), and second, the whole field is a disaster.

Science is about making the world a better place for humanity, and in case you haven't noticed there's an impending climate crisis that's going to demand an increased focus on sustainability, but all they're interested in is sitting on their hands and taking about how much they love their corporate handlers.  What a waste of two degrees and too many years, I should have gone into medical biotech from the start, at least that has a future.  No wonder there's an anti-GMO movement, they might be science denialists but they're fully justified in their suspicions, and I am very close to going to Twitter and letting them know exactly how I feel, and since those quacks are always looking for vindication from people with degrees that would be very bridge burn-y but it isn't like I have anything else going for me.

(weird situation),GradSchool,"Given my circumstances, I'm not sure how long I can technically say I was working as a research assistant while a PhD student or even if I was a ""research assistant"" and not something else. Forgive any extraneous details that follow. It's just easier to lay it all out.

So, basically, there were two channels of funding, but for the same project. My department was funding me on a research assistantship which I used to conduct field work abroad--this wasn't just dissertation work, it also could be characterized as consultancy work, which is why it's on my resume. That assistantship had a clear start date and cut-off date, with regular paychecks. However, my adviser also got funding for the same project and had written me into that grant, but that funding came later and as a lump-sum. So during the middle of my field work I was able to get a one-time payment of $10,000. I considered part of that to be reimbursement for research-related out-of-pocket expenses (though there was no paperwork involved) and part of it was just general compensation for the work I did and was still to do. I have no idea what my ""rate"" was in the grant proposal so I have no idea how long that $10,000 was supposed to last me, but it wasn't until a year and a half later, and a whole year after my assistantship ended, that I finally was able to wrap up my end of the project and produce a deliverable. I had not been working as dilligently on it as I could have been. But even so, my adviser was so happy with my work that at the very end he decided to pay me an extra $4,000 still remaining out of the project funds. 

So what I'm confused about is how I'm supposed to report the length of time that I worked on this project when I really worked on it off and on and had really irregular payments. The length of time I was on a research assitantship (12 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I also got separate funding for the same job. The length of time from start to finish (29 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I worked on it off and on during that time. Should I perhaps figure out a daily rate for myself, then work backwards from the $14,000 I received from my adviser to estimate duration from that, then add it consecutively to the research assistantship? But what about resumes that don't require me to report salary? Is the 29-month logic legit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gax551/how_do_i_report_the_duration_of_my_research/,2,Payment and funding source don’t matter.

I passed and got a job that I’ve been at since October. During this time, my committee/co-authors and I have been working on my manuscript via email. During my time as a grad student I never had any issues with my committee members or any of their edits except for one. One member refused to help most of the time, because he saw it as doing it for me. I get where he was coming from so I just taught myself instead of going to him with any questions. And before you ask, no I could not have replaced him on the committee unfortunately.

Now, out of the blue, he’s asked me for all of my data, and all of my Rstudio code under the pretense that he wanted it for another student who is working on a similar project. So I sent him most everything. However, I had a feeling he really just wanted to rerun all stats and analyses. Turns out my suspicions were correct when my advisor told me that my committee member had rerun everything without including me in this discussion. I am lead author on this manuscript, and I don’t appreciate that 1) he lied and 2) he didn’t even discuss with me that he wanted to rerun the analyses. He’s now emailing me for the original files and a key to match up the files to their designated number. Basically he’s not trusting me to have even done the most simple thing in matching up a key.

I’m unsure how to go about this. I don’t want to burn any bridges here, but at the same time I don’t appreciate that I’m being excluded from any and all discussions about this. This is my first lead author paper and I feel like I’m not learning how to go about being a lead author (isn’t that the whole point of being in school? To learn?!). This committee member also has a tendency to do everything for you in the classes he teaches (he’d always just write the r code for you in his informatics class) which is ironic since he refused to help me.

se vuoi fare il dottorato in USA ti consiglio caldamente di fare anche la magistrale in italia, per 2 motivi:

- i colleghi americani fanno 4 anni di undergrad mentre noi solo 3 anni, e la maggior parte dei programmi richiedono 4 anni di studi universitari

- devi avere esperienza nella ricerca: noi purtroppo facciamo solo la tesi, che dura 1-3 mesi per la triennale, mentre i colleghi americani cominciano fin da subito a fare ricerca (i cosiddetti REU) e una volta laureati hanno già 4 anni di esperienza; facendo la magistrale guadagni altri 6-9 mesi di ricerca per la tesi magistrale (meglio ancora se riesci a pubblicarla)

una volta che hai queste cose in saccoccia puoi cominciare a cercare le università che ti interessano, vai nei siti dei vari dipartimenti di fisica e vedi se ci sono prof che fanno ricerca che ti piace... ogni università ha il suo sistema di application ma le cose comuni a tutti sono:

- TOEFL in quanto straniero

- transcript della tua carriera universitaria (un documento in cui ci sono i voti in tutte le materie e i tuoi titoli, tradotto in inglese)

- almeno 3 lettere di raccomandazione, scritte da tuoi professori/relatori/tutor ecc, ovvero gente che può testimoniare le tue capacità di studio, ricerca e insegnamento

- statement of purpose (la famosa ""lettera di presentazione"") in cui dici chi sei, che esperienza hai, perchè hai scelto quell'università ecc ecc

- la succitata research experience: oltre ai periodi di tesi, cerca di fare tirocini/volontariato in laboratori quanto più possibile

- alcune università ti chiedono il GRE, un test standardizzato del cazzo che costa un fottio, io personalmente non l'ho fatto, se puoi trova anche tu posti che non lo chiedono

considera che il metodo di selezione è molto diverso da quello italiano, non c'è un punteggio che ti viene assegnato, ma è piu un sistema ""olistico"", come dicono loro, guardano all'insieme: per esempio se hai voti bassi ma piu esperienza, sei avvantaggiato rispetto al secchione che ha la media altissima ma non è mai entrato in un laboratorio... diciamo che loro vanno più a ""fit"", devi saperti vendere

per quanto riguarda i fondi, solitamente il primo anno sei pagato dall'università per fare il teaching assistant, ovvero insegni un laboratorio o un corso a studenti piu piccoli, dal secondo anno in poi invece sei pagato dal gruppo di ricerca che scegli, il che ha i suoi pro (non c'e un contratto nazionale del cazzo come in italia, se meriti di piu ti danno piu: se il tuo tutor vince tanti fondi, ti aumento lo stipendio) ma anche contro (se il tuo tutor perde i fondi resti anche tu con le pezze ar culo)

e poi boh, se ti servono altre informazioni puoi contattarmi in privato

edit: dimenticavo, in USA a differenza dell'italia devi anche seguire lezioni, al primo anno, che di solito sono ripetizione di quelle che farai alla magistrale ",2019-03-04 18:47:58

I’ve been there, and could barely bring myself to begin writing my PhD research proposal at all my first semester.  It’s mentally draining when you know you should be writing, but you keep stalling anyway.  

A while back I saw a post where a PhD student kept a word log of his dissertation writing progress and made a histogram/line chart with it. I thought it was a cool idea so I decided to do the same just for fun. I can’t post pictures to this thread but I’ll provide a link to my example.

However, what I have discovered is that this running word count has provided a tangible source of motivation and inspiration. Every day you write, even if you only add a single sentence to your manuscript, the line goes up.  It allows me to keep track of highly productive days, see that I’m capable of writing significant chunks at a time, and helps me stay on track with daily writing goals. 

This is just something that has been useful for me personally. Everyone works differently and are motivated by different things. But, in the sea of stress that is grad school, I just wanted to offer a small tip about something that has helped me, and hopefully a couple of you may benefit from it as well.

How to get over the regret,GradSchool,"I decided to go to a top ranked program for a 1 year masters and didn’t think through better financial options-it was quite a bit, but at the time I felt tuition was worth it for the name and opportunities. And was it? I made incredible friends, took interesting classes, was exposed to interesting research and felt I was in a very stimulating environment and finally felt like I figured out what I really want to do with my career. 

However, now that I’m working I’m depressed and wondering if I made the wrong choice. My first job, I’m making less than the cost of the degree and worked a terrible job. In my second luckily I’ll be making >$20K the cost and hoping to continue working my way up. But I am quite stressed out and wondering if I made a good decision in hindsight. If I researched a bit more and picked a different program, maybe I wouldn’t have had to pay as much or even at all and might have still done this.

At best, regret helps you avoid similar mistakes. Maybe the program you chose wasn't a good idea in hindsight. You made a decision with the information you had, and maybe there were things you failed to consider. You're more mindful now about large financial decisions, maybe. So point taken, now what? So what does agonizing get you? You can't take it back. 

Just accept the past. I know it's easier said than done, but maybe you just need to let go. Savor the positives (your friends, experiences, etc), and think of the future. You can't change it, you've learned from it, and so the regret has served its purpose and is now overstaying its welcome. ",2019-03-27 03:38:28

723,apytjj,False,Finance,5,Things I learned while refinancing my student loans,GradSchool,"At r/GradSchool most of us have student loans of some sort, so I wanted to share some things I learned from refinancing my student loans that no one seems to talk about. I hope to save you some frustration and a lot of money! At worst, at least you'll have something to benchmark.

Some background - I powered through 3 business degrees and got a good paying job, but I now my \~10 loans are near repayment. 

Credit score ranging from 710-765.  I have 140k all with federal set rates ranging from 3.4-6.8%. Refinancing was definitely a good idea. I ultimately ended up refinancing most of my loans through a combination of SOFI and ELFI (through credible)... see below the underwriter is still MOHELA for both.

1. There's a lot of options in appearance, but in practice there's only a few loan servicers.  MOHELA and Navient (Sallie Mae) are big ones. Most of the websites like SOFI, Credible, ELFI, are just intermediaries, they are *NOT* the underwriter. They do not make the decisions and your loans are still going to be handled by one of the big companies!
2. Companies like SOFI and ELFI are going to have very different terms. Their customer service is mostly BS.  For example, SOFI calls themselves a conservative lender but then has very aggressive payoff schemes where you have to payoff your loans in 5 or 7 years to get the best rates. 
3. The customer service of these intermediaries is worthless, despite how friendly they may be.
4. At the end of the day your income, your credit score, and your overall ability to repay affects your rates... these companies will not share their formulas with you.  *It is in YOUR best interest to spend time playing with the numbers.*  After I verified income, my rate went down and I was thrilled, so I asked for a larger loan (specified another loan), and despite multiple reps assuring me that my rate would not change. Guess what?! It did and it probably will for you. SOFI then tried to get push my application through and attested they had no recollection of a lower rate.  Call them back/modify your application. I removed the other loan and my rate went back down.  Even a 0.25% at 15k is about $40/year, and this stuff can really compound.
5. Your credit score will take some big hits for the process. Two companies, two hard hit and I lost about 40 points. This is the scummy part of how credit works.
6. You might want to consider multiple companies. Aggressive and conservative. I did 25k at a 4.7% rate for 5 years and about 60k at 5.4% for 15 years. This gave me a good mix.  Overall, I will save \~$800 in interest my first year alone. 
7. For academics, these servicers are clueless.  When they verify your income, they use monthly... meaning that if you're paid over 9 months... *cha-ching* for you. They will multiply one month by 12. 

I am not recommending any particular company and only outlining my experience with information I wish I knew beforehand.  This was an incredibly frustrating process but worth it with the savings in the end.  Hopefully, my info/story will help you.

228,fejt9d,False,Professional,6,When does it make sense to start over post-PhD?,GradSchool,"Venting time. In my late 30s, graduated with a masters 9 years ago and a PhD just over a year ago--both related to park-management in a developing country context--have done absolutely nothing since. Have no professional experience or skills that are sought after in the general job market and jobs in my area of expertise are extremely rare (have sent 6 jobs applications in the past year). Only have one publication to date and no history of independently obtaining research funds so post-doc opportunities aren't happening either. 

Right around the time I graduated I thought my prospects were looking up. A government agency in one of the countries I did my research in wanted to hire me to do a project and had me outline a contract for it. Also, my adviser and I also worked on a proposal for a separate project that would give me a job for the next 2 years and serve as a platform for a lot more research. 

Long story short, the government agency gets back to me months later, not with a completed contract, but to inform me that they since realized they can't hire me directly and have to put the project out for tender (which I can't bid on myself since I'm a foreigner). So the contract I wrote, which is based entirely on my dissertation, ends up going to a consulting firm that's only interested the occasional skype call with me as a courtesy. Then I just find out today that the major proposal my adviser and I worked on was rejected because my adviser didn't fill out a certain form completely.  

I have spent the better part of the last year thinking at least one of these opportunities would materialize. I am now in the most desperate position I have ever been in my life and I'm not young anymore. I can't imagine being in a more humiliating position than I'm already in, so what I'm wondering is whether I need to start over and pursue another masters degree? Perhaps in something more marketable? I had no idea what a dead end a PhD would be if you weren't successful enough at it. For all my adult life I thought I was working towards a certain career path but since graduating it feels like my life is over. 

I guess just so this post isn't a pure rant, would I at least have some post-doc prospects if I could get 1 or 2 more publications out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/fejt9d/when_does_it_make_sense_to_start_over_postphd/,13,Seriously a) 6 job applications is nothing you should be doing like 30 a week b) a postdoc may or may not help you if you want an industrial job because only about half of employers count that experience and many don't care about the number of papers you have. Look I know looking for a job is soul crushing and getting rejected from a position you know you are qualified for and you are very interested in sucks but 100% this is a numbers game when it comes to applications. I will also say as far as a postdoc is concerned if you have a chance to do one to learn some new you could argue it was worth it but if you are looking to just publish more it is a gamble. The thing is you could be the Stephen Hawking of your field and if you get assigned a shit project publish literally nothing in which case you probably were better off not doing it. ,2020-03-06 20:39:57

Disclaimer: I have little knowledge on graduate degrees. Just starting to research. 

Background: 

* 24 M 
* Working in Occupational Safety 
* Washington D.C. Metro area
* Graduated with a B.S. in Occupational Safety (3.88 GPA) from smaller D2 school in Pennsylvania 
* Never been the best student but I really buckled down in college and found a love for education and worked hard for a good GPA. I credit making it this far in life from common sense and street smarts!
* Part time officer in the Air Force
* Salary: 100K
   * Project Salary: 125K by age 26 (step 1 promotion)
   * 160K by 30 (step 2 promotion)
   * Both salary projections are with no graduate degree 
* Employer: Electrical Power/ Transportation Contractor 
   * 1000ish employees 
   * 500 million per year revenue 
   * Does not offer continuing education benefits 

&#x200B;

Goals: 

I’ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company. 

We don’t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me. 

I’m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Master’s of Science.  

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position. 

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket I’m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation. 

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity? 

I don’t even understand the rankings. 

It’s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years. 

I’ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so it’ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Does any specific programs jump out?

I understand most MBA’s have a specific focus right?

Do all programs require the GMAT or GRE?

Anything else I’m missing?

So a bit of background: my relationship with my advisor sucks. He convinced me to switch projects from one with a working code to one with a broken code without telling me the code was broken. So, instead of generating results and trying to develop a new method, I tried to debug thousands of lines of C++ CFD code, unsuccessfully, for about 7 months.

After failing to fix his code, he informed me in my third semester that he was hesitant to keep funding me, and that I would need to improve my work ethic. I think the debugging with no results had burned me out completely at this point.

Finally, I propose a new approach to fixing his code that he still doesn't particularly like, and yet it answered some important questions on how to move forward. 

He informs me that he cannot fund me past two years. Okay, fine. I'll try to defend before that.

He informs me halfway through the Spring semester that I should defend in May. Great! Hopefully I can get it done in time; if not, I'll have to pay my own tuition to defend.

Well, the deadline comes up and he tells me a ""sensible"" draft of my thesis should be fine. We meet remotely for the defense, and I fail.

So I've been out of undergrad for about three years, and I have wanted to go to graduate school for a long time but I've been reluctant to leave my job and its steady income.

Today things really started hitting the fan at work and I had to be like, yeah, okay, I have to get outta dodge ASAP. I plan to quit at the end of June, or maybe a couple of months earlier if things continue to be horribly mismanaged.
