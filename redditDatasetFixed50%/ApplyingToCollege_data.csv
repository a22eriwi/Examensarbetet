782,fpknny,False,Essays,52,The absolute stupidest essay that got my friend into Carnegie Mellon,ApplyingToCollege,"Proof that going full tweak gets u into genius schools

Prompt:
Consider your application as a whole. What do you personally want to emphasize about your application for the admission committee's consideration? Highlight something that's important to you or something you haven't had a chance to
share. Tell us, don't show us (no websites please).

Response:
One thing I would like to emphasize that is extremely important to me is my intense disdain for everything Andrew Carnegie stood for. As a person who believes that the American Dream should be accessible to everyone who is willing to work for it, Carnegie's actions in the American steel industry could never be justified in my eyes. 

Andrew Carnegie was the son of a humble immigrant steelworker. Never would any respectable person ever expect him to be the monster he inevitably became. ""Robber baron"" does not begin to describe the total absence of decency in any corner of his empty criminal soul. He mercilessly monopolized American steel and destroyed the lives of the American middle-class. 

I strongly believe in the idea that businesses should not be able to monopolize an industry as it gives them too much control over the lives of the people who require the resources it produces. As such l can only condemn Andrew Canegie as a man, despite his contributions to social welfare through his building of libraries and schools. While his legacy may be greater
than just his worst qualities, his despicable actions and crimes against the common American
man were too much to forgive. His workers were underpaid and worked in horrible conditions.
His brutal exploitation of his workforce was all to only contribute to building the monstrous steel
throne that Carnegie attempted to build for himself.

Regardless of my undying loathing for Andrew Carnegie, I do not wish to live at odds
with any person, living or dead. I would hope that by attending the university Carnegie founded
over 100 years ago I can reconcile my differences with the Ghost of Andrew Carnegie, and I
could once again be at peace with the word.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fpknny/the_absolute_stupidest_essay_that_got_my_friend/,1060,But Carnegie was a philanthropist who donated millions to fund libraries and schools. He wrote the Gospel of Wealth to encourage rich  Americans to uplift the poor. ,2020-03-26 22:01:10

604,g8i1rs,False,,446,Unfortunate truth for people making final college decisions: School prestige does matter quite a bit for finance.,ApplyingToCollege,"I ended up browsing this a sub a lot this year to get back to speed on the college application process to help my sibling. Fortunately, people know that school prestige isn’t everything, but there is some misinformation regarding it for finance. 



School prestige DOES matter a lot for finance. This is due to the fact that you are in a client-facing role and you’d rather have an analyst from Wharton or Stanford representing you over someone from Penn State, all things being equal. While there are plenty that break in outside of the “target” schools, outside of students from UVA, Mich, Berkeley, Kelley, etc. You don’t see much from schools like Iowa or PSU.



This is somewhat of a cycle, as alums from targets prefer students from their school, but it’s not impossible to break in. That being said, if you’re looking for the easiest route into Wall Street, I’d consider taking on more debt to go to a “better” perceived school.



Edit: didn’t even get to mention top management consulting firms. If you’re shooting for MBB, if you don’t go to a target AND have a near perfect GPA and resume, you have almost no shot. Even I couldn’t get an offer there back when I was in undergrad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g8i1rs/unfortunate_truth_for_people_making_final_college/,1240,I doubt that your undergrads matter that much to them.

Like you have interests and ambitions, you have good grades, but at the same time you’re not special at all. There’s nothing that makes you stand out from any other ordinary applicant. It’s like you can’t see why any college would ever want to accept you.

479,gjv9um,False,Rant,87,Prestige changes people...,ApplyingToCollege,"Long story short, I was accepted to a top university. It’s the first time this has happened in my area so everyone was pretty impressed. 

However, going through high school I was never really liked by most of my teachers. I worked hard but they didn’t like me due to my family connections. Both my mom and sister went to the same high school I did, and they both had mental disabilities that made them difficult for the school to deal with. This meant that they were a hassle to teach, and therefore not liked by the faculty. This ended up also applying to me as I went through high school. Even if I did well, I didn’t have the right last name and often got kicked to the side. 

Now that I’ve been accepted into a nice school, everybody likes me now. My old teachers who unfairly graded me and refused to recommend me or nominate me for school positions are now friending me on facebook, making posts about how they’re so proud of me and that they are honored to have taught me, and sending me personal messages of how they are glad they helped me in my journey. They’re talking to my mom, who they once treated so poorly, about how proud they are of her and me both. She knows it’s all lies and attempts to take credit for me. 

These teachers did the bare minimum to help me, and now it pisses me off that they’re trying to take credit for the success I’ve had that they tried so hard to keep me from. I hate all of it. I was always teased at my school by the principals and guidance counselor for applying to big schools. They would always mock me or say I was wasting my money. And now that I’ve actually done something, they’re so excited to post me on facebook and brag about me on senior day. 

Sure, I’m happy that I’ve gotten this far, but I hate that everyone is trying to take credit for my own doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gjv9um/prestige_changes_people/,1433,Haha I felt the same you do until I got accepted to some prestigious schools.

Hello everyone! It's here at last, the RD/ED II megathread. Spring is in the air, and with it, the hint of college decisions. 


If you want an official megathread for a particular college, send me a PM or comment below with the college's name and, if you have it, the exact date and time of the decisions release. Please give me ample time (~1-4 days before the decision date) to create your megathread, otherwise, the results might come out before I am able to fulfill the request.

College acceptance megathreads will be listed below, as well as expected release dates and times for those not yet released. If you have any information about release dates, please send me a PM/leave a comment with that information so it can be included in this thread.

DO NOT create a new thread about your acceptances or an unofficial school megathread. Such threads will be removed on sight.
We're excited to celebrate your achievements with you!

644,gsxou5,False,Serious,204,Asian male in CS? Ivies are overrated,ApplyingToCollege,"Hellooooo people!

So if you're a rising or graduating Senior, this post will either be helpful or veryyy relatable, so please do read carefully

I'm going to argue that attending your state school or a top public university is better than attending an elite ivy league university if you wish to study computer science, and become a traditional software engineer or technical product manager at google, facebook, amazon, apple, microsoft, etc. you get the idea

First off, cost. I get that your parents come from an upper-middle class background and can pay for that, but don't underestimate just how much undergrad costs. For most students who cant get fin aid, it costs around 75k*4 = 300k for an undergrad education.

State schools on the other hand, especially if in-state, might cost around 30k, and can be done in 3 years with AP Credits. So, we're looking at 90k.

You've just saved 210k

Now, you're probably wondering ""but, hey! ivies have prestige and lead to a better life and have more opportunities""

You're right in some ways, but if you're a CS person, you seriously couldn't be more wrong.

Employers in the tech industry go to many of the top public universities, and heavily heavily recruit. I'm talking the public universities some ppl on this subreddit love, like UVA, michigan, berkeley, georgia tech, etc. but I'm ALSO (and this is the imp part) talking ab random universities you've never heard of, like North Carolina Agricultural and Technical Universities. You know those universities with 70% acceptance rates? or 50%? or 60%? Guess what! Google recruits there. (look at pitt, google has an office literally in pittsburgh, and they just pick up the top cs majors at pitt; it's not all cmu)

The point is, you don't need to go to some super prestigious school and pay a shitton of money and get depressed that you got rejected by a lot of other elite universities.

Save yourself the trouble for once in your life. Be HAPPY going to Berkeley or Michigan or your local state university. Don't cry over getting waitlisted at Cornell or Penn or rejected by Harvard and Columbia. If you're at the top of your public university, you can literally get any top CS job you would like.

In hindsight, I wish I recognized this. I personally was accepted by all 5 of the top 5 PUBLIC universities on US News, but at the same time, rejected by several ivies. For a while, I didn't appreciate getting into Berkeley, Michigan, Georgia Tech, etc. to study CS because I was so caught up with the elitism and prestige of Penn or Duke. Don't make the same mistake I did. Be happy and be proud. You got this.




P.S. Keep in mind, as much as some ppl want to deny it, every ivy league university does heavily consider race in building their class. As an asian male applying for cs, you're in the most overrepresented highly qualified demographic there is. Elite universities like duke or penn are looking to build a diverse class, so naturally they can't pick all the numerous highly qualified cs ppl. However, big state schools, like gtech and berkeley, don't care about your race. They look for raw, untamed MERIT: your POTENTIAL to succeed. As much as I hate the budget cuts and huge ass classes at these big public universities, that trait to be race-blind is exactly what I think will make them far stronger over the next decade.


P.P.S There are a *few* exceptions to this, but the colleges that fit into the exception are not ivies. Only three: MIT, Stanford, and CMU SCS. These three do have a some unique CS opportunities (especially if you're going for quant or fintech) that might not be readily available elsewhere. However, a great bulk of the CS graduates from even these institutions work the same software engineering jobs as their counterparts from strong public universities. Feel free to include Berkeley, Harvey Mudd, Caltech, UWaterloo, etc. as part of this bunch too. Berkeley and Caltech are self-explanatory, Harvey Mudd has an intensely rigorous engineering/CS curriculum, and Waterloo has a killer co-op program (like GT!).

391,fbjckd,False,Other Discussion,48,"With RD season coming up: When you decline admission or withdraw your app to a college, they’ll ask you for a reason, and you should say it was for financial reasons.",ApplyingToCollege,"Colleges use the questionnaire as data to help them know who’s accepting, who’s declining, and it’s not a stretch to think it’ll be used to benefit the school especially in increasing their yield in the future.

So if you put down that you’re going to another school and put the reason as they have a better program or something else, they’ll make a note of your stats and may use it to make a more informed decision in whether to accept or decline a similar student in the future. You’ll be required to give a reason in the questionnaire too, and sometimes they require you to put down the school you’ve accepted instead too so you can’t leave it blank.

In order not to let your data be used in this way and to put pressure on colleges to give more aid or decrease tuition, put down financial aid as the main reason. There are no downsides to this. You won’t screw future classes over, and if enough people do it, it’ll make a statement. College is too fucking expensive.

EDIT: Not condoning lying, but if you’re choosing another school for multiple reasons with financial aid being one of them, put financial aid down as the reason since they’re usually only asking for one.

EDIT 2: Hey everyone, wow I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up like this. I’ve wrote a few loooong comments as replies to people who think colleges using data like this is a ludicrous idea, but I figured a lot of people won’t see them, so putting some info here. More links in the comments.

How are colleges using your data? Well, already pretty unethically. At the University of Wisconsin-Stout and over 43 other colleges (at least the ones The Washington Post found), [they](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) collect your data and use it in such a way without feeling the need to tell you because to quote Buff State: “You have a choice of not interacting at all” referring to the fact that people make a choice to visit the website and they can get their info through phone calls or social media posts instead. Ludicrous, right? They’re saying you’re agreeing to colleges using your data to score you when you’re looking up information and need to make a choice between a detailed database with answers to most of your questions and an Instagram post. I think you need to access the website to find the phone number too.

At UW-Stout, they use an algorithm to assign you a score out of 100 to determine what’s the likelihood you’d accept an offer if given and use it to make decisions. It’s also not said (hmm) where they got the data for the algorithm. I’m a CS/Philosophy major, so the role of trust in an online relationship is super interesting, but to me, I think these events have diminished, perhaps obliterated, any trust in the relationship between you and colleges. Perhaps better advice would have been to not answer the questionnaires at all and forgo making a statement. Your data is valuable, so protect it. This is another way colleges obscure the admissions process to increase the power imbalance in their favor, and transparency and organizing as a collective is how we get the power back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fbjckd/with_rd_season_coming_up_when_you_decline/,1602,"This is just misinformation all around and I encourage students to do the opposite - be truthful in your reason in choosing another school so the school can actually get informed data and better itself.

The data you provide is not “screwing future students” in any way and to say so is just false. It’s hard to imagine a single school that even uses the alleged method to weed out future classes. I can also assure you mass reporting “financial aid” as the reason is NOT going to change tuition rates or scholarship offerings. Why? Because supply and demand, the school filled its class with people willing to pay, so why change?

Be honest. That’s the number one rule for college admissions. ",2020-02-29 21:24:52
3,9vw5qw,False,Interviews,823,I got roasted in my stanford interview yesterday.,ApplyingToCollege,"TL;DR at bottom. 


[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&sh=96d699ce) 

Yesterday, I had my stanford interview. 

I arrived ahead of time and was just taking notes in my notebook, seems a small detail but it’ll be used later on. 

When he came, I shook hands and he insisted we sat outside. It was freezing cold, but I obliged nonetheless. He asked quite naturally to just introduce myself and I did... but he just interrupted me and went “sorry, I didn’t catch you. I just saw a beautiful girl. Could you repeat?”. I kinda got an odd feeling from the off with this. 

He asked me about what I do in IB, and I did so and explained my extended essay to him. He then proceeded to critically question it with various complex issues with the experiment I did for it (it was in physics, and he has a PhD in electrical engineering). He asked for the equation I derived, and obviously I can’t remember so I told him it was a long formula but I can’t quite remember. He responded by essentially telling me my experiment is quite simplistic, and it can’t be that long and complex. Then flexed his thesis that derived an 11th order formula. 
For reference, my extended essay was predicted an A. 

He asked about my econ coursework for the IB as well, and we had a short debate about monetary policy of the Fed. However, when explaining my opinions to him using simple economic concepts, he simply told me I don’t make sense. 

This was about 10mins in. 

He then proceeded to tell me “you spend your whole life studying. You won’t succeed at Stanford, you will struggle massively.”

He hadn’t asked once about what I do outside of school or ANYTHING. Nor had he seen my resume or common app beforehand. Zilch. I am convinced in hindsight he made such a comment simply because I was so into our academic discussions as an Asian. I’m convinced it was racial stereotyping. 

I refuted that claim, naturally. 
I explained all the things I do and he decimated each and every one. 

I run a funny podcast with friends for enjoyment. He ripped into it as “it does not have a purpose” despite me explaining we do it for the enjoyment and entertainment of content creation. 

I explained the two international honours I’ve received. One of them was a 3rd place. He asked me why I didn’t win, and when I gave my answer, he asked what the first place team’s project was. He told me “that’s actually innovative, all you’ve done is manipulate a few numbers. “. 
I explained my next one, and he said “I’m not interested in things you’ve done for competitions”.  

He asked me why stanford. I give a whole host of reasons ranging from the culture and how I clicked with students when I visited, all the way to specific societies and research groups that sound interesting to me. He told me “that’s not quite good enough. You can find that entrepreneurial culture in any university.”  He asked where I’m applying other than Stanford, then told me “you don’t make sense. these universities don’t have any entrepreneurial culture at all”. 

The colleges I named? Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, USC, NYU (am applying to more but didn’t want to rattle off a list of 10). He also insulted USC and NYU saying they’re simply “party schools with average academics”. 

Then he asked me what my “thing” is. I asked him to clarify what he meant, and he said “everyone has something they’re amazing or world class at such as sport, drama or music. What about you?”  

Now I’m sorry I’m not an Olympic athlete, a talented actor or a world class musician. I can’t help that. I do what I do and have excelled at what I enjoy- and I enjoy a few areas. He called me “uninteresting” and told me “you will blend in with the 50,000 applicants, you’re not differentiated. “

He asked me about what I want to do when I’m older. I told him I want to start a company.  He responded “there’s no evidence you can do this. You have no evidence. You’re 17,18, why haven’t you built a successful company already?” 

I have family responsibilities and don’t even know which area I love most to start a company in. What does he expect from me?
He then told me “real passion and evidence” is like this example of a girl who did debating since she was 9. 

He then asked about what drives me. I open up about what drives me... and he completely shut me down and told me it’s “not really a motivation”.

He questioned me on if I drink alcohol. Obviously I say no even though I do.... then he criticises me and says it’s “ridiculous that You follow your parents wishes even when they’re  not around”. Eventually I break my guard and say I have the odd beer with friends. 

Then, he wrapped up the interview by telling me “I know what I’m saying is probably making your mind race at 100mph behind that superficial smile of yours but you have to drop that. “ in a serious tone. 
He told me I “don’t have a story, narrative or drive in life” and to go and “find them and email it” to him. 

He said he would email me what he’s going to report to stanford and “not to be disheartened by it”. 

Then, as he’s leaving he tells me “take your little notebook, reflect and sit there and take some notes on what I’ve said. “

As I said, in hindsight his comment about me spending my life studying was imo racially driven. In hindsight, I should’ve respectfully terminated the interview there and then. 
He had no right to make such a comment. 

I should’ve been self aware of the situation, instead I was taken aback by his comment and too involved.

Advice: if an interview is going badly, be self aware. Don’t take shit, even if you think your future is in their hands - because it really isn’t. 

Honestly I’d rather have taken the L there and then from Stanford (most likely happening anyway) than sit through and defend myself against a constant unfair, unwarranted bombardment of criticism. The tone he took with me was condescending at best. I was nothing but polite and sincere. Luckily, I’m not too upset by this. Just pissed off. If it were someone sensitive, with the way he spoke, they could well have been in tears. 

TL;DR: Interviewer was a huge asshole and constantly criticised me. I believe he stereotyped the fact I’m Asian  when he told me I “spend my life studying” and thus will “struggle at Stanford” without knowing anything about me. Advice: don’t take shit from interviewers. I should’ve walked out there and then.

731,bgcxt1,False,,43,I love seeing my friends fall in love with their college decisions,ApplyingToCollege,"One of my closest friends just committed to Stanford, her very last acceptance after a slew of unexpected rejections. One of my best friends is attending Loyola Marymount for film, one of the best film programs in the country. Another one of my best friends had to pick between USC and in-state U of A and fell in love with U of A and its unique physiology major. Several of my other friends are going to ASU’s Barrett Honors College and pursuing amazing things like Economics with a focus on Public Policy and premed and engineering and interior design and psychology. Two of my closest friends visited and committed to Utah State because of the amazing environmental studies program they have up there. We had some impressive acceptances as an entire class as well - MIT, Yale, Harvard, Rice, Duke, Cornell, Brown, Vanderbilt, WashU, NYU, UCLA, Berkeley, UChicago, Williams. A ton more from smaller name colleges with just as rewarding and exciting academic, professional, and personal prospects for the future. 

Yeah, I’m ecstatic for my future college experience. But it excites me so much to see my friends and peers fall in love with their futures and make these huge, inspiring decisions. I’m so lucky to know such talented, kind, and energizing people. I absolutely can’t wait to see the things they do in the future. I’m fueled by their success.

628,aclutj,False,Best of A2C,107,Up Close and Personal: The Interview. Here's my Interview Cheat Sheet.,ApplyingToCollege,"I'm seeing that lots of you are getting invited to interviews and have questions about whether you should do them or not, or what they are all about.  

**Do the interview.** Data for some schools shows a striking difference in acceptance rates for those who interview and those who don’t if the opportunity is available to them. So, if the school offers you an interview, it’s in your best interest to accept. That’s even if they say that the interview is technically “optional” (you do know that there is no such thing as truly ""optional"" in college admissions language right?).

Lots of schools have different methods for the way they conduct interviews, so you need to **read their websites carefully.** For some, you are automatically put on an interview list when you apply. For others, you have to sign up and arrange it. Additionally, at some schools, they will automatically add you to a list for an off-campus interview if they have them available in your area. 

**Interview time is also an excellent time to start regularly checking your inbox for communications, as well as your spam and junk folders, and make sure you have your voicemail set up and cleared out on your phone. You don’t want to miss any communications from the college** (which you should be opening for demonstrated interest reasons), especially not for something like an interview. Note — one of my own children missed a couple of interviews because he wasn’t checking spam. It was definitely a lesson learned the hard way.

# Advice for nailing the interview

It’s easy to become anxious and stressed about interviews, especially if you’re in the midst of the interview swamp right now. It’s fun, but can be a little sticky, and gooey, and uncomfortable. Or dry and desert-like maybe. Or maybe even moist and dessert-like.

Regardless, you can do this! You’ve made it this far, having surmounted obstacles like grades, extracurriculars, and putting together your application. So instead of stressing, focus all that nervous energy into what you can do right now: prepare.

## Top Ten Potential Questions They Might Ask You

You shouldn’t memorize your answers to these questions, but it won’t hurt to think a little about your answers. Focus on how these questions can help you authentically present yourself, not how you can make yourself seem like the most impressive, perfect candidate of all time (the interviewer will see right through that). 

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
2. “What do you like to do in your free time?” Follow-ups: Be prepared to talk about some of your extracurriculars and why you enjoy them, how you got interested in them, etc. 
3. “Why X College?” Follow-ups: Here you should have specific details — amazing classes or professors or programs you’ve heard about. What first drew you to this college and why do you think you’re a good fit? What will you contribute?
4. “Why do you want to study X?”
5. “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” As follow up: What do you do to remedy those weaknesses?
6. “Describe yourself in 1-3 words.” Some say one. Some say three.
7. Be prepared to talk about “supplemental essay” questions: 
   1. Your favorite X (author, mentor, person, etc.)
   2. An obstacle in your life you’ve overcome
   3. What has influenced you the most in your life
   4. Talk about a time when you had to resolve a conflict
   5. Talk about a time you’ve demonstrated leadership, etc.
8. What are your plans after college? You don’t have to be super specific — maybe say what field you’re generally interested in, and perhaps offer one or two ideas you have in mind and why.
9. “What would you do differently about high school if you had to do it again?”
10. “If an alien offered to take you on an epic space journey, but you could never see your friends and family on Earth again, would you go?” (In my experience, sometimes interviewers like to throw weird or unexpected questions at you just for fun.)

## Preparing for Your Interview

In the days leading up to your interview, instead of preparing and memorizing whole paragraphs to lob at the interviewer, think about why you love the school so much. What is it that you love? Because what you love is the version of “you” that you see there. And “you” will be wherever you go. Figure out how you fit that school (it all comes back to fit!).

I suggest bringing a one-page resume. There are others who disagree with me, so go with your gut, but if the college or the interviewer doesn’t explicitly tell you not to bring a resume or anything, I recommend bringing a one-page highlights resume. This way the recommender has something to refer to as they talk to you and as they later write their notes. Simply hand it to them when you meet them. If they toss it to the side or say they don’t need it, no biggie.  See below for my one-page resume suggestions.

Also, bring a notepad and pen so you can take notes if you like. 

The night before the interview, do the basic but essential preparation stuff — make sure your outfit is clean, pressed, and ready to go. Check out the route to the interview location to anticipate transportation challenges and make sure you make it on time. Go over the next day’s schedule and make sure you’ve given yourself enough time to get to the interview location and get into the right frame of mind. Get a good night’s sleep. 

## Making a Good First Impression

**Appearance**

Contrary to what some students believe, you do not need to wear a suit to your interview. But you must have a tidy, neat appearance.

For example, you could wear a clean shirt with a collar, tucked in, and a clean pair of pants or jeans with a belt (if you have pants other than jeans, wear them). You could also wear a clean skirt or pants with a blouse or shirt, tucked in if appropriate. Or you could wear a nice dress (but nothing too fancy). Wash and brush or comb your hair. No need for anything too elaborate, clean and neat hair is fine. Shave or trim your beard, if you have one, so it looks controlled. If your hair looks a little messy and you think you need a haircut, well, maybe get a haircut.

Wear something you are comfortable in, and that makes you feel confident. However, DO NOT WEAR inappropriate t-shirts or dirty, stained, or torn clothes. Avoid t-shirts, hoodies, and ripped jeans if you can — even if they tell you it’s casual. If you wear tennis shoes, make sure you clean them up. Also, I personally feel like you should take out any piercings beyond ear piercings, but maybe that’s just me being old-fashioned and frumpy *\[AdmissionsSon’s note: yes, that is definitely you being old-fashioned and frumpy, though unfortunately many interviewers are also old-fashioned and frumpy. Students, try to gauge your audience a bit with this one. I’d be totally cool with whatever piercings.\]*

**Arrival**

Arrive early, so you don’t stress yourself out rushing to the interview. Plan how early you need to leave to arrive 15 minutes early, and then leave 15 minutes before that time. So yes, you might be 30 minutes early. That’s ok. When you get there, go to the bathroom. After you take care of your business, look at yourself in the mirror and put your hands on your hips and stand up nice and tall. Do the Superman Pose and take some deep breaths.

**Introductions**

Smile! Don’t force a big fake smile, but you’re not at a funeral, right? Again, the interview is going to be like a little chat between you and the interviewer. You might as well relax and try to enjoy it a little bit.

Make eye contact. This is very important. Make sure you look the interviewer in the eye, so they know you’re engaged and paying attention. But like, not too much. It’s not a staring contest. Just be confident but natural. 

Introduce yourself. The easiest and most casual, confident way to do this is to simply state your name during the handshake.

Shake hands. Think of a good handshake as about the degree of firmness you would need to hold onto a doorknob to open a door.

## During the Interview

Put your phone away.  Silence it and tuck it away. Don’t take it out again until after the interview. The only exceptions would be something like they ask to see a picture of an art project you did and you happen to have one on your phone. If you do show them a picture, make sure there’s nothing potentially embarrassing to scroll past!

Remember to breathe.

Listen to your interviewer. The one piece of advice that the Admissions Counselors for Colleges ask us to share with you is for you just to come and listen to the questions and respond. Don’t come with an agenda of what you want to say or come off as overly practiced. They could end up noting that in their write-up.

Being nervous is ok. Own it. Many of you are shy and introverted. Lean into your nerves. You can tell the interviewer. They might be too, and this will help them know to help you along. Your interviewer’s not looking to catch you in an awkward moment or waiting for a mistake to pounce on. They don’t want you to fail.

## After The Interview

Ask for a business card so you can write a thank you note to your interviewer! When you get home after the interview, jot down a quick thank you note and send it in. Here’s a good rule of thumb — if your interviewer is your parents’ age or older, a hand-written thank you note will be great if you have his or her home address (without creepy internet snooping); otherwise, an email is fine. Be gracious, be grateful for their time, and be sure to bring up something they talked about in the email. Don’t worry if you don’t hear back from them. It doesn’t mean anything at all.

**THE RESUME**

In most cases, the interviewer, especially if they are an alum interviewer, won't have any heads up about your application, so this gives them something to work through.

HEADING: Your full name, ID # for that school, email address, cell phone number, and home address 

EDUCATION: High School (s), GPA, SAT, ACT, SAT Subject, and AP or IB scores if they are helpful (note-i had a redditor tell me last week that some schools want to be sure you don't include your GPA or test scores. I'd never heard that before, but obvy if they say that to you, then leave that part out)

EXTRACURRICULARS: what do you do outside of school? It doesn’t have to be a school organized activity. 

WORK EXPERIENCES 

SUMMER EXPERIENCES 

HONORS AND AWARDS 

SKILLS and INTERESTS 

Obviously, this is you distilled into one page, so brevity is key. They may or may not look at the resume, but that’s ok. You just hand it to them when you get there. Some will politely set it aside or just say they don’t need. Others will refer to it and use it for notes. It’s out of your hands once you pass it to them.

&#x200B;

**INTERVIEW NO-NOs**

Don’t treat the interview as the magical ritual that will automatically get you admitted to the school of your choice. As stressed above, this should be a conversation, not an audition, not a monologue. You need to treat your interviewer with respect. Above all else, you need to let your best self shine through.

To achieve that goal, avoid these common interview mistakes:

* Arriving late
* Wearing dirty, torn clothes
* Having your phone out/Looking at your phone
* Offering a limp handshake 
* Being over-prepped
* Spewing canned answers that sound like you’ve tried to memorize them
* Coming with an agenda of what you want to or think you should talk about
* Not listening to the interviewer! The number one thing admissions officers and alums tell me to tell students is to LISTEN in interviews. They say far too many students come with rehearsed responses and you are not actually listening and responding to the questions presented to you. Listen. Be present. Smile. Engage. Breathe.

# 

# tl;dr

* Whatever it looks like, an invitation for a college admissions interview is awesome! It’s an excellent opportunity to have one-on-one and personalized contact with the school, and it adds a lot of useful information to your application.
* There are different ways to get an interview — you might be invited, or you might have to sign up. Keep an eye on your email inbox (check spam and voicemail too) and read the admissions page website for more information!
* Don’t be upset if you don’t get a ton of interview requests, or if you don’t get any at all. Lots of kids get into amazing colleges without an interview.
* Don’t overthink your interview performance. That means you should not memorize answers ahead of time. 
* Before, during, and after the interview, put your best foot forward. Look clean and neat, be attentive and polite, and send a thank you note afterward. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aclutj/up_close_and_personal_the_interview_heres_my/,1213,[deleted] ,2019-01-04 19:47:56

381,gx5612,False,Discussion,111,Miracles DO Happen,ApplyingToCollege,"I saw someone else's post on their waitlist miracle, so I wanted tell you about mine. 

I only applied to 3 schools (don't come at me lol). 1 was my dream school -- UPenn -- while the other 2 were target and safety schools. In March, I found out that I was waitlisted at Penn. After writing a LOCI (and sending it the same day I got the decision), I was informed in May that I got accepted off the waitlist.

My financial aid came in a few days after my acceptance, and once again I was disappointed because there was no way my family and I could afford it. After sending in an appeal, the financial aid office gave me more aid, but it was still not enough. 

*So I sent in another appeal...*

After waiting for two weeks and making tons of phone calls, I realized that the financial aid office did not see my second appeal. One of the counselors there eventually told me that Penn does not usually review 2nd appeals and suggested that I take out loans. However, after making a few more calls, my mom was able to contact the actual committee that was in charge of reviewing financial aid. They told my mom that they would look at my second appeal the next day and update me that evening. 

I'm happy to say that Penn gave me even more aid, making the price around **$40,000** *less* than the amount I originally had to pay. And now, Penn is even cheaper than the state school I originally committed to.

505,bbs8f2,False,Other Discussion,75,What I wish I could tell my 17 year old self-- Reflections of a 2 year post-grad,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all,

Not sure if this kind of post is allowed, if not, feel free to remove.

About me--I started college in 2014. I had a good time and got what I needed out of school, but I’ve also felt lonely and made mistakes. Here’s what I wish I could tell my freshman self. I know a lot of this may not apply to others, but I wanted to share in case it helps anyone else. Good luck to all of the incoming students :)

1. You aren’t having an existential crisis; you aren’t taking care of your basic needs. Good sleep, good diet, exercise, social contact—a lack of any of these things will mimic the symptoms of depression! Seriously, take care of these things first, always.
2. A class cannot be called “hard” unless you pay attention during lectures and put honest, good effort into doing practice problems, homework, and reading the textbook.
3. Undergraduate classes are not that hard. A reasonably smart person will be able to get an A in most of them with EFFORT. If you are not doing well, then something is going wrong with your study habits. Find out what it is so you can fix it.
4. When people say you have to choose 2 out of Grades, Social Life, and Sleep, they’re wrong. You have to choose 3 out of Grades, Social Life, Procrastination, Sleep, and Wasting Time on Social Media and Netflix.
5. There is nothing shameful about being poor; likewise, there is nothing shameful about  having your parents pay for your needs. Instead of pretending to worry about money, show your parents how grateful you are to them.
6. Your new college friends care about you a lot less than your parents do.
7. You need to wash your sheets, towels, and comforter cover. At least once a month.
8. Buy a trash can with a lid and empty it regularly unless you want your room to smell like trash.
9. Your apartment or living space needs a “deep clean” every so often. Buy heavy duty cleaning supplies early on, and use them. Don’t forget the bathtub.
10. You should put pride in your appearance. Your outfit and surroundings affect your behavior. If you wear PJs to class, you’ll act like someone who wears PJs to class. You don’t have to wear collared shirts or makeup, but you should put in a modicum of effort.
11. Roommates are not worth it. The privacy of having your own space is invaluable. Housemates strike an ideal balance between companionship and privacy.
12. You CAN have long lasting and meaningful relationships in college. You can find your life partner when you’re 18 or 38. The former does not make you immature or white trash. Love and companionship is underrated for young people.
13. Stop drinking once you feel the effects of the alcohol.
14. Don’t take dating advice from people who aren’t happy in their relationships.
15. Don’t be friends with people who don’t respect you.
16. The mental states of the people around you will affect you more than you affect them. If you spend time with people who are unhappy or anxious or overly competitive or narcissistic, you are much more likely to become those things.
17. Think about what kind of career you want early on.
18. It will all go by so fast, enjoy it as much as you can.

I graduate in about week and haven’t been spending much time on here lately because my college apps process is done. I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while but just never got around to it because I kept putting it off. I’m going to list off some tips that helped me during the process.

To start, I’ll give some background. I’m going to be a CS major next year at a pretty good CS school (PM me for more info because I'm not trying to give away a lot of personal info, but I would say it's one of the most popular schools on here. It's not an Ivy, but it's near the top for CS).

***

Research now what you need to do. I found out last September I needed two recs and SAT subject tests for some schools. Make sure you find that stuff out now so you aren’t in trouble next fall.

***

I think essays are a big source of anxiety over the summer before senior year and your first semester of senior year. It might sound crazy, but my honest advice is to not take them so seriously. Like, yeah, they matter, but you can literally write about almost anything. **You don’t have to write about some life-changing event.** All that matters is that it says something about you. Looking back, I spent way too long thinking about what to write about, but it became clear after the process that I didn’t need to dedicate so much time and energy to picking a topic. Have fun writing your essays. It sounds wild, I know, and I actually enjoy writing when I get to write about a topic I’m passionate about, but just chill out and write about whatever the hell you want. It’s supposed to be a view into your personality, not your best rendition of Joey's letter for Chandler and Monica. I’m the kind of person that doesn’t take things too seriously, but I know not everyone is like that, so this advice might not work for everyone. But I’m just giving my $0.02 on this whole process, so that’s what worked for me. I remember everyone freaking out about essays and what to write about last year, and, sure, I was stressed, but I just didn’t think of it as that big of a deal. Be yourself, that’s it. Some of this is on the schools too. It’s really freaking hard to write about why you want to go to a school. I’ve seen people say, “If you can’t write 300-500 words on why you want to go to a school, you shouldn’t apply there.” Maybe it’s just me, but I struggled to reach the word minimum even for my top schools. Shoutout to schools like UChicago and Georgia Tech and other schools like that for actually giving us a chance to showcase our personality. For the Why X schools, I kind of just BS’ed them. Just wrote I thought they wanted to hear and left it at that. It was in the Common App essay and other more personal essays that I took my earlier advice about just having fun writing and not taking myself to seriously.

***

Second, there’s a *lot* of great info on this subreddit. That said, there is a *lot* of misinformation too. Again, I don’t want to get into this too much because I’m trying to keep it private here because people from my school go on this subreddit, but I know way too much about my top three schools because I researched them hardcore, and I have seen a lot of wrong things on here about them. Still, in general, this subreddit is hugely helpful, especially for someone who didn’t have much help from parents throughout this process.

***

Keep an open mind. The school I’m going to next year wasn’t even on my mind in August of last year. My counselor gave me a list of schools he thought I should apply to, and I went back and forth on even keeping it on my list. Come December-January, it was my top school.

***

Don’t ED unless you’re 100% totally sure you want to go there. My top school in October didn’t have ED but I probably would have ED’d there if they did. I’m glad I didn’t.

***

Start essays early. I say it, everyone says it, and I know you probably won’t. For me, it’s not that I was so super stressed in late October, but instead it was looking back later and knowing I could have done better if I started earlier. That probably didn’t make sense. Let me rephrase: I started most of my essays about a week before they were due (I know, I’m literally the worst). I finished in plenty of time because I didn’t go crazy trying to think of ideas and nitpick every single thing. But I looked back at my essays in March (after I had gotten my decisions - *never* look at your essays after you apply until you get your decisions because you will drive yourself nuts finding tiny mistakes) and realized that I had gained so much knowledge of the college apps process since applying and I would have done a much better job if I started research earlier. Do that. It helps. I know you probably won’t, but you can’t say I didn’t warn you when you look back at your essays next year and kick yourself for how much they suck.

***

Finally, don’t be a dick. Don’t brag to others about where you got in and didn’t. I made a point to be vocal with where I got rejected because I think it’s important that people know it’s not the end of the world. Ask “Do you know where you’re going yet?” instead of “Where are you going next year?” because some people don’t get in anywhere they applied. Don’t look down on others because you never know what they’re going through (money concerns especially. College is expensive). I heard someone say, “Oh, I thought you’d go somewhere better” to one of their friends. They probably just didn’t think before they said that and meant it as a complement of their intelligence, but, I mean, come on, don’t say that. People say it’s a crapshoot, and that applies when you get in as well as when you’re rejected. Be humble when you get in places because a lot of people didn’t, and brush it off as best you can when you don’t in places because there’s another place out there for you. I’m not a big believer in the whole dream school idea because I honestly think a lot of schools can give you pretty much the same experience. We sometimes fetishize certain schools in our heads even though you’ll probably have a relatively similar experience at most of the schools you apply to. At least for me. I know some people are just applying to the top X schools for their major. Miss me with that. I would despise life at Carnegie Mellon even if they’re really good at CS. I’m just different than that socially. Not trying to hate myself for the next four years, you know? Editing to add this last part in now because this sounds like I’m just roasting CMU. I’m not. I just mean it’s not right for me personally. It’s perfect for a lot of other people. I just think I wouldn’t like it there.

***

Before I go, I want to echo what I talked about in my first paragraph about not taking this process too seriously. That’s not to say it’s not a big deal - it is - but don’t base your self-worth around where you’re going to college. My parents were pretty hands-off throughout it all so I didn’t have that much pressure, but I know some people’s parents aren’t like that. Sit back and think every once in a while, like, whoa, I get to pick where I study. I get to pick what I study. In X months, I’ll have independence and be living on my own in a place I earned the right to be at. That’s pretty fucking cool. Make this thing fun. You only get to/have to do it once. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to get accepted to all of these colleges. If you had told me this a year ago, I would have sent you to /r/wowthanksimcured because I know you can’t “just stop” putting so much pressure on yourself, or at least most of you can’t. Just, please, try to have some fun with this. College isn’t the end, it’s the beginning (and now I’m a philosopher I guess). This is the start of your new world of independence, but thankfully you’re eased in with the help of parents and teachers and counselors. Enjoy it. Sit back and smile and think about how you’re picking your own path.

***

That’s it. Definitely not proofreading this so my bad for any typos. Again, PM me for any personal/CS-specific/school-specific questions. These are just my $0.02 so YMMV. This process is different for everyone, this is just what helped me.

***

One more thing, about ECs, I literally had 0 CS-related ECs. 0 math competitions. 0 science competitions. No DECA or Science Olympiad. Nothing like that. I had a couple years of varsity sports, community service, and some clubs I’m interested in. Do stuff you like. Not stuff you think colleges will like. I’m not going to lie and say it wouldn’t have helped me if I had USACO Gold (I honestly don’t know what that is but I’ve seen it on here as a good thing), but I don’t think the cost of trying to get that (and probably failing) is worth what I would have given up.

192,g37nsu,False,Best of A2C,76,"My personal system for easily creating fun, original essay topics. Introducing: ""Half-Ideas""",ApplyingToCollege," In my experience, the majority of problems students run into with their application essays are based upon picking a bad topic. By ""bad"" I generally mean the topic falls into two categories:

1) Done to death

2) Too weird for its own good

The first one I can easily provide samples for: probably my most common one is running track. A lot of students run track and want to write about their experiences. That's great except that a lot of other students also run track and have similar things to say. There are only so many ways to write about track - see if you recognize any of these classics:

\- I joined track and was bad at it, but then I tried harder and now I'm good

\- I'm really good at track and here is a list of my accomplishments you already saw on my EC that prove how good I am

\- I'm just ok at track, but through the team, I have gained other skills like leadership that are important to me

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. But then I got better and now I can again

\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn’t anymore. And I still can’t. But it’s ok I figured it out

\- I don't actually like track, but in being forced to do it, I learned some valuable lessons

\- Here is a live recap of me running the anchor on the 400 relay, with every student I pass symbolizing an obstacle I have conquered in life to get where I am

That last one is a bit of a joke. But it's indicative of the problem that I think drives elite students to get so...creative in the framing devices on their essays. You students know track isn't that special, but it is something important to you, and you want to talk about it. The end result is...well…

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i\_think\_modern\_elite\_essays\_are\_terrible\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i_think_modern_elite_essays_are_terrible_and/)

And then the other problem is with ""le quirky teen"" essays. These never seem to work out as well as anyone wants. That penguin collection may be as important to you as you write about, but without anything more substantial to link those interests to, the essay falls apart.

So, what do we do about all this? How do we manage to write about what matters to us, but in a way that's still fun and original? 

The answer is *half-ideas*.

""I like track because it taught me responsibility"" is a half idea. So is ""I have trouble sleeping when I'm nervous. So is ""I collect stuffed penguins."" So is ""I like making people laugh and try to lighten the mood when things are hard."" A half idea is anything about you or your world that you think colleges should know about. What makes half-ideas different from normal ideas is that we want to come up with these ideas with the full intention of *combing those ideas together to create an original topic.*

Some people stumble upon combining half ideas by accident. I did! I wrote an essay ten years ago that perfectly encapsulated how easy and powerful combing two ideas can be. My two half ideas for the topic were:

1. I have ADHD
2. I like to run 

Either of these topics could be converted into a competent, if unexciting, essay on their own. I guarantee AOs will read hundreds of similar essays this year.  But luck would have it, I combined those two half ideas into a full idea that worked a lot better. All I had to do was look at those two topics and try to find a connection between them. I've found that the best connections will pop out to you. Mine did:

**How running helps me deal with my ADHD by giving me a way to quiet my mind and think clearly** 

The hardest part of my ADHD is getting my brain to stop moving so fast. As quickly as I start to think about something important, that thought gets batted away by garbage. I like running because I find when I get tired enough, my brain will quiet down, and I can think about things that are important or bothering me. I get most of my best thinking done six miles into a run. That's my essay. 

I guarantee there aren't many students writing that essay. By combing two ideas into a single one, I make the topic much more personal and unique. I also build myself a natural narrative structure by both presenting a challenge and a way I conquer that challenge. ""How X helps me with Y"" is a great way to frame an essay  Cool, right!

So let's get practical. The first step is to build as many half-ideas as possible. Just start posting as many ideas as you can. Don't worry about how you'll match them or if they're even worth matching. You've likely heard similar ""just write; it doesn't matter what!"" advice before, but I think that advice kind of sucks because it DOES matter what you write. With half-ideas, you should feel more comfortable posting weird factoids about yourself because you'll no longer have to worry about turning those ideas in a full essay. Just write them. Here are some sample list groups you can start with, along with as many personal half ideas I can think of for each.

**Cool stuff you've done that would make a traditional essay**

4 years Cross Country

3 Years Track

2 Years School Newspaper

4 years Parli Debate

Hosted a school zombie tag game

Active non-fiction writer

Started my own College Consulting business and made a sweet website, nbd (CollegeWithMattie.com)

**Obstacles you've overcome** 

ADHD

I suffered through chronic illness in my 20s

Colorblind

**Weird ""quirky"" facts about you**

I love cats and have one named Penny

I love football and refuse to work on Sunday

I taught myself piano using a video game

**Positive Personality Traits**

My mom says I'm funny

I'm easy to talk to and once won a bet by speaking about my cat and college admissions for 3 hours straight

I think differently and often come up with solutions for problems no one else has (like this one!)

I see patterns well and am always looking for a more efficient way to do things

**Goals/Passions/Proof of those passions**

Want to be a private college admissions consultant

Finishing UC Berkeley certification on topic

Worked past three years as a counselor with company

10 years of writing experience

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

That's just a short selection. Locate any ""idea suggestion"" posts and you will find more topics to think about. 

Now that I have my list, it's time for me to look for connections between the two. Often the best value for this method comes when one of the half ideas is from the ""challenges/hardships"" section. This is especially true for URM or any other student with a background hook. You want to present that background but do it in a way that's more tasteful than ""I grew up X, and here's why it was hard."" Combine that half idea with another interest of yours, so the topic becomes ""How Y helped me overcome my Childhood as X"". Yay half ideas!

When looking at my list, two ideas that come to mind are my history of illness + that I taught myself piano. I decided to teach myself piano two years ago as a way of signifying that my life was going to be different now that I was better. It turned out that way, and now I celebrate my piano playing as a symbol of the fact that life doesn't take things from me anymore; I gain from it.

Pretty good topic, ya? Seeing these topics all out in front of me made it easy to compare them to one another and see what kind of connections I could identify. 

Here are some bonus tips as you develop your half-idea stable:

**Your ideas don't have to share 50/50 content.** 

Sometimes one topic is just more interesting than the other. Don't be afraid for a single idea to encompass 80%+ of an essay, with another idea coming in as support. Maybe you write about charity work and realize that every time you read to a kid in the hospital you leave him with one of your stuffed penguins. That's exactly why you want to introduce those penguins earlier so you can add it to your experience.

**You can even have third ideas. Whatever**

Going back to my illness/piano essay, I'd probably also want to add my wish to be a counselor in near the end. Just as I gained piano in my life, I also want to obtain success in counseling. Seeeee? It's so fun and eaaaaaasy!

**Focus on the interaction between the ideas as much as or more than the ideas themselves**

Somewhere out there is another essay involving both a love of swimming and a keen interest in robotics. Simply having two half-ideas existing in an essay is not necessarily going to make it work. Instead, I find it’s the way those ideas intertwine -the connection itself- that is most interesting. I think it’s because that connection entirely relies on you and how you view the world. That’s where the magic happens. 


**Keep every half-idea about you**

This goes into advice for another blog post, but keep the focus of your essays on you. Your friends, family, famous people, politicians, and everyone else can cameo in your story, but the vast majority of content needs to be about you. The easiest way to ensure this is to keep all half-ideas that way from the start.

**You can think of half-ideas retroactively**

Write something and just feel like it's missing something? Think hard about other aspects of your life that may fit into the essay you've already written. Maybe you wrote about a big camping trip. You can bring up the fact that you're always the one who tries to keep the group calm, so when things were rough, you took it upon yourself to provide moral support. The goal is writing an essay that showcases what happens when different aspects of your life come together.

**Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative**

Utilizing ""how"" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.

**Don't go insane**

You may have a topic or two that are awesome and don't need tinking with. Don't! This may be advice for essays 2-27 you'll be writing. Keep the list of half-ideas handy and constantly be adding to it. You never know when you'll be inspired by it.

986,f9zxlk,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,96,Ranking t20s based on the distance to the closest Chick Fil A,ApplyingToCollege,"Everyone has their own metrics for judging how good a school is, maybe small class size makes a school more attractive, maybe it's a great grad school, or maybe it's an insane ratio of women to men students (I'm looking at you, American!) In any case, everyone has a different perspective on what makes a college truly great, and everyone ranks colleges differently. It is because of this discontinuity that I am pleased to announce: 

The A2C Ranking list of US News T20s and A Couple of Other Schools I Liked Based on their Proximity relative to Chick Fil A According to Google Maps (Or the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM for short). It is my hope that this life In this list will finally provide us with a stable metric on what ranking colleges really are. I've ranked the us news top 20 undergrad schools, along with some other schools I thought were cool. The results were as follows:

# #2: UVA, with a distance of 0.2 miles to the nearest chick fil a, it will take you approximately 5 minutes to walk there. Definitely worth it, Chick-Fil-As in the south are always incredible. Kind staff, good food, and an all-around great atmosphere, I've never been but I'm going to assume that it is amazing because it is a Chick Fil A.
# #3-5: Duke, Caltech, and William and Mary, with a distance of 0.3 miles to the nearest Chick Fil A. Big shoutouts to these schools for having super close chick fil as that you can easily walk to under the cover of buildings, so if it's raining or something you can get there while staying relatively dry. 
# #6: Georgetown. Georgetown also has a distance of 0.3 miles, but it appears to be an on campus chick fil a, making it worse than normal. No good thing has ever come from an on-campus chick fil a but you gotta give them credit for trying. Nice job georgetown!
Keep in mind the top 6 all take appoximately 6 minutes to get to from the center of campus as described by google maps
# #7: Rice, with a distance of 0.6 miles, taking approximately 15 minutes to get there.
# #8-11: UPenn, American, Notre Dame, and Vanderbilt. Each is approximately 0.7 miles away from Chick Fil a, and it will take an estimated 15 minutes to walk there.
# #12: Washingotn University in St. Louis. Washington is special because you need to cut across a park to get to the Chick Fil A, which is nice and calm. It takes about an hour to walk the 2.6 miles required to get there, but it looks like a nice walk, and I wouldn't mind strolling by on a sunny day on my way to the chick fil a. Yay. Alliteration.
# #13: Johns Hopkins, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required to get there. Johns Hopkins was a pain to find because searching ""chick fil a near to johns hopkins"" brought me to some random road like 8 hours outside of the city so I had to find chick fil a myself by searching for chick fil as in baltimore.
# #14 Emory University, which takes 1 hour to travel the 3 miles required.
# #15: Northwestern. 3.7 miles. 1.16 hours. Keep in mind when I type like ""1.16 hours"" that just means 1hour 16 minutes, im just too lazy to type it all out correctly
# #16 Brown, 4.8 miles, 1.37 hours
# #17 Columbia, 5.8 miles, 2 hours. How are there not more chick fil a in new york city. That's baffling to me. glad i didn't apply
# #18 Yale, 5.9 miles, 2 hours. 
# #19 UMich 6.6 miles, 2.12 hours. However, the chick fil a near UMich is an Express Chick Fil A in another university, so not only is it far away, but it's probably really bad too. 0/10 would not recommend applying to UMich. (EDIT: APPARENTLY this chick fil a is fine. nice.)
# #20 UC Hicago: 7.3 miles. 2.26 hours. I'm not gonna recommend you walk alone through Chicago at night just cuz ur hungry, but for Chick Fil A it might be worth it.

# #21 Stanford: 7.8 miles, 2.44 hours
# #22-23: Harvard and MIT, 8.8 miless, 3 hours
# #24: Princeton: 12.7 miles, 4.4 hours away. Very sad!


And now, our special mentions. You probably noticed that #1 was missing. This is due to just how incredibly small the distance is. You could practically crawl to chick fil a here, and it would still only take you about 5 minutes. With that introduction, I present to you:

# #1 UCLA! UCLA absolutely demolishes the competition with a distance of **EIGHTY FIVE FEET!!1** it would take you approximately **ONE MINUTE** to walk to chick fil a from UCLA, making it our top school in the A2CRLOUST20AACOOSILBOTPROCFAATGM ranking system. 

Now, for sadder news. Coming in at last place, we have Cornell and Dartmouth. 

# #24-25 Cornell: 59.4 miles, and 19 hours. Even worse is Dartmouth, with 91 miles and 34 hours walking speed. I could walk to Baltimore from my home in Virginia before I could walk to a chick fil a from dartmouth or Cornell. honestly quite shameful. very displeased.


In conclusion. UCLA absolutely owns the competition with an incredible performance, but lots of schools located in the Southeast United States give UCLA a run for it's money. Schools up north or on the west coast traditionally performed very poorly, probably because they are more liberal and hate chick fil a for some reason. buncha nerds tbh. if you want my stats here is the link to my epic spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M59TKDfW6cOLsUXsI_LvhMf2MDa51tJdzzQUZStnErg/edit?usp=sharing

I have been religiously following this subreddit. I just kind of wanted to share because I'm still in awe.

I got in to every school I applied to! Xavier, UMass Lowell, Mizzou (*with an automatic transfer scholarship), and IU East. Now I'm a 29F who graduated in 2008 and when I said ""graduated"" I mean by the skin of my teeth. I was a lazy high schooler who had to go to summer school, night school, and Saturday school just to walk across stage and get my diploma at a 0.97 GPA. I really just didn't think school was for me, even though I felt for the most part capable and intelligent. I had no drive.

After a few years of retail jobs that I was miserable at and seeing my fellow slacker crew graduating I began to feel a bit envious and enrolled in my local community college where I discovered a love for education I wish I had years ago. I somehow managed to get a 3.6 GPA and join the Honors Program and now I'm staring in disbelief as these acceptance letters come in.

I'm so grateful for online programs that are going to allow me to finally be a college graduate (alas, because of work Xavier is a no-go as it doesn't have a fully online degree program =[)

Anyway, I just wanted to let any other adult that thinks maybe it's too late or they can't work a full-time job and go to school that it's entirely possible. Also for any other slackers that every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.

Thanks guys for listening to my rambling! Now to choose, which is proving to be super difficult haha.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gbjltr/i_cant_believe_i_did_it_some_hope_for_the_out_of/,1377,Congrats! You deserve it. This was so inspirational. ,2020-05-01 14:57:14
0,ap8rk6,False,Serious,469,I'm dying in two months.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hey people. 

So I made a post a while ago, about how I discovered cysts in my lungs that were life threatening. Two days ago, I was told that the disease has spread, making transplant inviable. I'm very light on the details, because really, I just don't wanna know about it too much about it myself. I consulated one of the best diagnosticians in my country. It is what it is, no point knowing what to google to find reports and probabilities, ya know? 

So yeah. I've graduated from maybe dying to surely dying.

So one of the things on my to do list is to thank as many people as possible for making life a little better. All of you are number 46 to be thanked. So thank you for the laughs, the celebrations, the kindness, the ""st anford""s, the chance mes. The last two years, I've visited this sub everyday. So I know all of you are gonna own college and life. Go get that bread.

I'm gonna get off Reddit now and try to do everything I can while lugging an oxygenator around. Gonna try to keep smiling and celebrating life till the end. It was wonderful knowing you all.

926,cbp698,False,,72,Don't Fantasize,ApplyingToCollege,"Hello everyone. I'm a senior who graduated two months ago and would like to warn all you upcoming seniors about your college application process. The past year has been rough for me and the college application experience was fucking brutal. Hear me out for a second. I am a computer science major who applied to 10 schools and they were hard to get into for CS. I am an Illinois in the Chicago area resident and I applied to schools such as UMich, UIUC, Berkeley, UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, and the likes. I ended up getting rejected by all except two of my safeties (UIC and Loyola) after being waitlisted and given blue balls by Berkeley. When I was rejected by my schools I was devastated as I felt like my hard work was a waste of time. I decided to commit to UIC and I wasn't happy.

&#x200B;

Here's the point: Please do not believe that hard work alone will get you where you want to be at.  I remember grinding the SAT practice tests while watching videos about student life at my schools. I went through a lot of anxiety and worrying my senior year believing that maybe, JUST MAYBE, all my hard work and challenges would put me in a school where I would enjoy myself. I imagined myself on campus, where I would spend my time at making friends at my schools, and what activities I would be a part of. DO NOT DO THIS. It's like the saying ""don't celebrate too early"". Until you get accepted that's when you can start fantasizing. As much as we like to imagine that the world is just and that in the end we get everything we deserve, it is not like that. We like to imagine fairy-tale scenarios. The sooner you realize that you cannot control this shit is when you finally understand how to be happy. Please do not say ""I'm for sure getting into this school"" because when you don't, it is devastating. Life doesn't give a fuck about what you had to go through, you just gotta accept what it throws at you and make the best of it. I remember spending hundreds of hours reading about past students' stats and calculating my chances of getting in. I used to say stuff like ""I'll be the lucky one who defines the odds"". It was all a huge waste of time.

&#x200B;

After cooling off for the past couple of months, I'm not even mad about going to UIC. In fact, it may have been a huge lesson being rejected from all these schools as it taught me that hard work doesn't equal a good future. Luck is a big part in all of this too. So make smart investments and don't put too much effort / emotional investment into something that is not certain. The whole process is like gambling, it gives you a rush and if you lose it can hurt you. Good luck, upcoming seniors and please, be realistic. Don't fantasize about a perfect future but rather make the most of the present moment. If anyone has questions, don't be afraid to ask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cbp698/dont_fantasize/,916,"If you’re feeling bad, remember that the biggest factor in financial success in America is not drive, “grit”, IQ, or motivation, but your parents’ income.

659,c34ng2,False,,95,How much will a generic first name hurt my chances of getting accepted to Harvard???,ApplyingToCollege,"This might sound odd, but please hear me out.

My first name, Jacob, was ranked the most frequently-given baby name of 2001 (ssa.gov). Since I know that elite colleges look at applications ""holistically"" and want a diverse class, will having an extremely common first name like 'Michael' or 'Matthew' drastically lower my chances of being accepted? There was a person at my school two years ago (who I think was originally called James)... he switched his name right before application season to 'Tichawonka' and got into Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Tsinghua, etc. Coincidence? I doubt it; he flunked nearly all his classes and had virtually no ECs.

My mother and the 11 out of 12 of my private college consultants believe that I should replicate this in compensation for donating only one building to Harvard this year. I really don't want this to happen (I prefer my current name to some of the alternatives my parents have suggested). To make matters worse, we've already hired a big-name lawyer who ""can get it done within a week"". I'm very skeptical... is it really a good idea to legally change your first name in order to boost your chances at these top institutions?

190,9qfjl5,False,Other Discussion,137,A little bit of perspective from a 21 y/o college student,ApplyingToCollege,"So, I did everything right in high school. Great grades (APs/Honors courses too), stellar SAT and ACT scores (back when it was out of 2400!), leadership positions, national debate awards. I got some acceptances to private universities, some rejections. I got three full rides to T100 public universities, and I thought that I was failure. Not only did I think that I'd never be someone *important*, I was convinced that if I went to a public school I wouldn't even be able to get a job.

&#x200B;

God, I want to smack myself. I'm in my senior year of college now and the last three years have been the most amazing years of my life. I know without a doubt I wouldn't have had the same experience had I gotten into my 'dream' school. I wanted share some of my experiences below for those of you that are fixated on certain schools. 

**1)** **If you think it's competitive now, think about what the your dream college will be like**.

During college I've been a part of my school's debate society, which is probably one of the most well-funded and well-respected public debate unions in the country. I wouldn't say the college debate circuit is dominated by Ivies, but certainly Harvard/Yale/Princeton regularly send lots of teams to every tournament. Over the years I got to know a lot of them since we see each other almost every weekend. On the surface, they all seem perfectly content, like debating 30+ hrs a week on top of a rigorous courseload comes easily to them. Many (not all) of the people I've talked to are deeply unhappy.

Seriously, think about it. If you go to an Ivy/T20, you're among the best, if not \*the\* best at your school. You eat, breathe and sleep getting into \*this\* college, because goddammit you're *special*. You're not like any of the other chumps who took it easy their junior year, those losers who aren't doing 3+ extracurriculars at a state or national level, because you're *driven* and *going somewhere.* Probably your entire life you've been the brightest in your class, and you get a lot of validation from that. 

And when you finally get to this college, you're the norm. Average. Honestly, for most of us, probably below average, or at least that's how you'll perceive yourself. There is always someone with more money, more connections, more national or international awards, more *oh my god you're taking differential equations as a freshman?* 

And this is where the competition really starts. Competition for finance internships, for campaign staffing, for professor recommendations, for spots on the \*D team\* in your college's debate society (yes, even if you went to ToC). 

I don't want to hammer this point home too much. My friends at Ivies constantly talk about how competitive it is just to join an extracurricular, the feeling of always being inadequate, the sometimes shallow friendships and transparent social-climbing. And? You still have to compete with people from every other university in the country for the 'good jobs' that you were promised by this institution. 

I'm not saying that being under pressure isn't valuable, or that everyone who goes to these schools are deeply unhappy. But for me, going to a university where there wasn't cutthroat competition just to join extracurriculars let me shop around and join things I never thought I would. I felt like I had the latitude to experiment and grow as a person because I was surrounded with friends and professors who genuinely wanted that for me, not waiting to put me down so they had the feeling of getting an edge. 

**2)** **Don't get into debt.**

School is f\*cking expensive. It's absolutely ridiculous to be just starting out in life and have $100k+ of student loan debt hanging over your head. *Go wherever gives you the most money*. People say that (most) high schoolers have no conception of money and that it's criminal to lure them into thousands of dollars of debt. As a high schooler, I was convinced that \*I\* knew what I was getting into, and that I would willingly pay any price to go to a ""good"" school, because of course it would pay off.

It's golden handcuffs. When you know you're graduating with debt, the pressure to get a good job skyrockets. No summer to go backpacking with your friends in Europe, you *need* that finance bootcamp so you can work at Goldman Sachs next summer. Going to the bars or a party with your friends? No, the stochastic calculus and corporate finance classes you took requires at least 20 hours a week studying. Can't risk graduating with anything below a 3.8 if you want a finance job. And doing the bare minimum at these jobs once you graduate means working 80 hours a week, minimum. For years. Until that debt is paid.

More importantly, unless you are literally trying to work for Goldman right out of college, I promise you it matters less and less where you go to school because employers do realize how expensive school is. Internships at boutique finance firms aren't hard to come by and they really don't care what school you go to, and once you have work experience you're golden. Look at the list of schools Harvard and Yale Law accept students from; it's mostly public state universities. 

**3) Be a big fish in a small pond, if that's what you really want to do.** 

If you really are Ivy material, and you really do think that you're better than 95% of other students, go to a state school. Think about getting a stellar recommendation from a professor at an R1 (high research) university, vs. competing with *everyone* in your upper-level econ class for a tepid recommendation letter, or not one at all. Think about less competition for research assistant positions, leadership opportunities, conference travel funding. If you're a grad school admissions committee, which looks better? 

Most importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end. Think about what you really want out of life. If the only thing keeping you going is the validation you get from the name on your diploma, seriously reevaluate your life. The competition for external validation doesn't end when you get to an elite college, **it only gets more intense.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9qfjl5/a_little_bit_of_perspective_from_a_21_yo_college/,2182,Basically you're disappointed you aren't a big fish in a small pond anymore? ,2018-10-22 16:41:34

428,cqakh4,False,,72,UPDATE: Applying to college with a 1.4 GPA.,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi everyone! I made a post last fall as a senior in HS regarding my low GPA, basically asking if I had a chance at getting into any school other than community college. I decided to log back on and update anyone who read my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9or8i0/14_gpa_do_i_have_any_chance_anywhere/) and/or cares.

I was able to get a fee waiver so I applied to ten schools. I emailed each school with a brief explanation of my circumstances and asked for my applications to be analyzed with more weight on my senior year grades than my previous three-years. Four schools told me they'll write a note about it in my file, three assured me that they review the applications holistically, and three straight up said no.

Out of the ten schools I applied to, I was accepted into two, waitlisted at two, and rejected from the other six. I interviewed with, and was accepted into a private school in my state with about an 82% acceptance rate. The second school I was accepted into has a 96% acceptance rate. One of the ones I was waitlisted to was my absolute top choice.

For a while, I considered attending the private school I got into, but I just didn't love it there, the campus feel wasn't for me and I'd have preferred a bigger school. The other one that I was accepted into is beautiful but across the country.

I decided to go with community college. I took 16 credits this summer with a 4.0, and recently began the Fall semester where I'm taking another 16. I'm applying to a few schools as a Spring 2020 transfer, including my top choice which I was previously waitlisted to, but I haven't decided for sure if I want to transfer this Spring or wait until Fall 2020.

For all those with low GPAs, for whatever reason, don't lose hope! I remember feeling so depressed about how low my GPA was. My high school was very competitive and had high standards, I used to see other girls crying in the library because their GPAs were 3.8s instead of 4.2. There is nothing wrong with community college or schools with high admission rates. If I was able to get accepted into two schools with a 1.4, you'll get into college.

I've had friends who only applied to matches and reaches for either undergrad or grad/med school because they were confident, but ended up getting rejected everywhere. Safeties can normally save you in the worst case scenario, so apply to safeties.

Getting my main point across, here's my experience with college decisions this year.

I'm a senior who initially decided to apply for Computer Science at UCs, Cal Poly SLO, USC, Harvey Mudd, and Brown. Around November of last year was when I had to choose which UCs I would apply to. I saw Davis, Irvine, and Santa Barbara as match schools, and I was confident that I would get into one of these schools. Maybe my GPA was a bit low, but my other stats could balance my application out. I selected the top 6 UCs and saw adding the ""lower-tiered"" ones as unnecessary because of how much money the applications costed, as well as the idea of prestige.

However, as I was finishing up my UC application on the final week of November, I felt an ominous gut feeling that told me to add UC Riverside and UC Santa Cruz to my list. I felt as though if I didn't include them, something terrible would happen. I didn't have a reason of why, but I didn't want to risk ignoring my gut feeling. Going back to my UC application, I added both of them as safeties and then submitted my application.

If I had ignore my instinct then, I wouldn't be in college right now.

Turns out that my safeties were my targets, and my targets were my reaches. I got accepted to both Riverside and Santa Cruz for Computer Science first, which made me feel relieved. However, after that was constant rejection from every other school. Got rejected from every other college I applied to, with a single waitlist from UC San Diego.

It hurts getting punched in the gut with 9 rejections in a row, and there are so many people on San Diego's waitlist that it's nearly impossible to get off. However, without my initial acceptances, I would be hurting much more inside, having to accept that I wouldn't be able to start on a campus my 1st year.

I'm glad that I'm lucky enough to get accepted in a college and get that gut feeling that changed my future for the next four years. I'm lucky that I'm going to a school where I love the environment and can focus on CS, a topic that I actually care about. For the next 4 years, I'm proud to say that I'll be attending UC Santa Cruz with plans to major in Computer Science.

Rising seniors and future years, regardless of how confident you are, how high your grades are, or what you have done, apply to safeties that you would enjoy going to, and make sure that your targets aren't actually reaches. College admissions is an incredibly random and competitive process. Sure, there are people who manage to get into college while applying to no safeties or even only reaches. However, don't risk trying that like what I nearly did. Add more safeties. Good luck, and do your best! 😃

You guys. 

Be real.

Don’t be ashamed of your awkward self. Some of y’all don’t have social skills because you’re not social, not because you tried hard in school. 

It’s so annoying to see this narrative of people feeling like they missed out on high school because they tried so hard at school. This isn’t real. You were weird or awkward or lacked any romantic finesse with the opposite/desires sex.

You’ll get into a good school, enroll, and then continue to be awkward. This won’t change. You are who you are. Embrace it. 

In a way, this should be comforting. Your lack of a social life is your own fault. Don’t blame your academic success on your miserable high school years. So if you don’t get into a good school, don’t mourn your lost high school experiences; you wouldn’t have had them anyway.

Second, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores).

#Part 7:  How To End An Essay Gracefully

Ending essays is hard, and most students struggle to end their essay elegantly.  Mistakes here can linger in the reviewer's mind and really bring down what might have otherwise been a strong essay.  They often seem to end:

**1.  Abruptly as if the word count snuck up on them** and tackled them from behind just as they were drawing a breath to continue.  Sometimes this is actually what happened and the student didn't edit very well (if this is you, see Part 5 linked above).  

**2.  By simply rehashing something that was already stated** – a casualty of the common yet misguided advice to make your point thrice over in your introduction, body, and conclusion.  Other times students turn to their academic BSing skills and just say the same things a slightly different way to fill out the word count.  If this sounds familiar, see Part 6 linked above.

**3.  With a trite aphorism or sweeping generality.**  Examples include phrases such as ""striving to achieve our full potential,"" ""making the world a better place,"" etc.  These are commonplace and lame, but worse, they say nothing about the student.  Instead, they make the AO instantly aware that the author is trying to make an impression with such a statement and it causes skepticism about the sincerity of everything they just read.  

#So how do you end an essay in a compelling and purposeful way?

Obviously you want to give the sense that the essay actually ended intentionally rather than being stifled by the word count or trailing off into awkward silence.  You also want to leave a final good impression.  You need to close gracefully, sincerely, and purposefully so they continue to feel positively about you and reward you with a top score.  Here are a few ideas - there are more in the full guide available on my site.  I'd love to hear any others you have in the comments.

#The Comedian's Call Back

I'm fond of the ""call back"" commonly used by comedians (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy)). You reference something from earlier in your essay to say one more thing about yourself. Sometimes this is something that you used to start the essay off. Other times it's something that was a major theme of the essay, a big part of the story you told, or a salient insight or twist on something you mentioned before.   

#The Interchapter

Another option is to depart from the story and inject something more about you. Examples of this in literature include the socialist meeting Jurgis stumbles upon at the end of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged.  You obviously don't have the space to elaborate here, so one or two sentences is probably enough.  You will want to work in a smooth transition though so it doesn't feel jilted or like it ""breaks the fourth wall.""  One example of a good way to do this is to end with a quote about you spoken by one of the characters in your story.

However you choose to end, try to show depth of thought, introspection, maturity, and humility.  Just like great stories, when you do this right, the AO finishes the essay wishing it had continued longer.  They want to know more about you and are intrigued by the personality you presented.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/c6mckh/how_to_end_an_essay_gracefully/,972,!remindme 330 days ,2019-06-28 16:34:19

664,dtml35,False,,54,"On all the ""philosophical"" admissions negativity...",ApplyingToCollege,"The admissions process isn't fun. That's just a fact. But lately I've been seeing all these posts on A2C criticizing the process in a philosophical/""deep"" way. I just wanted to address the trend. To the people who have been writing these: you're great writers, and I'm sure you'll go far in college and beyond. This isn't supposed to be a call-out post for you. I'm just trying to make the process a little better for everyone.
The admissions process might not be everyone's favorite thing (it sure isn't mine). Everyone has one part they hate more than the rest. For me, it's essays. I just can't seem to write them in the right way. For other people, it might be standardized testing, or ECs, or just schoolwork in general.

But here's the thing: **If you want to go to college, you have to apply.** There's no school that's going to magically show up at your door and offer you admission. If you want to go to college, you're in the application process right now. (If you haven't started your apps yet, close this window and open the common app.) If you're reading this, you probably want to go to college. So you have to apply. Yay! What does that mean? Cue the dramatic A2C posts...

*I've wasted the past 4 years working on homework and schoolwork in hard classes!*  
*I've spent time doing things I don't even care about just to look like a ""good student""*  
*I had to take this super pointless test a bunch of times and waste my time and money!*  
*And now colleges want me to reduce myself into 600 words!!!*

I used to say stuff like that too, until I realized three key things: 

1. If you hate the process, you're doing it wrong.  
You don't have to love the College Board, or enjoy taking the SAT. But if you hate your extracurriculars, you probably picked the wrong ones. If you hate spending time in class, now you know what subjects you shouldn't major in. If you absolutely hate writing your essay, change the topic! You're not trapped in the things you do. You haven't ""wasted your time"". You've gotten one step closer to college, and learned things you'll need to know in the future - even if it's just what you don't want to study. So when you go off to college, you'll be better prepared for it. And who knows, maybe you even had some fun along the way. You know, just a little. :)

2. It's really not that deep.  
Colleges aren't reducing you to 600 words or a 4 digit number, as much as it might feel like it. The essay isn't asking you to condense yourself into 600 words. Honestly, you're already in the application. Your ECs, transcript, recommendations, accomplishments, and maybe interview all tell enough of a story. The essay isn't forcing you to fit yourself in a text box. It's giving you the opportunity to put your own voice in the application, and just talk to the admissions officers.  
In the same way, the numbers aren't everything either. Colleges look at your SAT and GPA (but not really GPA, more the transcript) to make sure you're academically prepared. But for most schools, the stats don't make the decision. They're just one way you can show you're ready and you've accomplished a lot. That can also come through in your ECs and recommendations. Don't stress about the numbers. You're so much more, and colleges know it.

3. (the most important one) Complaining doesn't get anything done.  
I'm not saying you can't complain. Complaining is fine, and honestly it's healthy. But don't get yourself so worked up about the process as being ""horrible"" and ""unfair"" that you lose all motivation to work on your apps. I've been there. My friends used to go on and on about how awful the process was, and it made me lose some of my motivation to get them done. If you're positive about the process, you'll have so much more motivation, and writing those apps becomes so much easier. Just try it out for a couple days. You'll see the difference.

So just remember: The process isn't all that bad. It is what it is, and if you want to get to college, you have to make the most of it. Even though it's perfectly fine to complain, don't worry too much about how ""awful"" it is - just focus on how great your applications are going to be! :)

844,bgkuik,False,,179,Can I just give out an advice to all Americans who are planning to apply to college soon to give British schools (or overseas schools) a look. Especially if you are middle class.,ApplyingToCollege,"I’m an American, went to a top American high school, watched all my friends get into top American colleges, and I decided to go to London to study at one of the best schools. 

I was also trapped in that middle class problem. Too rich to quality for financial aid, too poor to afford college. 

Well British schools are significantly cheaper. Tuition is around 25k usd a year. And then you can choose where to live. No on site residence requirements. Also most degrees are three years long. And did I mention drinking age there is 18? And you get to experience another culture. 

Look into Oxbridge, UCL, KCL, LSE, and other top colleges. I guarantee you will love it as I have!!

My college counselors at my American school didn’t even tell me about British colleges, so I wish I had applied to more British schools in hindsight, but I’m so glad I came here. I just wanted to share that UK might be an option for you!!

EDIT: a lot of people here are saying that I’m being misleading by saying that tuition is cheaper. I only say that it is cheaper than the US if you don’t qualify for financial aid in the us and you want to go to a private school AND you want to still go to a prestigious school. For example, if you were to choose between Harvard full price vs Oxbridge full price (they are same level), Oxbridge will be much cheaper. For me, I chose between paying 65k USD a year for four years for mediocre American colleges vs. choosing to pay 40k USD a year for a top global university that carries a name.

Also can I just say that unfortunately there aren’t that many scholarship options for American students and I really recommend familiarizing yourself with the system as unfortunately, American college counselors have almost no clue as to how to navigate the UK system.  

Also for everyone telling me I’m giving out a bad advice because I say it is cheaper, well first of all, I’m not giving a bad advice. And all I’m saying is to take a look into it, familiarize yourselves, and perhaps something will change your mind. E.g. some British schools have now opened up common app so you don’t even have to apply UCAS. Also if you want to do medicine or law, you can apply straight into these degrees even though it may be hard to practice them in the USA once you get there degrees. Still something to THINK about. Please don’t roast me thx

EDIT again: https://www.studyacrossthepond.com/ is a helpful organization from what I have heard. I did not use them, but I have heard things.

EDIT again again: Clearly, I've rubbed some people the wrong way here. Sorry but I can't change the title and I am sorry if my understanding of middle class is different from yours. And sorry if the finance bit is triggering. Of course it depends on everyone's individual circumstances. For me, I did not do a STEM subject. My fee per year was 18,000 GBP when I started, which is a bit less than 25,000 USD today. I also managed to keep my yearly cost to 10,000 GBP, so all in all, I paid 40,000 USD for THREE years for tuition, room, and board. Considering how some schools are 60-70,000 USD for FOUR years, this was a very good option for me. And as other redditors have suggested here, if the UK is too expensive, check out other schools in Canada, Netherlands, etc!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgkuik/can_i_just_give_out_an_advice_to_all_americans/,989,UK is a big risk tho.

290,b11h76,False,,169,I just got a full ride and I'm stunned,ApplyingToCollege,"Going into this, I knew I fell into the awkward bracket of ""too poor to pay for college comfortably but too rich to recieve any good financial aid."" I was already terrified of the $100,000+ student loan debt horror stories.  Matters were made worse by the fact that I wanted to become a Veterinarian. I did the math of state college + state vet school, and was looking at potentially $300,000 worth of debt by the time I was 30. 

So I obsessively applied to colleges. I was desperate. In the end, I think I applied to around 40. State schools. Private schools with good financial aid programs. Literally every. single. school. that emailed me offering a free application. I was writing supplementals during my lunch period and waking up at 4am to revise. It consumed almost every moment of my first semester. 

On top of this, I was also applying to full ride scholarships. Literally any and all that were available. By the end of January, I'd written around 65 essays. 

I've been accepted into 25 so far. Decent scholarships, but not enough to graduate debt free, which was my ultimate goal. On the other end of the spectrum, I was rejected from every full ride I applied too. Except one.
 
I had to fly to another state for an interview, conpeting against 100 other finalists. Here's where I started to panic. I'm autistic. Wasn't diagnosed until the second semester of junior year, but it's very obvious when you speak to me that something's off. I'd read the interview advice tips, practiced mock-interviews, but after I interviewed I was convinced I'd bombed it. I was too robotic/soft-spoken/antsy, didn't make enough eye contact, weirded them out, etc, while everyone else seemed so charming and funny and naturally well-spoken. I had no chance. 

And I got the phone call today. All four years, full-tuition paid. For once in my life, I didn't screw up. I did it. I fucking did it. My future is mine to mess up, and I couldn't be happier.

590,hac2u8,False,Serious,52,A message to underclassmen: please choose the right friends.,ApplyingToCollege,"In light of me (finally) being a senior and starting college apps, I just wanted to put out a word of advice for any underclassmen out there. Please, please, please choose the right friends in high school. And I don’t just mean your typical “stay away from bad kids” advice. Choose people that will lift you up and motivate you in a POSITIVE way. 

I don’t know if it’s just me, but I barely ever hear anyone talking about how important it is to give yourself the correct type of motivation in high school. Imo, one of the biggest mistakes I made was filling my surroundings with negative motivation and not positive motivation. Friends are people who hype you up and motivate you to challenge yourself because *you feel confident*, not people who make you do something because *you feel incompetent compared to them*. It’s good to look up to people, but it’s super important to recognize that line where self-motivation becomes self-criticism ESPECIALLY in high school, where people can get super competitive and toxic. Chances are, if you feel like you’re playing a never-ending catch-up game and being put down for your class choice/grades/test scores, it’s negative for you. 

Unfortunately, the college application process is hyper competitive. That being said, look for friends who value having fun just as much as they value academics. Personally, I made the mistake of surrounding myself with people who cared about nothing but college admissions, and it made my junior year miserable. I was stuck prepping for AP exams all day and didn’t have any time to do, you know, regular teenage stuff. To this day I haven’t been to a single concert, gone to the beach with my friends, or gone on a shopping trip with them. This might sound silly, but trust me. Having fun in high school is just as important as studying and taking the SAT. Getting into an Ivy or T20 is not the whole world, and while it’s important to work hard/aim high leave some downtime for yourself too. 

That’s all I have to write for now. I realize that this might sound a bit cynical, but I just wanted to write this out and clear it off my mind before I start college apps. Peace ✌🏼

EDIT: Wow thank you for the upvotes and award! I didn’t foresee this happening, but thanks so so much.

EDIT: A second award?! You guys are really generous. Some ppl brought up really good points that I think are worth reiterating: As it is with basically everything in life, it’s important to find the right balance of both fun AND academics in high school.

I would consistently show up late or occasionally skip school, and I only started working on assignments the night before they were due. I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties. 

&#x200B;

I ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about. More importantly, I found the motivation to work hard and go the extra mile because I was sick of not living up to my own expectations. 4 years later, and now I'm the first person from my department to ever attend MIT.

483,fznzys,False,Fluff,42,my backpack predicted the end of high school!,ApplyingToCollege,"Just thought I'd share this (kind of) cool story with this sub, you guys have all been so helpful to me! When I was in the seventh grade my mom bought me a backpack after my previous one had ripped. Now I was beyond excited to have this backpack as it was the kind that had so many pockets you forgot where they all were and whistle that you could blow on if you ever found yourself lost in the woods and nice reflective patches that glowed under the street lamps when you made your daily walk to the bus stop. I had become very attached to this backpack over the years, not just because of its physical attributes, but also because it remained the only reliable thing in my life. This backpack was there for me when I got bullied by the mean boys on the back of the bus for not being good enough, it was there when I had rushed to the hospital after school to find that my younger sibling was diagnosed with brain cancer, it was there when I started high school, it was there when I had lunch alone in the bathroom stalls, it was there when I threw up on the kid in front of me's head waiting in line, and it was there for so many tiny, but life-defining experiences. Though a month and a half ago as I was walking, I felt something round hit the back of my leg. I looked down and found the mandarin orange I had thrown in my backpack earlier that morning. After further inspection, I was distraught to find a big, threads hanging, completely irreparable hole at the bottom of my backpack. I called customer service, then the store I had bought it from, only to find that there was nothing I could do. My backpack couldn't be saved and I would have to finish the last 3 months of highschool using a tote bag or whatever else I could find. I had hoped to end my academic journey thus far with this backpack, do the kind of symbolic send-off that only happens in feel-good paperbacks. Three days later school was canceled because of COVID-19, and two days ago I was informed that school would be closed for the end of the year, marking the official end of my high school career. I just found it kind of oddly sweet, a little nod from the universe, the ""death"" of my backpack almost directly coincided with the ""death"" of highschool for me (and for all of us). I don't know if I'm reaching and maybe it's just a simple coincidence, but I just felt compelled to share the nice story of my oracle backpack amidst everything that's going on. I hope everyone's doing well :)

Answer these and you'll be prepared for any college interview.,ApplyingToCollege,"This is what I tell my kids that I  interview each year. And I'm very forthcoming with them from the initial  phone call/text/communication of the ""questions"" that I ask. They're  not really questions but they are objectives.

Tell me about your background and what you're interested in studying.

(I  personally don't care about why Stanford because you wrote about that  on your app presumably. Most interviewers will care so you need to have a  very solid, specific answer to that which goes beyond the academics but  gets into fit more than anything else.)

Tell  me what's not on your application that you want to share with the  admissions staff. This is your last shot to communicate with them so  make it count. Tell me about additional context or more detail on your  accomplishments or weaknesses. Family circumstances, health issues,  mental health crises, anything. I want it all and the kitchen sink because this is  the gold that helps make you more human to the admissions committee.  This is where we spend most of the time. In my interviews it is 50% of  the interview. We both brainstorm what else we want to add to strengthen  your app.

What are your questions  about Stanford? I tell them that I only answer questions that aren't  googlable so don't be offended if I shoot your question down just move  on to another one. Hint: asking me questions that involve my opinion or  make me think a little bit are useful.

So  I tell my kids everything I've written above to you. Total  transparency. I don't want to know your stats but I do ask where else  you apply because I give them feedback on the culture of those schools  and whether they think it's a fit for them.

I'm  not the norm but I am one of the university's most experienced  interviewers and I have developed my own method that works well for me  and adds something to the application. I hope that others in the future  will follow suit with the transparency aspect.

If  you can answer these confidently you'll be prepared for any college interview.

I  go into it with the attitude of being your advocate rather than another  person to judge you. I want to share my experience and help you as much  as I possibly can and I often stay in touch with my kids forever  regardless of the outcome.

Sure, you should prep yourself for possible questions by thinking on it and maybe brainstorming your response, but wouldn't it be better to set aside all notes during the interview and just talk? I think that would humanize the applicant a great deal more than reading off a script. Also, do you think that's something I could do? It's not that I'm trying to skimp on work, I just don't have a lot of confidence in my ability to stand out otherwise. ",2019-11-07 15:24:09

I am an incoming college freshman. Before I tell you where I am going, here are my stats:

SAT: 1230
ACT: 25
GPA: 4.2

I came from a low income household, so much so to the point where I was supporting myself my last year of high school, working insane hours to pay for my college application fees, graduation cap and gown, etc. 

I hated school until I was in sophomore year, when a teacher told me if I didn't get my shit together, I wouldn't graduate. I started to study, and actually cared about the grades I got. The only access to a computer I had at the time was to the public library. I actually transferred high schools, because I wanted to become more academically driven at a college prep school (despite the rumors from classmates that I got expelled from my previous school). 

The highest job my mom ever held was a shift supervisor at Carl's Jr. The highest job my (long gone) dad ever held was a drug dealer. 

I worked 6 months prior on my essays to colleges, and worked so hard for my extracurriculars that I had 500+ hours of community service. 

I got rejected from these colleges: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, UC Berkeley, Cal Poly SLO, San Diego State, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, USC. 

The three I got accepted to:

CSUN, Cal State Long Beach, **UCLA.**

I got accepted as a Biology major, and am attending this fall. So if you think you have a zero percent chance, that is bullshit. The college decisions are wack- of course you have a chance.

If you are in the mix and have the stats and have a chance to afford it, you've got to apply. You owe it to yourself to take your shot and while you are likely to be rejected, you gave yourself a shot.

My father and I both graduated from MIT and my kids were hit hard when they got rejected, but they were in the arena and had a legitimate chance to make it. 1960s MIT was very different from 1980s MIT, which was very different from today's MIT, but I would have done anything to have my kids go there.

That being said, you shoot your shot and you make the best of where you end up. There is way too much emphasis on picking your 'fit' in advance. More emphasis should be placed on resilience and deciding that where you end up is the 'right' place. Lay your acceptances out in front of you and pick the best academic/financial/future prospects place for you and the \*decide\* that your choice will be your future.

Make it your place for success.

My son ended up transferring out of Purdue. My Daughter is navigating the virus at Michigan, but I am confident that they are both finding their way through the vagaries of life, starting in college. Life will never follow your plan. You are best served by picking your best option at the given time and planning to adapt to what life presents to you.

In an official statement released to the press, Harvard, representing the League, explained that ""Cornell had failed to maintain the humanities and liberal arts focus necessary to stay in the League"".

Cornell supporters were devastated, claiming that this decision was an attack against Cornell's high acceptance rate and its mission to educate the masses. The Institutes of Technology - MIT, Caltech, GeorgiaTech - watched as the debacle unfolded. Together, they decided that they would do something to right the wrong. 

On a Tuesday morning, Cornell received a phone call, ""Hi Cornell, it's MIT. We have some things to discuss...""

Cornell arrived at The Conference. Inside, sat MIT, Caltech, and GeorgiaTech. ""We've brought in some powerhouses to help us with what we're about to do"", MIT announced.

Carnegie Mellon entered the room. UC Berkeley entered the room. Stanford entered the room. 

A document was passed around, gaining signatures from each of the schools. On it, read ""The reign of the Ivy-League ends today.""

On September 1st, 2025, the Techvy League declared war on the Ivy League, flooding the airwaves with billions of negative attack ads.

During the 2025-2026 admission season, acceptance rates for each of the Ivy League institutions rose to an all-time high while acceptance rates for the Techvy League institutions fell to a record low. Slowly but surely, Ivy League alumni stopped providing donations to their alma maters, and endowments at each of the Ivy League schools began to dwindle. 

By 2033, 8 years after the war had started, the Ivy League surrendered. Running out of money and no longer able to fill their freshman classes, the Ivy League had come to the end of the road. Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, and Columbia had already boarded up their campuses while Harvard, Princeton, and Yale pleaded for mercy. None was granted.

671,gwl8f4,False,Serious,66,The school I applied to 2 months late became the school I’m now committed to,ApplyingToCollege,"Just something I was thinking about that I wanted to share in case anyone else found it interesting or whatever. It might look long but I rlly don’t think it’s a terrible read 🥺 read if u would like, The title is basically the TL;DR

I live in California so it was expected of me to apply to 4 UCs and 4 CSUs. I did that and also applied to Stanford, USC, and Cornell (uw gpa 3.2, w gpa 3.7, sat score 1210) I had no chance of getting into most of these schools. My only match schools were the CSUs I applied to and one of the UCs.

ANYWAYS, fast forward to college decision season and I was rejected from all of these schools (except 3 CSUs). I made a dummy mistake and literally chose the CSUs at random because I thought for sure I’d get into just one UC and everything would be chill. But I was bombarded with rejection after rejection from all these schools and I just kept thinking “it’s okay there are still more decisions to come out!” And then the final rejection letter came. It was from UCLA and I cried for like 2 hours straight over it and I had to leave the group chat for a few days because my friend got in to UCLA and I was so sad about everything. I thought my essays really gave me a chance and it sucked that not one school I wanted wanted me back.

I started looking into community college, and 2 community colleges near me are feeders into UCLA for transfer students. But then I came to reddit and saw a giant list of schools that are still accepting applications off rolling admissions. I had no clue schools were still accepting so I looked through and googled them and applied to some more. Off rolling admissions I applied to DePaul, Pitt, and Penn State. I was accepted to all of these schools but had to decline Penn state and Pitt because of financial aid.

I decided I wanted to apply to more schools in case DePaul didn’t work out, so I used the college search feature on college board’s website and found Syracuse University in NY. It was the last school I applied to. I actually applied to this school 2 months after their deadline, they weren’t accepting off rolling admissions. I applied to this school and like a month and a half later I got an acceptance letter into the exact program I applied to. DePaul never ended up giving me my financial aid package, and I was bummed because it was my first choice and I had grown a little bit attached to it, but Syracuse is an amazing school and they offered me amazing financial aid. I was offered about $60k in grants and $10k in loans, but I can always apply for scholarships or save up money from work study, summer jobs, or whatever so that I don’t have to take out loans after this year. And I don’t have to make any payments at all!! Which is so amazing because my family can’t afford to make any payments for college right now. Their housing and tuition deposits combined totaled $950 and they waived both of them for me, so I was able to commit for free! It was a huge weight off my shoulders because I couldn’t cough up $950.

Ik I could’ve made this a lot shorter, but I just wanted to add some extra details that maybe someone here could relate to. It’s funny that the last school I applied to (2 months late) wasn’t even accepting rolling admissions but it became the School I’m committed to. I just thought it was a little interesting and also I wanted to use this as an opportunity to tell people not to give up right away, unless you’re fine with how things turned out. But if you’re unhappy with what schools you were accepted to, just try to apply to some more. Maybe even apply to these schools that have rolling admissions EARLY, so that you have backups before the big schools’ decisions come out. Don’t just give up. If you’re fine with or happy to go to a smaller state school or community college, then of course do it! But if you’re a person that just really wants a shot at a larger 4 year, or a school maybe a little further from home, there will be schools accepting applications, and some of them are amazing schools with great financial aid! You just gotta put yourself out there and know not to give up because it really isn’t over until you say it’s over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gwl8f4/the_school_i_applied_to_2_months_late_became_the/,1162,"Hey!

Hey everyone! Last week I posted on here asking for you guys to fill out a survey of pretty much everything about you guys -- colleges applied to and results, demographics, stats, etc. Well, after 15 hours of going through all the data, I'm proud to present the r/A2C Class of 2023 Profile.

Some quick stats for you guys:

- There were 605 individual applicants who applied to a combined 397 colleges (amounting to 5,224 individual applications). 44 states and 32 countries are represented (Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Wyoming, Idaho, and Mississippi people wya?).

- From those applications, 2,732 of them were accepted, 1,724 rejected, and 711 waitlisted.

- A whopping 27.5% of us are from California; the next two states with the most representation are New York with 7.5% and Massachusetts with 5.6%.

- Our overall acceptance rate was 52.3%, 21.3% of deferred applications were accepted, and our T20 acceptance rate was 23.4%.

- There was a total of 770 different pieces of advice submitted to aid the current juniors and future classes.

- The most popular colleges to apply to were UCLA (169), UC Berkeley (162), and Stanford (145). Similarly, the most matriculated to universities were Undecided (109), UC Berkeley (32), and Stanford (19).


[The infographic I made is a bit more in-depth \(and prettier\), so be sure to check that out here.

There was no way I could go through all the advice on my own, so after cleaning it of toxicity, I put them all in a Google Sheets document.

I just got into the scholarship program of my dream

As a broke international student withouth any parental support, this is literally a dream come true. At a point I thought that I wasn't even going to go to college. 

I can't thank the /r/A2C community enough. 

My school literally doesn't have a college counselor because so many of us fail to even graduate high school, and navigating this whole American college process withouth a counselor was something I never thought I could do. I could barely afford taking one SAT test, let alone expensive private counselling.

222,fp1o6k,False,Shitpost Wednesdays,43,BREAKING NEWS: Northeastern University decides to just not do decisions this year,ApplyingToCollege,"In a truly unprecedented move, Northeastern University has decided to not bother finishing to read their remaining Regular Decision applications and revoke admission from all those accepted in the early rounds.

""We deeply regret to inform all our potential applicants that we will no longer be able to send them short, impersonal letters this year."" noted Assistant Dean of Admissions Stefanie Kane. ""It was lots of fun sending them confusing and vague emails about our decision date, though. The funniest part? We weren't releasing decisions in the first place this year!"" Kane also scoffed at the idea of institutional oversight and transparency. ""We only hope our decisions release process is as nonsensical and sporadic as the University of Michigan's. The website crash in January simply wasn't enough."" 

Experts suggest that the move may have been an effort by Northeastern to manage their yield and US News ranking. ""If you don't accept anyone, your yield rate automatically rises to 100%."" noted many high school seniors disguised as college admissions experts. Additionally, Northeastern's ranking is projected to rise significantly next year, making it competitive with similarly named institutions such as Northwestern, the South Eastern Conference, and Southwestern Missouri Community College. 

Many A2C members were at first inconsolable, but soon realized that they didn't want to ""fuckin attend a school named after a direction anyways"" and it was all ""yield protection"".

If you really think about it, life is exactly like a burrito. We all hide our true selves from the world with a wrapped-up covering. But inside, we host a plethora of fascinating offerings: cheese, rice, beans, chicken, and so much more. Inside my own burrito, I have my artistic eye and my caring heart. Those might constitute my beans and cheese. But someone else's cheese might be their love of surfing or their ability to speak ten languages. In conclusion, we should all unwrap our burritos and let the rice and beans spill out into a messy pile.

**The sports injury essay**

It was the day of the big game. I had been preparing my whole life to play on that field that day. Sweat dripped down my face as I ran the warmup laps with my team. Suddenly I felt a horrible pain in my leg and I realized that I had stubbed my toe. ""NO!"" I gasped. ""Not on the day of the big game!""

Coach looked solemnly at me. ""Your career is over,"" he said. ""You can't play in the big game now.""

Suddenly his phone rang. He picked it up and frowned with concern. ""Oh no! Our star player has just come down with the flu and won't be able to play. Now we don't have enough players for the big game. We're going to have to forfeit.""

A burst of adrenaline coursed through my veins. ""No, we won't,"" I said, standing up resolutely. ""I'm going to play.""

Coach looked at me in awe.

That game I played like I had never played before, fighting through my agony for the team. Despite the unimaginable pain of my toe, I found it in me to score the winning goal. As I held the golden trophy above my head, I proudly realized that my hard work had gotten me here. Because, as Abraham Lincoln always said, winners never quit.

**The ""thesaurus"" essay**

I cherish to acquire comprehension in school, thus perusing volumes is my preoccupation. My incarnation is blithesome because I am disclosing new atmospheres and modes of quintessence. This scintillating diversion alleviates all malaises and obfuscations through elucidation. Whereas herein lies my denouement: construing utilization is my zeal.

**The sob story essay**

My life was never easy. I was born at a very young age, and was immediately plunged into hardship. I should have had a 4.9 GPA, however my numerous struggles have understandably resulted in my 1.7 GPA.

It all started with a birthday gift of AirPods. Unfortunately I received them just a week before the new AirPods 3 came out and everyone noticed my old-model AirPods and called me broke. Dear reader, the only thing broke was my heart. I couldn't even activate Siri with my model. However, I dusted myself off and trudged onwards. The next obstacle would be the one to shoot down my dreams. I had long hoped to launch a successful career as an Instagram influencer. With high hopes and my heart in my throat, I posted a selfie. To my horror, it received a measly 3 likes. This has wounded my spirit irreparably and I have since been struggling to cope. Obviously schoolwork has had to wait while I turn my attention to dealing with my greater problems.

**The overly descriptive essay**

At 6:35 am, I wake up and look at the lavender shade of my walls - not quite blue, not quite pink - and breathe in deeply. If my room were a clock, I have a periodic table poster above my closet at 3 o'clock, a world map slightly to the right of my desk at 9 o'clock, and a certificate for my work in cancer research at 11 o'clock. As I get up, I am aware of the white paint on my door and the soft fluff of my beige rug. Today is a cold day, about 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3333 degrees Celsius. I slip on my puffy green winter jacket and my bright red Nikes and step outside onto the cracked gray sidewalk. As I walk, I glance at a small brown squirrel darting across the long black power line. Soon it is time for school, where I will fill my inquisitive mind with knowledge and apply my bountiful observational skills.

**The inspirational service trip essay**

Through my service trip to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\], I learned that helping others is good. This led to the realization that service is my passion. That is why I will be perfect for helping others by being a doctor/lawyer/CS programmer. As soon as I arrived in a poorer country with my $2,500 summer program, I started to miss the clean streets of my Silicon Valley neighborhood. But I took pictures with local children and followed my tour group around, so now I know just what it means to dedicate oneself to service. Here's the funny thing: I went to \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] to help others, but what I didn't know is that they had helped me. Due to the five days that I spent in \[INSERT COUNTRY HERE\] I have become more caring and aware and humble. These are all qualities that I will bring to the UC Hicago/St. Anford campus.

**The ""intellectual curiosity"" essay**

For as long as I can remember, I have always asked ""why?"" to everyone around me. As a child, I practically lived in libraries, carrying wagons of encyclopedias home every night. I blew through sixty books a day, and even that wasn't enough for my thicc brain. I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that could never be satisfied, not by Einstein's treatises on relativity, not by the Feynman physics lectures. By the age of three, I was writing academic papers with my crayons. In conclusion, I have am quite a curious intellectual. Harvard, please let me in.

I have been attending reunions, football and soccer games, and other events on campus since before I can remember. I even met Elon Musk, one of my idols, there. I’ve been wearing Stanford sweatshirts since 4th grade and my house is littered with Stanford shit. At a very young age, I made it my goal to attend the school, and as I grew up, I fell deeper in love with it and envisioned my life there. Stanford was my dream school in every sense of the word. 

Yesterday, I was rejected. Obviously, I didn’t expect to get in, but the rejection was initially painful nonetheless.

As time passed and I gained distance from the news, a few things crossed my mind. Anyone who has or will face a college rejection should consider these things:
- As we travel through life, we find ourselves facing forks in the road at important moments. One of these roads was just blocked. I have little doubt that the path we find ourselves on will be more beautiful than we ever could’ve imagined, and that we will be incredibly grateful for the rejection in the long run.
- We know our accomplishments. We know how hard we’ve worked. We know how good of a friend we are, the joy and laughter we bring to others, the contributions we make in and out of the classroom. Don’t let a college be the source of your validation. Recognize the things that make you awesome, and understand that the amazing people in your life are a reflection of who you are. 
- Just because we didn’t get in doesn’t mean we aren’t smart or accomplished enough to do well there or that we aren’t smarter or harder working than the people who go there. Considering the other people from my school who got in, I know that for a fact lol.

I thought I'd share it again this year to console all you seniors about your rejections. I'm on a new account because I couldn't log into my throwaway account again.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. \*\*Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.\*\*Sure, there are some exceptions.

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.**(There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some high school students say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.

&#x200B;

Edit from this year: A sophomore at Stanford who's kinda Twitter famous had this one tweet that read:

***Elite universities are pillars of a colonial past, present, and future. Institutions like st\*nford, h\*rvard, etc. are not meant to mold free thinkers, only the next generation of capitalists & imperialists.***

Think about that the next time you see a Stanford or Harvard grad proclaiming to do good for the world in their college apps only to do a complete 180 flip (\*cough [pete buttigieg](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete) cough\*).

196,fuzm72,False,Rant,116,UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions,ApplyingToCollege,"Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of ""influencers"" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the ""SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!"" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...


**""What really got me into x university was...""** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?

**""What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!""** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should ""focus on your extracurriculars!""?

**""I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!""** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you ""write nice,"" I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score. 

More and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical ""HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY"" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: ""Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school."" That is it.

 It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fuzm72/unpopular_opinion_being_accepted_to_a_t20_doesnt/,2169,Lol I didn’t read ur post and I’m kinda stoned but I do have my admittance to Stanford last year. Tbh idk why I’m still on this sub but the truth is I spent so much time being a good student and the SATs because the odds were stacked against me. Being an asian applying to elite schools from the Bay Area is tough but it was tougher that my parents didn’t go to college and I didn’t grow up with elite resources. I only needed the determination and grit to try my hardest.

989,8a1fkl,False,,108,"Fuck my 1600; or, why I wish my parents had made learn the violin.",ApplyingToCollege,"Around this time, most of you have probably gotten your results back. Some of you are disappointed. Some of you are pleasantly surprised. And a very small, elite bunch of you are absolutely over the moon. But let's stop talking about you and start talking about someone I know much better.

Me.

Not too long ago, I fit into that third category. Yup, a perfect 1600. I don't know everything there is to know about this godforsaken test. Lord knows I practically guessed between the best two responses on a couple reading questions. And I actually made a mistake in the writing (blessed be thy curve). Hell, I did awful on the essay: a 6/3/5.

But hey, I got a 1600!

And I'll tell you a little secret... You know how when you're in the shower, fantasizing about whatever little thing, and you start playing that scene in your head, of hitting f5 on your keyboard, seeing that stupid acorn cb logo pop up, and then seeing the number in front of your eyes...

...It's fucking amaaaazing. Probably the single happiest moment of my life, pathetic as that might sound. Texting your friends, calling your family. Hearing your mom in the other room calling her friends saying ""Oh, the SAT? Oh, he did well. Very well, he actually got a perfect score. No, really. Yeah, a 1600."" As much as I had hyped myself up for that, it still exceeded my expectations.

Of course, that's nothing but a honeymoon period, and I was well aware of it. Life goes on, there's chem exams to worry about, and before you know it, you almost forget. But, there is one thing that sticks.

The ego.

But not any kind of ego. It's the feeling of confidence.

You see that kid over there? He plays basketball. Well. Meanwhile, I can't even do five push-ups without being sore for a week.

But, hey.

You got a 1600. He didn't.

Is it pathetic? Yeah. But it really, really helps. It's not that I lack confidence. It's not even that I'm insecure. It's just that I'm a narcissistic piece of shit. And hearing that voice inside my head is rather soothing.

Flash forward only a few weeks. I decide I should take the AMC 12, despite barely knowing it exists until some two weeks before the test day. Alright, I tell myself, Of course, this is a hard test. But I'm a fucking god at math, aren't I? Of course I am. Math is the one thing I'm better at than anything else. I'm the best person I know at math. I need to be in the top 5%. Small fry! I was in the top 0.03% for the SAT, and that's half reading, which I'm nowhere near as good at.

I got an 82.5. Respectable score, of course. But not even close to AIME qualifying. My mom told me I shouldn't think twice about it- Anyone doing well on this test studied for it for months, like I did for the SAT. I only did for a couple weeks. But still, I felt insulted. I'm BioticAsari-fucking-Babe. I fucking drink math for brunch, bitch! How the hell did I stare at a geometry problem for 15 minutes and come up with no good ideas for how to solve it? Am I dumb? Am I just not meant for math? I hope to god not. If I can't do math well, I can't think of anything that I can do any better. The notion of someone out there being better than me at Math drives me up the wall.

I move on.

Last week I went to a chamber concert. It was a piano quartet by Brahms, followed by a piano quartet by Walton. The Brahms left something to be desired- the violin was a tad loud, and the piano was a tad quiet. The Walton, though, was beautiful. It had this grand sense of theme and space. Gorgeously played. I can't help but think to myself- I'll never play like that. Sure, by the time I'm their age, I might play half-decent. But I won't be a virtuoso. Chances are, I'll never be a virtuoso.

Yesterday I was watching a video by this chess guy. It was about this 13-year old German kid who beat several grandmasters to win the Grenke open. Damn. I hear him again. I won't be that good when I'm 70.

I've been feeling two feelings lately, that I don't think I had ever felt before. The first is envy.

I had felt material envy. I had felt envy for my friends for all having phones when I didn't own one until I turned 17. I had felt envy for my friends for having driver's licenses when I don't because my parents can't afford the insurance. But this was a different kind of envy. A personal envy.

I didn't envy these people for what they had. I envied these people for what they could do.

What a bizarre feeling that is.

I envied the violist because she could play the viola. I want to play the viola. I envied the cellist, because he could play the cello. I want to play the cello. I envied the pianist, because he could play the piano. I can play the piano. But not very well. And I lack the time or money to truly pursue it to the point of playing even as a pro-am. I envied the chess kid, for playing chess like a god at his age. To my comfort, I'm sure many envy him. Even chess grandmasters, who know they weren't as good as him when they were his age, and he'll be much better than they are when he's their age. But I still envy him. And I still envy those kids that got into the AIME.

I'd like to comfort myself by saying it isn't fair. That they're somehow better off. But that's not true. They just spent more time practicing than I did. I would know- that's how I got a 1600 on the SAT.

The second feeling is contempt.

It isn't contempt for my father, for working upwards of 60 hours a week, practically breaking his back, all for what amounts to little more than peanuts- and all just out of his unending love for his family, which I am eternally grateful for. It isn't contempt for my mom, for being the best mother she could despite being in effectively 24/7 pain the last 8 years due to medical issues. It's not contempt for my grandfather, who was an awful father to mine (and a marginally better grandfather, at that.) It isn't even contempt for my uncle, who's got a million or two sitting on the dow, and who hasn't once offered to, say, I don't know, take me through Italy wine tasting.

I'ts contempt for me.

But not the me of now.

The me of later.

Why? Because I feel like a slave to him. Of course I will never be a piano virtuoso. But he might. So it is for him that I learn the piano. Of course I'm not smart enough to qualify for the AIME. But he might. So I buy 50 dollars worth of AoPS books, and study them on end.

But why must I do everything for him?

I've never even met the guy!

For all I know, he's an ass. Maybe he looks down on me not with pride but with shame. To think, that I was ever such an ungrateful child.

Why can't I make a hundred grand?! Not him, the me of ""the future.""

But me! I want my Wikipedia article, dammit. I want to be good at things! I want to write the Beethoven's 9th of the 21st century- BioticAsariBabe's 1st. I want to find the non-trivial zero to the Rieman-Zeta function with an imaginary component other than 1/2.

And I remind myself that he might. Maybe he will do all these things and more. But god, this whole process has made me hate him. I got a 1600 so that he can get into Stanford. I spend an hour at my shitty 90-dollar keyboard so that he might one day play the Emperor Concerto.

The men and women who have effected change or beauty (or disaster, even) in the human civilization did not do it by getting a perfect score on a standardized exam. Why can't I be them? Not him. ME!

Fuck my 1600.

I would gladly toss it to the curb if it meant I could truly do something well.

Edit: before someone mentions it: no, this is not an Asian parenting thing. Both my parents are extremely proud of me and have expressed that if anything, I should go a little easier on myself. Also: I definitely meant to title this post ""made *me* learn the violin.""

In elementary school you called me thick-headed and hopeless. And no, not out of friendly teasing as you insist today. You'd watch me in legitimate disgust. 

In middle school I worked my hardest to please you and my father and it resulted in OCD towards school assignments and grades. I strived to be the perfect student. As a result I because anxious and shut everyone out of my life. At which point i was no longer thick-headed but instead you called me anti-social, awfully nerdy, a loner, pestered me on my weight (i was a ""whopping"" 80 pounds just btw.. wtf even), my looks, how i dressed, and decided i was just outright strange. 

My self esteem plummeted and by high school my grades dropped (I know- great timing right). The stellar student in me became a shell of what i once was. Now to you I have been distracted and academically challenged. Whenever we'd drive around Seattle by one of my reach schools (in-state) you'd laugh and say ""Look, it's the school you'll never get into"". You insisted i'd have to attend community college. 

Today I got into that reach school we would drive by, University of Washington.

591,fst2i9,False,CollegeBoard Discussion,43,CollegeBoard is the best organization ever. Here’s why.,ApplyingToCollege,"I just want to show my enthusiasm for this amazing new sponsorship for A2C. Here are my top 7(I have to go to bed soon so I can’t list all 696 reasons) on why CollegeBoard is the absolute best thing to happen to us.

1: They are a nonprofit. We know as fact that the $80 registration fees for the SAT and AP tests are put to good use. And the $800 million they earn each year is of course used for scholarships and other wonderful causes.

2: They provide an excellent test to determine our readiness for college. Scoring a 1600 shows my superiority over someone with a meek 1580. The only reason I didn’t get into Harvard was because I only scored a 790 in the SAT Gender Studies Subject Test.

3: AP courses are the best way to prepare us for college. Who cares if taking 13 AP classes in one year damages us psychologically? At least we’ll be ready to thrive at SUNY Ithaca.

4: They are brilliant for introducing curves onto a standardized test to help all of us out. -30 for one question in Math is an awesome implementation.

5: They reuse tests to save money, which is used for all the wonderful causes I mentioned earlier.

6: When they accidentally screwed up the June 2018 SAT, they didn’t refund anybody. In fact, they didn’t even apologize. This shows that they were too busy working on fixing the issue that they didn’t even have time to refund or apologize.

7: It’s so wonderful that we get to send scores to colleges directly from collegeboard! And it’s free, too, if you decide to send it before you actually receive your scores.

So there it is! CollegeBoard is the best organization I have ever encountered in my 18 depressing years here on this planet. A true non-profit, and I can’t wait for the amazing things they will bring to r/ApplyingToCollege .",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fst2i9/collegeboard_is_the_best_organization_ever_heres/,1258,"1600 over 1580?

I have reminded him countless times that they were supposed to be due on the 1st but nope still nothing.

1. He only teaches maybe 3-4 classes, meaning he has 4-5 free periods
2. Every time I've asked him, he tells me ""he'll do it by the end of the day""

How do you feel about introducing my (eventually) 14-year-old to this sub?

What leads me to reject the *llaissez faire* approach are the kids saying ""I got rejected by all the top 10 colleges I applied to"" and ""I can't afford to go to any of the schools that accepted me"" and (in a related sub) ""I got a 1240 on the SAT, how do I get into the 1500s in three weeks?"". 

IMO, it's good to start early so kids have time to learn what they need to succeed on the SAT and college application process. My focus with my 12-year-old is on getting him to read a lot, which I don't do by fiat but by explaining how that will help him and by providing him books he enjoys reading.

Jori Johnson took the practice SAT test as a high-school student  outside Chicago. Brochures later arrived from Vanderbilt, Stanford,  Northwestern and the University of Chicago.

The universities’  solicitations piqued her interest, and she eventually applied. A few  months later, she was rejected by those and three other schools that had  sought her application, she said. The high-school valedictorian’s test  scores, while strong by most standards, were well below those of most  students admitted to the several schools that had contacted her.

“A lot of the rejections came on the same day,” said Ms.  Johnson, a 21-year-old senior film major at New York University, one of  three schools that accepted her out of 10 applications. “I just stared  at my computer and cried.”

The recruitment pitches didn’t help Ms. Johnson, but they did benefit the universities that sent them.

777,d1hmal,False,,77,a message to those applying to college right now,ApplyingToCollege,"hey, seniors. i know it’s a really stressful time of the year and it feels like your entire life depends on how to gift wrap all the hard work you did the past several years..

i was in your shoes a year ago. damn, i depended my life on college admissions and applications. it’s all i talked about, it’s all my “friends” talked about, it’s all my parents talked about. 

as if it’s life or death. terminologies like t20, t10, legacy, scores, ranking, fafsa,..all of it stressed the shit out of me.

it felt like if i don’t get into a certain level of a school then i’m pretty much fucked for life or something, you know? like if i don’t get into a t10 i’ll think, fuck, i could’ve been this or that and now i’ll never get that chance. just because i missed 30 points on the sat and didn’t get this score, just because i didn’t stay up the extra couple hours to study for the ap exams. 

but honestly, although i’m only a freshman at uni now, i don’t think that’s the case. it definitely is not. 

&#x200B;

your school and the value is what you make of it. sure, the label of a prestigious school can help. but what’s more important is the experience and the quality of it. 

and once you go to the school you choose, you won’t think back and hate yourself for not studying harder for the sat’s or ap’s or revising your essays more. you’ll be so caught up in the moment trying to make most of what you have in front of you and as long as you make it really worth it for you, it’ll be worth so much more than being accepted into some ivy or a goal school of yours. 

because from now you are focusing on what’s ahead of you and what you have now. and by all means, try your hardest to get into the school that you want to go to. don’t hold yourself back. what i’m trying to say is, don’t stress so much about what you could miss out on. focus on what you got. don’t look at what other’s have because everyone will deal with what they have differently. focus on you, what you want, and what you can do with what you have. 

don’t beat yourself up for not being “good enough” because there is no such thing. you are. you are all unique and have your strengths and ambitions and no school is “perfect” or the “best” for anything. 

&#x200B;

i’m a bit of a hypocrite and sometimes i think about how i could’ve gotten in somewhere better but honestly that has not helped me. being upset about it. instead, i'm getting involved on campus and building myself up so i can create myself. i don't have to make this school define me but i can create experiences of my own. i think that's what's most important. 

&#x200B;

710,7hs45h,False,,110,Don't be like me,ApplyingToCollege,"I know early decision and early action decisions are coming out soon, and as a current college freshman who frequented this sub last year, I wanted to give some advice on how to handle the decisions and enjoy the coming years.

When I was in high school, I was a good student like most of you. I was consistently ranked top 10 in a class of 600 at a competitive high school in a competitive area. I scored 240 on the PSAT and 2400 on the SAT when I was in 10th grade, and decided to take the ACT later just to prove a point to a friend that I could ace all three. I participated in a bunch of math contests - I won some local awards and went to ARML and qualified for AIME for those who are familiar with the math competition circuit. I did environmental research with local town officials during three major research projects over the course of my high school career. I entered in the big science contests (Siemens, Intel, etc.), but didn't win anything beyond the local level. I did some other clubs (Science Olympiad, some honor societies), did some volunteer service, did a summer math program, and had a sport outside of school that I was good but not great at. 

Over the summer entering my senior year, I constantly checked this sub for advice on my essays, how to present myself on my applications, etc. I made a list of 13 colleges to apply to, ranging from guaranteed full scholarship safeties to some of the best colleges in the world. I kept reading here how top colleges were never a guarantee for anyone, but I was confident I could get in minus maybe one or two. I submitted all of my applications regular decision. I heard back from my 2 safeties (both outside of top 50 on US news) first. But then when the other decisions started coming in, the results weren't quite what I expected. In total, I was accepted at my two safeties, 3 that were in the 30 - 50 range on US News, and one top 20. I was denied from 4 (all top 10) and waitlisted at 3, including one state school ranked outside of the top 25. I was shocked, angry, upset, everything. I was expecting to maybe not get into the top ivies, but to be waitlisted at multiple colleges outside the top 15 was a shock.

For the coming months, I was bitter and resentful toward everyone. My best friend was accepted at MIT, his top choice, and instead of being happy for him, I was resentful that I had better stats but didn't get into schools of similar caliber. I eventually committed to a top 20 school, but felt that I was above it, that I deserved and was entitled to better. Everyone congratulated me, and I outwardly thanked them, but I was still bitter. I would spend my free time on the College Confidential threads, getting mad at the people who got into Harvard or Princeton or wherever with ""only"" 34's on the ACT or 3.8 GPAs, thinking that they didn't deserve it. 

When I got to college in August, I pretty much isolated myself from everyone else. Every time I would pass by a black kid, or hispanic kid, or athlete, my mind would immediately switch to a sense of anger, mad that they supposedly only got in because of the advantages in the admissions process. I didn't bother to go to any of my classes because I figured I'm so much smarter than everyone here that I could beat the curve without even trying. I pretty much just stayed by myself in my dorm room all day wishing I was somewhere else.

It wasn't until the first midterm grades started coming in that I realized I was being ridiculous. I was under-performing on tests and hadn't been handing in any work. I realized that I needed to change and finally, 10 weeks into the semester, I went to the medical center and got therapy for my issues. I finally started to realize that I was lucky to be at a prestigious school (even if it's not the most prestigious), and started to put more effort into classes and developing relationships with other students. Now, during finals week, I've been going to class and hanging out with people in my dorm and doing normal college stuff. But I can't help feeling like I missed out on almost an entire semester of positive experiences (and GPA points) just because I was stubborn and entitled.


So please try not to be like me. If you don't get into your dream school, or even any of your top choice colleges, it's not an indictment on you as a person or even as a student. Remember the top colleges get many more applications than they have space for. All the time you hear of kids getting into Harvard and not Brown or MIT and not Carnegie Mellon. With the exception of maybe a few handfuls of truly brilliant and incredibly accomplished students, no one is going to get in everywhere. But as long as you continue to work hard, you'll end up somewhere good. Every college has smart and talented students. Maybe some more than others, but no matter where you go, if you work hard and rise to the top, you'll have the same opportunities as everyone else, whether it be for graduate school or jobs or anything else (except for maybe at Goldman Sachs but they're a bunch of pretentious babies anyway). Assuming you applied to a range of colleges where you'll be happy attending, you'll be fine wherever you go. Don't let a few rejections ruin the experience for you.

All of my friends were on that path and pretty much everyone who was average at math or better at my school seemed to be on this path (yours could be different!)

I am a senior, and I am only in Pre-Calculus. Months ago I was really paranoid and asked both this sub and r/chanceme if I would be able to get into T20s without having been in calculus or even having the prerequisite for calculus; I got a resounding “no” from pretty much everyone. Whatever, I still applied and worked my ass off on my applications.

So months pass and just a few weeks ago, I get my acceptance to Vanderbilt. What???

I got comments from these subs telling me that even as a social studies major I wouldn’t be able to get in because I wasn’t on that path. I applied *STEM* and got in!! 

The school system likes to shit on us, and tell us how good we’ll be at math in the future and decide what path we’ll be on in High School as early as the 5th grade with no chance of mobility onto the upper path. I spent the entirety of my high school years regretting and being very upset about the fact that I was bad at long division in 5th grade and was consequently put on the “dumb kids” path for the entire rest of my K-12 years. 

It CAN be done. I wanted desperately my junior year to make up for my lack of rigor in math by doing well on the ACT section, and I still ended up with a 28 max on the math section because my school only catered to kids on the “smart” path for ACT prep. However, I was still damn proud of myself for getting a 28 math while i was only in the middle of Algebra 2. I managed to get a 35 or a 36 on every other section and get a 34 SS, and even though I only scored a 28 on math 3 times in a row, the ad board at Vandy apparently still saw something in me that they thought would lead to me being an incredible STEM student. 

I will reiterate for the last time that IT CAN ABSOLUTELY BE DONE. I’m sorry if you were deemed “dumb” in 5th grade and weren’t able to move into the “smart” path like I was, but if you show that you have kickass ECs, a passion for what you want to study, and a thirst to do well despite your circumstances, you will be OK!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fg1xme/psa_you_can_get_into_t20s_without_being_seen_as/,1742,or it’s largely chance so there will always be stories like this attempting to break the mold ,2020-03-09 21:09:57

447,aa7hr3,False,,149,Does it ever strike anyone else that this entire process is completely and irrevocably fucked?,ApplyingToCollege,"Basically every college has an essay that boils down to ""Why do you want to go here?"" and I'm pretty sure we all feed them complete bullshit. The actual answers boil down to:

""This college is financially reasonable for me and of sufficient proximity/lack thereof (if you really just want to leave home) that it is convenient, and also you'll probably accept me.""

""This college is prestigious and I think I might have a shot.""

""Everyone needs a backup.""

""My parent(s) went here so you'll almost certainly accept me and I like the idea of it.""

""My dad bought you a building."" (for those asshats who can say that)

They must know, right? Most students are going to get a perfectly serviceable education pretty much anywhere. Barring post-graduate work and actual research, most colleges are going to be pretty much the same. Colleges are like people: everyone around them tells them they're special, and all those people are lying. Do they just pick based on whoever lies most eloquently? I don't mean to suggest we lie about the basic facts of our lives. No one would make up an extracurricular or fake a grade, because they'd get caught, but we definitely misrepresent ourselves to be way more invested in each *particular* college, when really we're just happy if we get accepted by *any* college we'd find acceptable. Why the hell do we grovel at their feet, when they are far more invested in us than we are in them? FFS, we get spammed with email and actual physical mail advertising to us. (Hint: We grovel because our parents are not-so-secretly completely fucking terrified that we might do worse than them, and if that happens, it means they're FAILURES AS PARENTS PANIC PANIC PANIC)

Also, the hell is up with letters of recommendation? My teachers have actual jobs. It is not part of their job to help me beg a college for admission. It is their job to teach me. Not to mention the quality BS that goes into recommendation letters, as well. Numerous teachers just keep form letters, then fill in names and adjectives.

Standardized tests, too, are a whole crock of shit. They're tests we pay to take from people who encourage our anxiety over them and then sell us test prep in order to profit from that same anxiety. We act as if they reflect the entirety of our self worth (at least until it comes time to show colleges our essays, at which point *they* become our self worth).

Just... for fuck's sake, we've created an educational system that puts people into so much debt that they spend their entire lives paying it off. We have *serious elected officials* whose platforms include programs specifically to deal with the debt incurred by buying one's way into the middle class (because that's what it is, make no mistake. If nothing else, the growing popularity of business majors should have keyed us all in to the fact that college hasn't been about education for a long time).

749,b73rci,False,,111,"AOs Can't Actually Detect ""Authenticity"" Or ""Passion"": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior",ApplyingToCollege,"(on a throwaway)

&#x200B;

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

""So, what do you like to do in your free time?""

""I like hiking and naturery stuff"" I said.

""That's not academic enough. Anything else?""

""Uh idk. I like art I guess,"" I choked.

&#x200B;

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something ""community-minded"" with my interests. ""How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?"" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some ""buzzwords"" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said ""yes, (my name) would love to do that.""

&#x200B;

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how ""I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey,"" but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they ""could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment.""**

&#x200B;

So yeah, ""an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color""... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

&#x200B;

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. **Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.** Sure, there are some exceptions.

&#x200B;

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of ""ditching your high school self"" and ""getting to live a little for the next 4 years"" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.** (There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

&#x200B;

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some admissions counselors like u/admissionsmom (I think she's amazing, just wrong on this one aspect) say ""just follow your passion"" and ""we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about"" or ""to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;"" and the worst one, ""be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself."" **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

&#x200B;

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for your letter regarding my admission decision. Unfortunately after reviewing the letter I regret to inform you that I will not be able to offer you a spot on my list of rejections this year. I wish a different decision had been possible but I hope this knowledge will be beneficial to your plans for the future. Through this excruciating process, I worked hard to holistically review the credentials of each college. While I wish it were possible to offer this coveted position to every college, I’m faced with the necessity of choosing only a select few. I offer my sincerest apologies for informing you of this.

I appreciate your continued interest of me as a student and wish you the best success in your future endeavors

Warmly,

893,89k25t,False,,129,A Miracle Harvard Acceptance,ApplyingToCollege,"***This will take a little while to read. This post is not intended to be cruel, but rather to present a realistic picture of top-tier admissions to prospective undergraduates. To address the holier than thou tone that will undoubtedly be present in this post, I'll preface this by saying that I was rejected from two Ivy League schools (Harvard & UPenn), as well as UMich, Georgetown, and Tufts.*** 


Alright, enough about me. Let's get to you. Based on the demographics of this sub, I'll take a very rough guess that you are a 17 or 18-year-old middle-upper class white male. You have very competitive stats, hold multiple leadership roles in organizations at your school, wrote well thought out essays, and received glowing LORs. Most other kids from your hometown do not compare to you scholastically. In other words? You kicked ass in high school. It's your senior year, and you applied to a number of highly selective undergraduate schools. 

In light of recent ~~rejections~~ events, a growing number of posts have been made on this forum disparaging the inequities present within the college admissions process. Complaints about affirmative action far outnumber critiques of any other system. The implication is that race allows underqualified applicants to gain admission to elite institutions over more deserving, non-minority students. 

This is an extreme oversimplification and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the admissions process. In an effort to remedy this, I'm taking you on a trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

*It's a cold January day here, and flurries are starting to sprinkle. I just finished a slice of cheese at Pinocchio's, a charming pizza place where Mark Zuckerburg used to do CS problem sets. Head outside and turn down Brattle Street, and you end up at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for Harvard. Inside, your application is currently being considered along with two others for two spots in the incoming Freshman class.*

**Alright, sorry to break the immersion, but I feel the need to say that I understand that this is not close to how admissions decisions are actually made. But I feel that this hypothetical allows the whole picture to become more clear.**

*Where were we? Right. Three applicants. Two spots. Let's meet your peers.*

*Three kids. There's one female, URM. Dirt poor. Slightly lower stats than you. There's you, middle-class male, white. Then there's one ultra-rich white male. Legacy. Lowest stats of the bunch, but only because of a poor freshman year. Everyone has comparable ECs, strong essays, LORs, etc.*

*So (cue opening scene of ""The Social Network""); ""How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs?""*

*Simple. You need a differentiating factor. In your high school bubble, you were the best. To cut it here? You need to be the best of the best.*


*When those kids walk onto campus for orientation, they will be at one of the most selective institutions in the world. The students around them are all exceptional in different ways. The rich kid has a dad with a $50 million net worth. The URM chick got a perfect SAT score and a 4.0 from a one bedroom house smaller than your kitchen. Look to your left, there's Malia Obama. To your right, Yara Shahidi.*

***This is your competition.***

""Wait. These kids are special cases! What about the normal ones?""

*Harvard offered 1962 people a spot in the incoming freshman class this year. Now, you're right. Malia & Yara are celebrities. They are a special case. Still, let's say two more celebrities applied this year. That's two spots gone. 1960 left. Roughly 30% of the class will be legacy students. That's 589 more spots off the list. 1371 left. 200 more will go to athletes. 1171 left. 10 go to faculty kids, 3 more to members of various royal families, and one to a kid whose last name is on a building. You see what I'm getting at?*

***Everyone is a special case.***

*Year after year, people ask for ""Miracle Acceptance Stories"" only to be shot down by seemingly wise commenters who simply state ""There are no miracle acceptances.""* 

*Those commenters are wrong. There are miracle acceptances. Want an example? Miracle acceptances to the most selective colleges in America are people like you. People who have stellar stats, strong extracurriculars, and eloquent essays, but no hook.* 

*You have gone through high school and constantly achieved at a level above and beyond your classmates. But here? In this cold room at 86 Brattle Street? You are something that you haven't been in a long time. Average. No, not an average admit. An average applicant.*

*The two people you're competing against? They played the game. Expertly.*

""But that's not fair! I can't control the situation I was born into!""

*Nobody can! That's the whole point! The athlete gets good genetics, the legacy gets money, and the poor brown kid gets affirmative action! They understood their place. They recognized an imperfect process for what it is; imperfect!* 


*I've never seen someone post ""It's unfair that I didn't get into Stanford with a 1230! I'm a bad test taker!"" That would be absurd. We all know that high test scores are part of the deal for any top school. Bad at taking tests? Tough luck! Figure it out. Born a middle-class white kid? Know what is required. Adapt, or die. The cards you are dealt are not the end all be all, but knowing how to play them is.*


*The accepted students? They knew their edge from the second they were born. Or they made their own. And they exploited it for everything it was worth.*


***You did not.***






*Dear You,*


*The Committee on Admissions has completed its Regular Decision meetings, and I am very sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you admission to the Class of 2022.* 

*We very much appreciate the interest you have shown in Harvard, and we hope you will accept the best wishes of the Committee for success in all your future endeavors.*

31,b2sjij,False,Major Advice,95,It's the year 1767,ApplyingToCollege,"The College of Harvard and Stanford sent out their decisions four months ago so that the letters get delivered by carrier pigeons to the applicants' houses next week.

You open your letter and see ""we regret to inform you but there was an influx of qualified students who applied this year. Our acceptance rate had to drop from 96% to 94% because we only have enough space for 30 students and over 40 applied. Unfortunately, your dumb ass did not qualify"". It's unfair because you ran a successful business selling your family's eggs, helped draft the constitution, and even received an academic scholarship of $8.

You find that your neighbor George got into UPenn, where the acceptance rate dropped from 110% to 36%. His daddy owns a bomb ass hat factory and happens to make $1,000 a year while your fam makes $200 ($10 after taxes) a year. A scandal breaks out. Apparently, George's dad paid UPenn $500 and had a portrait painted of George posing on a buggy for the amish horse buggy UPenn racing team. George can't even tell the difference between a horse and a cow. Unfortunately, your dad being a legacy to harvard and donating $2 a year did not help you while George gets a whole straw hut named after him at UPenn.

Not to mention, George updated his facebook status to  ""UPenn class of 1772"" on the town news board and his dad bought him an apple islate x and you get the oldest version passed down to you by your 8th older sister.

You receive a letter a week after your rejection from the collegeboard that was mailed out last year apologizing for their failure to submit your SAT score because the mail guy's horse died halfway traveling from their HQ in texas to harvard in Boston. They refuse to refund you and you are out of $0.10

You have no choice but to attend your community college, where the teacher is 2 years older than you and there are kids ranging from 4-23 in your class, all learning the same things. You show up for the first day and see that they're just learning their abc's. The 22 year old dude in the class doesn't know the difference between the numbers 3 and 6. The teacher spends the rest of the first week of college teaching up to the letter ""q"" and the number 14. Meanwhile, george becomes a fuckin president and you end up being a goat farmer.

8,en97tp,False,Discussion,620,Unpopular Opinion: a lot of y’all don’t belong at top schools.,ApplyingToCollege,"Alright so basically what I’ve noticed about people who get into top schools that I’ve been friends with is that they’re all nice people and actually have a life. If you have to study 24/7 and don’t have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don’t belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond ‘I need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT’ they’re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y’all really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think ‘why did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college’ then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don’t want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you’re not getting in to your top choices.

Edit: just because you didn’t get into a top school doesn’t mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons

124,e7zlez,False,Meta Discussion,219,Unpopular Opinion: A2C is a toxic sub,ApplyingToCollege,"For context, I'm a freshman in college who spent a lot of time lurking in this  sub last year. There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it **doesn't fucking matter**. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely.  If you don't get into your ""Dream School""It's not the end of the world.

I feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, ""you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA (how do you guys even do this? I don't think that was even possible at my school but okay?)"" and I'm not here for it. This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.

It also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.

I even cringe at the term ""Dream School"". Honestly, y'all have no freaking idea of what your dream school is like (I sure a s hell didn't going into orientation) and I've met so many people who regret their choice.  One thing I've realized in college is **how important fit is.** you should not go to a college just just because it's ""the best school you can get into"" because at the end of the day you need to put up with the environment you will be living in.

Learn as much as you can about the school you want to go to, and don't stress too much if you don't get into your first choice. The end of senior year will come earlier than you expect, so fucking enjoy your last year in HS.

Finally, getting into your ""Dream School"" over a less attractive school won't alleviate your problems. I had this mindset and boy was I in for a nasty surprise as I had to face academic hardship and a new college social scene at the same time.

59,cd0aib,False,,412,I'm in shock. I just got drafted by the Korean military. I'm a recent admit to Brown. What do I do?,ApplyingToCollege,"**EDIT: I want to say I'm mentally stable for now. Thank you so much for your help everyone, and I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. I'd like to cherish the time I have time left before losing my phone. Also, I disagree with the moderator's decision to disable comments in the other thread about conscription. Firstly, there is important advice and information other redditors can contribute. Secondly, I feel that we need a discussion bringing awareness to the topic. I know this is A2C, but I don't see how enabling the comments for some discussion can hurt. It's important to people like me, and young people concerned about social justice.**

I'm a male dual citizen and apparently they have guidelines not well known to the public that if you don't follow, you will be conscripted for two years even if you're not from Korea. I don't even speak Korean.

What do I even tell Brown? Do I need to apply again in two years with new essays and everything? Will my high school SAT scores and GPA still be valid??

They caught me at the airport and I had to get escorted. I'm so scared. I cried too much today and the staff here don't seem to care; no one asked if I was alright and just walked by me as if they were used to this scene. I had no idea this could happen to me; I was only on vacation. All of a sudden I'm going to be isolated from society in some military camp just because I'm a dual-citizen male who didn't renounce his Korean citizenship before March of the year I turned 18. I already looked my situation up, and apparently this happens very regularly to unknowing Korean-Americans like me, and the US doesn't do anything about it. It's a trap designed to get more conscripts, and I'm a victim. There's no escape.

I'm sorry that I'm going into venting mode right now, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle alone with no one besides me. No social movement even talks about conscription even though it's a blatant violation of gender rights and human rights. I literally feel so alone and it's painful.

I also feel stupid and embarrassed. I'll have to explain to my friends about how I was stupid enough to not know to renounce my citizenship. It's embarrassing. Also, in Korean culture apparently, if you complain about military service, you're not a ""man"" so you have to stay silent about it. This means I can't talk to anyone I potentially befriend in Korea.

I have to explain to my roommates why I can't attend. I even made tons of close friends from the Facebook page. I was so happy about going. My life was set. Now I'm in a situation that I STILL feel like has to be a nightmare.

I'm so glad I wrote this post and getting my emotions out, but at the same time, I feel like I wasted the little time I have left before I get transported and my phone taken away. I honestly think I'll try to kill myself. I've heard horror stories of hazing, abusive/violent superiors, intense training starting 6 AM, and how the two years go by extremely slowly. My uncle told me stories about how he was punished by being locked inside a gas room where it disabled his eyes and made him cough. And how he was outcasted (he's autistic) and beat by his soldiers at times. And how he slept the latest and woke up the earliest because soldiers said they'd kill him in his sleep, and he believed it. He said it psychologically changed him and he's the main reason why I'm so scared of the military. You also get paid $110 a month so it's not like the US military

Looks like my question post turned into a rant post. I'd be thankful for any help you can give me, and PLEASE some words of encouragement and emotional support. I also stopped crying writing this post. I should also say thank you since I'll be offline for two years; you helped me a lot through admissions and I'm so grateful you guys exist. I'm so scared and wish I could just die right now. Every person I see walking by makes me hyperventilate because I'm so scared they'll drag me away right now.

137,gqbyw5,False,Discussion,258,Essay of the girl that got into 8 Ivies,ApplyingToCollege,"""In our house, English is not English. Not in the phonetic sense, like short a is for apple, but rather in the pronunciation – in our house, snake is snack. Words do not roll off our tongues correctly – yet I, who was pulled out of class to meet with language specialists, and my mother from Malaysia, who pronounces film as flim, understand each other perfectly.
In our house, there is no difference between cast and cash, which was why at a church retreat, people made fun of me for “cashing out demons.” I did not realize the glaring difference between the two Englishes until my teacher corrected my pronunciations of hammock, ladle, and siphon. Classmates laughed because I pronounce accept as except, success as sussess. I was in the Creative Writing conservatory, and yet words failed me when I needed them most.
Suddenly, understanding flower is flour wasn’t enough. I rejected the English that had never seemed broken before, a language that had raised me and taught me everything I knew. Everybody else’s parents spoke with accents smarting of Ph.D.s and university teaching positions. So why couldn’t mine?
My mother spread her sunbaked hands and said, “This is where I came from,” spinning a tale with the English she had taught herself.
When my mother moved from her village to a town in Malaysia, she had to learn a brand new language in middle school: English. In a time when humiliation was encouraged, my mother was defenseless against the cruel words spewing from the teacher, who criticized her paper in front of the class. When she began to cry, the class president stood up and said, “That’s enough.”
“Be like that class president,” my mother said with tears in her eyes. The class president took her under her wing and patiently mended my mother’s strands of language. “She stood up for the weak and used her words to fight back.”
We were both crying now. My mother asked me to teach her proper English so old white ladies at Target wouldn’t laugh at her pronunciation. It has not been easy. There is a measure of guilt when I sew her letters together. Long vowels, double consonants — I am still learning myself. Sometimes I let the brokenness slide to spare her pride but perhaps I have hurt her more to spare mine.
As my mother’s vocabulary began to grow, I mended my own English. Through performing poetry in front of 3000 at my school’s Season Finale event, interviewing people from all walks of life, and writing stories for the stage, I stand against ignorance and become a voice for the homeless, the refugees, the ignored. With my words I fight against jeers pelted at an old Asian street performer on a New York subway. My mother’s eyes are reflected in underprivileged ESL children who have so many stories to tell but do not know how. I fill them with words as they take needle and thread to make a tapestry.

In our house, there is beauty in the way we speak to each other. In our house, language is not broken but rather bursting with emotion. We have built a house out of words. There are friendly snakes in the cupboard and snacks in the tank. It is a crooked house. It is a little messy. But this is where we have made our home.""

I mean yea, it’s not as if I’ve lived in the shadow of my overachieving brother my entire life, my teacher doesn’t even consider me a student 

My grades are declining in her subject and I was super worried about that but this just blows it out of the water

936,9cqs7s,False,,243,Caught cheating. Regret my decision every day.,ApplyingToCollege,"About a year ago I was like a lot of people on here preparing to apply to colleges. One day while I'm driving a friend home from school I ask him where he's thinking about applying. He tells me that race/ethnicity in college admissions is HUGE and you can simply lie about it and get a big boost. He tells me there's no punishment if you get caught. After spending weeks researching the whole ""race factor"" in college admissions, I decided I'd lie on college admissions and claim I was latino/hispanic (I'm white). If colleges asked anything I'd simply tell them I was columbian. 


I apply to selective instituions marking myself as Hispanic/Latino. In the weeks following I experienced stress and anxiety over my decision I never thought I would. Every email, every letter in the mail, and every visit to the guidance counselors office caused stress. I even had some nightmares about getting caught. Eventually acceptances and rejections rolled out. I thought at this point I was in the clear. I pick my college, buy apparel for it, update my social media bios, tell all my friends and family, and at my school they post colleges with the name of the students attending them in the hall.


In June, which at this point I had graduated from HS, I'm at a concert with friends. I get a phone call from my college. I don't answer but she leaves a message. She informs me that they performed an audit and noticed on ""old records"" (I have no idea what these records were or how they got them) my parents marked me as caucasian and that on my ACT profile I was marked as caucasian. She asks for a call back. My stomach dropped when I read this voicemail (I have a transcriber). I went to a porta potti and puked for over an hour. I had to tell all my friend I was just sick. And on the train ride home I had a panic attack. I had enormous chest pains, shortness of breath, and shaking. I honestly thought I was gonna die. 


I got home and planned my next lie. The next day I called and answered questions from an associate dean who didn't sound at all suspicious despite my nervous voice. I told him I had recently found out my Dad is columbian (since I never knew and still don't know my dad). After the conversation he tells me thanks and they'll email me if they have any more questions. On Tuesday I get an email from them informing me they'd like a written letter from my parents and guidance counselor confirming my assertion that I was columbian. 


At this point the jig is up. I email them informing them I'd like to withdraw my enrollment from the school and that I will no longer me attending. For the next week and a half I ignore multiple phone calls and emails from them. Eventually they just called my school and told my guidance counselor what happened. My guidance counselor at the direction of the college, or maybe his own volition I don't know, informs every college I applied to and he calls my Mom. 


Every college I was accepted rescinded my acceptance. My Mom and grandparents were angry as you can imagine. But they eventually understood the pressure I had on me to get into a good college and forgave me. I decided to enroll at a Community College, which is where I'm at now. I had to come up with a lie to all of my friends and family that I couldn't afford to go to a 4-year. 


I now live in fear that when I apply again in two years my counselor will inform all of the schools of my history, and I'll forever be blacklisted as a cheater. I live every day regretting my decision. I hate Community College so much and feel like I wasted 4 years of work just so I would have a slightly better chance at some schools. Thankfully, if there's any silver lining, I avoided any legal trouble since I was accepted without financial aid. I'm writing this to hopefully clear some conscious and improve my poor ethics (which I still have). I'll probably get a lot of hate on this post, which is understandable. I wish I would've known about this reddit a year ago, and I wish someone would've made a post like this. So they know it's not worth it. 



TL;DR Don't cheat the college admissions. It's 100% not worth it. You'll probably get caught. And if you don't get caught you'll have to live in fear that you may be caught.

686,gmsh86,False,Best of A2C,115,Juniors: Bored At Home? Here’s What You Can Do,ApplyingToCollege,"So, maybe quarantine’s getting you down. Maybe you’re like me, and haven’t done homework in weeks (would not recommend, even for a senior). In any case, you’re definitely on A2C and probably looking for something to do. Here are some ideas. 


&nbsp;


**Start planning for your letters of recommendation.**

Figure out who you’re going to ask, and start preparing all the materials. I have a whole post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/) that dives into much more detail on what you should be working on. 


&nbsp;


**Start narrowing down your college list.**

This is pretty important. I thought I had picked out a good list, and then changed my mind about applying to a lot of colleges, and **then** I thought I had figured it out by the time I had submitted my apps. After submitting, I realized I didn’t want to go to some of the schools I applied to, whether it was fit, financial aid, or strength in my major.


Here are some quick tips on choosing what colleges to apply to:

* If you need financial aid, apply to colleges with generous financial aid. Most T20s and top LACs offer the most generous financial aid. Run each college’s NPC (Net Price Calculator) to determine how much you would get. These are generally extremely accurate unless you have a weird source of income or other extenuating circumstances.

* Side note: also **consider colleges with generous merit scholarships**. u/ScholarGrade has a very thorough list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/). Keep in mind that these are extremely competitive. You need higher stats than even those who get into T20s. (Usually, those who get these are those who get into HYPSM etc., the merit sways them and gets them to attend these schools instead). 

* **Consider fit over shotgunning.** Some colleges have very different cultures than others. For example, Duke, Vandy, and Dartmouth are all T20s that are very fratty, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have schools like MIT, UChicago, and Caltech which are more known for their course rigor and difficulty (others would call it stress culture). 

* **Find schools that are strong in your department of interest.** Some schools are known for certain things, others are excellent for everything (cough cough Stanford). For example, Georgetown SFS is hands-down the best program for international relations, UPenn Wharton is the best for business, etc. Georgia Tech is great for engineering, Purdue & UIUC are great for CS. 

* Yes, put that college that is “out of reach” on your list. Even if you don’t get in, you aren’t left wondering what could’ve happened.


&nbsp;


**Start drafting essays.**

I know it’s early, but the work you put in now means that work that you won’t be suffering over essay writing during Christmas or New Year’s. Keep in mind that Common App wipes/resets every August, so you shouldn’t start filling in anything in Common App yet. Most schools’ supplements stay the same or change very slightly each year, so I wouldn’t worry about your effort going to waste. Even if they do change the essays, you can probably use the already written essay for another school, and you’ve gained experience writing essays. 

Speaking from personal experience, I found that it took much longer than anticipated to brainstorm essay topics, write them, and then edit them until I was satisfied. And despite the fact that my essays were not great in the summer, it gave me a good foundation to approach more supps in the fall as well as a crude draft of some supplements to refine.


&nbsp;


**Start studying for standardized testing.**

I’d say drop the SAT IIs (unless your schools require them), most schools don’t care much about them and many other schools are dropping the requirement/the option to even submit SAT IIs (hello MIT & Caltech, trying to lower your acceptance rate?). r/SAT & r/ACT are great places to find advice or other free resources. My guess is that less emphasis will be placed on test scores, but it’s still important: colleges still have to pad their median SAT & ACT scores.


&nbsp;


**Start working on a personal project.**

This isn’t as daunting as it sounds. Find something you’re legitimately interested in, and pursue it, even if it’s for an hour a day. I imagine you guys have a lot of free time. Personally, I’ve been improving my cooking & baking (free time = lots of breadmaking), working out a lot, exploring my town through biking, and a little bit of Python coding. “Sure,” you say, “but that doesn’t even sound like an EC to me.” Wrong: I literally put cooking as one of my ECs (I spent a decent amount of time on it last year), and was able to talk about it in a meaningful way. Plus, it’s an extremely valuable life skill. 

Working out may not be an EC in of itself, but you can certainly make it into one. I founded a fitness club at my school to coach other kids, and talked about that as an EC. “Well, I can’t do that now.” Obviously not, but I actually saw a reddit post on A2C asking if anyone wanted to get in shape and keep each other accountable. I asked OP if they wanted to make a groupme, and now we’re at 80+ members and counting. I’ve also helped set up a google classroom to keep group members accountable and to help coach others. That, combined with working out, can definitely be counted as an EC. (If any of y'all want the link, please chat/PM me). 


&nbsp;


**Or, look for other interesting things to pursue.**

It doesn’t have to be a project, but there are certainly things you can be doing. One of my friends was doing shopping with InstaCart (relatively safe, the only risk is when you go shopping, the delivery is contactless) and making $20/hr. A job is always an EC. Speaking from personal experience, part-time or entry level jobs are also looking for workers now. 

Or maybe there’s something else you’re interested in. Maybe that’s reading (if that’s fanfiction, I don’t judge and AOs will never know if you just list reading as an coronavirus activity), or writing, or drawing, or painting, or woodworking, or learning a language, or anything else you can think of. The best thing to be doing is learning **something** that you’re interested in. COVID-19 has given us a gift in the form of a shitton of free time to take a breath and slow down.


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**: make a college list, get LORs, start your essays, pursue your interests.

This is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.

Junior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. Unlike freshman and sophomore year, you now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list, but don't freak out if you're already a spring semester junior — or even a rising senior. You have plenty of time to get all this done.

Please note that my views about this might be different than the advice you hear from other sources or even other students. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

## Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)

**GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF**

* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).
* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).
* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to the homeless).

**GET A SUMMER JOB:** Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. A summer job also shows determination and resiliency. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT:** You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT:** Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of the junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.

**TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS:** Especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in June or August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.

**ENJOY YOUR SUMMER:** This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being involved with yourself. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

**START YOUR RESUME:** If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports. If you use the Coalition App, you can start on your application “locker.” Keep this list updated throughout the next two years. Create the following categories: Education, Extracurriculars, Work Experience, Community Service, Interests and Hobbies, Awards, Honors

**EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS:**   Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, Harvard, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.

# Junior Fall

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.

**TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN:** Colleges say that your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:

* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see it. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain)
* English
* Math (ending in calculus if it’s offered -- or higher)
* Social Science (History, Gov, etc).

**GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS:** Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it.

**KEEP UP YOUR GRADES:** I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now

**READ READ READ:** Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — just ask.

**KEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT:** Start testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year.

**STAY INVOLVED:** Keep up with everything I listed for summer. Also, get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says, ](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different.

# Junior Spring

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. I prefer one from a STEM subject and one from a humanities subject, but some colleges have certain expectations, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. Ask your teacher in person or by email and then follow up either in person or by email. Be sure to include a basic info cheat sheet about you for them and a resume. Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.

LOR Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

* What was your favorite part of the class?
* What was your most memorable activity or project
* What part of the class did you find most difficult?
* What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?
* Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes.

**COLLEGE VISITS:** Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Be sure to check out my new app, College Vizzy, and use it if you are visiting campuses to help make your visit more meaningful for you and to share your thoughts and experiences with those who can't visit. It's available in Phase 1 version on the app store now.

Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.

* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.
* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?
* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.
* Check out the dining hall and the gym.
* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.
* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

**COLLEGE LIST:** Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books.

* Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.
* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.
* Common Data Set.  Google college name and common data set.
* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, twitter, facebook, and snapchat. Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest with those who consider demonstrated interest -- and it’s also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays! \*College Vizzy App
* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds.
* [Niche.com](https://feeds.niche.com/)
* “Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and website)
* “College Match” by Steve Antonoff

* “Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni

**SOMETHING TO CONSIDER… Your SureFire Safety School** \-- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Safety School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would like to go there, AND they are a financial safety. Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there.

**COLLEGE FIT:** Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out. This includes thinking about and potentially creating a spreadsheet for:

* *Financials:* Will you need full financial aid?  Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are crucial considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. If you can’t afford the price of a school, it’s not a good fit.
* *Geography:* What areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no to the Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, deprive themselves of some excellent options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you want to get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?
* *Weather:* Also important. If you really, really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.
* *School Culture and Vibe:* Are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school? Or something that has it all?
* *School Size:* Do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid-sized? Do you want discussion-based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?
* *Potential Major:* If you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out, and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.
* *Your Stats:* Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to. This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out U.S. News \&amp; World Report and listing the top twenty schools.

**ADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB:** (I don’t actually have a book club, just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend:  *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, and *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be*, *Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit*. See my list later in this post for a full list.

**COLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET:** Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for the one I use.

**NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME:** Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.

**NET PRICE CALCULATORS:** Sit with your parents and do the net price calculators at a few colleges. Begin the financial conversations.

**NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS:** Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info!

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS:** If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

**COLLEGE FAIRS:** Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

**WRITE:** I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the timidest of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.
* Read and listen to essays on [www.thisibelieve.org](http://www.thisibelieve.org). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.
* Check out [www.collegeessayguy.com](http://www.collegeessayguy.com), and start perusing his stuff. His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.
* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you. Your application with your shiny stats and activities is for impressing. Your essays are for expressing.
* Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and when you read those, then you get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes you great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader. I can’t tell you how many essays I’ve now read that start with “The sweat dripped down my brow as I (tortured my way through the math exam, debate tournament, community service project, track meet…..” You pick). I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for strong personal essays and supplements. \*I’ll be happy to share my essay resources with you. Email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**READ BOOKS:** Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

**TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER:** Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do? Besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.
* Get a job. This might be a good time to get a job and start saving money for the things you will need in school. An old fashioned job where you earn just a little but learn a lot from the experience of taking care of customers or working with others who might never have the chance to work with is invaluable at this time. It also can help you with time management.
* Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of things you are thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating? Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here, but when we stop and think about it, it can take away some of the anxiety and stress.
* Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go. If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana 🍌 inside. A monkey comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the banana.
* Horses with flies. This is a silly one, but it can help! So, you know how horses make their skin quiver when a fly lands on them? That’s what you do here. It’s a super quick tension reliever. First, shake your hands, then your arms, then your head, then your feet, and your legs, and your belly. Raise your hands high over your head while shaking, and then quickly drop down and reach for your toes and come up. Make sure you make a silly noise when you drop down! Then, feel how alive your body feels and pay attention to that smile on your face!
* LEAN IN.  Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It is knowing that this is just what’s happening right now and it’s ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Lean in and face it and embrace it. Think about it. Assess it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school. It’s true. It pisses you off when we say it, but it’s true.
* Mindful Meditation. Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all — no need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breath. Be mindful of what’s happening to you. Is your mind wandering? Cool! That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing. It’s no biggie. Just come back to your breath. This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.
* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food

**OTHER…** If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

* Questbridge Program:[ https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)
* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)
* The Posse Foundation:[ https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)

Juniors, you are in for the journey of your life. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger.

I'm looking forward to watching your transformations; you got this! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are. Instead of focusing so much on getting in, let’s instead focus on getting inward.

# Rising Senior Summer

What to do? What to do? This is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab ( you get those positions by emailing any and every professor you know or who you can find doing research you’re interested in). Or you can get an internship (you get those the same way as research). Or you can do a program somewhere on a campus or around the world. Those are all great ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects. But, don’t forget the good old fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of job allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.

Here’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, says about summer: “Bring summer back. Summer need not be totally consumed by highly structured programs, such as summer schools, travel programs, or athletic camps. While such activities can be wonderful in many ways, they can also add to the stress by assembling “super peers” who set nearly impossible standards. Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.” link is here:[ https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time)

**Finish up testing.** SAT, ACT, and subject tests

**BE INVOLVED** (see above)

**RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES:** Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. Listen to books or podcasts. Hang out with friends.

**WRITE:** “Write like a motherf\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Don’t worry too much about the essays just yet. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring. Figure out who you are.

Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) and ask for my list of questions to get you going. This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Use this super cool app/website that some of the A2C kiddoes have taught me about-- [www.the](http://www.the) mostdangerouswritingapp.comStart asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. You can practice answering these in themostdangerouswritingapp.com! I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:

* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?
* What do you worry about?
* What’s your secret sauce?
* What’s your superpower?
* What’s the last thing you think about before you go to sleep?
* Who are your role models and why?
* What’s your favorite comfort food?
* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?
* What makes you smile?

**THINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY:** Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about being unique; worry about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. Let the reader know what’s happening inside you. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Focus on More Expressing, Less Impressing.  I'll be happy to share my essay resources with you, including the essay chapter from my new book, ""Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit"", if you email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**MAKE A COMMON APP and COALITION ACCOUNT:** Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background.

**UPDATE YOUR RESUME** (Or create it if you haven’t done so yet.): see description above

**VISIT COLLEGES if you can:** see description above

**START YOUR COLLEGE LIST:** Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least one SFSS (SureFire Safety School). What is a SureFire Safety School you ask? As a reminder, a SureFire Safety School is often your most important school. It’s one:

* where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats
* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA or Rolling
* AND you can see yourself being happy there
* AND it works financially for you and your family.

**KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES:** Sign up to ""request info"" from every college you’re interested in — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following the Common App, too. Also, it’s totally ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general front desk with questions.

# Senior Fall

All of the above....plus:

Finish up any **college visits especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.**

**COLLEGE LIST:** Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two SureFire Safeties (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing).

**COLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET:** Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for a spreadsheet.

**FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS:** Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.

**EARLY ACTION:** Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.

**FAFSA AND CSS:** Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.

**FINANCIAL AID:** Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them.

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and ""cheat sheet"" if you haven't yet.)

**YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR:** Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**SAT/ACT/SUBJECT TESTS:** Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates. 

**SUBMIT TEST SCORES:** Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools who don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted. 

**ESSAYS:** Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. How many Why College Essays do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. And then group the others. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1.

**INTERVIEWS:** Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read the website carefully. Some you are automatically signed up. Others require you to sign up yourself. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. Don’t worry (as long as you’ve checked your trash and junk mails). I do suggest that you do them though — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

**LOCI:** If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest).

## Senior Spring

**FINISH UP APPLICATIONS:** Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer).

**SUREFIRE SAFETY SCHOOL:** Make sure you have a SureFire Safety School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.

**KEEP THOSE GRADES UP:** Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing.

**TAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY:** Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control.

**EMOTIONAL PLANNING:** Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too connected to any college except for your SureFire Safety. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into.

**GRATITUDE:** Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.

**ENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL:** Connect with friends and family.

There are affordable schools here that I can go to, and overall my situation is one of privilege. I'm not looking at ""proper"" colleges tho, hence my wording.

College admissions has turned into such a cutthroat affair. And I get it, to some extent, because I can understand the near desperation of wanting to attend your dream school. But I don't want this whole process to turn us into enemies. We're in this together.

We've all come this far. We all DESERVE to get in. I know that everyone's situation is different. We have different test scores and GPAs, different ECs, different financial situations; some of us have struggled quietly with mental illness and burnout while others have faced tough living situations and environments. Yet what unites us is that we've all done the same thing: worked our absolute hardest to get where we are now, to finish our applications, and to send them in. 

A lot of us will get rejected. But it's not because any one of us is better or worse than the other-- we all have our stories to tell, our scars to show, and stats alone can't possibly define us. It's just how it is with a competitive school! 

I'm prepared to not get in. I know I'd be happy at any of the other schools I've applied to. But I'm hoping and dreaming, and I'm doing the same for every single one of you! 

So in this time of stress and waiting, and the waiting joy and tears at the end of the line, know that I'm proud of all of us. We've gotten this far! And we'll continue to go far, no matter where we go. But let's hope it's to our dream school.

Love you all! We got this.

436,fr4hru,False,Best of A2C,280,"A message to future international STEM applicants, particularly Asian students",ApplyingToCollege,"Admittedly, I'm using a throwaway account.

I'm currently an international freshman student at a certain college in America. I wanted to share some (unasked-for) insight for future international applicants who are interested in STEM.

First, my stats. I want to emphasize that I have no intention to brag about my accomplishments, so please don't take this the wrong way.

(To keep my anonymity, most stats are kept vague but are written so that the gist is understandable)

I am an Asian male looking to major in a certain field in engineering.

GPA:  4.0/4.0 (Constantly in the top two throughout all my years of high school, which is one of the top three high schools in my country. We need to pass multiple tests to enter our high school.)

SAT: 1560/1600, first try (not that that means anything)

SAT 2: 800/800, 800/800, first try (Math 2 and a certain science subject test)

Extracurricular activities *(Most are kept vague to preserve my anonymity):*

* Invented/Discovered a certain new thing under the mentoring of a university professor, published paper and accepted to present at an international conference
* Won national competition in a certain field. The twist was that other than me every other participant was a  college student pursuing their masters degree in the field
* Captain of a high school team competing for a certain well-known international contest
* Won in multiple national contests related to my field
* Started multiple clubs at my school, and every club has won a national award of some sort
* Recognized and was provided full-ride scholarship grant by my country for the four years of my college (excuse my passive voice)
* etc.

Most professors in my country who are in my field of interest knew who I was from my research and I've been interviewed for a news article too-which isn't an extracurricular, but I want to emphasize that my application can probably be considered to stand at a very high level.

Essays:

In my senior year, I've written 1216 essays (This includes short 100 word essays all the way up to the common app). I know; it sounds like BS, but it's true.

International students *WORK THEIR ASSES OFF.* I remember living on an hour of sleep and spending a constant five to six hours every day writing and rewriting essays for a whole year. I had everybody I knew (including a relative who has experience with college applications/essays) and consultant professionals check my essays.

After a grueling 1216 essays I was confident that my final products were the best I could produce. My common app way my revision number 83. I did everything I could, paying attention to each and every word in every essay, and admittedly submitted my application at 11:58 P.M. All my essays were perfectly at the word limit, which doesn't mean jack sh\*t but yeah.

Some parts I could've improved were my SATs and my submission time; I definitely could've spent more time grinding out practice tests to aim for a 1600, and while it's said to not have an effect on college decisions my submission time was probably a bit too close to the deadline.

Again, I'm not here to brag.

And now my results.

Out of the 21 schools I applied to, I was accepted to three and wait-listed/rejected by the rest. Yes, I applied to Ivy league and so-called ""T20"" schools. I got into one Ivy league school (No, not HYP) and two other very awesome STEM-focused schools who were kind enough to give me a smile of acceptance.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's my message to the fellow future STEM international applicants.

* The whole admissions process is ""unfair"" and biased in countless ways. Why? I'll explain in the following bullet points. But I guess that's just how life is.
* Asian + Male + STEM, especially CS, ME, or AE = You're going to have a very hard time.Yes, being female will increase your chances of getting into a better school; this is very clear from admission stats. I'm not trying to undermine the accomplishments of the accepted female students and saying that they've achieved less than their male counterparts; I'm saying that with the same/similar level of stats, most colleges will probably choose the female applicant. I'm also implying that yes, the ""each and every person is special!"" is BS.
* Contrary to popular belief, yield protection does exist.
* This is probably well-known already, but international students need to achieve WAY higher than the average student in America to obtain similar results, i.e., ""We consider each application without regards to race and ethnicity"" is obviously BS.If this was actually true, American colleges would be flooded with international students, particularly from China and India, but in that case, where would domestic students go?In other words, the international applicants from competitive backgrounds are most likely VERY, VERY smart. One person I know who goes to MIT is a math genius; not just the ""typical international math Olympics gold medalist,"" I'm talking Von Neumann-level of genius. Dude literally solved the hardest problem on the math Olympiad in under 15 seconds.That's the competition you're (or rather, us international students are/were) going up against. And one thing that tends to go unseen is that it's VERY, VERY difficult to even do an extracurricular in most Asian countries, whereas in America opportunities are abundant and handed out to students who want to participate in them.Colleges need to have ""diversity"" in their student body; they can't just admit every qualified international applicant (Which, in my opinion, is fair. Every country has colleges international students can go to, and American colleges are technically for American students in the first place). Your race/ethnicity/family income are all (uncontrollable) factors in your college application. Even if you're super good at what you do, if there are tons of others with the same conditions then you'll have a less chance of getting in compared to somebody who has ""achieved less"" but has unique uncontrollable characteristics. Accomplishment itself is a very relative factor.This is one reason why you shouldn't feel disappointed in yourself when you don't get accepted to a certain school; you were qualified-perhaps even more qualified than a portion of the admitted students-but you were waitlisted/rejected because of something you can't control. At my school, I hate to admit that around 70% of the people here aren't the shiny, omnipotent Ivy league students people think they are.
* As a STEM student, you aren't only judged by how smart you are. As in, you can't just be good at the technical stuff, unless you're so good that you're number one in the world and nothing else matters, even your grades and SAT. You must create an image of yourself where you're also good at things like PRing and the humanities, your ""compassion and care for others"" in your application in some way. I believe this holds true for the future, when we apply for jobs/positions too.This does go against the traditional  ""follow your true passions"" BS, but like explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion.
* This follows from the previous point, but if you want to get into a good school you are most likely better off pursuing something that sounds good on an application than your true passions.This is the reality.In my case, I was lucky enough to have my real passions work out for me at the end. I've continued my research in college, and things are working out quite well. But chances are most people won't be as lucky as I was.Sadly, you just can't write about your hobby of gardening unless you've obtained a really prestigious award which shows your ""artistic skills.""
* The vast majority of students from international countries who are applying as a STEM student and were accepted to HYPSM have an Olympic Medal or something close to that.No well-known international/national awards? You only have a slim chance of getting into T20s, and even if you do have a prestigious award, you still may not get in. In my case, everybody around me was shocked to learn that I didn't get into HYP. Again, I'm not trying to boast.
* Essays are very important for domestic students, not international students. Of course, there are outliers but in general your extracurriculars are what get you into T20 schools. But if you are willing to bet on that sliver of a chance where you're going to be that outlier, you're most likely in for a big disappointment. I'm not saying to give up and not try;  I'm saying to not aim too high and expect to prove reality wrong. Unless you're Einstein, it's probably not going to happen.

My point is, to all the Asian international male students who are looking to major in a field of engineering: I'm sorry, but most of you won't get into your top choices, especially if your top choices are Ivy League-level colleges if your extracurriculars aren't at a godly level. The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive.

From my personal experience and what I've heard from others, this is the harsh truth.

EDIT: This post is by any means not to discourage future applicants.

(2) For all her AP classes, she cheated on tests and quizzes through the papers given to her by her upperclassman friends and when students report her, the teachers are all like “____ is a good student.

If you're a low performing student, chances are your teachers will try to get rid of you. Got caught for talking during an exam? A low performing student will be likely be either suspended or expelled, afterall your going away will make the school's record better.

Funny story- Even after cheating, I finished my paper just the same time as the class topper and even scored literally the same number. 

I may never know is the topper was a cheater too or not.

322,gmdryc,False,Discussion,140,TRULY UNPOPULAR OPINION : Online APs are a Necessary Evil,ApplyingToCollege,"On this sub, it appears the general sentiment is that College Board is some giant scam that purposely created an unfair online test-taking experience. While some of this is true (I certainly disagree with College Board's status as a monopoly and supposed ""non-profit""), there are certain parts that I think are just completely false. Here are some of my points...

**1. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THE CURRENT TESTING SITUATION**

While I understand it is frustrating, I believe it is important to think about the predicament that College Board is in. They must create a standardized test that all universities can trust as a method to gauge course understanding, as well as assuring that this test is accessible and achievable for the average student. As well as this, they must try to maintain the authenticity and security of these results when they are being taken AT HOME. Given all of this information, what all could they really do? If they had decided to import the ENTIRE test online (multiples essays, short answers, multiple choice), students would complain about the difficulty and there would likely be even more technical difficulties due to people's internet cutting out across such a long time span. If they had made a longer test and more relaxed time requirements, it would give students even more ability to cheat and share answers, further compromising the security of the test. While imperfect, I think the current format for test-taking is about as good as they could have gotten it. My only real gripe is that I wish the personalized email option had been open to the first week test takers, but I suppose hind-sight is 20/20. Regardless, I would like to hear if anyone on this sub has a better alternative to the current testing format, genuinely.

**2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO CANCEL ALL THE TESTS**

Another common sentiment I see on this sub is that tests should have been cancelled right out of the gate. This is simply an immature thought in my opinion. If they had done this, I have no doubt that people on this subreddit would have been livid given the fact that they had just been robbed of the opportunity to gain college credit. I know personally, a large number of my friends are counting on their current APs to exempt them from a number of their college classes. While the current testing format is imperfect, I appreciate that given all of this craziness, we are still given the ability to further our education. Additionally, If you truly believe this testing situation is too unfair, College Board is accepting all refunds so you don't have to take them if you don't want to (I understand some schools require you to take the test as a final/mandatory curriculum. I do think this is unfair)

**3. THE REPORTS WE HEAR ARE LARGELY EFFECTED BY BIAS**

I am extremely empathetic of those who experienced technical difficulties when submitting their APs, but it is important to realize that the reports we hear are largely inflated by selection bias. Those who have technical difficulties are more likely to voice their concerns than those who did not. This effect is often called the ""vocal minority."" Again, while unfortunate, it appears that no test in week one had a failure-to-submit rate of more than 8%. That is still a sizable number and should be considered, but is definitely not the amount that is being portrayed by this sub. It should also be said that those who experienced errors (at least in my class) commonly did not take the required submit time (5 minutes) and instead gambled by attempting to submit with 2 or less minutes left. While this is obviously unfortunate as well, it should be understood that at least some of the submits errors were user-based issues

**CONCLUSION**

It needs to be said that the current situation we are in is difficult. We are taking a test that is different from what we have prepared the entire year for and it is completely fair to be upset. However, painting College Board as this purposely malicious entity is simply not true. I believe there are improvements that could be made on the current system (The retest window should happen RIGHT after week 2, there should have been more stress-testing done on the current website, email option should have been standard, greater accessibility to test taking options), but I also think that the current iteration we have is pretty okay and not as bad as everyone is displaying it as.

44,efh3em,False,Serious,130,Admissions broke me and I want everyone to know they don’t have to break you.,ApplyingToCollege,"Merry Christmas everyone! I just discovered this subreddit last night and was just absolutely fascinated by the content on this subreddit. I see a tremendous amount of good information, bad information, and misinformation. I just wanted to share with you all what it’s like going to college since I’ve just graduated and what that admissions process looked like for me.

As a senior in high school in 2014-2015, I had a ton of the same aspirations as the rest of the people on this subreddit. I had 4.0 GPA out of 4.0 (5th in my class) and 2120 on my SAT when it was out of 2400 (1460 composite with Math and English). To digress slightly, I just also want to tell everyone you can absolutely improve your SAT/ACT if you work hard enough, my PSAT was an 1080 Math and English composite. I forgot what I got on my two SAT II’s but both were in the 760+ range. All 5’s on my half-dozen AP tests in a variety of subjects. I was a varsity level soccer player, an Eagle Scout, and the President of the Literary Magazine. However, I was also a white, middle-class Long Islander who went to a Catholic high school. I knew that I wouldn’t be getting any extra bumps on my applications but I was certain I would be able to stand out.

I don’t blame my college guidance counselor for setting me up for anything, but she motivated me to apply to a lot of top programs on the East Coast and led me to believe that I can get into any of them, barring maybe one or two universities. 

I had a ton of high hopes. I applied to 18 colleges (something I totally discourage anyone from doing, it really should be 8-12 tops). It required a tremendous amount of effort, it was expensive, and if you’re a good student like I was, it can totally cripple your ability to make a decision come time. I sacrificed every waking moment that I wasn’t in school or doing something else for extracurriculars applying to colleges. 

The process was extremely tedious, frustrating, and aggravating. However, once those January deadlines hit, all I had to do was wait. 

In the meantime, my school had even nominated me for the Jefferson Scholarship at the University of Virginia. I then went through their own tedious application process. Thankfully, I was asked to interview and was then later told I was a finalist for the NYC area and would likely be invited to the final interview/selection process at UVA. I was elated. I truly thought I was going anywhere I wanted and my unstoppable work ethic (which I now realize was unhealthy) had finally payed off. My parents had assured me that I could go anywhere as well, depending on if they were good enough. I had a college fund, but I also have two siblings so it wasn’t substantial.

When everything began to come back, it started off extremely well. On a whim I had applied to Creighton (I love Big East basketball) and was shocked to find a package that included a full-ride offer and a handwritten letter from the Head of Admissions practically begging me to attend. There was also an offer to pay for my flight and accommodations to Omaha considering I hadn’t visited the campus. Everything was going great. Early action admissions came back and all of them included near or total scholarships, as well as acceptance into their honors programs. My life felt like a film about great success and overcoming hardship. I was happy about these admissions results, but none of the really top programs had gotten back to me yet at this point and of course I wasn’t going to attend any of these *peon* schools (if you couldn’t tell, I was becoming arrogant). 

Then February and March arrived. On the same day, I was deferred from UVA and denied from the Jefferson Scholarship, denied from Columbia, and waitlisted at Williams College. I was later denied from Georgetown (a school I legitimately thought was a safety for me, but I later learned they hadn’t accepted a student from my high school in 10+ years) and received no money from Boston College or Notre Dame. Schools I thought would give me more money ended up giving me none or not enough. I was also later denied from UVA and Williams College altogether.

Devastation doesn’t begin to describe what I felt. It’s normal to be upset about these types of things, but it’s not normal to refuse to eat for multiple days and either be crying or on the verge of tears at all waking hours. When I told my college guidance counselor about the results, all she could do was say she was sorry. I think she realized what she might’ve done and apologized to my parents for setting me up with these types of expectations. My parents told me how proud of me they were everyday but it didn’t matter. I genuinely felt worthless and stupid. I wanted to kill myself.

The worst part of this whole experience was that I also began to resent people who I considered my friends. I had a friend who was being *sued* by Columbia because she applied early decision only for her to be accepted into MIT and she pulled out. Multiple people I knew with worse SAT’s, extracurriculars, and GPA were all getting money from and/or into the schools I wanted to attend. Every word of reassurance became white noise. I didn’t know what to do and felt like my life was over. 

It is now the end of April and my parents are begging me to decide on what college to attend. I just start listing off the schools in terms of their rankings.

“Notre Dame”

“It’s too expensive.”

“Boston College”

“It’s too expensive.”

“Fordham”

“Your scholarship isn’t big enough.”

We then get to the schools that I can feasibly attend at their price range.  The thing is I didn’t want to attend any of them; they were beneath me and the work I had accomplished. I was completely obstinate to the reality of the situation. They said “you can basically attend these 4-5 colleges,” but they were really hoping I picked the one that multiple people in my town had attended and reportedly loved. However, I had hated my tour of the place and simply did not want to go there. The school did though offer me a 60% scholarship and entrance into their Honors Program. They even told me that a family friend’s daughter, who had been accepted into UVA, chose to attend this school and loved it. I was really upset and tried to stop myself from crying through the whole process, but I ultimately trusted their judgement. 

I can say with definite certainty that I tried to like the place I attended. I joined clubs, tried to meet people in the dorms, went to sporting events, etc. It just wasn’t working. I was so lonely and sad and angry about everything that I shut down. I still attended class and finished my first semester with a 4.0 having taken 19 credits, but it all felt hollow. I was dead-set on transferring out of there and was certain with my performance in college thus far, anywhere would be accessible. Someone had even told me transferring is the way to get into some of these programs. 

Not only was I rejected from all the top schools I had applied to the previous year, but I was rejected from some schools that had previously offered me scholarships! I was also beginning to hear from my friends who were a year younger than me getting into these programs I had wanted to attend, which hurt me further. With limited options, I realized I would have to graduate from my current college. I would be stuck there for four years. 

I’ve used the word devastation before, but it doesn’t really encapsulate the absolute darkness that encompassed me. I began to think I was an alien (not like a space alien). I felt like I had been lied to and that the world was for other people and not for me. 

At this point in time, I now recognize in hindsight that I was in the process of developing serious undiagnosed depression. I began to sleep for 16 hours a day and felt tired while I was awake. I would only eat when I felt I was about to faint from exhaustion/malnutrition. I kept trying to make friends and make the most out of my experience, but nothing was working. By the end of the year, I had been denied from the two clubs on campus that had the closest thing to a family bond/fraternity vibe to them.

Every day I thought about killing myself (I even took up smoking as a nonviolent way of slowly killing myself). I thought about the girl at Brown down the road who didn’t deserve her spot there while I lived in the closest thing to Hell on earth. I would pray to God every night begging him to tell me where I went wrong. 

I returned for my sophomore year in an even worse condition. I was eating less and sleeping even more. I was sleeping so much I was going to bed at 6PM and having trouble getting up for 8:30AM lectures. I looked awful. I had hair down to my back (I’m a guy), didn’t shower, and smoked half-a-pack of cigarettes a day. I couldn’t even do my work anymore, the one thing I valued myself on through my entire life. It was long process that will make a long story even longer, but this all culminated in me medically withdrawing from school in the Fall of my Junior Year. 

It took 9 months of therapy, medication, and love, but I willed myself back to that campus determined to just basically finish and get out of there.

I don’t know what it was, but a paradigm shift in my perspective occurred. I would like to state that I always thought my professors there were brilliant, I was just unhappy about the prestige of the school and my abysmal social life. But I began to realize that that these people are here because they (1) got offered a job in an extremely competitive field, and (2) because they themselves are extremely qualified. I don’t know why it took me so long, but the “esoteric knowledge” of the books I was reading was not limited to the faculty and resources in the schools I had wanted to attend. This made me feel substantially better about the education I was receiving. I also began to make genuine steps towards making friends. I was able to join one of the clubs I had been denied from in my freshman year. Funny enough, one of their responsibilities was giving tours! I was happy for the first time in a while.

Nevertheless, it was still difficult. My depression robbed me of much of the work ethic I once possessed. It took much more effort to do the same activities I could do with ease as a senior in high school or as a freshman. This means I did not graduate with a 4.0 (3.6, barely cum laude). However, I grew to love my school. It was a long and complex time, and I graduated a semester late, but I’m happy I went there. Apparently, I’m poised to win the top English prize for my senior thesis and am presenting at the Senior Symposium. Just to have the opportunity to thank my school and my professors for their help and guidance would be an incredible opportunity. 

I wrote this down as a way of expressing to others the obscene damage that the expectations you put on yourself can do to you. To be fair, I think I always predisposed to depression considering my fragile emotional state and this might’ve developed later in life but that’s beside the point. The catalyst for this all was my college applications. Hell, it mattered so much to me that when my dad told me that a family friend’s son had gotten into Yale a few days ago, I nearly cried and I’m already out of college. It’s fucking pathetic (but I recognize it’s fucked up and I’m still working on fixing myself).

But I’m not like most people. I was an elitist who wanted to join elitist institutions. I still do to an extent. I’m looking at all these scores on these tests that you guys post about and there’s tinges of envy popping up inside of me. Some of you might even think I was delusional for ever thinking I could go to those top programs in the first place, but hey, I and no one here will ever know why things turned out the way they did. But I also recognize now that for me to have been this upset about college admissions when I knew how things would turn out, I have no idea why I was so upset.

The thing is though, opportunity has found its way into every facet of my life. When God shut doors, he always opened windows whether I knew it or not. I’ve learned so much at college about my majors and myself it’s hard to think I could’ve wanted it any other way. I just want people to know that I know how rough and disappointing it can be. It’s not fair. But it’s also not designed to be fair. Don’t let these things stop you from becoming the person you are meant to be. I should’ve been able to see the overwhelming amount of positivity I received earlier in the process and realized just how much these schools were wrong about me. You will be accomplished anywhere you go. Don’t let *anyone* tell you that you’re not good enough. What some admissions officer thinks about your application is not indicative of who you are as a human being. It is not the total indictment of character and intelligence that I thought it was. 

I know this is so long and I genuinely respect anyone who’s read to the end of this, but if I have only one piece of advice for anyone here, it’s be kind to yourself. I was so profoundly unkind to myself for so long that my brain stopped working correctly. 

This will not define you. This goes both ways. Going to a “lesser” college means nothing of your intelligence. One of the biggest losers I know went to Columbia and he’s still a fucking loser a year after he graduated. It’s what you make of it. 

Enjoy your senior year of high school. Meet people. Have sex. Make mistakes. Drink too much. Discover what you love. Find out who you are. That’s what college is for and nearly any place will give you this opportunity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/efh3em/admissions_broke_me_and_i_want_everyone_to_know/,3777,">1460 composite

176,cqkgri,False,,280,Poor kids have it worse. In response to middle class complaints on this sub.,ApplyingToCollege,"It's a pretty common notion here that middle class kids get fucked over the worst with financial aid - because rich kids can afford to pay in full, and poor kids qualify for lots of aid. And I'm not going to refute that middle class people do get fucked over quite often. Middle class kids often don't qualify for the aid that they would benefit from, and that's not a good thing.

The notion that middle class kids have it *worse* than poor kids is incredibly insensitive and wrong, though.

Someone made a comment on one of the recent front page ""the middle class gets the shortest end of the stick :("" posts with something to the effect of ""the poor will always have it worse"" and I want to echo that sentiment and make sure some of y'all get a little clarity on what being poor is actually like.

So sure, poor kids get a lot of financial aid. Might get all of their tuition, all of their room and board paid for. That doesn't account for all the other expenses, though. That doesn't account for food, for all of the living supplies like toiletries, cleaning supplies, new sheets because nobody owns a Twin XL at home. And while everyone has these expenses, they're a lot bigger of a burden on poor people, and y'all better not have the audacity to try and refute that. Simply living on a day to day basis can be a challenging expense for some folks.

I'll use the disclaimer that I'm poor, so yeah, I'm going to be more sensitive to my fellow poor kids. I got over 3/4 of my tuition and housing paid for with need-based aid. But that's only the beginning of the expenses. I feel guilty buying the things that I need to live in college. Even buying things from the thrift store and the dollar store - I still feel horrible for the burden it is on my parents. Because that's what it's like. Buying sheets is a burden. Buying a hamper for my laundry. Paying for laundry. Paying for books. We already skimp on breakfast sometimes if we haven't gotten paid yet and don't have the spare fucking 2 dollars for a dozen eggs. I'm worried for how they'll fare this year after I've left, with monthly tuition bills on top of every other expense.

Being poor isn't some great circumstance that middle class kids should somehow envy. It fucking sucks. And while I understand that it's frustrating not to receive financial aid, I promise you that you are NOT getting the shortest end of the stick. It's really disheartening and disgusting to see people on here acting like being middle class is the worst thing that happened to them, and that somehow, they've got it worse off than poor people. **Being poor isn't worth all the financial aid in the world.**

Sorry if this comes off as mean, but I'm at my wits' end and I'm absolutely disgusted with the misunderstanding of poorness on this sub. Not everybody here acts like it, but I have seen far too many posts here complaining about how middle class kids have it the worst for college, and far too many of them are making it to the front page. I understand your frustration. But not one of you would want to live a day in a poor kid's shoes. It's insensitive to erase those struggles and act as though your lack of financial aid is a bigger problem than things like, I don't know, poverty.

399,fmrv9g,False,Best of A2C,98,What I learned from my Stanford Deferral,ApplyingToCollege,"A few months ago I got deferred from Stanford. I was excited at the possibility of being a competitive candidate and maybe even attending my absolute dream school; however, I saw everyone else that got deferred as competition and factors I needed to be better than. After joining a chat with about 20 other deferees ( all from Reddit)- who were all amazing in their own right- I fell into a depression and suffered from major imposter syndrome, because many had done actual research and had national awards. Ultimately, they all scared me and it felt like my chance to attend my absolute dream school was slipping away from me. I had trouble texting them and just tried not come across as stupid, but one night everyone was sharing parts of their applications and their personal narrative. I decided to join along and learned a great deal about everyone in the chat and when I shared my story I was met with an unbelievable amount of support. The people in the chat with me started to become more than just my competition but other people who worked just as hard- if not harder- and wanted to attend Stanford just as much as I did. (I'm avoiding names cause I want to keep it private) There is one girl who constantly tells us how much she loves us, one who is the nicest person I've ever met, a boy we joke is our admissions officer, a really tall kid that believes in everyone, and so much more I couldn't possibly put into words. It really hit me that applying to these big schools makes you think you're against everyone else applying when, in reality, we're all just trying our hardest to achieve our goals and succeed in life. Every achievement in our group is met with an applause from everyone, and believe me these kids are out-of-this-world intelligent. We have people that got into MIT, a large number of likely letters from Ivy Leagues, a Duke likely, so many T20 acceptances already, and so many crazy smart people. I used to think kids like this were robots, but they are so human. We eat whole bottles of mayonnaise, preform the orchestra version of the Wii theme, tell dirty jokes, and spend so many hours just being high schoolers. After spending so long with them- and as Stanford approaches- I can't help but think that I no longer care if my spot goes to one of them. Will I be upset, yes; however, I know its another kid that is just trying to succeed. They all deserve as much as I do- if not more. However, I've also seen how unpredictable the process is, kids that got likely letters from Ivys get rejected from MIT or people from MIT don't get into other less prestigious schools. I don't say this to degrade them because they are easily some of the smartest people I've met- much smarter than me- but to show how fickle the whole process is. All in all, as Ivy Day and Stanford approaches I hope y'all can realize that the whole process is unpredictable and isn't indicative of your worth at all. Everyone on this sub is just a human trying to live their own unique experience. We're not each other's competition we're just kids. We're all on this Earth confused about what to do and how to make our dreams come true.

If any of my fellow Stanford Eggs are reading this I hope you all get in and I would give the world to be able to attend Stanny with you for the next four years. Hopefully we can beat the 15%-25% acceptance rate! Even if I don't get in I wouldn't change a thing. I loved meeting all of you and bonding over our love for Stanford and learning. After Stanford decisions we may never talk again, but I hope you know you truly touched my heart!

TLDR: Apply to big schools even if you think you're unqualified the best case scenario may change your life. Heck, I did and got deferred and got to meet some amazing people. Other candidates aren't your competition they're just kids like you- many have worked just as hard and want to attend just as much. Lastly, go easy on yourself. You're just a kid and college is confusing. A rejection doesn't mean anything and you're not inferior for receiving it; vice versa for an acceptance.

Also we're considering starting a youtube channel just as a resource for kids deferred from Stanford and to show what we wrote and did to get into great schools like MIT, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Vanderbilt, UCLA, Duke, Stanford(hopefully), and so many more great schools)

They compare your app to the other people in your area, and if the other people in your area are interning for presidential nominees, you've been beat.

Also, you're definitely NOT taking advantage. Maybe its different in DC, but over here many internships and volunteer opportunities do not require citizenship.

634,edyphz,False,Best of A2C,63,How To Handle Imposter Syndrome,ApplyingToCollege,"You got in!  Congrats!  And everyone is clapping you on the back and beaming with pride for you, but somehow you feel...uneasy.  You can't shake the voice inside saying there's no way you deserved this.  Other people who had better stats got rejected, so this must have been a mistake.  Maybe they gave you way too much credit for your essays, or your URM status, or something.  Whatever the reason, you didn't earn this, and you're way over your head in a place you don't belong.  How will you cope with the guilt, cratered self-esteem, and nagging doubt?

1.  If you're feeling out of place or like you have major imposter syndrome, first recognize that this is a good thing.  It means you're doing so well for yourself that you feel out of place being so awesome and successful.  Success is what you make it, not how you feel compared to your peers.  So don't let it bother you.  Instead, you should feel good about having achieved so much and attained something great, regardless of whether or not you ""deserved"" it.

2.  This may shock you, but there's really only one reason you got in - they wanted you there.  And that alone means you deserve it.  Admission is holistic, so even if your GPA/SAT/ECs or whatever weren't the best in their admitted class, you had other things they loved.  Top schools receive tens of thousands of applicants and deny ~90% of them.  Many of those 90% were probably ""more academically qualified"" than you.  But they wanted you. 

3.  There are some 50 people fully engaged in the admissions process at most top schools.  These people are the world's foremost experts on their admissions, what they look for, how they decide who ""deserves"" it, etc.  **And they chose you.**  If JK Rowling tells you how to interpret a certain passage of Harry Potter, do you question her and instead trust your friend who just read it for the first time last week?  If Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier, and Feng Zhang explain something about CRISPR to you, do you instead trust your peers who ""totally aced"" AP Biology?  If Katie Bouman tells you how to take a picture of a black hole, do you instead trust some people in your class who just got an SLR and telescope and are now experts on astronomical photography?  That would be asinine, worthless, lame, anti-vax, flat-earth BS.  Those people are not only the top experts on those subjects, they own them.  Every nuance and detail is meticulously shepherded and it's all entirely under their purview.  I'm struggling to even express how ridiculous it is for someone to second guess this or say they know better than the admissions office when it comes to their own admissions process.

4.  One of the lesser known facts about college admissions is that a few points on your GPA or SAT aren't really that big of a deal.  Colleges will often take an applicant with lower stats because of something else interesting or compelling in their application.  Maybe they have a unique and valuable skill.  Maybe they just seem like a really incredible person.  Maybe their achievements are indicative of a much higher ceiling.  Sure, a 1500 is going to be viewed very differently from a 1200, but it's not that different from a 1550 and many colleges even use SAT bands instead of actual scores in their rubrics because they don't want to use a microscope on it or overemphasize a few meaningless multiple choice questions.  

5.  Your job is not to justify getting in, it's to make the most of it now that you've earned this amazing opportunity.  You don't need to justify it to anyone **not even yourself**.  So stop trying.  Instead just focus on being the best you.  I'm going to say that again a little louder for the folks in back:

#You do not need to justify this to anyone, NOT EVEN YOURSELF.

6\.  Recognize that imposter syndrome never really goes away.  You will probably feel it at your first job out of college, after every promotion, after you start your own company, after you get elected, or whatever else you achieve.  Research indicates that even the very best people in the world at what they do still feel imposter syndrome, regardless of how accomplished they are.  So recognize that you're not alone.  Part of this comes from being the world's foremost expert on your own weaknesses, but it's not your incompetence or inadequacy or even your insecurity driving this - it's your humanity.  So don't feel like this sensation is bad or wrong or indicative of a problem.  It just means you're a real person just like everyone else.  Embrace it, lean into it, and let that nervous energy empower you.  Learn to live with being a better person than you think you have any right to be - it just means you're awesome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edyphz/how_to_handle_imposter_syndrome/,1203,"I used to watch college vids nonstop day and night through out high school.

You're going to want to squeeze out every second possible before submitting those applications. (and it usually means 11:59:59 in the time zone where the college is located)

Do yourself a favor and pretend the deadline is a day or two earlier though.  You may have less time than you think.

It didn't happen last year, but in the past the Common App has been swamped on deadline day and had outages and severe lag.  Some people say there were DDOS attacks two years ago, but it's hard to distinguish between DDOS attacks and a company just not having a robust enough server to handle additional load.  Be that as it may, this forum was filled with anguish as people watched their chance to submit an application in the early round slip away with 'unable to connect' and the spinning hourglass/rainbow circle.

Even if the Common App manages to handle the load, there are local outages that can hit you.  Transformers blow.  This time of year we can have windstorms and in the north we can get early snow.  Internet access dies at random for someone every year.

Don't let that happen to you.  Pretend that the deadline is October 30.

482,b5jplt,False,,215,UPDATE to the post: My crush rejected me because she's committing to UCLA,ApplyingToCollege,"Okay so I'm just gonna start of by saying today has been the craziest day of my life. So I told you guys I was gonna ask out the AP lit girl, which I did but before that something else happened. 


During one of the longer passing periods/breaks (15 min), I was at my locker just grabbing my textbook, you know the usual, when the UCLA girl who I asked out comes up to me. We just say hi and and stuff and talk about a class and then there's this awkward silence, which she breaks by saying, and I'm being dead serious, ""look, if you want to date, I'm down but the reason I didn't want to at first is because I really hate USC and if we date I feel like I might want to hurt you"" 

Like any normal person, I was thinking WTF. Literally reminded me of that ""sweet but psycho"" song idk but holy shit. I was inwardly freaking the fuck out but played it cool and told her I understand and it's okay, and that we probably shouldn't date then. She just nodded and left and I just stood by my locker for like 5 min wondering what the hell just happened. 

So the break ends and I'm in AP Calc thinking that maybe I just heard her wrong. Maybe she meant emotionally hurt? So I kinda just pretend nothing happened and then 5th period AP LIT finally comes and I see the girl who my friend said likes me (let's call her Selia) sitting in her usual spot. The class was kinda empty except for like 5 people since we had 6 min before class started and people literally rush in literally 1 min before class starts. Anyway, so I go up to her and talk about the hw before saying something like ""Hey Selia, so I was wondering if you wanted to go out tonight, maybe go bowling?"" (No flames pls I know I'm not the smoothest cactus out there)

But her face just lit up and she was like ""Really? Sure!"" We exchanged phone numbers and stuff and I don't know if it was cuz she looked super happy or maybe cuz I was gonna go on my first date with someone (yeah again, no flames pls) but I just felt warm inside. And thankful that my friend wasn't trolling me and that she actually liked me lol. 

Anyway, flash forward to the end of the day, I'm heading to the parking lot and when I get to my car, I see it was keyed with the words ""UCLA Forever"" etched into it. And normally I'd have been annoyed but prolly get over it but I just got this car a few weeks ago for my birthday so I was pissed. I look around the car to see if there was anything else and notice the opposite side of the car was keyed with the words ""Fuck USC"" and then a happy face. At this point I'm livid. 

So as I'm driving home, I'm tryna think of who could have done this and then I remember what that UCLA girl said when I was by my locker. I don't know for sure if it was her, but I'm more scared than angry at this point. If it was her, holy shit. Like i'm not tryna get killed here over some stupid rivalry. 

Anyway, I get home and tell my Dad and he's kinda mad, especially since I didn't go back to the school office and tell someone. But he said it should be fine cuz he knows a car maintenance/ paint job guy who could probably fix it for free. 

So after that fiasco, at like 4 p.m, I went and picked up my date (drove my mom's car) and we went went bowling and had some food after and it was actually REALLY fun. She's pretty shy so I didn't really know her that well before this, but we share a lot of the same interests and she's... wow. I mean she's pretty, but her personality is just insanely adorable lol sorry if that's cringey but I got me some butterflies in the tummy rn. When I walked her to her porch, she kissed my cheek goodbye and... well my cheek is still tingling. I know for sure I'm infatuated with her, but I hope it turns out to be something more. So happy. Oh and she's most likely gonna attend UCSD so Go Tritons! No crazy UCLA shenanigans on her part. 

I'm legit on cloud 9 rn haha but anyway I guess if there's a moral to be taken from this, don't have a crush on psycho girls (or guys). And also, don't be afraid to interact with people you don't really talk with. You don't have to date them but who knows they may be really cool people!

Edit: I will update when I find out if the UCLA girl is actually the one that did this. Will have to be sneaky about it though.

EDIT TLDR: Enjoy having little responsibilities.


I know most of you young seniors can’t wait to get out of highschool, but really, cherish your senior year. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a sophomore in college and it’s loads more fun than highschool, but I would be lying (along with like everyone else I know) if I said I didn’t miss being a high schooler. I know it sounds like I want to relive glory days or whatever, but really, life becomes a lot more difficult in college and you actually have real responsibilities and essentially become an adult. Enjoy your senior year, don’t go too ham, have some fun with it, it will be the last year you truly at to be a “kid”. 


On another note, don’t stress if you don’t attend like an Ivy League because the truth is, it doesn’t matter. If you are attending a good university, ranging from like A&M to Harvard, there are no closed doors for you. Every oppurtunity that exist graduating from Harvard would exist for any other “good” college as well, at that point employers don’t care too much where you attended since they both give you a sufficient education, they care more about how you did there, and how you as a person will fit into their team.

Anyways, I told my brother pretty chill and at first he was like yelling, then he calmed down but his eyes were glazed and he kept muttering ""are you being serious...you're being serious...no...oh my god"" and then he started crying. Mind you, this kid is like 19, about to be 20, he has never cried in front of me before, and we have fought to death on things over the years; we've made each other bleed (*edit: not that it matters much, but I am a girl.

We both grew up and our relationship has gotten better but we can still fall back on that fighting territory pretty easily haha So just watching him so happy...God, that's not something a person can buy.

My other brother is about 22, but he has Schiz and stays at home. He rarely talks but I love him to bits. A couple months ago I was asking him how he would feel if I moved away and he just looked away and muttered he wouldn't like that. He already felt betrayed by our other brother who moved away for college and outright refused to talk  to him on the phone for a long time.

I haven't talked to him yet but I have the opportunity to stay home and I want to tell him (I'm away rn).

I had a brutal admissions process. I applied to a bunch of T20 and T40 business schools - rejected by nearly every school besides a few targets and my safeties. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out where I went wrong, questioning myself, etc. Eventually got over it and figured I would be alright because I was happy with some of the target schools I got accepted to. Got the financial aid for my target schools and couldn't come close to affording any of them, leaving me with only one option -- my state school. I had been waitlisted by one target and one reach, but I had low expectations so I lived as though I was going to my state school. And then the call came. The school I had no hopes of getting into was offering me a spot. ""I am calling to offer you a spot at Cornell's Dyson School."" The school I applied to on a whim just because of its state tuition benefits. The school I figured I had the least chance of getting into, given its 3% acceptance rate. After getting rejected from every other school on and even below its level, for some reason they waitlisted me. I still had no hope because the waitlist itself was about a 3% chance to get off of. But they saw something on me that apparently none of the other schools saw, and they gave me a chance. Waitlist miracles do happen.

I withdrew my applications to every college I submitted an application to. I decided to enlist in the Air Force instead. I swore into the Delayed Entry Program just before Christmas and I've never been happier.

Why did I decide to forego college? Its not because I couldn't go anywhere or because the military was a last resort option. I have good stats (33 ACT, 3.87 GPA, strong ECs, and several prestigious awards). It wasn't because I couldn't afford college (between savings, scholarships, financial aid, and half of a GI Bill, I could've paid for college with minimal debt.

I enlisted because I really wanted to. I haven't booked a specific job yet, but hopefully I'll end up in an Aircrew or Intelligence job. I am going to complete my Bachelor's on Uncle Sam's dime (thank you to all of you who pay taxes, its appreciated) and then get a Master's degree paid for by my GI Bill once I get out of the military. I can do all of that in about the same amount of time that it would take to finish six years of university (BA and MA) level education.

I'll be 19 years old making a decent salary with no debt and very few living expenses, complete health care, amazing opportunities, guaranteed college tuition support, and probably a Top Secret clearance. 

So I urge you, if someone you know decides to forego college entirely and forge their own path, military or otherwise, support them. Don't tell them they're throwing their future away. Don't say ""But you have so much potential."" I'm excited about my future and the opportunity to get a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a career opportunity debt-free. I'm not throwing my future away, I'm taking a while to do what I love and reap the maximum possible benefits from it and hopefully come out ahead.

Best of luck to all of you as you select your colleges and finish your apps. I love you guys and I want the world for you.

Bye for now ✌️

EDIT: So a lot of people seem to think that I'm drinking the Kool-Aid. I'm not. I was born on an Air Force base and I've spent the last 18 years moving 13 times, seeing my dad go on numerous deployments and too many TDYs to count. I know it takes a toll on families (my parents are now divorced) and I know its not an idyllic patriotic heaven of all benefit and no pain. It sucks sometimes. That's okay. I know what I'm getting myself into. I'm also not getting screwed over by my recruiter. My dad used to do recruiting and has helped me cut through the BS and really get what I want. I'm gonna be okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/egq6he/after_a_stressful_season_of_applications_ive/,1663,Hey how is one supposed to get that top secret clearance again? ,2019-12-28 12:22:31

651,edgr7z,False,,85,Fu*ck you Lehigh. You are an asshole.,ApplyingToCollege,"I called Lehigh after that incident (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ed4jff/what_the_fuk_lehigh_how_can_you_do_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The admission office told me that they were sorry. I elaborated them my situation and how hard it has been for me now. 

The lady noted my phone number and said that I will soon get a call from someone at Lehigh. The time was around ( 8:30 am in Lehigh). I waited for the call for 3 hours but got no response. I called them again, and she said that the respective official is in the different call. ""Oh, okay"", I said.

Then I called them, again and again, and she said the same thing. I called them again, and again the same thing. And slowly they didn't even receive the call 

I made my last call at 4:45 pm in Lehigh. I didn't sleep for the whole night. I repeatedly made call for ""8"" hours. Now when I call again, and it says that business hours are over and to make a call on Monday. 

So they played with me? I will never forgive them for this and will not call them again. I pray for their demise. Such an asshole institution. 

P.S: Thanks to all A2C member who consoled me in a hard time. Now I'll not look back at that fucking college. I'll move on. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Edit: They called me by themselves just now and said that they are ready to offer me any help and i should look forward apply to other colleges. They were ready to provide me admission but since financial aid budget is out, they couldn't. And if i could pay the full cost now, they will accept me. 

And I'll obviously not pay anything more than my previous EFC. Looking forward now. Thanks guys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/edgr7z/fuck_you_lehigh_you_are_an_asshole/,1178,Lehigh university? More like Le high school with all that drama lol ,2019-12-20 21:59:43

Now these videos are all on Youtube so you can visit them without leaving home!

&#x200B;

**In each video, there are some stats by ""looking down"":**

\- USNews undergrad rank from 2010 - 2015 - 2020

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. I couldn't find this info aggregated anywhere so I went to every school's website and added tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.

\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com

\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)

\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines

\- Nearest major city and relevant stats

&#x200B;

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I felt really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a ""feel"" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

**For more immersive playback**

1. Youtube defaults to 720p – 1080p playback, which is too low for 360° video. Click the settings icon and change to 4k for MUCH better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For wider field of view, play back on your computer in full screen mode (F11) and scroll down on your mouse. You’ll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest field of view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!

304,f148vp,False,,133,Extremely inappropriate interviewer,ApplyingToCollege,"Sorry if this post comes off like word vomit but I need to get this off my chest because I haven’t told anyone about it yet. I had my Dartmouth interview a couple days ago with a man who was probably 50 years older than me and he was being really inappropriate the entire time. We met in a Starbucks. He complimented me multiple times on my outfit, jewelry, hair, and was very insistent on telling me about the social scene at Dartmouth. I would try to ask about academics or atmosphere and he would steer the conversation back to what the dating scene was like there. He told me to “stay safe at frat parties because God knows what those boys would do to a girl like you.” He asked me if I was part Asian and when I said yes he said his girlfriend during his junior year was Asian. During the interview, he would put his hand on my knee/thigh and keep it there for a minute. He was also constantly staring at my chest. When it was finally over he said he wanted to walk me back to my car and I said that’s okay I need to use the bathroom and he said he would wait for me. I didn’t want him to say I was rude on his review of me so I just washed my hands and let him walk me to my car with his hand on my lower back the whole time. 

The entire time I just felt like he was too close to me, he was practically breathing down my neck at one point. He wouldn’t stop touching me even though I would shrink away from it, and he wouldn’t answer any of my questions. After I saw him drive away I just sat in my car and cried for a while. I don’t know if I can explicitly say it was harassment because I never told him to stop touching me or to stop looking at my breasts but I still feel so disgusting knowing he was looking at me like I’m just a slab of meat. 

He knows my name, email, and my phone number and probably lots of other information about me. At multiple times throughout the interview he said he was good friends with lots of people in the admissions office so I’m scared he’s gonna say something bad about me if I report it. I also just want it to be over, I don’t ever want to have to see him or talk about him again. I have no proof that he was harassing me. I feel like if I report it they’re gonna ask for proof which I don’t have, or they’re going to ask me what I was wearing, or just ignore me. I don’t know what to do and I’m getting really upset again thinking about it. Have any other girls had a similar experience? Boys, too?

Edit: I’ve sent an email with help from u/ScholarGrade and others. Thank you all for the encouraging me to say something and if this happens to you you should as well. Sometimes it’s hard to remember your principles when you’re caught in an uncomfortable situation, but there is nothing wrong with asking someone to stop touching you. Again, thank you all",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f148vp/extremely_inappropriate_interviewer/,1797,"Don’t report to Dartmouth yet.

640,alw2vj,False,,134,let's make a company,ApplyingToCollege,"**This is going to be a long post. Before you apply or say anything, please read everything.**

Hi! I'm BakerHouse2021, the MIT student who runs [College Admissions Blog](http://collegeadmissions.blog/). From the Chance Me Calculator to Guess My Decision, I have developed a number of college-related apps.

I love blogging, but I've realized that the process is incredibly time-intensive. I want to give out as much advice as possible, but churning out content is a slow process, especially since I'm working alone.

**Having realized this, I'm reaching out to the A2C community to join me on my next venture.**

# The Idea

I'm developing a website filled with articles, advice, and tips for **AP classes**. There already exist a number of resources online to help students learn the specific content for each course. As such, I'm not looking to write resources on the content. Rather, I want to write content that acts as a ""synthesis"" layer, one level above the content. What do I mean by this?

There's a difference between learning the raw content for a class and processing it. It's one thing to memorize all the hard facts and formulas, and it's another to parse that information and break it up into key components.

I want a collection of articles such as: ""5 Key Things to Remember for the AP Chem Exam"" and ""Great Study Resources for AP Language."" The articles do not teach the content itself, but rather help hammer key points.

# The Issue

There are a ton of AP classes, and it's impossible for me to write 10+ articles for each course. Also, it's expensive to pay someone for each individual article.

# The Solution

I have years of experience in web development, blogging, and SEO. If done right, a site of this nature could receive millions of views over the course of a year, reaching thousands of students across the nation. The way I can make this idea a reality is if I gather a large group of writers, and if we can work together on churning out the content.

# Business Plan

Below you can find key points on how I plan to structure this project.

* 18 AP classes to cover
   * United States History
   * Biology
   * Calculus AB
   * Calculus BC
   * Chemistry
   * English Language and Composition
   * English Literature and Composition
   * Environmental Science
   * European History
   * United States Government and Politics
   * Macroeconomics
   * Microeconomics
   * Physics 1
   * Physics 2
   * Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
   * Physics C: Mechanics
   * Psychology
   * Statistics
* 4 writers for each course (1 course manager, 3 authors)
   * The course manager vets the content and compiles a list of articles to write, and delegates it to his/her authors
* Total of 72 writers
* 1 CEO, 18 managers, 54 authors
* Revenue distribution
   * **CEO:** 10%
   * **Each manager:** 1.5% of monthly revenue
   * **Each author:** 1% of monthly revenue
   * **Savings:** 5%
   * **Bonuses:** 4%
* Recruiting for the first half of February
* Writing for the second half of February
   * Each author and manager writes **7, 1,000+ word articles** over the course of about a month
* Launch by mid-march (a bit ambitious, I know)
* I'll be developing the website, writing content, managing the social media, and advertising
   * I'll also build an ""Our Team"" page, including the headshots and names of managers and authors who want to be included
   * If we grow quickly, I'll look to get someone to help me with development and business strategy
* Bonuses will be distributed to each course team depending on performance
   * The job of the course manager is to work with his/her authors to determine what to write
   * The goal is to both help students, but to also *attract* students (for instance, the ""5 things you *need* to know"" template works well, as shown on PrepScholar); it's up to the course manager to devise a list of articles to write
   * Each course team will receive a bonus proportional to how well their content performs *relative* to their course's search volume on search engines
* By mid-March, the goal is to have over 500 pages of high-quality content on the website
* With over 500 pages, and assuming the content performs well on search engines, within three months the website could acquire 5,000,000 views, and with a page RPM of \~$3.00, that would be about $15,000 in revenue (and this would be through just one ad network; I also plan to use in-text advertising, which would yield approximately another couple thousand, but this is a very rough estimate)
   * The content will remain on the web permanently, and assuming growth month over month, and peaks in May, this project could provide a very steady passive income for *years to come*
* This is not a get-rich-quick scheme, but with correct execution and leadership, I see this being a fun project to work on with a large group of you

This is a super late-night thought I had. It's ambitious, and sometimes I feel it sounds stupid, but I feel it's equally as viable. Sometimes I feel you just gotta take risks and do the stuff that even sounds stupid. You'll never know how it'll turn out.

Also, if this post does get a good response and over 100 upvotes, I want to make clear that those who choose to work with me will have access to my contact info (and my MIT email) so that there is complete transparency. I will also be calling all team members individually.

616,f939ya,False,,99,I asked four of my friends about the worst moment from their alumni interviews.,ApplyingToCollege,"We all fuck up in interviews.

I personally have a few moments that occasionally keep me up at night. Not just from college interviews – I'm a bungling buffoon during internship interviews, debate tournaments, and class presentations. I figure, though, that I can't be alone. Haven't we all experienced that one cringeworthy moment, that instance of instantaneous embarrassment we so zealously yearn to retract? If you answer ""no,"" you're probably just not self-aware.

As such, I asked four of my friends about their interviews. Each of them are bright, talented, and entirely worthy applicants for their schools, but each can be a stumbling bastion of bumbling ineptitude at a moment's glance. Unsurprisingly, then, we all fucked up during our interviews. I rank them below in order of ascending stupidity.
_______________________________

**#4: Mixing up the Colleges** 

This guy's first choice was Duke, with Middlebury being a rather close second. These are, as y'all know, two very different schools with respect to location, athletics, and (especially) size. He had conducted due research on both, and emphasized components of each college which appealed to him. For Duke, he loved the large class size. For Middlebury, he loved the small class size.

The doofus forgot which college he was interviewing for. 

It went a little something like this –

**Doofus:** ""Middlebury's large size deeply resonates with me. I enjoy having several opportunities available to me on campus, and socializing with new people each day. I think it'll be integral to my college experience, and Middlebury offers just that."" 

**Interviewer:** ""Middlebury, uh, Midd's class size is about 2,500–""

**Doofus:** ""Exactly. But the breadth of opportunities available at Middlebury – their clubs, intramural and varsity sports, teacher-student interactions – makes it feel big. There's an opportunity for each student, the ability to explore several directions, hence why I say 'large size.'"" 

Honestly a remarkable save, in my opinion. He remarked that the interviewer bought it too, as they began talking about which clubs interested him. He got deferred from Duke ED and is waiting on Middlebury RD. 

**#3 Just a Terrible Answer** 

Interviewing for Vanderbilt. She said her interview was going smoothly enough, nothing remarkable but hardly any mistakes. Their conversation was winding down and she was handling the stereotypical exit questions, principally ""what do you look forward to doing the most at Vanderbilt?"" 

What would you answer? Probably something safe like engaging in Vandy's education training program, relaxing in the library, seeing the first snowfall, etc. Not her, though, for she is a nincompoop.

**Interviewer:** What do you look forward to the most at Vanderbilt?

**Nincompoop:** Attending one of the frat parties, putting myself out there... Vanderbilt's party scene is a major selling point.

**Interviewer:** Oh –– I was looking for something academic, but that's a unique answer.

Not too bad, but certainly not the ideal way to end an interview. She got accepted into Vanderbilt, though, so I guess something clicked.

**#2 Really Weird Wording**

This friend has a particular penchant for writing. He's able to string words together eloquently and impactfully, in a way where he invokes emotion. Sometimes, though, he misuses words or inadvertently creates really fuckin' weird pictures, as he did during his Dartmouth interview.

He said it was going pretty well, they were conversing about teacher-student relationships and the importance of accessible professors. We all attend a pretty small and progressive school, and routinely consult our instructors outside of class. So this lummox says:

**Lummox:** Maintaining relationships with my instructors is just indispensable for college. I feel Dartmouth has that. At [high school]... we have deeply intimate relationships that extend beyond teacher and student.

**Interviewer, thinking:** *this guy's gonna fuck every professor at Dartmouth* 

Rejected from Dartmouth ED. Guess the fertility rate in New Hampshire's high enough already. 

**#1 Insulting your Fucking Interviewer** 

Williams College up in Massachusetts has a pretty good XC program, believe it or not. This friend is ""the guy"" on our cross-country and track team, and he was interviewing with some Williams alumni. They got to talking about the athletics program at Williams, namely the success that their XC team had this year (they made nationals, I believe). 

I should add that his interviewer was a rather large woman.

Everything was going smoothly, he says, until this dunce whips out this gem:

**Dunce:** Running's a major part of my day-to-day life. Practice starts at 4:00, and it usually takes two hours between running, stretching, and weight training. But I love it – the competition, the drive to better yourself – it's just something I need to continue in college.

**Interviewer:** That's refreshing to hear, having a passion and sticking to it. I personally don't run–

**Dunce, smiling cordially:** Yeah, I can tell 

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:**

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:** I am so, so sorry 

The conversation continued awkwardly thereafter, and neither side brought it up again. I asked him just what the fuck he was thinking, and he had nothing. 

He did not get into Williams.

In the spirit of ubiquitous interview fuckups, I invite y'all to share your embarrassments below... it was really fun to hear how my friends fucked up, and I hope it was fun to read too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/f939ya/i_asked_four_of_my_friends_about_the_worst_moment/,1233,Holy shit number 2 is gold ,2020-02-25 02:49:35
914,fqd7er,False,Rant,151,Unpopular Opinion: Some of y'all really brought these rejections on yourselves,ApplyingToCollege,"Please, dear god, apply to a range of schools of varying selectivity. I see some of the 2020 gang applying to all the t10s and their state school and being completely shocked when they get 1 acceptance. I don't care how good you think your application is, unless you're Greta Thunberg, you should apply to a range of schools. Apply to some with a 15% acceptance rate, but also some with a 50% acceptance rate and definitely a couple with a 70%+ acceptance rate.

**It kills me** to see some people on this sub who have accomplished amazing things and gotten fantastic GPAs and test scores have no choices besides community college and taking a gap year. Of course, those are two perfectly fine options, but it sucks if you are being forced into those options, and you deserve to have a choice.

**Don't even come at me** with that ""but my SAT was in their 25-75 percentile! I never could have predicted rejection!"". You have to know that a school with a <30% acceptance rate will look at things besides your SAT score. Having stats in the range of t20s doesn't mean you are likely to get in. It opens a door for you to be considered admission (disclaimer: of course there are those who have stats lower than the range but make up for it by being fantastic in all other aspects and you all are amazing!)

If you did not know that, I'm sorry you had to be disillusioned like this. My friend had a 36 ACT and 4.0 UW GPA and was appalled when she didn't get into Stanford today, because she thought that her stats were enough, when really, **it's so much more than that**. I'm not saying the system is right or wrong, but that's what we're working with.

Also, some of y'all are like ""but I did 3 internships and wrote a published research paper and volunteered 300+ hours and started a nonprofit but only got into my state school wtf1!1!!"" And to that, I say, I'm sorry. That sucks. But, when you look at the schools these people apply to, many of them just apply to HYPSM and then one safety school, and ask themselves where they went wrong.

It's just really sad, because there are so many amazing applicants that shotgunned all the t20s or Ivys or UCs and got rejected/waitlisted from all of them, when they would have gotten accepted at t40s or t50s. For example, if you love Yale, by all means, apply! But also apply to some other low reaches/high matches/low matches/safeties.

See here, a balanced profile: Yale(6%), Boston University(18.5%), Northeastern(19%), University of Florida(31.4%), Purdue (58%) , Clemson(51%), VATech (70%), Loyola University New Orleans,(90%)  University of Maine(91%)

See here, a foolish profile (sorry if I call you out): Ivy league, MIT, Stanford, UC Hicago, Caltech, some selective UCs OOS, and the University of Wyoming.

I know that this is not a popular belief, especially right after rejection season. I've gotten many rejections as well, and it hurts big time, but Class of 2021, you just **need to be practical** about your applications. I know that a t50 doesn't sound as exciting to those of you who are conditioned to only accept ivy leagues or UCs, but if you don't like your state school/safety, you need to find some more safe options. **t20s and even t30s are NOT your safety/match schools** (rare exceptions of course), so find a range of schools. PS (GATech isn't ur fucking safety school if you're OOS!).

I swear to God, if I see any of you 21ers out there next year like ""shit got rejected from my safety, UC Irvine and my match, Cornell/SUNY Ithaca"", blood will be shed in this chat!

Sincerely,

A concerned senior

424,fw9eb7,False,Rant,250,Just got into a huge argument with my parents over not wanting to go to MIT,ApplyingToCollege,"I just filled out the USC Housing application and got to the page to submit the $55 application fee... apparently talking to my parents about deciding between multiple schools didn't make it clear enough to them that I wasn't going to automatically commit to MIT. I was bombarded with 30 minutes of yelling, accusing me of ""being a pussy,"" ""being retarded,"" and ""having serious mental health issues"" in Chinese (Damn, what a failure I must be for that).

Obviously I was insanely happy when I got into MIT. I was over the moon for about an entire month. But after that initial euphoria went away, I began to really process what going to a school like that would mean. I've worked insanely hard for my grades in high school, and I was never the type that would be able to not study for tests in order to excel. I always felt stressed out by everything, and the ""college resume building"" aspect of my life took over my entire mindset. Although I've never had the guts to go to a therapist or seek professional medical attention, I'm sure I've experienced depression and anxiety far too many times during my four years in high school.

Through more research online and talking to current/former students, I've come to realize that MIT truly might destroy me. I'm already extremely fragile mentally, and the advice I've heard over and over again is to not go to school if you fall apart under stress. Sure, the graduation rate is extremely high and I'll probably be able to make it through, but at what cost to my mental health? High school has already broken me many times -- how is MIT not going to be even worse? The only thing I realized I truly like about MIT is the prestige associated with its name... and that's precisely why I don't want to go there right now.

When I tried to tell my parents my thinking, they refused to even contemplate the reasons as to why I'm having doubts in terms of attending this \*magical school\*. They told me every college would be hard, and while that's certainly true, is it possible to deny the fact that MIT will almost certainly be more intense and riskier for my health than other, ""worse"" schools? The campus made me feel miserable when I visited, the horror stories I've heard have scared the shit out of me, and I honestly can't see myself enjoying my time at MIT. But my parents said that ""MIT is too prestigious for you not to go,"" that ""there is a reason why their yield rate is so high,"" that they ""couldn't stand to talk to me again if I chose to go such a bad school like USC.""

Maybe I did this to myself. My entire life, I've been a sheep to my parents. I listened to them when they insisted I needed straight A's since the beginning of middle school. I listened to them when they told me I couldn't hang out with my friends during the school year because a ""good, smart Chinese boy had better things to do with his time."" I listened to them when they told me that a ""perfect ACT/SAT score will set you up for your entire life."" I even almost listened to them when they told me to quit playing a sport, literally the one thing that has kept me sane throughout the past 6 years of my life. Now, they expect me to blindly listen to them again. But this time, I can't.

I don't know what to do. I know that I will probably regret passing up the insane academic opportunities at MIT if I don't go. I know that I might never be able to heal my relationship with my parents if I don't go. I know that, if MIT doesn't destroy me, it is probably the best choice for me to go to college. But how do I know that it won't destroy me? I can do more research, but how can I know for sure that I will be fine if I go there? How do I make the right decision? I can't even discern my own thinking from that of my parents. I don't even know how to end this rant. I'm just a giant freaking mess. I feel stuck.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fw9eb7/just_got_into_a_huge_argument_with_my_parents/,1539,Go to USC and show them up ,2020-04-06 23:23:58
695,b6h3rf,False,,160,"Dear Beautiful Seniors, please hold on to your hearts ♥️",ApplyingToCollege,"I know for many of you this is it. This is THE day you've been waiting for. You might’ve even been waiting for this day -- not since Dec 31 or last fall sometime when you hit submit on your apps, but for years. And as I think most of you recognize, some (most) of you are going to be extremely disappointed today, and others will be over the moon excited. So, I want to tell you how proud I am of each and every one of you. In the last year or so that I've been nagging at you to remember to breathe, keep life in perspective, and open your minds about essays, college lists, and your ECs, I've seen such growth. I've seen you mature from kids who seemingly only care about prestige, where you get in, and writing obnoxious braggy essays, to young adults who are giving each other truly awesome advice and pieces of wisdom. It has been an amazing process to watch. Your support for each other is real. You all are incredible kids. Please remember that today. And tomorrow. And next week. And next year. 

So, do me a favor. Let’s take the focus off your college decisions for just a few minutes. I want each one of you to write to me right now, and for the next few days,  or the next week or hell, forever, and tell me three things in your life you’re  grateful for.  You can respond here or pm me if you'd rather. You come from around the world with so many different circumstances, and I know many of you have struggled with parts of your lives. I've heard your stories, read your essays, and even cried for some of you, but today I want to focus on the good stuff. So tell me three things you are thankful for. Big or small. 

(Please feel free to respond even if you're not a senior.  We often have younger kids and college kids and older join us!)

I'll go first. Two years ago, I wrote about being grateful for this subreddit, my crazy amazing kids and my wonderful mom who supported me in life and decisions even when she disagreed. Last year, I wrote about my love of travel, and how thankful I was for books and movies. 
 
Today I’m grateful for:

1. The hard times. When my mom
died right around the same time of empty nesting, I lost my sense of identity. I’d been a daughter my whole life and most recently her caretaker as she was very ill for her last three years. And I’d been a mom for 25 years and suddenly, that seemed over.  I wasn’t sure what to do with myself because my roles that I so strongly identified with were gone. I had to really dig in and find myself and what I wanted. It was hard. But I’d never change those hard, sad days (and there were many). It was almost as if I was emerging from a chrysalis. 

2. Yoga.  In the last two years, I have discovered the benefits of the connection of my body and my mind. I’d always been more of a life of the mind person, but now I really know the connection and how much I have to pay attention.  In fact, I am training and studying to be a yoga teacher now. 

3. The now. Right now. This moment. I’ve learned to appreciate and try to be aware of the moment I’m in. I’d always been a planner. Thinking of the future and in doing so missed out on so much of my life, so now I work very hard to be present. And I’m so thankful for the moments when I can look up and see how green the trees are or how soft my dog’s fur is or how amazing your writing is. 

Now it's your turn. I can't wait to hear from you.  

As you’re thinking about what you’re  grateful for today, remember it can be big or small. An added benefit is that research shows that people who take the time to note their gratitude daily are in general Happier and more content.  Regardless, remember that no matter the outcome today— whether in your favor or not, you’re more than your college acceptances. They don’t define you.  You are a badass with or without any specific school or schools.  

Prepare yourself with some emotional planning during the day.  While it’s ok to hold on to hope for the best, be prepared for the worst. Hold on to your heart. 

Now. Let me know what you’re thankful for in your life!  And breathe. 💙😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b6h3rf/dear_beautiful_seniors_please_hold_on_to_your/,1137,"i’m a junior but it can’t hurt!

1. my mother. my father was overseas from kindergarten to 6th grade, so my mom had to take charge of the household when me and my brother were growing up. i had to become a mini-adult in a way, because my mom worked all day and i needed to make sure my brother got the love he deserved. she also worked at a book fair company so i developed a love of reading and writing from there and it just took off. she’s the reason why i am where i am.

2. my heritage. i’m native american, but was adopted by a white family in the suburbs when i was born. i’m so thankful that throughout everything, my parents made sure i knew of my heritage and was at least somewhat involved until i could get enrolled in my tribe (it’s happening soon!!!!!). really, it’s what got me into activism, which has shaped my life from the NODAPL movement to MFOL.

3. schrodinger’s cat. it may seem frivolous and stupid to some, but this quantum mechanics thought experiment is what made me realize STEM is the path i want to follow. one day, in 6th grade, i watched a SciShow video on it because i was scrolling through youtube and i was bored. i didn’t understand half of the theories and terms he mentioned, but i understood the gist of it. i explained it to my mom (who didn’t get it) and explaining this paradox made me feel so alive and so smart. it was then that i understood that studying science/physics will make me feel that way all of the time. smart and grateful.

254,9w8qhi,False,,63,Should I invite my regional admissions counselor to my birthday party?,ApplyingToCollege,"Hi all; I think I've just had a stroke of genius.

I haven't received an interview from my ED school yet, but it's really important that the school gets to see me as a human being, rather than grades and an essay. I just designed an online invitation to my birthday party, and I'm thinking I should invite my regional admissions counselor.

Since I didn't get an interview, I think hosting Mr. Admissions Officer at my Excellent Eighteen would provide a plethora of opportunities for him to get to know me:

* I have prepared the following playlist:
   * ""Two Phones"" by Kevin Gates as a metaphor for my ability to balance my academic and social lives.
   * ""X Gon' Give It To Ya"" by DMX to warn Mr. Admissions Officer that rejecting my application with an ""X"" would put his well-being in peril.
   * ""Thrift Shop"" by Macklemore to highlight my fiscal responsibility and natural potential as an Economics major.
   * ""F\*ck Up Some Commas"" by Future to apologize for minor grammatical errors in my supplements.
   * ""E.T."" by Katy Perry and Kanye West to indicate my interest in pursuing a minor in Aerospace Engineering.
* I will serve food and drinks exclusively of the schools colors as an implicit claim that I am a clear fit for the college.
* I have designed posters to hang in my basement bearing phrases, which clarify that academics are *always* a priority:
   * ""Less drinking, more thinking.""
   * ""No Juuls. Joules only (1 joule = 1kgm\^2/s\^2)""
   * ""Don't drink and derive.""
* I am inviting 6% of my grade to my Excellent Eighteen to make the environment more comfortable for Mr. Admissions Officer, as he tends to invite around 6% of applicants to the school.
* I will provide some grant-based financial aid for Mr. Admissions Officer's travel expenses to and from my house, if he chooses to fax his 2017 Federal Tax Return and 2017 W-2 forms by November 15th.

Do you guys think this will raise my chances of admissions? Again, I personally think my Excellent Eighteen provides an opportunity for the Office of Admissions to complete their holistic evaluation of my application.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9w8qhi/should_i_invite_my_regional_admissions_counselor/,1948,Thank god this is a shitpost ,2018-11-11 23:42:11

402,djpb31,False,,40,Stuck on your essay? Here's a psychological trick,ApplyingToCollege,"Early Decision deadlines are coming up and I've started to see people talking about being stuck on their essays.  In the next two weeks this will reach epidemic proportions.

I get it. This is important and you want it to be perfect.  Some of you haven't even started, or have a hundred false starts and they all seem to suck.  You stare at the blank page and nothing seems like it is going to work.  You've done your homework and read a lot about the things that you shouldn't say in your essay and every time you write something it seems like a cliche, or pretentious, or unappealing.  Your parents and teachers are nagging but you just can't find the words.

One trick that I have seen working is to set out to deliberately write the world's worst essay.  Go ahead!  Swear, use jargon, brag, be stupid, be silly, be trite, be a stereotype, be pretentious, be obnoxious, be mean, be petty.  Just sit down and get it all out of your system.  

Once you start keep on writing until you run out of momentum.  Then put that aside and do something physical for 20 minutes to an hour.  Dance, go for a walk, rake the leaves, clean your room, do yoga, whatever.  Just do something that gets your blood moving and doesn't need your brain.  Once that's done, pick your joke essay back up and read it out loud.  Do funny voices if they fit.  

You could find that once you've gotten the bad writing out of your system, the good writing is hiding right behind it.  Or you could find a phrase or sentence in the terrible essay that sparks a thought and leads to a really great essay.

For extra bonus points, when your parents nag you about your essay progress give them the terrible essay and pretend you think that it's good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/djpb31/stuck_on_your_essay_heres_a_psychological_trick/,1588,I've written three of these damn things and I still can't get it right. ,2019-10-18 15:43:13

735,bmqo1x,False,,96,i turned down a private admissions counselor who had gotten 100+ students into hypsm & other ramblings about college admissions,ApplyingToCollege,"edited to remove some personal info.

several disclaimers: i love my parents. i know they are acting out of what they think are my best interests in subjects they think they know better than i do. and i trust their judgment, and i am truly grateful for all they’ve done for me. i think we just have a fundamental misalignment of our values. second, i know how lucky i am. the programs i’ve been able to attend, the connections afforded by my parents, all of these things helped me bring me to where i am now. with that said, thank you guys for reading this rambley rant!

during junior year my parents encouraged me to work with a private admissions counselor. he had had huge success rates in getting students (especially asian americans) into hypsm, ivy’s/t20’s, etc.

he emphasized how choosy he was but that he would be glad to work with me. i instinctively turned him down; not only would it have cost $10,000, i didn’t feel right doing it.

my parents tried to get me to work with him for weeks, saying they were fine with the cost (which i knew they were — i’m fortunate enough to have a family that prioritizes my college education). i kept telling them that was too much to pay (and i still think that it is, to be honest) but that wasn’t the main reason. i just imagined myself opening up that decision letter and seeing the rejection, seeing myself wasting $10,000 that my parents invested in me. or even worse, seeing the acceptance and knowing that colleges hadn’t admitted ME, they had admitted this snobby, polished version of me, with ten caked layers of makeup and plastic surgery.

after that summer, i was a bit more confident about the college process. i had done a lot of introspection, a lot of soul searching. my parents tried getting me to work with the counselor again; he said that he was willing to make an exception to work with me last minute but would raise the price to $15,000. the idea of anyone making that kind of transaction sickened me. he made me do an interview with him and all i could think the entire time was, why are you profiting off a twisted system that already favors the rich and are now tilting it even more in their favor?

needless to say, i didn’t work with him. flash foward a few months, i had gotten rejected from almost all the ivy’s, including my dream school. we went to an admitted student day at a t20, but not one i had particular interest in, and on the way there, my dad asked me if i regretted not working with the counselor.

but you know what? i still don’t regret it. the college admissions process is twisted beyond belief. the elite schools profit off the rich while shoving the few minority or low income students in your face in some facade of diversity. and yeah, these schools have a decently diverse student group and help low income students who make it in break out of the cycle of poverty, but all in all, the admissions process is a shitshow. it’s all a transaction, and maybe it’s not always the monetary kind, but the manipulation of the admissions process and the inequity of it all absolutely sickens me.

i’m not saying anyone who worked with counselors is a bad person, or that every college consultant is a scam, but as a personal choice, i’d rather be at a disadvantage than use money to get myself ahead. the counselor i would’ve worked with wouldn’t have written my essays or anything of the sort, but i’d be spending my parents’ money for some glossy essays — not something that would actually help me grow as a person. over these past few months i’ve realized that i don’t really care about the rankings of schools and all of that anymore. if you have the drive, you’ll succeed. it’s as easy as that.

tldr; i turned down a $10-15k admissions counselor and a better chance at the ivy’s because i thought it was immoral and didn’t want to contribute to wealth inequality in college admissions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bmqo1x/i_turned_down_a_private_admissions_counselor_who/,1100,"What absolute insanity.

I still can’t believe parents like your own believe these things. It makes me question whether Asians very high iq (only below Ashkenazi) means anything at all.
