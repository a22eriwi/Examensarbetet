I'm incapable of vulnerability and sharing myself even with my therapist. How can I get over this,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fnw5b9/im_completely_incapable_of_trusting_anyone_and/,35,"Little bit at a time. This post is an example of one step, which is great! The next time you feel ready, take another one. Start by sharing with safe people, like a licensed therapist. Maybe one of the things you can work on is figuring out how to open up more. Therapy is a great place to practice conflict situations that can come up from not being willing to trust, so you can tell your therapist something like ""I don't trust you"" and they will work through it with you without forcing you to open up (if they're good at their job). 

I have a really hard time trusting people too, and it really takes time to get over. Some other things that helped were staying in-the-moment, and reacting to things as they happened instead of worrying about what bad things MIGHT happen later on. 

Also, sometimes it's helpful to talk to a pet, doesn't have to be an emotional support animal but it helps. You can practice saying things out loud that make you feel vulnerable before trying it with a person that you think is worthy of that trust. ",2020-03-24 01:17:27

879,bco6fa,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,26,Just need to talk to anyone,depression_help,"So I have been a part of this subreddit for idk how long, but never posted anything because I felt like my problems are not important. But now I want to post something. I actually have typed this post out several times this week but always ended up deleting it. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. I’m gonna start with what happened today. This story has nothing bad happening but it caused me mental pain. I’m typing this out because the four hours I spent with my fiancé has been the longest I have felt happy this week and I just need to talk to anyone right now. 

Me and my fiancé went to the gym this morning. He had to pick me up due to we both still with our parents and haven’t told anyone about our engagement( we want to surprise them and are waiting to by financial set). We went to the gym worked out for an hour or two then we went out to do some errands. I was bringing my resume to places applied to and my fiancé was my ride. After that he got on the freeway and we were just driving and making jokes. I was telling him a funny story about a quest I did in a game I’m playing. Then I got a phone call from my mom. She wanted to know where I was and when I’m going to be back. Now I know this is seems like a red flag but she only asked because she had to get a new work uniform and my other siblings were going with her and no will be home. That doesn’t seem bad but my mom’s stepdad lives with us and he is unable to much he can walk and stuff but has a hard time remembering things. So someone has to be home with him.  

I said ok and we started to head back. This when I noticed that my fiancé was upset. I asked what’s wrong, it turns out that he had a surprise for me. He was taking to a sushi place that he promised to take a while back. He also had plans for the whole day for us but wanted to surprise me with it. I started feeling like I ruined the whole day. His plans and the way he described it made it sound like today was gonna be the most perfect date/day. On the way back I was just upset and angry with myself and my siblings. I was upset with my siblings because they are all young adult, hell two of them are adults,(21 and 19) but one of couldn’t stay home for a couple of minute until the rest of my family got home. 

While we got to my house he didn’t even park, he just stop in first we said goodbye and I went inside. I say that because he always parks in the driveway, gets out, and walks me to my front door. He did try calm me down before hand but I was just so angry. My parents were still home and asked me what’s wrong and why was I upset. I told them but my mom made feel worse. She made me feel like I should have told her and that it was my fault for not knowing about his surprise for me. My dad tried to tell her that she was wrong and that how was I supposed to know about my fiancé’s surprise. 

I was texting and later was in call with my fiancé while that was happening and he was still upset but was telling me that it was not fault. That what happened was unfortunate and upsetting but it wasn’t my fault. Every-time I tried to blame myself he would tell me to stop. That yes he was upset and he was sorry for upsetting me. It ended with me and him in a phone trying to make the other person feel better but it didn’t work. Now he has gone to bed and I’m still awake still upset my eyes burn a little due to crying. 

I just want to talk, just to clear my mind of bad thoughts. I can’t call him because he has work in the morning and I want him to rest. I feel like I need help, I’m a mess. I feel like crap my mental state is fucked due feel like my happiness was ripped from me.

658,ejy5n9,False,,6,I'm so afraid that I've messed everything up already,depression_help,"... And that I can no longer make something of myself anymore. For a little background, I'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. From a very young age I was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as I grew older I just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, I met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. A failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later I went back to uni now in an English course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. I lost the courage and the patience. I've been out of school for a whole year now and I've been faking it to the people I know by editing my grades on the internet. Now I've fallen out of touch with my parents because I've disappointed them too much and I'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. I also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her Doctorate. She's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. I feel like everyone's expecting something from me that I can't deliver. I've done fucked up so much that I don't even know where to begin fixing things. Honestly, I don't even know what has kept me going. Back in late 2018 I attempted suicide. Before 2019 ended I promised that I won't reach the New Year. But oddly enough I'm still here but I'm afraid I might finally burnout. I haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that I tried to do it with. I just wish my future didn't revolve around a piece of paper so much or at the very least I wish I was able to do things right the very first time around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ejy5n9/im_so_afraid_that_ive_messed_everything_up_already/,61,"Hey, 

  I’m sorry you’re in so much pain, let alone a host of extreme negative emotions. You are totally allowed to feel that way - it is what you do with those thoughts and feelings. And you are NOT a failure for your actions. Even though I haven’t taken any higher education classes, I have the same views of a degree as you do. You are NOT a failure. You HAVE NOT messed everything up. 

  I think it’s amazing you have gotten this far. When you are actually living life, DOING something with yourself - mistakes are going to happen. I’m not saying suffering is a sure sign of progress - but sometimes just surviving is all that you can do. Even if you’re treading in complete darkness. But you made it another day. Another personal victory for you. No one can take that away from you. 

  I’m the youngest out of five kids. Even though it may not even be close to the level of pressure and expectation life has placed on you, I understand, the feeling is completely mutual. Comparing myself to my siblings makes me want to crawl in a hole for the rest of my life. So in that regard, I can only imagine the pressure you face. I feel for you I really do. 

  It’s seems nearly impossible to think otherwise that life will get better. Especially when things like this has been happening for a long time. Just the fact that you are here, on earth, set up a Reddit account and shared that with us takes some serious guts. ",2020-01-04 15:47:04
344,amm2m7,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,36,High functioning depression,depression_help,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking in depression subreddits for a while but I finally decided to post.

I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but since I started university my depression has become more high functioning, and there have been times when people do not believe me when I open up about my depression. Even when I talked about my PTSD from a sexual assault and a mentally abusive relationship, some people did not believe me.

I shower two times a day every day, I finish all my assignments a week ahead of time and I make sure I get near perfect grades on everything, I work 5-6 days a week, I'm a clean freak who has to do laundry and dishes every single day or else I panic. My anxiety disorder screams at me to get these things done or else my anxiety will eat me alive.

I've had people who tell me my depression ""isn't real"" because their depression had them unable to leave their bed. When I talked about my struggles with suicidal thoughts I was skirted to the side and seen as a liar, while someone else was praised for their struggles because they were unable to continue going to college due to their depression. 

I felt like screaming that depression is not a contest. It ruins lives and there is no ""one size fits all"" depression.

I just need support that my struggles are valid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/amm2m7/high_functioning_depression/,97,"It sounds like you might have an addictive personality.

I spoke to my doctor about it (a few days ago for the first time) and she believes that its just a burnout. I have panick attacks when school, work or life in general gets overwhelming, so I get where she is coming from.
But does that mean that this feeling that I just want to stop existing and that life is pointless comes from a burnout? She asked if I ever wanted to hurt myself and I said no because I've seen firsthand what it can do to people (family/friends). She said that it probably isn't a depression because of that.

615,eo8ob8,False,RANT,7,Life just feels over and I'm only in my mid 20's.,depression_help,"I just don't know how to get the will to keep going. I've been through hell, and I have no blood family left. 

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational. 

If you took the time to read this I appreciate you. 

Here's to feeling better. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eo8ob8/life_just_feels_over_and_im_only_in_my_mid_20s/,65,"Maybe you can think of things in a different way: obviously everything that happened is a tragedy, but those things are in the past. The silver lining is you went through a series of experiences that few other people go through until they are in old age. 

This will make you more mature. It will make you more empathetic. It may even make you more passionate, if you start using the bad experiences to motivate yourself.

Dwelling and ranting really doesn’t help. Thinking negatively doesn’t help. You have to try to switch your thinking or you will of course feel negative after constantly thinking negative thoughts and doing little to try to end the negative thoughts themselves. Not saying that’s easy, or sufficient to cure everything; but if you don’t even try to be positive and keep ranting and dwelling on everything that is bad - you have no chance of being happy. The first step is changing your outlook and way of thinking. If you feel overwhelmed by your thoughts and feel like you can’t change your way of thinking, try meditation lessons.

A phrase I always found helpful is “just stay on the bull.” Life can seem hectic and overwhelming at times / often, like you’re riding a bull. You can feel overwhelmed by reality and too stressed to think straight. But the key, as cliche as it sounds, is to hang in there. Keep fighting the day to day struggle and doing your best. You don’t need to fix everything now, you just need to stay in the game enough so your future self has a chance to succeed. 

Compliment yourself for the effort you’re making and the progress you’re making. Try to do healthy things like exercise and sleep to help manage your stress. Keep building and eventually things will likely get better. There’s no guarantees, bad luck happens, but you sound like you’ve already received your fair share of bad luck and you should be optimistic that life can really only go up from where you are now. You’ve been through a very disproportionate amount of tragedies for someone your age - it’s logical to think that the years to come will be better than the past.

Take it slow. Breathe. Do things at your pace. The debt probably isn’t as much as you’re imagining, and a few days of setbacks isn’t going to ruin your life. Get around to selling those cars, but if you don’t feel up to it, take a break. Just try to make small steps when you can. Over time it will get easier and easier. The hardest part is always the first few steps of a journey.

PS You can usually still refinance a loan that is in a trust. ",2020-01-13 19:10:50

Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert.

Healthy snacks high in protein and low in sugar may do you some good. Granola bars, dried/fresh fruits and veggies, nuts, etc would be easy healthy snacks. If you have time on the weekend, you could prepare healthy meals in bulk, then divide them into separate portions and freeze them for later eating. Cheaper than most fast food and frozen meals, with the right ingredients.

 If you're not feeling up to tons of laundry, you could drop your dirty clothes in the wash daily until it fills, wash and dry them, then set them aside until you do have the energy. 

Some daily b vitamins may help with your energy levels, although I'd consult with your doctor first to make sure there wouldn't be any interactions with your current meds. You could try experimenting with different ways to help you to sleep. [These](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-fall-asleep) tips might be beneficial.

 I used to limit my sugar and caffeine to daytime hours only, plus hot nightly baths to help me through rough depression patches. Hopefully you can find some things to get you closer to your desired amount of sleep and energy. ",2019-04-16 10:50:28
340,dy5tvu,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,28,Too depressed to even do basic things,depression_help,"Lately I’m too depressed to even have the energy to do basic things like shave, shower and get out of bed.

I’m already on antidepressants.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dy5tvu/too_depressed_to_even_do_basic_things/,100,"I also suffer from this. What I have to tell you is this. MAKE YOURSELF DO IT. I know, it's easier said than done. I'd rather stay in bed and pity myself. Or sleep. But no, I decide to fight with myself and make every effort to do those stuff. First, I make myself shower, then make the bed, and then I make myself clean the house. I don't like cleaning that much, but it makes tremendous changes to my mood. As a next step, I want to learn to wash my car more often. I am sure that clean windows and interiors will improve my mood and give me a sense of control, like cleaning the house is helping me.

  
For the most part of my life, I lived in a country that has bad records of air pollution. There, not cleaning a house for one week meant that the house will soon look like a zombie's nest. I never suffered from depression there. Maybe because I didn't have time to. Whatever I do, the house needed to be cleaned. Otherwise, it had been hazardous for health. The amount of dust everywhere would cause a problem with breathing and lungs. So I cleaned the house because I wanted to live. I didn't want to die from air pollution.   

  
I am amazed at how cleaning affects my mood right now. But don't expect to get out of depression quickly. Time took you in the condition you are in today. So time will get you out. It's about small wins consistently, every day. It's about making you each day count. Whatever you do, don't suffer alone, silently. ",2019-11-18 16:56:33

988,fkzm1y,False,RANT,3,Just a vent from someone who's having a self-loathing and hopeless vision of reality,depression_help,"Well... We live in somewhat complicated times, which is obvious. However, this is something that I can’t allow myself to care about. An apathy definitely became an inherent trait of my ego a while ago...

It has been about a year since I published an introspective analysis of my current life situation somewhere on the internet, besides what were the expectations before I decided to see a psychologist, trying to decipher what is tormenting me. Well... I can say that that first attempt was a failure.

I was only able to seek professional help for a brief period before I was fired from my previous job last year, interrupting the process. On the positive side, I was able to organize my professional life a little after that happened. But on the negative side... I could see that my demons being stronger than before.

Today, I'm approaching 30 years old, and given the circumstances, I’m not the happiest and hopeful person I used to be...

I have no one to blame. No one but myself... Countless wrong decisions have taken me to where I am today. Decisions that admit they can be corrected and put back by myself, thus making a fresh start. But... These decisions were much more severe with my inner spirit than with the others.

Apathy, hopelessness, and hatred... These are things that make me who I am today. The rancor of having to let myself go into this spiral of despair and my self-loathing prevents me from looking for something better... I don't feel worthy to be happy, let alone stop feeling pain. And you know the worst of it? All the eventual calls for me to seek support from other people sounds false to me...

Yes. It is a claim that it will really sound rude, but I have to say:

""I don't trust any of you. I’m not able to trust""

I’m sorry for that, as I’m unable to see any act of affection, empathy, and appreciation. I know that a lot of this isn’t true, but that’s something I’m unable to see...

Things like faith and hope lost the meaning to me, for having become something vague and inconclusive to hold on. Any acts of goodwill strike me as hypocritical and empty, just with the intention of shutting up someone who is about to recover. This world seems so fucked up that it basically causes me zero strength to care for a single drop with it.

Obviously, I am still a long way from acting belligerently, suicidal and sociopathic at this age of crisis, but I’m tired to wait any longer. The sad part of all this is that I have a wife and a son who I’m can’t have the strength to fight for them and keep myself sane... This is truly a Herculean task.

I really think I should shut up about this. Spare people from this senseless anguish... But I'm still human. I don't know if I'm going to stay whole if I can't shout in some way or another.

As for my future? Only time will tell...",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/fkzm1y/just_a_vent_from_someone_whos_having_a/,33,"Something similar happened to me (actually, when I was 30), though it was brought on by very bad medical advice. I was newly pregnant, and since you have a child, you know that the OB won’t see you until you’re 8 weeks in. But my antidepressant that I’d taken for years had a big warning against taking while pregnancy, and I was terrified of something happening to the baby, and I called my psychiatrist, and he told me to stop taking it immediately. Not to cut it down, just stop. Within a week, I was in a bizarre state of what I later learned was anhedonia. Nothing made me feel anything. I was scared it would never go away - that was my only feeling. 

I did find a new psychiatrist, and since it’s not an easy specialist to get an appointment with, I stayed with him. He wasn’t the best, but he was sane. As I started taking my meds again, I also started a volunteer job which I loved. Things got better so slowly, I didn’t realize they were improving at all.

Three is my lucky number when drinking (that’s how many glasses it takes to make me go from totally social awkward to social butterfly). After that, I even go to the toilet with a girl I know.

As I am waiting for her, a glass in each hand, a girl I saw some times in school walks up to me. “Hey girl, I haven’t seen you for so long! How are you? Haven’t you been to school lately? Must have been some months since I last saw you. Is it true you’re dating Dave?” I don’t know her name, but thanks to the drink in my hand, it doesn’t matter. “Yes, we have been dating for some months now. You look mesmerizing tonight!”

I go out to meet my boyfriend again. Some time later the same girl, which now has a name, Anna, sits next to us and starts a conversation. I slowly open up, of course because of the alcohol, but she really seems to want to be friends. So, we hang out all night.

First things first. You've gotta distance yourself from this depression. It is NOT part of your character or part of your personality. Just like a zit isn't part of your character or personality. It's just something you are going through. It is something you are rightfully concerned about and talking about. So far so good.

Depression in of its own is not a disorder. It is the symptom of something usually deeper. You need to shop around for a therapist until you find one that you feel you can connect to. Might have to try out 3 or 5 different ones until you find that good one.

If you can't do things for the love of yourself, the second best thing to do is to do things for the love of others. For your fam.. for your SO.. but that will only exhaust you and carry you through for a certain distance, the next part is accepting and loving yourself.

I'm getting therapy and have the support of family and friends and it's not getting better.,depression_help,"From Mid December to March I witnessed my girlfriend's (both mid 20's) steep decline into depression and felt totally helpless. I've been working with my own therapist lately and I've come to the realization that during her depression, I went through a steep decline in self-esteem because of the immense shame I was feeling.   


I feel totally inadequate as a person. I wasn't funny enough to cheer up my girlfriend, I wasn't smart enough to find a solution for her, I wasn't strong enough to save her. At the lowest point in her depression, She started cutting, drinking and smoking. She also completely pushed me away and started hanging out with people we both used to describe as ""toxic"" when things were good.  


I tried my best to support her with what I knew at the time. I always told her she wasn't alone and that I was there for her, I encouraged her to seek help from a therapist/medical team. When she asked for space, I tried my best. I never pressured her to be intimate (her depression stems from sexual assault in the past), I avoided her triggers (the one's I knew about). I do have regrets though, I know I could have been a better listener. I tried to fix things for her even though I know now that I couldn't.

&#x200B;

In February she asked for complete separation for a few weeks so she could work on herself and I did that for her. It was the hardest time in my life. I was so scared for a number of reasons and I constantly ran through scenarios in my head ranging from ""she's having fun without me and doesn't want me"" to ""she's going to commit suicide"". We met up once 2 weeks into no-contact and I was in a bad place. I felt totally rejected and I was very vulnerable in front of her. I cried in her car for about an hour and she tried to comfort me. I know she wasn't in a place to support me, but I was a mess.  


After a few weeks of no-contact, we met up again and she had decided she needed to work on herself and try and heal, and that she couldn't be in a relationship at the same time. She broke up with me the day before my first scheduled therapist appointment. I also think she felt guilty for my decline in self-esteem over the past few months and thought that I would be better without her in my life.   


After 6 weeks I've gotten to a point where I understand that neither of us were in a position to support each other the way things were. I'm grappling with serious shame because I continue to blame myself for her depression, as well as the ways I've acted since breaking up. In the first few weeks, we saw each other a few times, and one day she was really upset and I was able to comfort her until she calmed down. After calming down, she told me she loved me and tried to kiss me. I talked with her after this and told her I'm always here to listen and support her, but I couldn't hear her say ""I love you"" or go back to being in a relationship. She apologized and since then we've barely talked.

Through friends, I've found out she's doing quite a bit better and she's finally having more good days that bad. She's on the road to recovery without me, and I feel like I'm still in a downward spiral. She won't talk to me at all, she deleted me on facebook and our mutual friends are starting to get fed up with me because she's all I can talk about. It feels like every interaction I have with people,  I twist into a narrative that I'm a bad person. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't help her, and that now that she's starting to do better, I can't just feel happy for her and leave it at that. I'm feeling jealousy whenever I think of her being happy, because it's not with me, and then I feel guilty for not being able to happy for her recovery.

908,dpb02k,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,15,I think my boyfriend left me due to his depression and I need some help to understand and deal with this situation.,depression_help,"*(tl;dr at the bottom)*

Although I have more than enough mental problems on my own, depression probably isn't one of them. But it is the problem of my now ex-boyfriend.  
He isn't someone who talks much and I really tried to talk to him but it's hard to get any real information from him and although he seems to try to answer me, most times the answer is some variation of ""I don't know"".  
So I thought I'd ask you guys if anything in my story sounds relatable to you and if you have any idea about the situation of my ex and can maybe explain the things he can't (Of course I know that you can just make guesses but I'm trying really hard to understand him and I'm just so confused.)  
We both have our own problems but as a couple I wouldn't say we had any major problems. In the last months his depression got worse and I tried to support him but more often than not he prefers to be alone when he's feeling very bad and then I just try to give him enough space. That's why we're not as close as I would have liked but this slowly improved over time, so I was patient. We didn't see each other for a month due to badly timed holidays and when I came back, he broke up with me. His reasoning was something along the lines that he thinks I'm feeling more for him than vice versa and that our relationship was more like a friendship. (Which I think is true and at the same time isn't... It's definitely not just a friendship, but because I tried to not put any pressure on him and let things be more casual at times, we weren't already there where I would like my relationship to be.)  
That was two months ago. We're still texting each day and sometimes meet - we're not having sex or kissing but still, he doesn't treat me just like a friend and it seems like he doesn't want to. We're officially broken up... but we're not just friends.   
I explained my thoughts on this matter to him and he told me that he didn't think it through and maybe was overhasty to break up and admitted his actual reason for breaking up were his thoughts going in circles, so he just ended things to stop this - although it seems that this didn't improve anything for him.   
He said he doesn't know what his feelings for me are but he doesn't want to lose me and a lot of other things none of which sounded like things you tell a friend.  
I don't know what to do. I want to give him time but as far as I know, he's doing nothing to improve his situation and I can't take this much longer.   
I know that most people - especially in the relationship subreddits...  -  probably would just tell me to put an end to this and forget him. To confirm that I'm not totally delusional for thinking that we might get back together, I've talked to some friends... and surprisingly, no one told me to just give up and that they're confused, too, and also think that his behavior isn't that of ""just a friend"".

And now, I'm still here because I've seen that he really cares about me and feels more for me than for a friend. I have the feeling that the actual reason for the break-up and what's standing between us aren't not enough feelings or arguments or any other stuff... but his depression. Many people tend to cut people out of their lives too easily and I don't just want to leave this awesome person behind because he's going through a hard time.  


**tl;dr**: Boyfriend has depression and broke up with me but still treats me more like his girlfriend than just a friend. His reasons didn't sound like they have much to do with me but more with his depression. Doesn't know what he feels for me but doesn't want to lose me and wanted time to think and work on his problems - but isn't really doing anything. I have the feeling he wants to be with me but his depression prevent him from doing so. I'm so confused and don't know what to think or how to help him.

So... I'm not sure how to phrase my question or even what exactly I'm looking for... I guess I just want to hear some other thoughts on this.  
Does anyone of you ever left a partner due to your depression? Is it possible that his depression is so predominant that there is no space to develop intense emotions for another person?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dpb02k/i_think_my_boyfriend_left_me_due_to_his/,35,"Not the same situation but I met someone who has depression.

This is apparently very unhealthy and self destructive. Problem is, that is all I know about how to love myself. I have been told to love myself but I find that VERY difficult to do. I was raised in a household with a mother who was infuriated and enraged with seemingly small things and took things way too far pretty frequently. She took a lot of her anger out on my father and she did so in plain sight of me and my sister. Her use of pure hatred and rage towards my father rubbed off onto me. The difference is, that unlike her, I have the common decency to keep all this inside my head. A lot is directed towards the outer world and a lot is directed towards myself. I cant love myself, because the only two things I feel for myself are hatred and rage, so I look to unspoiled minds for affection. I know this is self destructive and it will just push me closer to pulling the trigger or jumping off the cliff, I know that.

I am looking for real, tangible, practical and usable advice for how to love oneself. The only advice I have received so far is    that, ""You should love yourself.""

I can't properly describe it, but I could not stop crying. And this happens almost all the time. No matter what I do or how I distract myself, the pain always comes back. It's why whenever I get done with a walk or finish doing something fun, I start crying again. I think it's getting worse. Nothing I used to feel better was enough anymore. I wanted to take a knife and carve the ache out of my chest, but it doesn't work that way.

So I thought about cutting myself. I always wondered what it would be like, but never seriously considered it until last night. I even went as far as getting a knife. I got scratched by my cat before so I figured if it was anything like that it wouldn't be a big deal. And cutting supposedly took away from the emotional pain, so it would be worth it. I ultimately didn't do it. Mostly because summer is coming, and I'd have to wear short sleeves. Also because I chickened out. I would like to say I'm proud for not doing it, but I'm mostly just upset and angry. I'm tired of this. As hard as it is living with depression, I never understood why anyone would want to cut.

And it eats up all the goodness we could have for ourselves. It’s usually passed to us, but our culture plays a part too. I say this because I’m more aware now through reading and my therapist. And EMDR which I would suggest to any one with toxic shame. 
Shame can be healthy, but when it rules us it can destroy a lot of good. I’m very introverted, but I know it’s due to my PTSD, and would force myself to interact with others. 

Listen you are a human being, not a human doing. Do you think the Buddhist monks tell each other how lazy they are because all they did was meditate all day and clean the temples. I think it’s a beautiful start when we can be happy with the boring cycle we are in and then expand. 

If you don’t take meds or see a therapist I would suggest it or just having the conversation with a doctor. I hate taking my meds. I have to take a big fat antipsychotic every night along with a mood stabilizer and antidepressant. But I don’t want to die.... some days suck.... but I’m not thinking of ways to kill myself... and idk if it’s the combo of educating myself (books and YouTube) and therapy and meds, but I can now say to my past self that it will get better, but it does suck to get there, but it’s better than where we were.

Don’t beat yourself up about going on the internet. There are great youtubers (don’t buy into the life coach bs) that are awesome psychologists and therapists that can give some good advice out there. And podcasts like mental illness happy hour. After listening I feel like I would gain a perspective I hadn’t before and it felt like I did something (because I did right lol)(even if my mind wandered shhh)

A great book by John Bradshaw called healing the shame that binds you is great. I think he even has some YouTube videos from back in the day. Another great one is by the university of Staniford  on how depression is biological plus the guy who lectures it is capturing enough to not make it boring. I couldn’t even read when I started and got into audible which made it easier.

You are not what you spend your time on or how you live your life. You are a human being that needs some love and compassion especially towards yourself. You deserve good things, and you deserve peace. I hope I could provide something. Good luck friend ",2020-06-08 00:37:32

In regards to the whole kms thing I also think about it alot bit don't really think I would ever go through with it...plus I have exams in a week, important ones, and I can't even think about revising it's just such a far fetched idea to me at this point, so I know how you feel... 
It's like a beyond emptiness where you only do things reactively and never proactively. It's by far and beyond the hardest thing I've had to deal with and it is so mentally draining but if I can offer some advice (given from a therapist):
It sounds lame but seriously it's worked for me quite alot: change your thinking, liturally tell yourself how and what you want to be/be doing. Do this over an extended period and trust me, at first it will feel rediculous but over time you will start to genuinely believe in what you're telling yourself and then, slowly but definitely surely, you start to feel like you're climbing a bit out of the hole.

I am super insecure in my friendships and relationships, not about the other person, but about me.

I have autism, its incredibly hard for me to read specific emotions, and also ""read the room"" as it were, which has lead to some serious issues with human interaction in the past. I overshare, overanalyze and overthink EVERYTHING. And it leads to me constantly feeling like I'm not worthy of any relationship, not worthy to feel emotions that I do feel, and CONSTANTLY question if what I'm feeling is fair, or even my own damn fault.

I'm deeply in love with my partner, he's everything to me, but I can't identify anything he does that annoys, or frustrates me. He has told me in the past things I do that frustrate and annoy him. He has said certain things that made these feelings of inadequacy worse. He didnt mean to hurt me, he deserves to be honest about these things, and I have been doing my best to work on them and better myself. 


But ALL OF THIS, together, has made me a depressed, anxious and nervous wreck. I want to be healthy for him. I want to work on myself and be my best. But I also want that for me. I want to be independant and secure in knowing that even though I do have things to work on, I'm still...worth it. Worth his trouble, worth his patience, worth his love.

I have no will or reason to live. I hate my job. I feel like I just live to work. Getting the company owner to pay his employees what he owes is a constant battle. He tries anything he can to fuck his employees out of their money. Even going so far as to threaten to take us to court for trying to challenge him, knowing that we can't afford it. I'm a sprinkler fitter apprentice and the entire company is basically run by apprentices. We have 3 journeymen out of about 20 people. One of those is a service guy, another is the superintendent. Only one journeymen actually works on jobs. It's illegal to have jobs run by apprentices, without a journeyman on site. Like two months ago the boss went off in a safety meeting about another employee being on a job by himself. Now, I'm on a job by myself with even less experience. He constantly bods jobs that we can't man so, we basically have one person per job at this point. 

I feel completely trapped. This is the only job experience I have. I've always found it extremely hard to get jobs because I have a really hard time with interviews. And it's hard to explain to people that I spent the first years of my adult life homeless and didn't get my first real job until I was 27. 

I rent a place with my dad. He got a DUI a while back and it's taking a lot of his money. I hate the place we live. I'm pretty much just confined to my room whenever I'm home. I can't get my own place because he won't be able to afford the place of I move out. Again, I feel completely trapped.

So, I went home early today. I have a rope that somebody gave me a while back that I tied into a noose. I stood at my back door for a good half hour, looking at the tree I want to hang myself from. But, I couldn't do it. Why? Because I'm too fucking scared of a couple minutes of pain leading up to my death. Or that somebody is going to see and try to talk me out of it. Or that I'll fuck it up and just end up permently disabling myself, but not dieing. Or what my dad's reaction would be when he comes home to see me hanging g over his fire pit. Even though when I first told him I wanted to kill myself, he said do it. So, I ended up laying down and fell asleep. Woke up to pouring ran and yet another reason to despise myself. I have no desire to live yet, I'm too much of a scared little bitch to go through with killing myself.

I have no real friends. I rarely get out. I'm a PC gamer. It's pretty much the only thing that distracts me from the fact that I despise being alive. So, everyone I talk to is online. Idk why I'm even posting this. I'm just gonna get the same generic bullshit replies that always come up when somebody mentions wanting to die but, here I am. I've never come this close to actually killing myself and all I can think is what a bitch I am for not being able to follow through with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bxz01s/left_work_early_today_with_every_intention_of/,46,"There are loads of people in the world suffering from the same problems as you.

What's the point of all that. I'm not happy at all, despite everyone saying that working on myself will make me feel some sort of accomplishment. I don't. Yes, I guess I'm more healthy than ever before. But that's not what I'm after. That's not my passion or anything.

I like doing various alone-things like playing video games or daydreaming because I'm an introvert. But I'm also lonely. I could go out and meet some people. But I'd have to force myself out there, put on some fake happy face and make friendships that won't hold because either A. I would have to maintain a false personality, forget that I'm an introvert and just go out there every fucking time someone wants to meet up and do something I will not enjoy or B. go on about my introverted life but in return people will just abandon me, as they tend to do because there's a lack of common interests in the end.

The only real friends who genuinely get me are internet friends sitting somewhere on the other edge of the world. But those friends hit so much different than local friends. And, honestly, I think I'm even perfectly fine with my current friends situation. I just want someone to tell ""I love you"" to and the typical relationship stuff, but it's kinda hard finding someone compatible if I prefer staying home and cutting myself off of people. Dating apps? Fuck that, no luck there either. I understand you don't ""need"" that to survive and I could probably find some other purpose in life but this certain void in my heart will never be filled. And I can't just forget about it either.

 I asked my husband to let me know if he noticed any differences and last night he mentioned I wasn't responding normally and today even said I was being chipper.

1. Sleep: Go to Bed before 10pm. Get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.
2. Exercise: Walking, Cycling, Swimming. If you can, do them all and as often as you can. Forget Gyms, get out in the Fresh Air. Get back to Nature.
3. Medication: Find the correct AD dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. No shame in taking medication.
4. Meditation: Buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. Practice daily. I takes a while to get use to it so be patient.
5. Reduce External Stressors: This is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. Not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.
6. Stop living in the past: If you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. You will never be able to change what has already gone. Forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. Just try not to repeat any of them going forward.
7. Kick bad habits: If you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. These are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.
8. Loneliness: This is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. All i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. They saved my life. If you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.
9. Keep yourself clean and tidy: Wash each day and put on some clean clothes. It'll make you feel better.

274,favh7l,False,RANT,15,TL;DR my depression is making me spend more money than I can afford,depression_help,"Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow ""high"" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought ""well, what could happen?"". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

&#x200B;

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000€ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600€ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid.

For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I called my doctor and she said, as some of you suggested, to call the pharmacy and ask for an emergency supply.

I want to hear more from others....I'm a very introverted person, and I'm smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting.

910,b5npuz,False,STORY,3,LOVE,depression_help,"I think most of us would agree that love is the most important thing.

To love and care for someone and to have that love and care reciprocated.

One would think that something as fundamentally important as love should be something easy to understand, easy to give, easy to receive.

In reality, however, many of us have difficulty knowing what love is, and difficulty knowing how to both properly give it and receive it. 

In the world today, love is confused with sex, whereas sex is only an expression of love.

Love also gets confused with limerance, or the feeling of “being in love,” this too, is mainly a chemical and hormonal response to a person who seems desirable usually in a sexual way, which again is only a limited expression of love.

Many of us do not know what love is… little wonder, because in todays movies, tv and music they frequently portray love as limerance or “being in love,” as sex,  as enmeshment or even as codependency… but none of these represent true love, but rather a warped and out of context view of love.

Then, to compound the problem beyond belief, many of us were raised by parents who were cruel and abusive physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically… the terrible scars left on us make it ever so difficult for us to know what love is, how to show it and how to receive it, especially when we have never experienced what normal love is.

Love is like a multifaceted diamond. As a child, we are supposed to be taught by experiencing it, that love is unconditional, consistent,  reliable… it should provide a sense of safety and security when we feel scared or vulnerable… it should engender an atmosphere of openness and honesty with a sense of confidence that even if you did something wrong or bad that you will be helped and nurtured to do better.

This is by no means a definitive explanation of what love should be, but is an example of what too many of us have never experienced. 

For too many of us, love was conditional, inconsistent and unreliable, vacillating between what appeared to be love, but we knew could turn into the worst of abuse in an instant… and so love never provided a true sense of safety and security… when we did something wrong or bad we generally had confidence that we would be further abused.

In this sort of environment, as abused infants and children, we did not know why we were not loved… as an abused infant or child we formed the only conclusions we could… on a fundamental level we started to believe that we did not deserve love… we didn't know what we did wrong but we started to believe there must also be something seriously wrong with us and that we should feel ashamed and guilty about it… if we had needs and wants then we were made to feel ashamed and guilty for having them.

For many of us, a feeling of love had more to do with behaving in a manner that got our parents approval, and so we learned at a very young age that what we think, feel and want is not as important as the way our parents perceived us… being truthful was not as important as being safe. Being honest and vulnerable was not seen as an opportunity to be shown love, help and nurturing, but as a highly likely situation for further abuse.

In our early teens we start to experience feelings of romantic love… our young minds still do not know what normal love is, but by now we know that our parents are incapable of giving us the love that we need. So we start to fantasize and idealize romantic love in our minds as the thing that will heal the deep wounds cut into our subconscious minds, believing that we need another person to undo the emotional and psychological wounds that we carry.

As children and teenagers we are introduced to the concept of love through music, tv and movies. These influences further warp our sense of love into something like sex, or enmeshment, or codependency, as though “being in love” is the pinnacle of what love is, and the ultimate validation of our self worth.

Little wonder that few relationships last for years, let alone decades or a lifetime…

For many of us, we not only start off life with a handicap, but usually a large portion of our life is devoted to just figuring out what the hell went wrong in our lives, when and why and how… a great deal of us find the process far too confronting and distressing and turn to drugs or alcohol, or to other self destructive behaviors in an attempt to escape from or dull our pain.

One of the main problems with cognitive behavioral therapy is that abuse in our infancy or babyhood, is generally not stored in the logic center of our brain, so logical reasoning alone cannot undo much of the damage that is stored in the emotional fear response part of our brain, typically associated with, but not limited to, the fight or flight response… however, this is also where some of our core beliefs of worthlessness, unlovableness and fundamental shame and guilt over simply having needs and wants are stored… this is because at a very young age, these emotions were inextricably linked to fear and danger and pain that must be avoided at all costs.

That is why also, for most of us, dealing with our issues is first dealt with through severe denial, distraction and suppression, because our minds associate our vulnerabilities with severe pain and anguish and does everything it can to avoid facing up to our vulnerabilities. 

As if in a cruel twist of fate to sabotage the rest of lives, we are rarely attracted to the type of person we need to fill our emotional needs or to help us heal. Typically we are attracted to people who are oblivious to our pain and behave in such a way as to exacerbate and further entrench our emotional damage. Why? Our early childhood taught us that uncertainty almost always leads to pain… we were taught that when we did have certainty, there was a greater chance of avoiding pain. Therefore, when we met the people who could actually fill our emotional needs we were filled with uncertainty, even contempt. Why? Because these people were usually quiet natured, emotional and not afraid of vulnerability and valued openness and honesty…. All of these things put us on high alert for potential danger and pain and we are repelled by the things that our subconscious associated with danger.

What our subconscious associates with safety is certainty… so ironically, we meet people who were like our parents, mainly interested in filling their own needs, people who do not talk about vulnerable emotions, people who put on a good front… all of these things our mind is attracted to because it is familiar with it and therefore feels safe… we easily slip into relationships of codependency, relationships where our people pleasing, validation seeking and approval seeking find their best use. Usually this is with self centered people with narcissistic tendencies. These people themselves are not to blame for the perpetuation of your abuse because they themselves are products of their childhood that made them who they are who were… attracted to you as a person to meet their codependent needs or narcissistic tendencies.

One of the most soul destroying, depressing and confronting truths you will ever face is the fact that your entire concept of what love is, is wrong… you've never experienced love or given love…. You've only ever given and received your concept of love which may only amount to sex, enmeshment, codependency or “being in love,” none of which on it's own is true love.

To fix this problem we need to go back to our childhood where everything went wrong. The challenge is that sometimes we need to remember back to our infancy or babyhood if that is where the abuse began. Unfortunately this is also where many of our deepest scars were made, and it is also the time of our life where we retain the fewest conscious memories… so to go as deep as we can we often need to rely on what we know about our parents and combine it with what we know would likely have happened. Here is an example from my own life:

As a young adult, I knew I hated porridge, the very thought of it activated my gag reflex. This I knew was because my mother force fed me porridge every day as a baby. It wasn't until my 40s that I realized the deeper damage that my mother had done. As a baby, I didn't like porridge, so like most babies I spat it out… this made my mother bang loudly on the table in disapproval, she would yell and scream and hit me for spitting it out… when I learned that the only option was to swallow and then scream, my open mouth would be shoved full of another tablespoon of porridge, she would even hold my nose to stop me screaming or spitting so that I would hurry up and swallow so I could breath and scream only to be forced with another table spoon of porridge. Sad story… but in practical terms this led to far more damage than a revulsion of porridge… this is my earliest memory of subjugation… the feeling of dread associated with having no choice but to do what you are told or implied to do… subjugation by fear and consequences of pain and shock and humiliation. It also contributed to an underdeveloped self, where my personal preferences were completely irrelevant and dangerous. It also contributed to enmeshment where I quickly had to learn to do and accept and behave exactly as I was expected to make the trauma and abuse end as quickly as possible. Here is another example from my childhood:

I can't remember why, but I remember being dragged to the bedroom by my ear at about age 6… I was given a solid beating with a belt and put to bed… as most 6 year olds would do I cried hysterically, loudly, inconsolably, sobbing… as an adult looking back I think this made my mum feel bad… she didn't like feeling bad so she came back in my room to give me another hiding for crying so much… another sad story, but in practical terms, as a child it taught me that I will get punished for feeling sorry for myself… in effect teaching me that self love, self-soothing is bad and I should feel shame and guilt for it, even self hate.

For me personally, this has been my experience… my parental abuse led further to feelings of subjugation, enmeshment and an underdeveloped sense of self… this led to people pleasing, approval seeking and validation seeking behaviors as well as codependency… all of this was unsustainable and ultimately led to my severe depression and anxiety.

It is not hard to imagine why so many of us with childhood abuse are debilitated by self hate, feelings of worthlessness, intense guilt and shame for doing things that make us feel good… and continuing to do bad things that make us feel good because we were taught that this was the price to pay for feeling good.

So how the hell do we undo this?

Not easily and not quickly… it takes a great deal of time, and concentrated, deliberate, repeated effort and even then your progress will be measured in small increments.

To undo the damage, you first have to recognize what the appropriate response to your abuse was. As a child you naturally expressed this appropriate response by crying, screaming, yelling, throwing a tantrum… but all of these responses, in your case, were met with an even greater level of violent humiliating abuse… our young minds had no choice but to convince itself that the appropriate response was an inappropriate response, even a dangerous response.

Now because these memories are not purely logic based but are stored in our fight or flight response center of our brain, we cannot access or change these through logic, or cognitive behavioral therapy alone. In order to access this stored memory we first need to trigger it. For me, triggering the sense of worthlessness and unlovableness meant getting in touch with the feeling of being in love, but having that love unreciprocated or even rejected… this pain I was able to intensify by listening to my most painful heartbreaking love songs. Knowing that changing this visceral feeling had little to do with logic, I meditated on the fact that this intense feeling of wanting and needing reciprocated desperate romantic love was a complete lie… it's not and never was a true representation of love… I meditated on the fact that the concept and truth about what love is was stolen from me by the abuse of my parents… then I let myself get angry… at my parents, even though they themselves are products of their own abusive childhoods… I got angry at the injustice of life itself… I started to feel, the way a child would naturally feel when wronged for the first time, indignant, outraged, angry, generally pissed off… I listened to music to encouraged the feeling of defiance against outrageous abuse of power such as Leo Morachioli “Killing in the Name of” and “Give it Away” and “Sabotage.” In all fairness, these songs and these feelings will not make you feel love, but they will help you to wipe the slate clean… they will give you a sense of justification for feeling angry that you had valid innocent needs and wants that were not met, that you were abused and that you have the right to not be happy about it.

Of course, none of us want to spend the rest of our lives angry, but neither do we want to spend the rest of our lives apologizing for the fact that we have desperately unfulfilled emotional and psychological needs… the scarey part is allowing ourselves to move into uncharted waters as we explore the person that we really are, having full trust and love for ourselves knowing and believing that we will rise above ourselves, and be an even better version of ourselves than we ever imagined that we could be… but first, we need to be willing to explore those parts of us that we have tried for so many years to deny, suppress and distract ourselves from.

From that point on, you can start fresh… you can start giving yourself commendation, praise, validation and approval for every single good thing that you say and do. You can stop giving a @#!@ what other people think about you, because you know that whatever you did or said was exactly the right thing by you… because you can be guaranteed that most people in this world won't care one tiny little bit about you when making decisions or saying what they feel they need to say.

You simply cannot love others if you don't love yourself. If you come from a place of self hate, self loathing or low self esteem,  what possible love do you have left to give away to others? On a basic level you don't even believe that you have anything good at all to offer anyone… so you can't show true love to others until you learn how to show true love to yourself… this means being prepared to put your feelings, choices and preferences above those of others without the guilt or shame you were taught to feel. Only from that concrete position can you give consistent, reliable, unconditional love to others… you cannot do this from a place of emptiness.

Even then, when we have done everything we can, most of us may still find ourselves in a world that is less loving, less nurturing and less accommodating than we need… however, this is yet another reason to make sure that you come from a rock solid concrete basis of knowing who you are, knowing where came from, knowing what your needs and wants are, and knowing that you have the right to expect more from life than you got.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/b5npuz/love/,38,This is an excellent post.

101,goxyim,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,10,"To everyone who actually took time to read this, thank you for caring for me, a random stranger who probably doesn't deserve getting much help anyways.",depression_help,"My mom just got high blood pressure today. And it's my fucking fault.

Since I don't live with my mom or my dad, I live with my married sister and her family. My parents visit me a few times a year, and recently, my mom was able to come over to Cali since the state she lived in was going to close due to Covid, and she wanted to take advantage of this time and spend more time with me. She comes over, goes into quarantine for 14 days, and everything peachy.

Well, when my mom realized I was still hurting myself, she got really concerned, and made it her life's mission to help me get out of this depression, which I had lied about and said ""I'm fine."" Dear Mom, I want to let you know that I really love and appreciate you, but for some reason, I just can't bring myself to tell you. I'm sorry.

Within the several days, my mom *really* tried to help me. But I was always bitchy towards her, saying I was fine, and I yelled at her. My mom, she cried sometimes, but she just didn't let me see her doing that. But I could always hear it. And being me, I couldn't swallow down the part of me that hated her, for leaving me and making me grow up faster than all my friends, who had happy families and happy parents, and had the love and emotional support they needed from their own. I was always the one that stuck out, who had to depend on friends instead of my guardians, because they always insisted they were right, and I was wrong. I could never bring myself to talk to the people who supposedly loved me because I always feel like they're lying, that it's their obligation to take care of me, and that they only view me as a waste of space and money and *so much time.* 

I got depression around the age of 11, but I just never bothered to get myself help until I was close to really cracking down from all the stress and anger I'd hold in from all my encounters with my sister and her husband. We don't get along, and they always gang up on me, saying how my best friend did this better than me, I was always so bad at this or that, or how I was so fake and I always lied to them. They say other things too.

My mom started this nightly ritual for me, and it really helps. She'd take Vaseline, which would help heal wounds, and she'd spread it all over my arm where I'd hurt myself. Then after that she takes this long see-through sash, and she'd tie and secure it on my arm so I don't pick at my wounds and scabs at night, because I do that a lot just so I could feel the pain. But every time in the morning and afternoon, I'd always reopen and add more cuts and pinches onto my arms. This really stresses out my mom because I never stop, even if she really begs me to. I just get mad at her and say that it helps me.

Today, I had gotten into a pretty bad argument with my sister and brother-in-law. The previous night, I snuck my iPad into my room (no electronics in my room), and I stayed up till 4 am playing and talking with friends, who were pulling an all-nighter. It was fun, until my brother in law read my messages without me know and he found out. He got really pissed, and they enforced my already strict parental controls on my iPad, and now I can only strictly use it for a few hours at a time. They also deleted a few of my apps they didn't like me using because they didn't use it and found it a waste of time (the apps were things like TikTok and some games). While I was using my iPad, my brother in law got all in my face and pointed out how I already used my iPad for 4 hours already, so he told my sister to block my iPad so I could stop using it. I got really stressed, and I couldn't vent because I could only text on my iPad and computer (which was in the living room, and I didn't want to see their faces). So I resorted to using the back of a scissor blade, and ran it back and forth on my arm with all the scabs, and I scraped off the scabs + 2-3 layers of skin. It wasn't bleeding much, so I just cleaned it and let it dry. 

Then when my mom called me to go on a family walk, I flat out refused, and I started yelling at her for never understanding me, and how fucked up I always felt, and how tired I was (I had cried a few times earlier) and I just wanted to never see their faces for the rest of the day. Then my mom saw my arm, and she just left the room. Then around 2-3 minutes later, I hear my sister freaking out about my mom having a bloody nose. A few moments later, my mom started spitting out blood, and that's when we decided to bring her to the ER.

On the return trip from the ER, my sister just glares at me and says how the blood was triggered due to stress, and how we were lucky it was only some blood, since she could've gotten a stroke. My mom starts trying to explain to me that it wasn't my fault, but she just starts tearing up in the middle of it. Of course, that's the last thing me and my sister want, so we just shut up and try to comfort her before something else happens.

Then at home, after I had taken a shower and was trying not to cry as I explained the whole situation to my best friends, my mom just comes out of the room with Vaseline and sash in hand. She starts binding my arm, even though I was the one who caused her to be so sick, and she acted like nothing happened and tried to comfort me as I started shaking.

I feel so bad. I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm just wondering if my mom really needs a child like me. Maybe she's better off with my older sister and her perfect husband and perfect child. I stand out in the picture anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/goxyim/to_everyone_who_actually_took_time_to_read_this/,199,"I'm sorry for everything you're going through, it sounds very stressful. From your post it seems like your mom really cares about you and that you feel bad about times that you've blown up at her. My advice would be to tell her about that, tell her that you feel bad but also that you feel like people are lying and whatever else you're feeling.

Importantly, I wonder if your mother can be your ally to advocate for you against your brother-in-law to get you some more iPad time. Tell her that you need to talk to your friends as they are part of your support system and how you feel when all these restrictions are placed on you.

On the topic of self-harm, my heart goes out to you. I also know of a close friend that does this and it breaks my heart but I've learned to not tell them to stop. The reality is that it is a coping mechanism for you, and you won't be able to stop until you've found another coping mechanism to replace it, so that you can deal with the stresses that come your way. Maybe your mom and you can look into harm reduction approaches that will minimize the harm that comes to you, like not using scissors (especially ones that could have rust on them) or how to know if you've gone too far.

I’ve wrote songs before, I’ve played many instruments before, I’ve spent hours playing around secretly in GarageBand. I took singing lessons for a while. In the 4th grade I was in the 5th grade music class, because apparently I was ahead of my classmates. I played piano, and took up drums for a while. 

I quit singing lessons last year. The violin is gone now. And every once in a while on some stupid magical moment, I play piano. But I still long for music.

374,gw6j7v,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,18,This is a cry for help...,depression_help,"My story is a little bit long so I apologize for that.
I'm a step away from suicide. I've been dealing with depression for at least 19 months now, and everything sucks.

Hi there. I'm a 19 year old boy from Iran. First let me make it clear that I'm an atheist and this is story isn't from a religious perspective. But Iran has a religious culture and government which has affected this story.

I grew up lonely. My mother and father were never there for me. They just had a lot of expectations from me cause I was a smart-ass kid. But they never really cared about the pressure they put me through or my feelings.

I started dating when I was 18. Yeah, a year ago. How did I start dating? It was my last year in high school and I was studying the shit out of myself to get accepted in a great university. Just 5 months before the big test, I was so sick from the pressure. I needed someone. I needed someone to love, someone to love me. my family sucks. So I started dating this girl who was the same age I was. 


One thing I need to explain to you guys is that relationships in Iran are really different from Europe or USA. They proceed a lot faster. I know it's wrong. But it's part of the modern/religious culture that you live in.
For example you have to say ""I love you"" in the first month. Crazy, isn't it?
Also most relationships in iran don't include sex. Cause most people in iran believe that hymen test is scientific. 
And doctors are making money of this myth. Fuck.


So I started dating her and we dated for 2 months. I became extremely obsessed with her. I loved her so much. Please don't judge me for that. It was my first serious relationship and I completely fell in love.
She told me the same.
But after 2 months she told me that she can't get her ex out of her mind and broke up with me. Making me realize I was just a rebound. 

I spent the next 8 months completely depressed. I can describe my mood like instead of blood, some sort of black ink was being pumped into my vessels. I spent nights crying and punching the wall. I moved to another town for college. Dated 3 more girls but I couldn't love them and I still wanted that specific girl.

I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown to my family to start studying for the big test again and get accepted in a university. 
How did that happen?

8 months after my breakup, While I was spending my days and nights depressed as fuck, I saw something on Instagram. 
A girl from my hometown whom I had a crush on for a year followed me on Instagram. 
I saw her post and stories to know her better, and she was EXACTLY my type. Her taste in music, her beliefs (atheist) and her style and her face. She was kinda ""the one"". As Persian names are not familiar to you, I refer to her as ""Jane"". And, I refer to myself ""Jack"".

I started talking to her on Instagram, and we hit it off.
I reached one of my girl-friends who knew her. And asked her if Jane is single. She said she got back together with one of her ex boyfriends, and that guy is a fucking douche. He had convinced Jane that their breakup was her fault and she needed to grew up. Jane is also 19, and the guy was 20.
That guy was driving Jane crazy. He disrespected her in every possible way and didn't care.

I saw that as a great opportunity that when they breakup again, I can date her and treat her the way she deserved to be treated. So I waited.



But the next day, that friend told me that Jane asked her: ""did Jack say anything about me to you?""
She said no, but told her that a long time ago she heard from one of her friends that ""Jack is into Jane"".

She told me that the moment she told that to Jane, Jane got very happy and excited, and told her that she has a crush on me too.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I wanted her but she was into me too? 
I spent a week chatting with Jane on Instagram. She was absolutely amazing. 

So, sick of depression and everything, I took a leap of faith. I dropped out of college and moved back to my hometown. 
A few days later, I heard jane broke up with that asshole because of me. 
I started dating her and we dated for 2 months.

Finally, I was happy after a long time. I was living in heaven. She was so perfect that I was finally happy for a short time in my entire fucking life. I totally forgot about my ex girlfriend and fell in love with Jane.

Note: Jane is one month older than me.

I lost my virginity to her. We had sex for 3 times when we were dating. So I became kinda attached to her, you know?
I loved her and she loved me sooo much. We couldn't get enough of each other.
Something to add, she was extremely jealous. I thought that was really cute and adorable cause it shows that she cared for me but, our relationship got toxic.
She fought with me a few times about those 3 girls I dated in the past! I explained to her that they meant nothing to me and our fights ended with her saying ""I love you""

One night she told me she loved me so much. But if she sees that I'm flirting with other girls and stuff, she will breakup with me cause she can't tolerate that. I kissed her and told her that there is nothing she needs to worry about.

And I meant it.
I was 100% loyal and honest to her. 
But one time one of my friends (girl) from my ex-college  commented on one of my Instagram posts ""miss you"".
The next day, I realized Jane flirt flirted with a few guys. 
I asked her what the fuck was going on, and she said I started it.
I was heartbroken, told her that was a misunderstanding, and she apologized, which I accepted.
But, I was heartbroken cause I couldn't believe Jane wasn't loyal and committed to me.

One night, she told me that she's scared cause she feels like she is one of those girls who meant nothing to me. I told her she was insane and I'm in love with her.
 
Until one day when we were at one of my friends house and we were alone, I started making love to her. we didn't have much time so she got pissed off and told me that I was so selfish and I just wanted her for sex and left.

This led to our breakup. The next few days we fought and she started flirting with other guys.
I couldn't believe everything was falling apart. 

She told me that she loved me so much but she thinks that I don't love her so her love for me has faded away.
She told me that her personality makes her want to date older guys and I've been acting like a kid.

Break: can you believe age is this much important for girls in Iran? Well you can't blame them cause they have a lot of father issues,  but I really didn't expect it from Jane.

I couldn't believe what I heard. I was totally mature and loyal and honest about our relationship and the person who was acting like a kid was Jane the whole fucking time. But I got accused of ""acting like a kid"".

We broke up and she blocked me on everything. It's been 3 months since we broke up and it happened in the worst possible time.
I couldn't hangout with my friends to ease the pain cause of quarantine. I was lonely the whole time.

After quarantine was finished in Iran, I started hanging out with my friends and stuff but there is still a crushing pain deep down in my chest.

And you wanna know something funny? I heard she got back together with that asshole who treated her like shit.

Obviously knowing that she is this much immature made me realize I don't love her anymore. 
But I still miss that feeling. I miss being happy in a relationship. I miss being in love.

I've been seeing a therapist since we broke up and she helped me to ease the pain a lot but, I'm still extremely depressed. 

I can't study, I can't workout, my appetite is fucked up, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I can't enjoy anything. 

I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy being single. I want to put my career and studies above my dating life but I just fucking can't cause it seems like I'm still seeking for the love and attention that my parents never gave me.

She suffers from clinical depression, which causes her job as a medical doctor to be too overwhelming for her. I told her she should see a psychiatrist about that, and she responded that she is already seeing one and that she's taking meds to help her. She said she wanted to tell me because she knew I was really worried about her and why she hasn't been to work in the past months.

I didn't even realise that that was depression until my mom had me meet a psychiatrist who finally determined that I was depressed. Anyway, with proper medication, I overcame it and got much better, but I spent so many days and nights feeling extremely miserable. Thinking that my mother could be feeling that way breaks my heart. 
Unfortunately, that's not all she's dealing with. Her father died last week. My parents flew overseas to see him when his state was critical, but they refused that I come because I have school.

apparently if you can get a medical degree or an engineering one, you can work outside if you get really good grades, even in super advanced countres like australia or canada, but you have to pass some sort of really diffcult exam before you can get accepted and that worries me, because i dont think i can get motivated enough anyway to study for it

im really jealous of westerners, they have everything they could ever want

they have cool things like museums and space obsevatories and such, ive always wanted to go to one of these, or maybe a movie theater, ive never been in one before, while here we have nothing

im sorry for rambling and my really crappy grammar, i just wrote whatever was on my mind and i dont really care about revising

thanks, just writing this down after bottling it up for so long feels really liberating, i feel so much better already, and usually im not in this much of a bad mood, ill probably get over it in the morning

Sorry about the delay, I was a bit embarrassed to check this account after rambling for so long, and I was afraid I wouldn't get any replies...

Thank you so much for replying, everyone! I really can't find the words to express how I feel.

All that I can say is thank you, and I hope you get through all your problems as well.

Finding some sort of medium to talk about my problems, especially in a country that doesn't take mental health seriously at all, it honestly feels amazing.

It's just like some of you have said, people in developed countries can definitely suffer too. It's always a good idea to put yourself in other people shoes and see what they're going through. Even if they're much better off than I am, they can still be depressed, and that's okay.

There are also people far worse than I am, even in developed countries, and that's also okay.

Thank you for reminding me about perspective, and once again, thank you for replying.

I tried two years of college but it was just way too heavy for me mentally. I thought I could handle it but I was absolutely wrong. I've lost lots of credits and not even sure whether I can try again in the future. I'm even too scared to call for information. My parents don't know about this. Not even my friends. Everyone keeps asking how I'm doing in uni but I don't wanna be judged so I keep it to myself and say that everything's perfectly fine. I'm planning to work this summer but no idea what I'm going to do the next year(s). I don't want to be living paycheck to paycheck and struggling just because my depression messed up my future. I don't know what to do and this has been killing me for the past few months.

590,g5lqp5,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,8,"In the “home stretch” for my classes, but finishing everything feels hopeless—any advice?",depression_help,"My classes went online about a month ago. I knew right off the bat this wasn’t going to be a good switch for me, motivation and focus-wise. In the beginning, I actually adjusted pretty well. However, now that it’s down to the wire (two weeks left of class), I feel overwhelmed and hopeless.

The only big assignments I have left are three essays, two final exams, and a final project. I also have a few regular assignments to finish before all these are due. I’m attempting to work on one of the essays that’s due this Friday, but it feels hopeless. I feel like it’s going to be an awful essay, that I might as well not turn it in, and that it’s impossible for me to finish all these assignments over the next 2-3 weeks. 

My university is providing the option to take an ‘S’ grade for classes, so if I get above a D-, the class doesn’t affect my GPA at all. Part of me wants to take an ‘S’ for all my classes and simply give up on the rest of the assignments. However, I know the guilt will eat me alive if I do this. Plus, I can’t guarantee I’ll get above a D- in every class if I decide to take this route.

Is anyone experiencing something similar, or has in the past? Do you have any advice for dealing with this debilitating lack of motivation?

Was struggling to stay motivated before the switch to online classes, but now that I'm back home and everything's online I've been having a hard time even acknowledging my classwork, let alone finding enough motivation to do well on all my assignments. The best advice I can give is to do what you need to do to pass your classes, if you're anything like me failing the class and taking it again will just lead to more frustration and regret next semester. Just focus on that goal, that's what I've been reminding myself of whenever I feel like ignoring an assignment or just giving up because nobody will notice. ",2020-04-21 19:23:24

I have a long list of artists I can't listen to because they make me irrationally emotional, but once a month or so, I'll crack out the sad tunes and basically, purposefully let the music kill me internally. It's like I want to be overwhelmed with sadness and this is the easiest way to do it without the obvious actual self harming techniques.

612,g7p1o4,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,17,I (18M) think my girlfriend (18F) is falling into a depression and I don't know what to do about it.,depression_help,"Ok first of all I think this needs some context. We both live in a country where males are given far more rights and freedoms than females, and her dad is a tyrannical controlling misogynist and he doesn't let her do anything (basically she's been in quarantine her entire life). This is the main source of her sadness and it's really affecting her mental state negatively. She rants to me about it a lot and I try my best to make her feel better but I'm running out of ideas. 

About a month ago we were planning a way to get out of here and build a new life in a foreign country but, unfortunately, the plan flopped. Even without the coronavirus, there's no way to get her out of here safely without her father's permission. So the only way to get out is for us to get married, because when that happens I'll be the one legally in control of her (yeah, it's fucked up, I know). 

My family said I can't get married until I get a bachelor's degree (got 4 years left). This happened about a week ago and that really fucked my girlfriend's mental state up. She was sad before but at least she had hope for the future, now she says she feels like there's no hope for her and that she's losing her youth. 

At first I thought she was just exaggerating, because she was frustrated that our plan flopped, and I told her it was gonna be alright and motivated her successfully (or so I thought) but it's been a whole week and she's still depressed. I don't know what to do since we can't really be together because of this lockdown and her piece of shit dad. I send her motivating texts and constantly remind her that she's a wonderful amazing person and that she makes me really happy, but that doesn't seem to have any long term effects. 

We were talking today before she went to sleep and she said she was feeling down again, but this time she didn't have a specific reason to feel this way. that's why I'm worried and I think this is a much deeper issue than I previously thought. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said ""thanks but I don't think it'll help"". I just sent back some sweet messages that got a positive reaction then we said goodnight. 

I hope that this is normal sadness and I'm just overthinking, but what can I do to make her feel better or to maybe stop the sadness altogether? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g7p1o4/i_18m_think_my_girlfriend_18f_is_falling_into_a/,64,"Before you do anything just talk to her and check the true extent of the problem. As I said, she might just be a bit sad at the moment. If you find that she is reluctant to talk and open up maybe share your thoughts and feelings. Maybe if you talk about how upset you are that you can’t elope, or how sad you are that you can’t see her more etc etc it will ease her mind and she will feel able to open up to you when she realises that she’s not the only one feeling the way she is. Or who knows, maybe she is down about something completely unrelated! Or doesn’t even realise she is behaving in a way that is making you this worried. 

Are your family aware of this situation? I’m sorry but from the way you’ve described this situation I’m going to say what I genuinely think based on my life experience.

Nb: No matter what; all I want is the best for both of you so please know that everything I’m going to say is to try and help even if it seems a bit harsh

1. Can she not go to University too? That would give her some independence, a chance to get out the house etc. 

2. Are your family really the type of people who would ignore your happiness to this extent?

3. If she really has depression - she needs help. Being admitted to a hospital or taking her to see a doctor would be the best thing here as well as reaching out to the community/government/legal routes to see if there are any options for her. 18 legally makes you an adult in most countries so if she is 18 and is, in the eyes of the law, an adult, her father has no power over her. Moreover, if you are 18 you are an adult and therefore your family have no power over you.

4. You say none of the options people have given are realistic because you need your family to pay for your education. I’m sorry to say this but is your education more important than your girlfriends life? - if it is something you absolutely know you want and you have looked into every single way of getting an education and there is no way to get one then that is your choice. I am not saying this to be mean or anything I’m just trying to look at this from various angles. I have known too many people who have tried to and have succeeded in killing themselves. If she is genuinely very depressed, you can’t take for granted the idea that she will survive and wait for you for 4 years. She might be too depressed and take her own life if she is forced to continue living the way she has. 

5. If you absolutely cannot get married and if you absolutely have to get your degree then I would talk very seriously and honestly with your family. Maybe they won’t let you get married but maybe they would be able to help in some other way that you both, at 18, aren’t able to think of or don’t know about. Also, if your parents are made aware of the full extent of your girlfriends mental state and the situation with her father, they may reevaluate the situation.

6. If you can’t do anything to help her until you have gotten your degree, maybe you shouldn’t necessarily break up with her, but maybe you should be aware that expecting her to wait might not be the fairest thing for you to expect from her. - with this point I want to say that you need to be very careful. I would imagine she is upset because she loves you very very much and you are probably the thing keeping her going right now, so please know that I am absolutely not telling you to end the relationship, I am just trying to share some opinions from various perspectives because I don’t know where you both live or any more than you’ve shared. 

I don’t believe ending the relationship would be the thing to do here. I believe getting her away from her dad and/or to a doctor is the key here, I am just kind of playing devils advocate. Someone had said “wait until you’ve got your degree” but expecting a young woman to remain depressed and imprisoned for 4 years while you are off getting your education isn’t very fair and it would likely lead to a bad end. This is why I believe getting her into uni or work would be good to help her get her independence and maybe even save money, talking it over with your family to see if there is anything they are able to do or change considering your girlfriends situation and getting her to a doctor are the main avenues to go down.

Do try talking to her again before doing anything else though. She may just be a little upset. Depression can last a week or for someone’s entire life. She might just be a bit low because of the state of the world. Does she have much social interaction via the internet and friends etc? 

It’s clear how much you care about her and it’s really touching to see that you are her trying to get advice from others. As I’ve said, I know some of what I have said might seem a bit dramatic but with mental health you never know so I would rather say things to make you consider them than not say anything and for something bad to happen.

Last quick thing: you might have to choose between her and your education so maybe think about what you truly want - you’re 18 and you deserve everything you want in life but sometimes we do have to make difficult decisions.

Finally: I know you love her, but it is not your job to “fix her”. She is responsible for looking after herself too. It’s great that you are trying to help but don’t forget that you are not responsible for her life. There is only so much you can do, and you do need to think about yourself too. ",2020-04-25 06:44:33

I’d like to start by saying I’m not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit for this and will happily remove if incorrect. So I’m M 23 and ever since I was a kid my parents (mainly father more recently my mother. Well touch on that) have been a large source of my mental health issues. I’ve discussed this with them multiple times and was constantly told “other people have it worse” or when I break down in tears from everyday life being told “ he’s a grown man crying what a cry baby”

2 months ago I attempted to take my life and was put on short term disability until I was approved to longer be at risk to the company I work for and myself. It’s the only time I’ve felt they’ve taken the matter seriously until I found out that my mother has been talking about it to her coworkers and other family members without asking me first. 

So until I manage to find an apartment to move into I’m stuck with in a house where I don’t even feel welcome in anymore, and have begun to distant myself to the point where all I say is “okay” to any sentence and avoid conversations. I do see a therapist and things are going smoothly. I’m just at a lose on how to tell them they’ve been a large cause my problems. Not to have them take fault.

816,dw868j,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,21,Feeling like an absolute pile of rubbish. Psychiatrist has put me on another pill.,depression_help,"From UK. Long story short been diagnosed with depression since 14. Cureently 29. GPs tried me on 8 different types of SSRIs in various dosages with and without benzos for anxiety. Been to many therapies and counselling sessions.
In 2014 i got really bad after the death of my nan who raised me. I was referred to a psychiatrist who i believe saved my life.
He rediagnosed me with unipolar treatment resistant depression with anxiety. He put me on a TCA called lofepramine at 240 mg a day. This is not what the pill is licensed for however he has found through his research thats when the medication works best. (Had a lot of gps having problems with prescribing me dosage because of it, even with a letter from him) it also has a short half life and as I was a suicide risk, it was the safest option.
Been on it for a while. This week he has prescribed me another TCA amitriptyline. I also am in weekly therapy (currently mindfulness)

Anyway, i just hate the fact i have to take pills. Everyone has their demons and one of mine is feeling weak for taking medication. And now i have to take another type. It makes me feel so shit, so incapable of functioning like a 'normal' human being. My self hatred is so high and I can't switch off the thoughts.

you bottle everything up , so no one knows how you truly feel . you’re tired of the way things are & feeling this way . you’re tired of faking your way through life by pretending to be this strong & happy person . you’re tired of having to put up so many walls to protect yourself

you may feel put down by others & the things they say , but you don’t say anything because you don’t want anyone else to feel the way you do . you want everyone to like you , even when you know it’s better to just steer away from them

you’ve been hurt before , maybe more than once . you refuse to let anyone in because you fear they won’t stay . you want to be happy more than anything , but you’re scared you’ll ruin it . you fear that you’ll run off the only good thing that has ever happened to you
so many people who struggle with depression hesitate to get help because of a stigma . our society has conditioned us to be ashamed of our “negative” emotions

we’re reminded of how lucky we are , of how many would feel blessed to be in our shoes , etc . but in reality , that doesn’t help with depression . is depressed people know our circumstances & i for one often feel guilty for being sad despite everything

let me tell you something . you’re beautiful . you’re strong . you’re better than this . you can & will overcome it , if you believe you can . there are other people just like you , all over the world that are going through this with you . you’re not alone

there are people in your life that care about you & would do anything they possibly could for you . those people that hurt you aren’t worth you crying over . you should never let anyone make you feel less important than you are
one day you’ll be happy , look back on this & realize how much time you wasted worrying about people who don’t even matter . you’ll have people in your life that make you feel so blessed that you may even forget this

As it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. She helped me grow into a mature adult when I was still doing stupid young man shit. She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.
Ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which I can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. We've talked from time to time since then.

806,bn77he,False,Add a Flair!,14,I have no one.,depression_help,"I’ve been wanting to talk about this with someone for a while, but I have quite literally no one to talk to. I’m don’t make enough money to go to therapy sessions so this is the next best thing I guess. To start out, I have been rather tall and thin my entire life, it was never a problem, until high school started. As a girl it’s even harder to have the type of body I have. I’m 5’8 and 112 lbs.. Anyways, the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad moved my family to an extremely rural area on the other side of the county, so naturally I had to start at a new high school where I knew absolutely no one. The school I started was full of racist rednecks and I had never been exposed to those type of people. This is pretty funny (and I can’t wait until the day where I’m not so depressed about it that I can laugh about it) but on my very first day, this girl in my science class told the whole class that “she heard the new girl bleaches her asshole” lmao I know completely random. Well I have a dry sense of humor so when people asked me if I did I would sarcastically say yes, and they told other people that they asked me and I said yes. So for the rest of the year I was called “butthole bleacher” and I haven’t shared this info with anyone bc I’m so embarrassed. This group of boys would always tell me how disgusting my body is and how I was shaped like a boy. I went home everyday crying because I had no idea people I didn’t even know could be so cruel. This one boy in particular would tell me to kill myself every.  single. day. He was not joking at all which made it worse. I had no friends (still don’t), was told how ugly I was everyday, and was now just known as a girl who bleaches her butthole (it’s ok to laugh at it, I know it’s funny for people who aren’t me) I remember one day in particular I was walking by a group of redecks and this guy goes “there’s the flatass who fucks everyone” . I was shocked and went into class crying. I was confused, I have still never even kissed anyone so I couldn’t understand where people were getting this information from. You may be thinking I’m over exaggerating but I’m not kidding when I say that everyday I was made fun of by mainly boys for being so skinny. The day I hit rock bottom was in dance class. I had just recently experienced a ton of problems at home and the constant bullying made my depression way worse. I had made no friends in the dance class and the time came for a group dance. I waited until the last group went in fear of being made fun of, and in front of the whole entire gym, the whole group as I began to approach them said “no, no, no we don’t want you” and the ENTIRE gym laughed. after dance class was last period where the mean boy was. He noticed I was sad and told me I should probably just kill myself. Everyone was taking about me on the bus ride home that day, and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I took a rope, ladder, and my phone and climbed as high as I could up a tree in my yard. I was crying and playing my favorite song “American Pie”. Then I saw my dad pull into the drive way, and I couldn’t do it. Then, things began to turn around. I was excepted into the dual enrollment program at the community college, so for my entire junior and senior  year, I’ve been going to the community college full time and have not stepped foot into that school. I love physics so I decided to major in engineering, But, i got a D in calculus II last semester so I was kicked out of the program and since  I had all my credits for high school, I just began working full time at my job. I still have never had a boyfriend or even my first kiss. I’m so lonely and feel so ugly. Although now I’ve accepted the fact that I’m just not attracted to the opposite sex apparently. Anyways, I found out I actually had enough credit hours to get my AA before even graduating high school, so I got that last week. I’m just so depressed and I literally have no friends. Like I’m not exaggerating at all. None. I feel so lonely and embarrassed. Next week is high school graduation and today I had to go pick of my cap + gown from high school during the senior luncheon. As soon as I walked in all of the horrible memories came back and I got the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had. I pulled myself together and got in the line to get the cap and gown. And then heard a group of boys saying my name and staring at me so I looked over and  a bunch of girls laughed. Then, the group forced a gap in line right where I was standing and said loudly “excuse me”, while the rest of the group laughed. I felt so humiliated. I have to actually walk with these assholes next Saturday and I’ve never wanted to not do anything more. I just want some friends that I can lean back on when shit like this happens but as aforementioned I have absolutely none. The only thing that keeps me going anymore is my hope that my future will be better. I got into University of Florida so I’ll be starting in the fall. I’m pretty excited for a fresh start even though it’s just an hour a way from where I live. But to be honest, I’m so sad right now and I’m back in a rut.

Even if I did graduate, no one from my family would probably have gone. My own parents have never told me they were ever proud of me growing up, not once. If anything they only reminded me of my failures.

The majority of my depression is caused from growing up in extreme poverty and an unstable household with brothers abusing drugs, abusive parents, neglect, and childhood trauma. I went to a private University and none of my friends or anyone I knew even remotely experienced anything like that. 

Sometimes I get frustrated that a big reason why I couldn't graduate was because of the baggage and instability from my childhood that more privileged people graduating at my school didn't have to deal with. But I guess that's just life, it's not fair.

That comparison is going to push people away as you are creating a scenario where you isolate yourself. That’s the depression speaking. That’s what there is to fight. No one will be able to understand your experiences the way that you have. No one will be able to fully understand your pain. But don’t be resentful about it. Try and look at it as positively as possible. Maybe the people you care about that care about you won’t understand your learning disability, but remember that they are trying to, and that really matters. Perception is a huge part of depression.

Your pain is there and you don’t have to justify or quantify to other people’s experiences. All there is to do is move forward and try and find ways to be as happy as possible. We are stuck with the hand we are dealt so instead of being upset you got a shit hand, try and make the most of it. I’m really sorry that you feel this way, but no one is going to make it better but you. 

Think of the little things that make you happy, think of the people that care about you and mean something to you. Let yourself relax, and take things one at a time. You will find ways that work for you that help with the depression I know you will! Good luck :)

Quick backstory: I've suffered from depression ever since I was around 16, now I'm soon-to-be 25. I tried seeing a therapist back when I was 18 and started university. She was truly awful and I thought I had no right to see a therapist. 

Fast forward to january 2019, I decided to try another therapist because I am truly incapable of living in this state. I still haven't finished university. I'm trying but failing. I'm incapable of doing most tasks, let alone focus on studying. Although I have a job I don't get paid much. I depend on my parents who try to support me, but soon won't have the governments support because I'm too old to count as a child. 

I just found out and I feel aweful. I never wanted to be a burden to my parents. They're not made of money, and although my mom said she won't kick me out, I know she's growing impatient. She's having  a difficult time understanding me anyways and this will only make it so much harder. 

  
I struggle very hard not to let the thought of ""ending it all so they'll be better of"" take over. Because I know my mom won't be better of knowing I've commited suicide. I don't want to die. I just can't live.  Does anyone on this reddit know how to deal with this?

Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode 

So ages ago I came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. I have been searching high and low for it to share, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. If these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. 

In the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what I pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. 

[Note: I’m not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. These will not work for everyone. This is just a compiled list of things I have found useful, people I know have found useful, or I have read from other writers.]

Including: 
-The Very Basic Basics 
-Food 
-Personal Hygiene 
-Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross 
-Asking for Help 
-Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time 

**The Very Basic Basics**

1)Don’t Die 
It sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. So as long as you are still alive, good job! If you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help ASAP. Tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in America) or go to your nearest emergency room. 

2) Bare Minimums 
Moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. And I mean the absolute bare minimum. The more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. Once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. 

For example, my list is:
Get out of bed at least once 
Take meds/vitamin 
Fill water bottle to drink throughout the day 
Eat at least one (1) thing
Do one “Have To” and one “Like To” (see next point) 

Theres plenty of other things I shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just A Thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 

3) Have To’s and Like To’s 
Try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. This is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. You are moving through this depressive episode. 

Make your Have To’s and Like To’s  proportional to your energy that day. On an okay day your Have To might be a load of laundry and your Like To might be a long walk. On a bad day your Have To might be wash one fork and your Like To might be to watch a funny youtube video. Baby steps. 

Don’t worry if you are not actually enjoying your Like To. Depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. It will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. 

At the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! 


**Food**

So in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. To do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. Also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. 

[Note: I'm not a nutritionist. Note #2: I’m super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what I eat while depressed. Please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]

Buy stuff in advance 
You probably don’t want to go shopping when you’re depressed. So sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. I’m not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. Depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. Bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. Think things like:

Hearty soups/stews with protein and grains
Chef Boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie serving
Frozen Tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain 
 
Whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of “Open, Microwave, Eat.” 

It’s also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 

2) Grocery Shopping 
If your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: Asking For Help). There’s nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. 

This is your chance to get the things that you can’t store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. Again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. 

Stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. It depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of 
Yogurt 
Chicken or Tuna salad
Veggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) 
Hummus 
Cheese 
Sandwich meat 
Fruit (if you think you’ll eat it fast enough. Mine always ends up going bad) 
Milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) 
Pre-made sandwiches
Etc 

Also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like 
Bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) 
Crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)
Cereal 
Snacks (See below) 

3) When you can cook, use that energy well 
If you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. 

As with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. Extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. Think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. I always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. I know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. Whatever works for you. 

When I’m done cooking, I like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross) but I know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don’t have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 

4) Snacks! Make them useful 
Sometimes meals are tough. No worries, snacks are easier! But in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. You are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like 

Nuts/trail mix
Granola 
Protein/granola bars 
Beef Jerky
A giant spoonful of peanut butter (I know I’ve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) 
Or other foods with similar benefits

5) Drinks 

DRINK WATER. As much as those “all you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day” posts are utter BS, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. Water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. 

Whole milk and Soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. 

If you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast or something along those lines. If you find a protein powder that isn’t super gross, that's good too. Try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. 

Drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. V8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. 

Smoothies? I’m a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. I’m not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.

NO BOOZE. I know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. Alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. Also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. Just stay clear until you’re feeling better. 

And drink water. I said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. 


**Personal Hygiene**

OK so this one gets tricky, because I don’t want to be the one saying like, “meh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things” but when push comes to shove, if you can’t do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. So, a few points: 

1) Teeth:
If you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.

Mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it’s way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 

2) Showers 
Feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. 

You can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. So instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself “I’m going to get in the shower, and I’m going to wash my armpits, and then I can just stare blankly at the floor until I run out of hot water.” Odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you’ll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. If not, at least you don’t have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. 

Washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don’t let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. Some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. 

If you can’t manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. Again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 

3) Face 
Baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don’t have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 

4) Baby wipes in general 
Baby wipes are just in general great. Keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. Anything you need to be clean and you don’t have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 

5) Have a routine 
If you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. Ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. Autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think “Wait, did I brush my teeth before I got in the shower? Was that three days ago? Who knows.” 

5) Clothes 
Wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don’t stress too much. Clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. A good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. If you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. You are already 75% of the way there. Grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. 

If you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). 


Long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don’t let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. Do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.


**Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross**

The more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. Also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don’t want people to come over, either just for company or to help. So, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. So here’s some tips 

1) Trash
Don’t bother with trash cans. Ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. You’ve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. That's way too much work. 
 
Instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. Put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. Make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). Just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. When it’s full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. Or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. Done! 

2) Dishes 
Ain’t nobody got time for dishes. Piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. Buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. Seriously, it's a life-saver. I recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you’re eating out of a halloween bowl in June? When you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you’re good to go. 

If any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 


3) Disinfectant wipes
If your episodes are long enough that it’s unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. Just grab a Clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. Make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 

4) Overall 
Overall, try your best but don’t worry. Nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. 

If you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. If you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at.

 Ask for help before it gets too bad. It's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. If it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). Or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. Again, you’re sick, it's okay to be a mess. 

**Asking for Help**

A strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. Having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 

1) Again, Don’t Die 
I’m going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. If you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out IMMEDIATELY and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest ER. 

2) Explain your depression before an episode
Talk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. If they give you the “yeah, okay, I get sad sometimes too” face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. If they give you the “Oh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, I get that because I understand how bad depression can be” face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 

3) Ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family 

When you say you’re having an episode, a lot of people will say “aw, well let me know if there's anything I can do to help.” They say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. And it's true they can’t make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. 

When you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don’t have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. They will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. 

So ask for specific things. When they say “Is there anything I can do to help?” Say something like:

“Yeah, actually. I know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and I need a hand with it. Any chance you could come over and help? We can watch a movie while it's in the washer.”
“Yeah, I really need to do dishes but I’m having a hard time motivating myself. Can you come over and give me a hand? I think I would do better at it with company.”
“Yeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and I don’t know where to start. Can you help?”
“Hey, I really need some food, but I’m having a hard time getting to the store. If I gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? I’ll pay you back for them.” 

Its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. 

Also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. Mine is a lot less formal and a lot more “Hey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.” But whatever works for you and your support system. 

4) Be specific in what you need socially 
In the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. 
. 
This is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. A lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. It’s okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. Again, be specific. You can ask a friend: 

“Hey, I need some company, but I don’t have energy to go anywhere or do anything. Want to come over and watch a movie while I lay on my couch?” 

Or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don’t have much energy, same thing:

“Hey, I still have way too much depression for doing things, but I need a change of scenery. Can I come lay on your couch while you do stuff?” 

If a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you’d like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. If you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. You can say:

“I’d love to join, but I’m still dealing with a depressive episode, so I will probably just sit there. That okay?”

Or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don’t want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. Say something like 

I think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. Thanks for inviting me, though. I appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if I keep saying no. Eventually I’ll be able to say yes again. 
Or
I’m probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. I feel really bad that I have to keep saying no, so how about I tell you when I’m feeling better and we can start hanging out again. 

However BE CAREFUL when creating long-term distance from people. You need some people checking in on you, so it’s okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don’t have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.

5) Talking to casual acquaintances 
It's tricky to explain depression to people who don’t understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. People like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don’t like, etc aren’t owed that level of information about you if you don’t want to get into it. That is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. A lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally I just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. 

Everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. It's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you’ve been so off lately. Whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you’d like to share. 

Since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as “being sick.” The conversation I use most frequently goes as follows.
 
You okay? You’ve seemed off lately.
Yeah, I’ve been sick. I’ll be fine. 
Oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?
No, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* It happens sometimes, but I’ll be okay. 
Oh okay, well I hope you feel better. 

That establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) I clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) I’ll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. 

I use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why I’m not super peppy at work, etc. 

Again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 

6)Getting professional help 
If you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. Nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. 

I'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. Getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. You might have friends saying ""you should really talk to a doctor about this."" Tell them ""yes, I want to, but I do not have the energy to make that happen. Here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while I call and schedule an appointment?"" if you have to. 

I'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but I will say this: Talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. 


Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time
 Phew! Okay, that’s the guide. So to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:

Lists to make:
Your list of absolute bare minimums for every day 
Depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can’t be purchased in advance

Things to have:
Good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prep
Storable food items that need to be cooked, but are easy
Storable healthy snacks
Mouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you’re into that 
Plastic/paper bags for trash 
Paper plates, bowls, and cups
Waterproof box with a lid for dishes 
Disinfectant wipes for cleaning 

People to talk to/things to think about
Talk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not 
Explain the type of help you might need
Think about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask 

Please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps! Stay safe friends!

She dropped everything and came over and cleaned up the dead mouse (when I'm well, dead things freak me the fuck out and while she is grossed out she can still handle it). She helped me clean my closet, took some of my clothes, my bras, and my duvet home with her and washed them while I did some other laundry while we were cleaning. She has depression too and once had somebody do this same thing for her.

765,9b8p3u,False,,7,After years of issues I've just been diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy.,depression_help,"I hope this is not patronising because each person's set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. Some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. I think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. Hopefully you'll find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. Here's what helped me:

Stop drinking completely. You may think you're only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. Alcohol is of course, a depressant. Giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in Western cultures but there are now some good non-alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. Alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. Try going at least a month without drinking. I expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. I don't know much about those though.

Exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. The endorphins make you feel better, you'll get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run/swim/cycle etc faster and further. If you join a club you'll make some good friends too. Personally I think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you're there with a friend. Group classes are good though. Track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. Go out even if it's raining. Once you've warmed up it's great.

Give yourself a project or ambition to work on. Immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it's just here on reddit. You might feel right now that you've lost interest in just about everything but there's probably something from your past that you could pick up again. Or it could be something totally new. Some examples: learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, CAD. I hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which I don't think helps much. I think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. Just pick something to work on and do it regularly. Share what you do with other people.

Minimise your social media use. There have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. Dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. I'm not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but don't just endlessly scroll. Same goes for reddit. Try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary.

Find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. Therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. Good friends are better imo. Maybe some of them are having problems too. You could help them and feel good about it.

Get some quality sleep. Go to bed on time and don't allow distractions like your phone. If you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. There's a ton of stuff like that on Spotify. You'll want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. There's also Sleep Radio. Also important is getting out of bed on time. Have a little routine. Get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing Feeling Good and don't give a shit who hears.

Recognise when you're ruminating and make yourself stop. This is hard. Sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. Don't feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. Get up and do something. Do that thing you've been putting off doing. Clean the kitchen. If you're doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow.

Avoid shift work. It's really not good for you.

Get a pet. Or even just a plant. Look after it well.

Listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. If you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz.

Spend more time around nature.

Help other people with their problems. It's rewarding.

This last one is going to be very controversial: Make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. Hopefully you'll find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. Say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. I'm not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking 'how are you?' can help lift someone else's mood and in turn could lift yours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/9b8p3u/after_years_of_issues_ive_just_been_diagnosed/,49,This post is helping me pull myself out of the rut of negative thinking I’ve been doing for the night.

750,do7trc,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,7,Two Depressed people in a relationship,depression_help,"I’m really struggling and need some support right now.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for a few months, and we clicked immediately.  We’ve always been really forthcoming with our struggles with mental illness.  I tend to lean more into anxiety with sporadic bouts of depression.  He, on the other hand, is a full blown clinically depressed.

The depression started creeping up beginning of September.  At first it was subtle, and I was doing ok with dealing and understanding.  

But now, it’s manifested into full blown anxiety attacks on my end.  I can’t even joke around and be fun anymore, because I consider every thing he says to be to be a slight against me.  I’m misfiring and crying uncontrollably.  And I’m constantly battling between my intellect and what I know (he’s depressed, it’s not a choice, he doesn’t mean to pull away or hurt my feelings when he’s withdrawn, etc.) and my anxiety monologue (something is wrong, because I am wrong, and he’s not telling me because he wants me to break up with him/hurt me).

The major difference between us is, I have a support system.  I have group therapy, one on one therapy, and tools that I use to keep me in check.  But lately, I can feel my codependency on him being happy completely fuck with my own well being.

He says this is just how he is, and has been luke warm to my suggestions to see a therapist (though I know he believes in counseling and has gone in the past).

And it’s also screwed with our intimate side (which I think is a lot of the source of ire).  Sex is important, but my partner’s well being is of course more important.  I am usually the one initiating, but the last few weeks he’s been so down, we can’t connect on that level.  I have my own issues with self worth and feeling desired.  A previous ex of mine withheld sex as a means to get us to break up, so I am on high alert.

It’s really hard to hear he loves me and this has nothing to do with me, but to feel the actions he makes are contradictory.  I am really struggling to allow him this space to process and move through his depression without imploding on my end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/do7trc/two_depressed_people_in_a_relationship/,54,"Look, I'm going to say something you don't want to hear right now, but I say it in the honest belief that it is the right thing to say:

This relationship is not worth destroying yourself over.

Love just isn't enough sometimes. While I do believe in fighting past rough patches in relationships and supporting each other, I also believe that sometimes we encounter situations where our wellbeing might become damaged if we try to do that. This sounds like something that is going to be an ongoing problem in this relationship, so you need to consider whether it is worth it, and whether you can handle it. I'm not suggesting you break up with him, but I am suggesting that if you need to step back then do so.

Now that I've said that, I think you might do well to do what you can to help yourself first. Use that support system to keep yourself together as well as possible, and (if you haven't) read up on depression and methods of dealing with it. If he's luke warm about therapy, there are other tools out there he might be more willing to try. You might even suggest you do them together.

Also, if you're having trouble with intimacy right now, try replacements. Cuddling and massages are good physical replacements, and the former can be done watching tv together or something. Make it as easy as possible for him to be engaged or with you - even just being in the same room as him and doing your own thing will allow him to know you're there for him, but giving him space. He might be withdrawn, but trust me that knowing that you care for him and are around will be important to him.

That said, don't be afraid to take a few days break. Text him, message him, whatever, but go and do something for you. A small break might be exactly what you need to better support him and not implode. And, it might do him some good too.

Does he suffer from SAD? Winter months can be really tough for some people. ",2019-10-28 11:57:47
257,bdawhr,False,Add a Flair!,15,This is a post for all those who consider taking their own lives.,depression_help,"One week ago my little brother committed suicide. I am not going to tell you how, because I don't want anyone getting ideas and I also don't want to get too personal.

He was in his early twenties, he had just started a new job he really liked, he had friends, he was dating, he had fun, he was enjoying life. At least that's what we thought, that's what it looked like. What no-one knew was that he had been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years… The news not only about his sudden death but also about his illness has left his friends and family in a complete shock. Our world has suddenly stopped turning and we have no idea how to deal with this. 

Looking back you start seeing little signs, small things that could have indicated how he was really feeling, behind all his jokes, behind his laughter… not a day has gone by since he left us that I haven't cried until I was completely exhausted; that I haven't begged the universe to let me wake up from this nightmare and bring him back to me.

We were extremely close and I often let him know how much he means to me and that I will always be there for him, but still… he felt alone. It was his depression that didn't allow him to see things the way they really were. And now it's too late. He can't go back, he doesn't get a second chance. We now know that he thought there was a tiny chance he might survive this, but he didn't. If you make that choice, it's final, there's no going back, not for you and not for the ones who love you.

You may think you're alone and that nobody is going to miss you, but that is bullshit. It's your illness that makes you blind.

So please, if you're considering suicide, think about all the pain your death will cause. There are people you can turn to, places you can go to that can help you. There is a way out of this suffering. I wish my brother had had a tiny bit of energy left to seek help. I know this world sucks, I really do. We have created a disgusting society that makes more and more people feel worthless, never good enough and right now I'm furious at the whole world. Please don't bow to the sick ideals of today's society. You don't have to be 'sexy’, you don't have to have a certain weight or earn a certain amount of money. All you really have to do is make yourself happy, truly happy. Reach out so someone. There is help and there are so many people who managed to come out of this and take back control over their lives.

I wouldn't wish this kind of pain upon my worst enemy, so please don't do this to the ones who love you. I know that depression sometimes makes you think 'they will be happier without me’ - I can assure you, that is a lie. It's a lie your illness tells you to make you surrender. It wants to win and to do that you have to die. Don't let it win. Please stand up and fight. You don't have to fight alone, but please don't give up.

Edit: Thank you all for your support, there's not really much I can say at the moment, but please know that your kind words are appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/bdawhr/this_is_a_post_for_all_those_who_consider_taking/,114,"I'm so, so sorry for your loss. I want to thank you for understanding, even when your loss is so raw, that people aren't being selfish when they take their own life. Depression lies and twists everything to fit its negative narrative, where nothing will ever get better and other people will be better off without you. Being made to feel guilty and ashamed for having thoughts of suicide doesn't help at all.

Personally, in my teens and early 20s I was really scared of being a failure and letting my family down. 

When I really hit rock bottom and seriously contemplated taking my own life I actually felt angry that I had to stay here suffering to prevent the people around me suffering. I've seen the impact that losing someone to suicide has, even on people who were only acquaintances.

I came to the realisation that just staying alive is enough, and anything I achieve while alive is a bonus. I managed to get out from under the crushing weight of expectations and it was quite freeing. I've quit multiple jobs and I live with my parents, while my friends are getting on with their lives and hitting goals like marriage and buying homes, but I've stopped judging myself by other people's standards. 

I really wish your brother had felt able to speak to someone and ask for some support. There's such a big problem with men not feeling able to reach out for help. Here in the UK the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is trying to change things. ",2019-04-15 02:31:10

Gratitude is important, because it focuses you on what you have, instead of what you don't.

Think about what you have, and what you don't and you really need. Make some lists. And this is how you get ideas.

Think about the problems you currently have, and see if others have them. If many people have a certain problem, see if you can solve it by developing a product or service, and see if people are willing to pay.

Ask for help. Visit associations, volunteer, meet new people.

There is a solution, but you are not looking in the right place if you are not seeing it. Break the pattern and do something different.

I already get depression sometimes, but up until a few months or less ago I was ready to kill myself.

I ended up moving back in with my parents (did not want to, I didn’t grow up in a healthy household and it’s still not healthy) and quitting my job (about 4 months ago).

I’m currently picking myself back up. I’m at the point that I know when I get a new job I will for the most part be back to normal. 

Whenever I talk to my mom about putting out applications and what I’m doing, she just gives me this sad looking smile. 

I know that my mom/parents are not healthy...honestly I need to move out of here when I can (there are a lot of reasons that I won’t go into right now). 

But I guess in my state of mind this really bothers me. I’m trying to get back on my feet and instead of someone there to say “you can do this!” I get this pity look. I don’t understand. It makes me go back into that thinking pattern of “what’s the point?”.

I don’t need praise in normal life, but with what I’ve been through/am going through it would be nice to have some positive support.

I don’t really have anyone else besides my parents right now and one friend that I see occasionally. (Another thing I plan to start working on, making more friends).

723,byz4jp,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,47,Seeking advice for working with depressed partner,depression_help," Hi all,

I've been dating a really wonderful woman (mid 20's) for about half of a year that has been depressed for the last couple of months.

At first she was mostly quiet, tired, and sad, but she was responsive enough to tell me she couldn't hang out because she wasn't feeling great. I understood that she was isolating herself, so I gave her space and tried to be understanding. We still saw each other once or twice a week, but we communicated a lot less.

Now she's becoming more irritable, less responsive, and frankly not very nice to me. I've been taking the mean comments/criticism in stride and talking with her as if what she said wasn't mean. But it's beginning to take a toll on me. She's also shut down affection/intimacy for the last month which has made me feel less close to her (but I understand that can disappear). She also asked for more space this past weekend (which was an easy thing to say okay to, being that we're not even seeing other very much right now).

I think I need to have a boundaries conversation with her so that I can outline that I need her to try to be less critical of me, to talk to me about what I'm doing that isn't working / what she would rather I be doing, and to talk to me about why affection has died between us and what we could do instead to maintain closeness in our relationship.

Could somebody give me feedback on if having a boundaries conversation with her would be a good / bad idea?

For example right now my daughter has a blister on her foot and what does she do she says daddy my toe hurt. I could continue to be depressed today but I choose to go into daddy mode and make her ok.

I have 0 friends and I can't make any due to my social deficits and anxiety. Going outside is pointless, because the streets are ugly and filled with dog shit and I need to breath through my mouth for most of the way. Trying to start a conversation with anyone is pointless because most of the people around here are elderly, extremely conservative, and annoying and will make it clear that their frontal lobe is deteriorating with age. Besides that, there's a lot of foreign people around that don't know English, and I never even got along with the native population because of conflicting values and being nearly unable to communicate in the native language. Cue misunderstandings, people being very annoyed with me and looking at me in suspicion because of that.

I cannot escape into the countryside because we barely have any left, and what is left is filled with rubbish, criminal hunters, and yet more dog shit. At least maybe if I lived somewhere like Germany or Sweden, I'd think how if I killed myself I wouldn't get to experience all that beautiful nature.

And I find it absolutely maddening how people chastise me for trying to isolate myself from the world. The environment around me is objectively, fucking ugly. And the only way I can deal with it is by spending time in the virtual world; video games, forums, writing. It's literally been my life support for years.

In other words, if your daily life is miserable, trying something new wont be as bad and it can help you see options and doors where there were only walls. As for spending time in the virtual world, if you like video games so much you can work towards a career there. The gaming industry is booming. Or if you're a really good gamer you can post youtube videos and get a community going. I'm also into virtual worlds (Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, LOTR, GOT).

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

I can feel emotions. When I’m with friends and family or watch a funny video I laugh and smile, but it just feels empty? Lifeless? Like on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the happiest) I know I should be feeling a 10 and in general the situation is a 10 but for some reason I can’t seem to get past a 5 at most. It’s like my brain is saying “this is funny you should laugh and feel happy” but I just don’t feel that? At least not fully. It’s like my 5 is other people’s 10s, both are fully happy just one is less than the other. When other people are laughing so much they’re in tears and can’t catch their breath I’m only chuckling, even though I *know* the situation is funny. I can’t even remember a time where I laughed so much I was in tears. When I laugh it almost feels like a chore or an automatic response that I could just as easily not do. This is hard to explain but when I laugh and smile it’s like i’m not physically feeling it. What I imagine true happiness to feel like is a warmness, something you can physically feel in your body, but when I smile/laugh the outside physically changes but inside I don’t feel anything. It almost feels as if I’m acting but I’m not because I do know the situation is funny. It’s like there’s a disconnect somewhere. It’s hard to explain. 

And this is just one emotion, I feel this with everything. The only emotions I seem to be able to feel the strongest are annoyance/anger and sadness, but even that’s toned down, not saturated, lifeless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/amtpud/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_saturation_in/,80,Do some mushrooms 🍄 ,2019-02-03 20:37:14

I have one last semester left before I graduate. I feel empty inside and I feel like I haven’t done much fun stuff with college. 

I’m 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although I have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it’s eating me up, because I feel like no one wants me. The few girls who I got “close” with (and by close I mean talking) turned me down, and last semester I got friendzoned by the girl I liked. I have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. All of my friends have had sex/dated and I feel so left out. I’ve lied to people about my lack of success just so I don’t get mocked.

I’ve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to put on weight or bulk up. I’ve never been athletic and don’t have anything to show for that. I’m also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. I don’t have enough money to travel, and don’t really have any unique hobbies or skills. When I was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which I feel has socially stunted me. 

I don’t know if I’ll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when I return home i feel like I’ll be stuck at there NEETing and working minimum wage jobs. Two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.

I know when I graduate I’ll be miserable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ej0qkv/i_feel_anxious_about_going_back_to_college/,54,"Hey, brother. I'm 26 (also a virgin who's had little luck with women) and doing my second graduate degree in another country far away from my home. I have to return to school next week to finish my internship and to start my master's thesis. I'm very nervous about going back, due to the pressure of work and school. Being on the other side of the planet and far from my family doesn't help either. I also have serious regrets about what I studied for my bachelor's and my first master's degree, as I've found it incredibly difficult finding work in my field. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time by choosing poorly regarding what to study.

As sad or discouraged as you may be feeling, I strongly recommend that you look for some fun/interesting hobbies; not so that you sound like an ''interesting'' person to others, but rather for your own personal/mental development. Trust me, from my personal experience, it helps so much as a distraction from and a way to cope with whatever negative feelings you may be having. Also, you have a lot of time to change what you want to study or to pursue a completely different field altogether! Don't feel trapped or like your career is headed for a dead end. There are always other options. :)

I hate being the 5 billionth person to be complaining about the pandemic. But I need to get it off my chest. I wish this could all be over. Everything’s getting worse and worse. I’m not exactly doing great mental healthy wise, especially seeing how I haven’t seen my friends for 23 days now. Yes, I’ve been counting. And I don’t know why.

We’re running out of food, with little way to get more. My mom can’t go to work because she got infected. She won’t see another paycheck for god knows how long. I can’t go find work because everything’s closed, and I too got infected. The money I have now won’t be enough.

All I can do now is lock myself in my room. Doing endless amounts of homework and waiting for the virus to kill me. Because it might. I have asthma. It hasn’t gotten to that point yet but.... at this point I want it to kill me. I don’t know when this will all be over, and I’m losing everything. I’m close to losing my friends. I keep lashing out against the people I care about and I don’t know how to stop.

It’s becoming a problem. I haven’t been able to physically interact with another person in weeks. I’m desperate for any human touch at this point. I think it’s making me more horny.... which is becoming a serious problem.

I wish my mental health wouldn’t crash down like this man. But it did, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t know if I’m outright suicidal. Maybe borderline.

I was in student government, ap classes, had a awesome group of friends, and just came back from state for DECA. This diagnose came after me starting to skip school and not wanting to get up in the morning. Naturally I started therapy and would go once a week during lunch. April rolled around and my depression was progressively getting worse. It all came to a head when I wasn’t allowed to run for student government next year and that night, April 18th 2018 I overdosed on several different medications that belonged to my 89 year old great grandfather and mixed it with NyQuil. I laid backed and closed my eyes hoping to die in my sleep but then I had a dream where I died and everyone I knew wasn’t the same next thing I know I wake up in a hospital with my great-grandfather wiping his tears away and I knew what the universe was trying to tell me. So eventually I continue therapy and fail second semester of sophomore year because I knew school wasn’t for me. I spend the summer with friends and try and get back into the grove of things. Fast forward to October and for DECA there was a fall conference that I was really excited to go to and I knew would help put me on track. I was denied because my “penmanship showed I didn’t care.” I again felt so defeated and started skipping school. My friends wouldn’t try and be understanding this time and told me to get my shit together and drop me. My grades where dropping and I was just feeling like killing myself again. This time around I knew better so I started to have sex, drink, smoke, party to distract myself from the pain. I got stuck on a island (I live on the west side of WA), would come home @3am a lot, sneak guys who were 18+ and I was 16 at the time and would overall put myself into a lot of danger. During this rebellion I found this app called Yubo and for the next few months I made some amazing friends, got into a lot of drama, and this helped meet my social needs to a certain extent. Also during this time I switched to online school. I eventually was banned off Yubo because of “threatening behavior.” But the app is trash and toxic and only gave me a small group of people that I still talk to to this day. All of my “problems” seemed to go away once I deleted the app and the day after my 17th birthday I got myself a puppy. Now I’m going back to my seasonal job at Nordstrom and I’m only a few credits away from graduating high school a year early. I started off on the top, hit ROCK bottom TWICE, but with the help of therapy, support, Prozac, and honestly going through a rebellious stage I’m in a happy place in my life and it is all thanks to my ex-friends, and the two teachers who hated me for putting me on a path that will lead me to making 6 figures a year by the time in my mid 20’s debt free while they all are dealing with crippling debt<3.

I may be a cynic and that's why but I do feel like, instead of helping, positive thinking makes me feel like an incompetent person, like I'm being talked down by the superior other that is going to come down to tell me the universal answers. It sounds like the one doing the positive talk is patronizing me. Is not that I'm the one who has ""low self esteem"", it definitely sounds like you are the one with ""superior complex"" and or humble brag. *""It's so easy to to be happy, just do what I do, it worked wonders for me, how can you not be happy with what you have? I care about you, you are so strong (smiley face thumbs up  heart kitty)""*. Ugh... It's like baby talk. It's condescending.

That only works so much and doesn't solve anything. 

Sometimes saying ""you know what, yeah, it fucking sucks and there might not be a solution to it"" it's much better because I can stop focusing on it and start trying other things. Sometimes a smack on the face on someone that is being a dick to you is what is needed to stop certain situations. Let me lash out at the world and let others know that something might be wrong with it and it won't get better unless it changes too.

I would prefer not avoid not to hurt the other with my words or my supposed toxic behavior because I can't see the bright side, censoring myself and what I actually think every five minutes to try to keep things going and make the other not feel offended.

Try calling around, the local librarian is a lot of help too. Ask, ask, ask. You are young-you only have one foot on your launch pad. Hang in there there truly are fantastic happy times ahead. Expect the unexpected. ",2020-03-18 09:02:37

439,ee5rgx,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,16,Are you honest with your friends about your depression?,depression_help,"I’m a 28yo F, and I have severe depression since 2012. 
My crisis unfortunately occur quite regularly (once an year or once every 1 and a half year). 

But since my first crisis I told me friend that I wouldn’t give them attention, I wouldn’t go out with them, I would avoid social media and texting. 

I explained everything the best I could, how I felt, how hard it was to keep contact and how it felt like a task/burden during my crisis. 

That maybe during the crisis I would need their help and it would seem selfish being absent for long periods os time and appear to ask for help without asking  about them. But it is what I can offer at the moment, and that when I’m out of a crisis I would treat our friendship normally again. 

Did I lose any friends? Sure, but it’s the life, some people can’t deal with this, but a lot of people can... you would be really surprised. 



I have a lot of friends for my age. 4 friends that I know that would do anything for me, even take me to their home if I end up homeless. With them I can share about the ugliest parts of my depression if I want to... 

I also told them that it’s ok for them to not know what to say or how to help when I tell them the ugly stuff,  I go to a psychologist every week and she can help me with that. I just tell them those things when I feel like I need to vent and I’m ok with them only answering in the lines of  “shit, this is tough. Let me know if I can do something to help.”

And I also have other friends that are super ok with me being absent from time to time, and when I’m on those periods of non crisis I talk to them by text and even see them occasionally to talk and have fun, and it seems like nothing have changed on our friendship. 


I’m very lucky to have them, but I know that this is due to the fact that I was honest with each one of them and I asked them for comprehension. Some of them just disappeared from my life with time, but I made other friends and those who I kept are really understanding and supportive. 



So I guess this is a tip for those of you who don’t know How to handle friends during your lows. 

Instead of disappearing without a warning and being embarrassed to contact them later, or making yourself present on their lives and, consequently, being rude or down in your interactions (which makes them not wanting to be your friend on the long run). Be honest and don’t be ashamed to ask what you need. 

It is a disease, and unfortunately it is a chronic one for most of us. So don’t apologize for taking care of yourself the best you can, even if you have to disappear from time to time to do that. 

The right friends will help you with that. 



Another tip: don’t waste your time with acquaintances. 

You need to have a good relationship with the people that is part of your daily life, like relatives, colleagues, friend of a friend. So be polite and helpful whenever you can. But don’t put your energy and mind on those relationships. You already have so little of it. You should use it to the things that are important to you.


Do you need to go to a party from a colleague from work or go out to look for s gift to s baby shower for a distant relative? Do you have to call all your relatives on their birthday and go out of your way to do a favor to your friend’s friend that you see sometimes and chat with them socially on those occasions?  Hell no, you don’t have to do any of that. Saying “no” while being polite it’s totally ok, and should be done by everyone, not just us. 

If the person gets upset because they feel entitled to your time/money/effort, to hell with them. Who cares? They are not important enough to be more than acquaintances anyway, and if they say shit to others about you, the important people in your life already know your situation and won’t listen to their comments. 


I hope these tips can help someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ee5rgx/are_you_honest_with_your_friends_about_your/,83,"It’s a tough question . My own experience :

1. Part of the reason I got divorced was because I started to depend on my wife too much for emotional support when I should have continued taking anti-depressants and stayed in therapy .  So tell , expect some support , but understand that at some point you need profesional help.

2. I tell my close friends and I think it really helps them understand when I’m just not feeling up to going out or talking .  I had a reputation for being super flaky , but now they understand why and are more liable to forgive me and call to ask how ok doing.

3. There will be some people who will always see depression as a weakness , and that is fine .  They can still be friends and can still support you , but not in the same way as others.  It doesn’t mean they’re bad people.  My parents are like this , they don’t want to talk about the D word because they feel like they’ve failed as parents , but they have been there for me at my worst moments .

That’s my experience ... tell people you trust .  Even if they don’t react well you’ll know where you stand and how to ask for support . ",2019-12-22 15:01:20

585,e0655n,False,STORY,18,I lost my passion in music.,depression_help,"I’m 23, still didn’t finished my music degree and I feel like I don’t deserve to graduate from this course. I first studied AB English and told my dad that I can’t see my future with it. So, he allowed me to enroll a music degree. My major is Piano Concentration. I loved playing the piano since 7, though I wasn’t really good at it but I know how to play it. Since I got in a band in high school, that convinced my dad to take up Bachelor of Music. I started this course with [I think] 20% knowledge to Music Theory though I know how to read notes but not that fast. And I also started my First Proper Piano Lesson. I was doing great but my first piano teacher there keep on admiring advanced students instead of others like me and that made me miserable. I didn’t progress much.

By 3rd year, I had a new Piano Teacher and she was great. It made me go back to zero and that’s fine with me because I saw myself loving my passion again. I practice 6pm-9/10pm at school Mon-Sat. Until.... 1 night, a piano teacher came in my piano cubicle and told me that I am not allowed to practice there til 9/10pm because I AM NOT A ADVANCED STUDENT AND A RECITALIST. I told her that I need to practice in that kind of schedule because that’s the only time my body is productive to practice. So it’s like a body clock. On the other day, she reported me to the dean’s office and the dean told be that I shouldn’t be practicing on that schedule because it’s not in the rules. But I don’t remember that certain rule because I saw others practicing til 9pm so I thought it was okay. They still didn’t agree with me. After that discussion, I ran to the bathroom, cried so hard and called my dad about it. It was unfair. I was only doing it for myself because I want to be better. My dad bought me a 2nd hand electric piano so I can practice at my dorm. Everything went fine at first but I can’t get that incident out my head. It made me think that I’m a loser, talentless pianist there is in that school. That’s when I started to miss all my piano lessons and dropped my Piano Subject 3 times in a row.

It made me stayed in school since the 5th year. And I went to a psychiatrist to treat my traumas, my thoughts and insomnia. I was dianosed with depression with anxiety because of my thoughts of being afraid of what might happen next in the future. I’m terrified of tomorrows. That’s why I can’t sleep.

I moved to another piano teacher because I was so embarrassed to come back to my previous one. She already gave up on me because I wasn’t making any progress. And it’s a total humilliation to her reputation. I’m on my 7th year now and my current Piano Teacher is also great and he really wants me to graduate next year. He was patient of letting me going back to zero and gave me piano recital pieces that I can play. But my problem now is that, IT’S BACK. My demons are back and I haven’t returned to my psychiatrist since july. Because I’m afraid and my dad already used a lot of money for my mental health, sessions, medication and sleeping pills. I’m in a 3rd world country and we are not that rich.

I’m anxious that I might not graduate next year and it will make my parents misereble. I lost my passion in playing the piano that I can’t finish practicing 1 page in a day because of these thoughts and pain. 

I’m sorry for you to hear this. Because if I will not able to graduate next year. I will kill myself. I’m typing this 3 in the morning and crying. I haven’t told anyone that it’s back. Even my boyfriend. Everytime someone tries to cheer me up about my progress, I get depression. Imagine that. I getting depressed over positive things. I’m losing my mind, I feel so numb and I’m skipping piano classes again and I’m afraid of my piano teacher of seeing me not having any progress at all.

I’ve stopped having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now and I thought I would be able to recover without having any help or any therapy sessions at all. But just last night, I had trouble breathing again and this time no-one was around. I was all alone in my room with my aunt downstairs and my dog beside me trying her best to do what she can to calm me down (cause I think deep down my dog senses that something’s not right w/ me). I’ve had scenarios like these before. The first time, and I remember it so DISTINCTLY was when I sang up on stage alongside my choirmates and I was the soloist at the beginning of the piece and I forgot the first note, so I sang the whole piece a note lower so it affected my choirmates and they got confused and they couldn’t sing along and it was embarrassing. But the worst part was when a male teacher went to me, scolded me, and said “How could you be so selfish?” “You messed up big time” and he just made me feel like shit. He gave us this look that he would give to people who were worthless to him and I approached him and he gave me that look, but I disregarded it and said “I’m sorry for being selfish sir” and he didn’t answer me. At all. And later, I realized that he had talked with all of my choirmates and had asked them what they learned from this experience. And one of my closest friends went to me and that’s when I lost it. I couldn’t breathe for hours and I just kept on sobbing and screaming. He just walked away. The next occurance like this was when this time, my aunt called. I was at our school cafeteria at the time. Both she and I don’t have a great relationship because whenever she’s in a bad mood, she would mutter the words “Your siblings were never as bad as you” “It’s better if you just leave” “Leche ka. Buwiset ka.” - those are Filipino words that mean that I’m annoying and such. And I went inside a bathroom stall and I started crying. When I went out, one of my guy friends had asked me if I was okay and that’s when I snapped and he gave me a seat and he held my hand and I just started squeezing it because I wasn’t able to breathe for hours and our friends were there too trying to give me water and telling me to count until 10. I started telling them that I couldn’t feel anything. My legs, my hands, my guy friend’s hands, nothing. And I couldn’t speak properly. It had been 3 hours already and so I just told them that I was okay and I still couldn’t breathe but I’ll be fine. But when we got to the nurse’s office, I sat back down because I literally was feeling like I was on drugs or something bc I was getting so dizzy and lightheaded and I couldn’t get up anymore. They started bringing in an oxygen tank and gave me a pink pill and they said that it was supposed to knock me out, but it did nothing of the sort, so they admitted me to the ER and they rubbed something on me and I fell asleep. The 3rd occurance was last night. I’M SORRY for this long-ass thing, but if you’re still reading, bless you🙏 

Last night, my teacher had told me that I messed up my project and IT WAS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ONE, like literally, but I really flunked it. So I couldn’t breathe for hours and hours and hours and I started throwing the pillows at the wall because my chest hurt so bad and I was all alone and my friends weren’t here to calm me down or get me some help and stuff. What eventually calmed me down was when my dog jumped up my bed and just looked at me. Right now, I have a blade and it’s not cutting my skin like at all. I’m afraid to get some therapy because my parents believe that its only for crazy people. Do you guys think I need therapy? What are your thoughts after reading all of this? Thank you for taking the time and reaching this far. I’d appreciate it if y’all commented something down below because I really need summ help right now. Do y’all experience this stuff to? Because when my parents found out about me not being able to breathe and being admitted to the hospital, they said maybe I was having a stroke or might probably be getting the coronavirus symptoms. But I was tested and it wasn’t a stroke or the coronavirus. They said I hyperventilated. Do y’all experience that too? Or am I just over-analyzing my situations? Stay safe y’all🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g1pgm5/please_i_need_some_help/,61,"Jesus christ. I know fully well what youre talking about. The worst is not the bad words of the teacher, but its WHEN he said - at the WORST possible time, when youre so agitated and vulnerable. Im seriously thinking if that teacher is too detrimental to your mental health to continue. Your mental health is important, and you are in need of help, not scolding.

That teacher is bringing up your baseline anxiety A LOT, he will break you down, the increasing stress will bring you down. You NEED some fresh air from that teacher. When you rest and recover you will be not as sensitive and will be able to control yourself in front of that teacher.

People hold on pause their jobs or career when they breakdown mentally, like you. The same way when you injure yourself physically, you take time off, so when you are broken mentally, you take a rest too.

&#x200B;

Also I wonder if medication is not making it worse. Antidepressants generally work fine and have that  calming down effect on emotional sensitivity and irritability. Most ADs wiil help, however one was different ""venlafaxine"" which made me even more irritable and depressed. I started sleeping 16-18hours per day and felt extremely emotionally sensitivity to tiny bits of stress or negativity.

I have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. Every time I try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. Some force greater than gravity. I can’t move.

It’s a long story and I’m sure everyone reading this will think I’m weird.

So I think I’m probably gay but it’s been really weird and I’m not even sure. Years ago I started to feel that I don’t like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. I always tell myself that it’s not okay but that’s not how really how your inner self work. 
The thing is, the change that I (for some reason) want is to get fat. It’s weird because I wasn’t really that skinny anyway. I always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and I’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s definitely not the case.
I think about this more and more and it’s been bugging me for some time now. 
I have a friend who’s probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (I know it sounds creepy) I started to feel that I always wanted him to live better than me. 

**There is one thing to make clear: although I think I might be gay, I don’t necessarily “love” him, he’s just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**

He once broke his arm and, when I heard the news, I just snapped. I have broken my arm before and it wasn’t even that painful. But for some reason, that day when he broke his arm I feel so weird deeply that I don’t even know what that feeling is. I started to be very protective of him and it’s started to annoy him a bit. At first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.
I get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. It’s making anxious, and I can’t even tell him bc he will just think I’m weird and not believe in me. I know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, I think that too. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and it’s just making me confused and terrified to face the future. It sure doesn’t sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it’s a totally different story.
I just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day I finally decided to hang myself or whatever.

Right now it looks like she's not coming back but i am hoping she will.

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat. My previous cat went missing last year around the same time but at least back then I could look for her and hand out flyers. This cat was my baby and I raised her. She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. It's like there's a void in my house where she used to be (if that makes sense) 

I am so depressed I can't even get out of bed. Is there anything I can do that will help me cope with this? Because I am just so heartbroken and I can see its taking a toll on the people around me as well.

550,fncdcr,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,12,The current situation has caused a HUGE setback,depression_help,"Hey everyone. I hope you are doing better during this crazy time than I am. 

A bit of background: I'm a California girl in my 50's. And, I've struggled for 20 years to fight off very intense anxiety and depression. I have been unable to work since 2014. I've got a claim for SSDI, but apparently I'm not sick enough. SMH   I married my high school sweetheart May of 2018. He was the one that got away. I was never happier. After choosing the wrong guys all my life, I finally choose the right guy! Then in October he fell ill with an unknown lung disease. By the 21st of December I lost my love, my best friend he just couldn't breathe anymore. He put up a valiant fight.

I was immediately hospitalized in the psych unit. I was overwhelmed with grief. I wanted to die. I wanted to be with him. I even tried several times to make that happen. And to add fuel too the fire, my dad passed away three months after my husband. I'm not ashamed to say I was Daddy's Little Girl. And I miss him just as much as my husband.

So, for a whole year I struggled and fight my depression and anxiety. In that year, I was hospitalized 10 times, for psych and other ailments I have. But sometime after the 1 year mark when he died, I kinda just came out of the fog. I was feeling so much better, reaching out to his mom and other friends. I was so glad that I was gonna beat this. 

Fast forward to the present. I am an isolater by nature, so this covid-19 situation I know I can get through it. I have one good friend and my mother-in-law for support. I keep my appointments with my psychiatrist, and take my meds as prescribed.
I have no income, since I have to go through the entire process with Social Security before I can qualify to receive spousal benefits. Basically, what he was earning. Thank the good Lord for food stamps and Food Share, I'll never go hungry. So since I'm disabled, waiting for benefits, my rent is $50/month. I also had internet shut off because I couldn't pay them (just $50 too. My needs are small) I've had help from friends and family, and then eventually from several local church charities.

 And, well, I've run out of options and was scrolling through Reddit. I saw a couple of subs in which to ask for help. So I took a deep breath and posted how I need help paying my bills. The only reason I did this is that I have seen many messages of gratitude from individuals who received help. But that didn't happen for me. In fact there were some negative responses, and both posts where completely down voted. So, I guess either I don't know how to ask for help, or people just don't care. Let's add to my situation that my one good friend is going through some of their own challenges, and being a complete jerk. I've heard that the economic stimulus package won't pay anyone who is not working. Figures, the people who need it the most get nothing. And I pray it is only a rumour, because $1000 could set me up for many months while I work on my disability claim. The California Governor has issued a ""shelter in place"" order. I have asthma pretty badly, so I'm party of the group that SERIOUSLY shouldn't go out. Same with my mother-in-law.

My anxiety and depression had returned in full force. I have thought, again of giving up on my life. There is really NOTHING good about it. At all. My sister has shunned me because she knows nothing about mental health, and thinks I should just ""be happy."" I've never really had any meaningful relationship with my mom. She has been emotionally unavailable my entire life. 

So what am I left with? A complete shut down. No news, or Internet. (I'm typing on my government phone which has very limited data. But at least I can post) My friend is unavailable. Yesterday I went to my mother-in-law's place so I could download some movies. It's really exasperating to be so helpless, and so tired of my f**ked up life, and so sad, and no real prospects in paying my measly $100/month bills. And when I reach out, it either goes sideways or I am ignored. I can't eat or I get very nauseous (die to my anxiety and a medical issue with my stomach.

Played up until 5 am then put on an alarm at 7am so i can play all day long again. After a while of being inside i went to grocery store and had my first panic attack.  

Thats what pushed me to start therapy and we worked on it. Socializing was such a chore because the feeling that i was obviously awkward was extreme. To the point where i couldnt socialize. My head was completely empty which obviously made social anxiety worse and so it became a never ending positive feedback loop that made socializing literally impossible so i understand why people just give up. Its too intense and after “tries” of socializing i used to come home and cry because it felt so damn hopeless and intense.

I went far ahead and social anxiety doesn't bother me anymore. It indeed is possible to become “normal” and not awkward although some quirks of awkward self persist but they are compensated by the positive traits of your normal self. 
You also learn to turn the awkward parts to positive or just make them irrelevant and forgetable.

Its hard but the main thing to learn is that isolation most of the time make awkwardness worse. After a while you feel less awkward although its a slow gradual process over months.  You begin to learn social skills and turn awkwards traits to manageable.

I too prefered being alone although i often questioned how much of it is coping. Of course i would NOT prefer awkward socializing and being alone is not only a relief but the only option. When you become better at socializing and begin to even enjoy it because it felt good to finally become normal or good at something. Especially something like socializing that you never thought will become easy

Of course i would not want to go back and would prefer being alone and playing games that make me forget the intensiveness of awkward socializing.. But when it becomes enjoyable you realize why “normies” enjoy it and do it all the time. 

Its hard to explain all the little details that become easier but i literally dont see how isolation will make it better. Its hard to treat exactly because its a self feeding feedback loop that makes you STUCK. While avoidance might seem like a better or at least not worse option i would tell you “dont be so sure”. What you should fear more than anxiety or panic attacks is not getting better. Or even get worse. Spend 10 years in a rut of panic attacks and it will be so damn hard to treat you will regret not taking action sooner. I did. What pushed me to get help even though the thought of getting an appointment made me anxious af was the thought of how much worse it will get if i dont do anything. I thought fuck it. If i throw up in the room of my doc so be it. If thats what it takes. I had to suppress my paranoid self and go forward regardless if i vomit from the pure anxiety.

277,gqdzae,False,INSPIRATION,13,I can finally say that I’m a College Graduate,depression_help,"last year i posted a story of my dreadful life in studying music in a university. it was a tough year and i was really happy and most thankful that you guys were very supportive and helpful in the comments. i followed every advice on taking everything slowly. practicing piano 1-2 hours a day upto 4 hours a day. 

everything went great when 2020 came. passed my auditions and scheduled my recital last March 14, 2020. i was the last one to perform but everything went wrong because of the pandemic. my school closed down by March 13. i wasn’t given a chance to just perform by March 14. and our graduation supposed to be on last March 21. they didn’t allow me and my family were very disappointed. all our plans were wasted.

i came home to our hometown with a broken heart. i kept my chill so i can prevent severe episodes during the lockdown. i have small cries in the bathroom and anxiety attacks during late night hours. i did my best to breathe.

our college of music dean told me to have an alternative. i’ll send raw footage of me playing my piano pieces. once i send those videos, the dean will certify that i’m a graduate of the university. (because the recital is my final requirement for me to be able to graduate). of course, it took a while because i recorded a lot so i can send the best videos.

and just tonight i sent them all and felt very nervous because it’s already late.

it was checked and got critiqued. and then the dean said, “Congratulations”. and then, that was that. it’s done. and at last, after 7 years...i can finally say that i’m a College Graduate. i cried so hard my family laughed at me for my ugly tears of joy. they were very glad and made ‘em proud.

i would like to thank everyone in this sub. i may not know you, you may not know me and you may forgot that story i posted but this reddit sub helped me cope up. i helped people here too even though i myself was feeling miserable. i read some comments to some posts and learned a lot.

664,ahdc6o,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,30,Being the boyfriend.,depression_help,"My Girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 years. She has suicidal thoughts occasionally. She tells me I am very supportive and a great bf but sometimes I don’t think I’m giving the best support. 

(Sorry for the long post. I don’t know if there’s any other SOs in this thread or if there is another sub I should be posting in) 

I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this. After about a year into dating, while we were cleaning dishes in her apartment, she let on how serious her depression was when she told me that she had once held a gun to her head. After a long silence we both cried and I told her how much I loved her. She told me that she had only ever told her best friend and didn’t want anyone to know, so I’ve never told anyone, not even my closest friend of 15+ years whom I share anything and everything with. So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. 

Over the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. 

I feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. 

I don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: “Well what about me?”- “Fuck about you! What about her!?” And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.

Headspace A: 
“That being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”

Headspace B:
“A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die” I love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.”

Am I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. 

I want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? 

Thanks so much for any help.

Full disclosure I’m a little drunk writing this so it may not be totally coherent. Anyways. So this morning I talked to that therapist and honestly it was so helpful for me. I’m trying not to get too excited because maybe things won’t pan out as we’ve discussed...but basically I think I channeled my inner therapist and talked so calmly and caringly to my fiancé that he has agreed to try medication and Therapy!! This is 5 years in the making and I’m seriously so excited. I mean he had a horrible day so it’s not like that’s worth celebrating but the fact that he wants to seek professional help is so awesome because I’ve been so struggling. Not that this is about me but you get it. I am feeling hopeful :) basically if I can share some things from my session: 1. You cannot fix things for them so you need to set some boundaries (hard but that’s what she said), 2. Lead by example and he may follow (if exercise helps make him feel better then I should say I want to go for a walk and maybe he will join me ), 3. If he is panicking, you need to de escalate and not have serious conversations in that moment. Talk about them when he can think rationally. ... that’s all I can remember off hand but I wrote it all on my computer and I’ll message you again because I do want to share what helped.

447,g8x0om,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,36,How do I get to the point of WANTING to get better?,depression_help,"TL;DR - Depressed for probably 10+ years. Heavy sucidal thoughts for about 5. Is there any chance of getting better if I don't even want to, or seeing the point of it?

Alright, gonna keep this as short as possible, since I'm tired of giving my life story and also I hate myself for whining about this and not pulling myself up. I'm a 32M from Sweden.

On the surface and in reality, my life is great. I got a job, I got a girl, I got an apartment. I got a dog. I'm healthy. I believe I'm quite intelligent (although it feels like depression has made me very much more stupider and I forget things all the time). I got it all. I can act all extroverted and social if the situation demands it. I have friends (although I barely keep in touch).

I just don't want to live. I see no point in me continuing doing so other than to not mess up the lives of my friends and family (or mostly my gf and my grandma, don't care too much about the others). I have a very detailed and thought out plan of how I would end my life, with small chances of failure. I know it's not the right thing to do, but it would just feel sooo good not to feel like a useless piece of shit who cares about no one. Who sees no future or no reason in moving on. Who gets hung up on all his failures and shortcomings. I come from a broken home with divorces, drug/alcohol/verbal and physical abuse. But I still consider my childhood to have been good. I had friends, I had fun.

Tried several different antidepressants in increasing doses over the course of 3 years. Only gave me side effects so I quit out of spite. Seen numerous doctors, psychiatrists and therapists. Only felt mocked and not taken seriously so I quit out of spite. Been admitted to the psychiatric ward (sry, google translate), a good place to get depressed by the way, but I talked my way out of there after a week.

I've tried quitting my job. Quitting my band. Quitting my girlfriend. Exercising. Eating healthier. But deep down I always knew I only made all these changes and sought help just so I could tick them off and in my suicide letter write ""look, I tried all these things and they didn't work so I killed myself instead"". Oh, and did I mention that I've only told my gf and my older sister about any of this, and getting to that took YEARS since I feel so embarrased and don't want people to get involved. They have both been supportive by the way, but I won't let them help me.

I read about people all the time saying ""just muster through, it's worth it in the end"", or ""therapy saved my life"", or ""I know it feels dark right now...It'll get better"", or ""antidepressant X changed my mindset completely"", or ""these inspirational quotes and pictures of kittens made me rethink my life choices"".But I just can't connect with or believe in that. And I know I sound like an immature spoiled brat in saying so. How does one find the motivation or the will to conquer this? I feel like giving up before actually starting the fight. It won't be worth it. I really can't see myself feeling proud, happy or satisfied about myself, or being the person I want to be. I really can't put words to my thoughts and feelings, it all sounds so banal.

I know a lot of people feel like this, like ""no one understands me, it will not work for me, there is no help I can get"" . I KNOW there is help I can get, although it hasn't for me yet. I KNOW it might get better if I put the time and effort into it. I just don't want to. I want to die. But I'm not allowed to and it pisses me off.

While I am proud of myself, I don't feel as good as I thought I would. I didn't expect my depression/anxiety to be magically lifted, but I did expect it to get slighter better. Honestly, it's gotten much worse. After graduating with a degree I wasn't 100% sure of and an unfavorable internship in my area of study I feel hopeless (I have a part-time job, but it's certainly not my career path and is unreliable due to the pandemic). I feel I have no career path and that I'll be stuck in this cycle forever.

I don't know my direction in life and I don't even know how to find one. I can't picture myself happily in any career path. Even job searching online causes immense panic attacks. The thought of interviewing for a job makes me physically ill. 

My friends (most of whom graduated on time years before me) have already started their careers and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud...unable to lift my feet off the ground. It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think I'm lazy and unmotivated but I'd feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. It's gotten to the point where I avoid dating (pre-pandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines) because I feel like a failure when I tell people I don't know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel it's strained some of my relationships.

My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently it's been fluctuating again (I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate) this has made things very difficult and I've had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done.

I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. 

I'm having trouble thinking, I've stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day (my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly) and I'm just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done.

Sometimes I have a meltdown because I feel so much pressure and stress, i don’t know how to reply to her, I don’t know how to handle it. 
Feels like we don’t talk about anything else other than her problems, and I really want to help but it’s so hard.

I know she relies on me for support a lot.

It’s been a few years since this has been happening. She’s always coming to me, and I’m pretty sure only me and I feel like a sponge just absorbing all her sadness. 

I don’t want her to feel like she’s a burden to me, though I can’t help feeling this way.

Has anyone been in this sort of situation ? What can I do? 

Thanks for reading.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dlg2yg/i_feel_like_my_mental_health_is_deteriorating/,37,"I had to learn this the hard way when I lost a number of friends (from being in the position of your friend).  After losing some good friends because I was just too overwhelming, I've learned to be very clear with all my friends: I want them to take care of their mental health first.  If I'm looking to them for support, but they're not in a good place themselves, I want them to be honest so that I try to do something for them (if possible), or at the very least, not solely rely on them.  

However, I didn't get to this point, and never truly realized the impact my relying on them had until a very close friend finally said to me one day, after losing many friends over the years, (something along these lines) - ""You're my friend and I really care about you.  I want to be there for you when I can be and I want you to be able to trust me, but I'm also not a professional and it's not fair to you or me to only rely on me for help and support.  I think it would be wise to look into going therapy again.  I'd be happy to help you find one, and would even come with you the first time or two for emotional support"".

Once he said that, everything sort of clicked.  Your friend may not realize what impact she's having.  I recommend trying to say something like the above that works for your situation.  Be honest about where you're at, because she may not realize.  Once I realized in my own situation, I was able to be a little more self-aware, and my friend helped me expand my network of help and support, which helped both of us AND strengthened our friendship more.

It doesn't matter how many times you fail, what matters is if you give up on yourself. Please, you do, in fact, matter. You are, in fact, worth something. Hold onto whatever makes you wanna live, no matter how small or insignificant that thing might be, its still worth living for. If your family wouldn't care, if you don't have friends, if you feel as if not a single soul cares about what happens to you, at least know that I'd care. Alot of people I knew were depressed or suicidal, and things got better for them.

Please. Do SOMETHING. Go on a walk, for example. It doesn't have to be a big one, it could be just around the block or up and down your sidewalk. Or you could read a book, or do a small workout, etc. I know it seems pointless, but these things help improve your mood. I'm speaking from experience.

Eat something.  Don't starve yourself. It only worsens the pain.

Kids at his school bullied him almost daily because of it, often going as far as assaulting him and yelling racial slurs at him. 

His family said he often prayed for his bullies and never fought back when they attacked him.  

Well, he hung himself, a 10 year old boy knew how to hang himself. This poor little innocent child will never see what a beautiful life he had ahead of him because his bullies thought it was so hilarious to attack something he could not control.

We are all in this sub reddit because we have faced, are facing depression, pain, mental disorders. Some of us may have faced bullies in our lives. And those “bullies” are all facing problems of their own causing them to lash out at others. And unfortunately, they are causing so much pain for those who do not deserve it.

So today, I am asking all of you to please keep this little boy in your thoughts because he was one of us, and unfortunately the pain was too much for his innocent soul. If any of you are facing problems that you feel are too big for you to handle. Please seek help. Reach out to those around you because I would not be here today if I didn’t make the decision to seek help.

I really didn't want to but I made myself get up and plant those little feckers. I knew that leaving them in a box in my kitchen would have justified my usual brain set - look, they've died, what a stupid idea to get them in the first place, throw them away, everything is spoiled, metaphor for my life.... 

I spent two hours planting them in tubs and pots. Who knows if all of them will survive? Who knows what they will look like if they do?

178,dogpcs,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,17,A short(ish) guide on showering,depression_help,"  A short(ish) guide on showering. I have marked this post as not safe for work because I talk about my ass a lot. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to read.

Ah yes, personal hygiene, the bane and all consuming nightmare for anyone who cannot bring themselves out of bed. We as people try to bribe ourselves, if you get up and have a shower then you will feel better, but that bed is so comfortable, and its not like you’re going anywhere, why should you have to shower? The biggest reason I can think of is because its very very very simple. 

Because it makes YOU feel better.

We still get up to pee, what’s so hard about having a shower? Well when I say ""everything"" people usually laugh. The idea of taking off the pyjamas you haven’t washed or changed in give or take a week is like peeling back the layers of your failure onion, looking at your matted crusty greasy hair is like looking straight into your birdnest of shame. Trying to even attempt to trim the hair on your face, or armpits, or where have you feels like you’re battling a particularly stinky yeti that tells you that you suck. Noticing you still have mascara goop in your eye from that one day you put in effort is like a glaring unhygienic reminder of how completely worthless you feel. You feel vulnerable, naked, figuratively and literally. 

And then there’s the smell, as someone who has gone for weeks without showering I can tell you that the human body is not a garden, it’s a waste disposal centre of epic proportions. You smell from everywhere, and your butt cheeks feel like they’re kind of glued to each other. And when you finally get to that point where you are ready to turn on the shower and you step under, it’s like you’re a snake, shedding your own skin. And the water washing off you is definitely not the right colour. So why the gruesome picture you may ask? Because it’s a reality for so many people, and it perfectly illustrates why depression isn’t a simple quick fix, it’s a years long battle. The idea of your ass smelling and your sheets having a skin imprint on them is so completely unpleasant, even to me as someone who has been there. it perfectly illustrates just how strong the hold is on people who are fundamentally good people. How strong the shackles on our minds can be. 

So what about this guide, you’ve personally illustrated very well what its like to not shower, how can I get to showering? The answer is hard to do in the real world but its so simple to write down: do the minimal effort and get the maximal pay off. You start small, ridiculously small. Pick a body part, even if its washing your hands after you pee instead of walking to your fridge and then crashing back into bed. If that’s too much then trim your finger nails, hell, trim one finger nail,. Every single goddamn day. When that doesn’t feel like a gargantuan task of epic proportions that makes you want to cry at the thought of it, then add a finger nail, or fuck, do one and a half if two feels too much. I started, by washing my genitals. For smell related reasons, obviously. I didn’t shave, I didn’t do anything fancy, just some ph neutral soap and a bidet, that’s all, the main reason I did this was because I went to the bathroom every day and that involved putting my pants down, it seemed like an easy place to start. And I did it, for about a week, and then I stopped doing it for a day and it made me cry because look at you, you layered dirty onion of shame and disgust why cant you even wash your own ass, what are you? A fucking baby, cant even do that one fucking thing, you piece of shit. 

That’s what happens, and I’m sure it might happen to you, and you’ll crash into bed and resume whatever you were mindlessly watching as you hope your over rested, creaky, aching body will just fall asleep again even though you slept for 16 hours. It will happen, and my advice is:

Tell yourself to that what you didnt do is okay. Dont excuse yourself, but realise that failure is not a curse word, its a reality of life. That’s how depression is combatted and it is a fight, but instead of you murdering the crazy 88s like the badass you are, you’re in a room with yourself, no lucy liu, no gogo. Just you and your head. And instead of a hanzo sword you have to fight your own brain that is biologically programmed to tell you you’re a piece of shit. And its hard, its hard to fight that voice in your head. But you know what wasnt hard for me? washing my ass, I made it as easy as i could for myself, and after that one time i kept doing it, because i told myself that it was okay to fail, to strive to be better.

I know the follow up is “I’m so depressed I don’t even care if I smell, I don’t care if people see me like this, I don’t care if I die from ass stank induced shock”. I’ve been there myself. And these depression guides seem to gloss over the fact that even the simple act of caring can seem like an impossibility. Here’s what I found out: caring as a depressed person isn’t there, it has to be created. A lot of the times people will ask a depressed individual to choose something they care about and then “do it for them” comes out. But it doesn’t work like that. You have to do it, and the caring will come later. You have to in a sense rewire your brain. I don’t wash my ass because I love my parents and don’t want them to be disappointed. I wash my ass because I like my ass to be clean, and smell decent, I didn’t care what it smelled like when I started, but I started caring because when I went to pee, I wasn’t greeted by a horrible smell and a constant reminder of my failure as a human being, because hey you know what brain, its okay, I cleaned my ass, and even though I did nothing else, I still cleaned my ass and that’s more than I did before. And I can say I am proud of it.

Consider for a moment that your brain, or rather the imbalance within them are trying to make you do all these things you don’t really like, and on top of that this imbalance is also making you not care about the inability of doing these things. That’s the part you have to say fuck you to.

Wash your ass, start with something small (or in my case big, get it, I’m saying my ass is big haha, I’m so funny). And the caring will come, and after the ass, you can move on to washing your hair, or brushing your teeth, or even just trimming a fingernail, or drinking one single cup of water, the caring will come later. And when you do wash your ass, be nice to yourself. 

Here I will help you, for when you have done the one hygienic thing:

An achievement to ….:

Hereby I wish to say that …………………………. Partook in an act of personal hygiene, an achievement that should not be overlooked, a wondrous day for mankind. She or he took the time to perform this task, even though it probably sucked and no one is more proud of her or him than I. It is with great pride and pleasure that I say that this act of personal hygiene is something we collectively, as a society should be proud of and no one should be more proud than the person reading this, who took the time to perform this task.

That probably came off as sarcastic and petulant, but the message is there, Don’t punish yourself for doing something, that in my experience is the best way to break your cycle. Because its so easy to go “yeah you did one thing, but look at all these other things you suck at, look at this bed, look at this house, why is the pizza box moving, because of you, asshole”. You have to stop it. I’m not saying you need to build a parade every time you wash your hair, but you also shouldn’t be tearing yourself down for it, you did something that feels so big and so difficult that you cant do it every day, and that is an achievement.

Take the time to feel pride for your smallest accomplishments, allow yourself to feel okay about something. And even if you cant bring yourself to say good job to you, be neutral. Its okay to just say okay and try again.

98,gguht8,False,RANT,20,I’m kind of embarrassed by how much taking care of a cat has improved my mental health.,depression_help,"So I’ve dealt with chronic depression my whole life, I have a lot of strategies to help and I’m almost in my thirties, I’m proud that I’ve become pretty functional. But I still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and I know I will again in my life. But I can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and don’t let things spiral until my life implodes like I used to. Always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:

“There are certain things
That I have to do.
Day to day just to keep it at bay,
You wouldn’t believe if you knew”

And I’ve been doing okay with that. But I let things in my personal life, the parts I can keep private or aren’t a “big deal” slip consistently. My room is always a mess, I let my beard get big and bushy even though I (and everyone I know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what I could do today sort of stuff. And not even to do fun stuff, I just kind of dither and worry about the things I’m not doing. 

A few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. One of my roommates left the place and didn’t take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. The cat decided I was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if I didn’t let him hang out in my room. I was reluctant to adopt him because I was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement, and I wasn’t sure I was ready for the commitment. Finally the lease holder said he was going to take him to the humane society that afternoon, I said bye to him with some sadness, and went to work. but he had only been “my cat” for a week so I figure better he go sooner before he got too attached. He’s an adorable sweet boy and only a year old so I didn’t think he would languish too long and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.

While I was at work it really stuck in my craw. I just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. But when I got home he was still there! I decided screw it, he’s my cat now. Told my roommates I’d take responsibility for him and dubbed him Jonesy, cause he looks like the cat from alien.

I’ve been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved In pretty much every way. There is the mental health improvement from having an animal around, he’s a very affectionate cat. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. But there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. I’ve been keeping my room clean because he will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks, so empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go. I always actively
play with him when I get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (I don’t answer text, listen to music, watch TV, I just play with Jonesy) is very calming and centering. Cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. I’m drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. I usually feel like all the little things I don’t do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life I feel like I’m catching up.

I’m straight up embarrassed by how much I love this animal. He’s my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. I can’t control much in the world but I can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. I know there will still be some dark times ahead but I feel like I have a new ally in the daily struggle. Just wanted to rant about my cat and feeling good for the first time in awhile, thanks for reading!

I've had issues (depression, eating disorders) since I was a kid but I was always able to ""handle"" it and stay high functioning.  Then, over 6 months, I lost my job after 25 years and with the end of my paycheque, so ended my marriage.  That was it, I had no strength left to put up my front and I dropped quickly into a deep depression.

&#x200B;

Well 5 years later I'm divorced, still unemployed, completely broke and barely surviving financially, have panic attacks when I try to job search, and have zero confidence left in myself.  I feel like a total and complete failure in every aspect of my life.  I even feel like a horrible father because some days I can barely handle the normal stresses of dealing with a young kid and I give into her too often which is leading her down some bad paths health and habit wise.  Almost all my friends are gone.  My supposed best friend left me not long after she saw me at my absolute worst when I was in the hospital after an aborted suicide attempt.   She decided our 20 year friendship meant nothing because I ""must always have been a secret narcissist"".  When she left, two of my other very close friends went with her since they were closer to her and felt uncomfortable staying my friend given her feelings.  Other friends I wasn't as close with disappeared when I was slow to reply to them during bouts of depression.  They decided I didn't care or wasn't worth it.  Some just didn't know how to deal with me when I was always down and they had known me as the up guy who was always there to support others.  

&#x200B;

I have nothing left.  There is nothing inside of me.  I want to die all the time. I've been though treatment.  3 doctors, 2 hospital visits, multiple drugs, TMS treatments, ECT treatments, day therapy programs, DBT/CBT training, anything they wanted me to try I did.  Nothing.  I move between moderately depressed on the best day to severely depressed on an average day.  What joys I get last only for a few minutes before I go dead inside again.  My latest doctor when I showed some optimism about trying to change said ""its not realistic to expect you will ever be back to near where you once were again"" and that he discouraged me from even trying to find work.  I can't live feeling like I have no purpose but leaching off of society and not even having enough to do the things that are important to me.  No money, no job, no friends, what's left?

&#x200B;

The only thing that's held me back for the past year is my daughter.  She's 10.  She is all that matters to me.  I don't want to desert her, but I often question if I add anything to her life anyway.  And its hard to live for ""every other week"" with someone especially when those weeks can be so hard mentally.

I dont know if you have tried to reach out for therapy. Or medical help in the form of drugs to help. I wanne share with you abit of my story.

 I have been depressed for aslong as I can remember. During 2015 I had enough and tried to end it. It failed but left me with a shattered memory, which I tbh dont care that much about. However what changed was that I was forced to make a hard choice and tell someone about how I didn't feel anything. And it took abit of time to find the right people and it is hard or might seem embarrassing or just impossible. It's none of those really. Even if you think soo. But your mind. And this you are maybe aware of Is a huge dick. And a liar. But when I found the right help. Which for me are drugs (Prescription) and guidance from a professional. It changed my life. 

Im not saying it fixed me. Or in one day gave me the happiness or blew my mind. But I'm definitely in a better state of mind. And I'm hopeful that I will keep going that way. And that is what I wish for you. Try and reach out. Find the right people even if it seems impossible and fin what helps you function enough to be able to do abit of what you want too. Its gonne be hard, frustrating annoying and probably more things. But it's also gonne be something to look back at and go. It was worth it.

Disclaimer I'm not the most coherent person and I tend to ramble. Not sure if this fits in this sub I also posted to r/AnxietyDepression) 
 
So I've suffered with crippling anxiety since the age of 12 when my dad passed in quite a traumatic way for me. I've been through therapy/on meds for years and about a year ago I was feeling much less depressed and anxious and came off my meds yay!! 

A few months ago, I lost my job and it was a massive blow to my confidence. Ive slipped back into a depression and never want to leave the house and am constantly arguing with my boyfriend (massive social butterfly) because I don't want anyone at the house and I just lock myself in the bathroom and cry all the time. Obviously arguing has been making it worse as I feel like I'm losing him aswell as my mind.
Hes very kind but generally not the most sympathetic as he leads a very fast paced life and has been through a hell of a lot and his way to deal with his issues is the opposite to me lol.

The past month my heads been full of suicidal thoughts, I think about killing myself most of the day, every day. Like even if we are sitting watching TV I'll be looking round the room planning ways I could do it (even though I probably wouldn't). Last night my boyfriend got really frustrated with me because he noticed I'd been self harming (when I do this I don't usually even remember It really and am always so embarrassed by it as soon as I realise-do other people get this??) and I shouted something about how I just wanted to die but I just couldn't leave him on his own and he looked absolutely heartbroken just cuddled me for ages. We had an amazing talk and he was the first person I've EVER told about being suicidal (not even my therapist). I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can't stop crying, even now (in a good way) and I wish I had said something so much sooner. I also not believe that someone can love me unconditionally for who I am and that's really special. 

Our relationship already feels so much more back on track and even though I'm still sad, I really feel like I've accomplished something and feel very blessed to have such an amazing man in my life.

I guess I don't have too much of a point here. I just feel like I've really accomplished something and made a massive step in both my mental health and my relationship and wanted to share with someone. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dwvffo/massive_weight_off_my_shoulders_opening_up_about/,92,"You may be suffering from PTSD trauma manifests itself in extremely complicated ways that are unexplainable logically, I've created a subreddit to help with alleviating this stress i hope it can help you [https://www.reddit.com/r/Emotional\_Regulation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Emotional_Regulation/) ",2019-11-15 19:16:05

Plush, its easy. You can do as much or as little as you want. For something small, wipe down all the door handles. Finding a better job will help but I know that's super hard. If you like writing, keeping a diary or journal can help. And the only other thing I cant think of right now is exercise. I struggle with that too, but it really does help once you can start. You don't have to make it a lifestyle change but even once or twice a week. Even just stretches, will help you a little bit. If you want faster results, try planking.

- Go and get a glass of water, hydration does wonders

- Clean up your room a bit, it doesn’t have to be fast, do it at your own pace. A clean room eases your mind, and you did something productive

- Put on some calming, soothing music that you like

- Shower if you haven’t showered today, give yourself the whole spa treatment while you’re at it, hot showers are so relaxing for your body

- Spend some time on something you love to do, but haven’t done in a while

- Eat something healthy if it’s been a while that you ate something

- If you’re still studying, catch up on the things you’ve seen in class, work on the assignments

- Try to avoid staring at screens right before going to bed

These are small actions that’ll get you in a more positive mindset and which will help you sleep better that night. This way you can wake up the following morning with a fresh start.

That’s not very much imo. I remember starting college, it seems overwhelming for a week or two, but then you get used to it - it’s not nearly as much as it sounds. For some reason when you start, it’s kind of a time warp. When you go from studying 2 hours a week in high school to 20-30 hours a week in college, it seems like a lot, but it really isn’t. 

Try going to the library rather than studying at home. This helps a LOT. Everyone else in the building is working and time flies by, it will help you concentrate and not worry about other things you want to do. Eventually you will actually like studying. 

But yeah, not a huge deal if you drop it either way. Just talk to a counselor first to make sure there’s no big consequences to doing so. ",2019-01-26 01:48:35
784,bz8ih4,False,RANT,17,My mom makes me feel worse and I hate how shitty of a person she is,depression_help,"It took me years of being severely depressed until she finally acknowledged it. Her initial reactions were ""you have no reason to be depressed"" and started making it about herself. Of course she immediately defends herself and says she has nothing to do with the way I'm feeling and how great of a mother she has always been and how she doesn't understand why I'd say I'm depressed.

Meanwhile my home life here with her is 80% of the cause of my depression. She used to be an awful alcoholic and smoker. She would get drunk every other night and sometimes I'd find her on the floor mumbling to herself completely out of her mind. You shouldn't have to go through that shit as a child. She threw me across the room one night just because I stepped in her way. 

She was never there for me, never understood the shit I was going through at home and at school, always made my issues about herself. Only just recently has she been paying the copay for my therapy as I can't afford it right now as freshman in college. 

It initially helped me cope with my shit, as I used to go once a week but I've been forced to go once every three weeks. Now I can't go at all because she's cancelling the card linked to the therapy because she doesn't feel like helping me anymore. I'm on the wrong medication for my depression and I need a psychiatrist, as my depression has only gotten worse in the past month or two of being on it and now I don't know what to do.

If I can't afford to go to therapy anymore and never be able to get that psychiatrist, my mental health will only severely decline from here and there's no telling what I might do to alleviate this pain. NONE of my family members are supportive. My dad doesn't give a shit, and neither does my sister. No one has any idea how serious this shit is except for my boyfriend, who is the only supportive and understanding person in my life.

You can set a really low bar for things to be grateful for, like the fact that soap exists and we don't have to stink all the time, or the fact that toilets exist and we don't have to just shit on the floor or whatever. If you get in the habit of thinking about things your grateful for, even for just one part of your day, it'll start affecting your overall way of thinking.

850,bh8ii4,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,24,Complete recovery after depression is a realistic expectation?,depression_help," Hey, before depression took over my life I\[23F\] used to be such a happy person - joyful, positive, hyped about all kinds of activities, passionate about life. Before finishing college I used to think that lack of time is my only problem, I had so many plans and wishes and I used to think that depression isn't a real thing, that some people just choose to be unhappy. And then it hit me - repressed childhood trauma, unhealthy relationships with my family members and too many disappointments in my love life gave me depression.

At first I thought it's only a bad phase and I was expecting it to end soon since I was about to start my summer vacations. I had planned a 2 weeks trip to Scotland and I was really hyped about it for like 6 months before leaving, but somehow I couldn't enjoy it, I only wanted to sleep and be alone and I was struggling to get through each day without being rude or visibly irritated by everything was going on around me. That's when I realized that ""bad phase"" was a special one, but I only decided to get specialized help when I was already 4 months deep into it. At that point I was a mess, crying several times every day, spending all my free time sleeping, being terrified of my own thoughts, started thinking about suicide, pursuing a toxic online relationship, being unable to watch movies or reading books due to losing my ability to concentrate. At that moment, one of my best friends told me I was only a shadow of the person I used to be. The best feeling I was able to get about anything was ""this is almost acceptable"".

After my first visit to the psychiatrist I was put on medication and after only one month things became a little bit brighter for me - Christmas was coming and I started WANTING TO DO STUFF AWAKE!! I started watching netflix again, playing video games, hanging out with friends. I was still sad mostly, but I was able to enjoy these things from time to time which was nice. I also got fired right before Christmas for sleeping too much at work and doing almost nothing because of my depression, but I wasn't even mad about it. I mean, I cried because crying was like my main occupation (along with sleeping) and because I knew that's what I'm supposed to do when I get fired but I didn't really feel much about that event. In January I went in a trip to New York with one of my best friends and I enjoyed every moment of it! Then I came home and started looking for a new job. I was so relaxed and carefree and I was becoming my old self again. In February I started a new job and shortly after that I stopped my antidepressants treatment.

But I feel like **this journey of becoming my old self again is never going to be complete**. Sometimes I get close to what I used to be before this whole thing but I can't sustain that, like the old-happy-me is visiting sometimes but she doesn't wanna stay. Even though things go great for me now (great new job, great old friends, new healthy romantic relationship) I am mostly anxious and scared. I can't be genuinely happy with the good things I have in my life, because the fear of losing them and going straight back into depression is overwhelming. I heard things like ""you'll never go back to what you used to be before depression"", ""depression leaves a scar you'll have to live with your entire life"", ""depression is a part of growing up, you just can't go back"". I am starting to believe these things and it's sad. Are they true?

Its hard only living in the past and hoping for a better future, you are never able to enjoy the present moment. But there is light. I have questions though. You said you had a psychiatrist did they tell you that it was safe to get off the meds? Or did you get off them on your own? Sometimes when we start to feel better we  stop taking our meds and it may seem like the right thing to do , but a lot of the times we feel better because the meds are starting to work and it may be a good idea to stay on them.

See, everyone else always told me it was just treatment resistant depression and that was that. My new doctor took a look at my history (and played some pretty weird mind games with me) and came to a startling conclusion. I'm not depressed at all. Well, at least not only depressed. I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: ""What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?"" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more.

Some tips from my psychologist that helped me to stop: 

1) Distraction techniques: when she starts thinking about it, she has to either speak with a designated support person, almost like a sponsor with AA/NA. Then she has to find good distractions to keep her mind off of it for minimum 15 minutes. Take a walk, play a video game, read, exercise. Anything that can absorb her attention.

2) Mimicking tactics: these will give a similar release without permanently harming her: snapping a rubber band on her wrist, holding an ice cube in her hand until it melts, and if the blood is what she needs to see then get some fake blood tabs and heat them a little in the microwave so they feel like blood. 

3) Find a way for her to get it out: cutting is a form of release so have her get it out, let her scream until she cries, write about her feelings, have her paint a picture, or try to find music that she feels she relates to (I chose screamo/metal)

Cutting is as addictive as cocaine, and releases large amounts of dopamine and other feel good chemicals into our brain due to the adrenaline rush it comes with. As with every addiction the person struggling has to want to stop and they need a very strong support system. These coping techniques are mostly temporary but they help set up a foundation for when you’re ready to quit. Relapses are going to happen, and when they do just be ready for them. A lot of cutters/self harm users even after stopping self harm will hide the objects used to self harm because it helps them feel safe/comfortable knowing it’s there if they need it. 

My Psychologist always said, “If at the end of all these coping techniques you still need to cut, do it as safely as possible by using sterile tools and first aid.” There’s also a book that helped me that directly deals with the topic and it’s meant for teens/young adults called “Cut” by Patricia Mcormick.

I'm depressed (have been managing it with increasing success over the last 10 years) and this post was inspired by this recent post in the sub: [https://old.reddit.com/r/depression\_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody\_likes\_you\_when\_youre\_depressed/](https://old.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeu8d4/nobody_likes_you_when_youre_depressed/). Please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 

1. Don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. We're already doing our best. 
2. Providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. Be okay with this. 
3. Stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. See #2. 
4. Before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 
5. If you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to ""go outside"". But you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 
6. People who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. Concerns about SSRIs are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 
7. We're not always sad. Sometimes we're angry. Sometimes we're numb. Sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 
8. Sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. Telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. Refer to #2. 
9. Therapists - get extra rest. Take care of yourself. Do not take on too many patients. Be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. Be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 
10. If you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. Take a vacation. Go on a date. Focus on yourself. 
11. If you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). Offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. Maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. Maybe we need some time alone. Maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. Ask. 
12. Don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will ""fix"" our depression. It's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. We may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/eeyh7o/how_to_coexist_with_depressed_people_by_someone/,51,How do people beat depression? ,2019-12-24 08:11:43

I was crying in front of my father yelling at him ""I just want to be happy"" and he told me to suck it up and stop whining. I felt so pointless and hopeless. So unimportant to my dad.

All of this piled and piled on me and I would never show my feelings because again, it wasn't ""manly"" to show your feelings. I feel so trapped and crushed under these things. It would get to the point that I would cut myself just to feel something. I felt so numb and dead both inside and outside. I've made dates to kill myself but never followed through. I tried reaching out for help before but no one listened. My parents don't understand that someone could hate themselves or be this depressed. Whenever someone asks me if I'm okay or how I'm doing I always respond with I'm fine. I'm really not. At this point, I just want to be happy. nothing interests me anymore and nothing seems interesting. I can't do anything without thinking ""what's the point, why am I doing this. there's nothing that will pay off from doing this"". I feel so empty and alone. I push away friends and people I care about because I don't want them to see me and judge me for who I am. I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm drowning in this horror. I need to get help but I'm too scared...

I just wanted to share this because I needed to get it off my chest. This was the first place I thought of because I feel like I won't be judged here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/gcmoxw/how_should_i_deal_with_this/,44,"

694,em3ykb,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,19,Is it worth trying more anti-depressants?,depression_help,"Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/em3ykb/is_it_worth_trying_more_antidepressants/,52,"Are you working with a psychiatrist who knows your medication history? 

Also what is the source of depression. Are you able to sit down and think about what is causing you to be depressed. For example for years I was depressed and I just didn’t know why and life seemed pointless. Than I realized I was having existential questions and spirituality questions like what the purpose of life is type stuff. I was making little to no progress in therapy until I started exploring the existential questions that made me uncomfortable. Reading and researching about religions and spirituality and atheism made me feel SO much better than any medication or therapy. 


I also at one point had become depressed because  of my traumatic childhood. My father commit suicide and burned down our house leaving me and my siblings to grow up single parent and extremely poor. This never affected me till I became an adult. I would think about it every day for hours and hours and hours convincing myself that I was going to end up like him. This was extremely depressing as you can imagine. So I tried EMDR to address the source of this trauma and it really helped me a good bit! Again more than the medications. 


So I’m not saying to get off meds, in fact the meds can help you utilize the tools you learn in therapy with a more clear mind. I tried them a few times and they did help when I needed them. But, if there is something deeply rooted in you that you haven’t explored or questioned, the meds are not an end all be all solution. I wish you luck OP! My DMs are open :)

Oh edit also:

Make sure you are getting your human basic needs. Sunlight every day, exercise(do it outside if possible)  good sleep(i require 8-9 hours or I have terrible anxiety), socialization with other people, hobbies, some type of purpose or spirituality or a group of people that you meet up with, some type of sense of belonging. These things make a HUGE difference. For me once I started a weekly hobby that made me a group of friends and taking daily walks in the sun, it helped so much. ",2020-01-09 03:33:11

108,brpt7q,False,PROVIDING ADVICE,34,My friend killed himself after 8 failed attempts over many years. Don't always trust their parents alone to do the right thing cause sometimes they just don't; they make it worse.,depression_help,"I'm 23 now, it's been a couple years since he died and I can't help but remember him on occasion whenever I experience something new or good in life. I just think ""if he didn't end it all he'd have seen the bigger picture eventually"". It's never as simple as that but at the same time, it is; it's all about the timing.

  He had it all. He was popular, had that ripped body everyone envied him for, had the attention of the ladies and had a wealthy family. None of that seems to matter one bit when it concerns clinical depression. It only got worse with whatever his dad thought was the best response which was to initially send him to live in another country thinking a change of scenery was all he needed after his first few attempts, that didn't really work either. His dad's solution was to just deal with it like a man ought to and so my friend confided in his grandfather instead of his own parents. This one time he jumped off the fourth floor of his house (wealthy family like I said) and only survived cause he landed on his car. Shattering his skull and shoulder blades, he was back up and walking in a few months. The guy was a tank, a kick boxer and at the peak of his physique so he seemed to oddly survive his various attempts. 

  Things settled when he got into a stable relationship for a few years and we grew out of touch but I heard he was doing well and had left the country with his significant other. The last thing I heard after that was how his grandfather had died and that they found he had hanged himself a few days after the funeral. His family didn't even tell his friends about it, they just had a quick and quiet funeral for him the next day and I only found out about it months later. 

  That was the end of his story but it doesn't have to be for so many others out there. Please seek professional help for you or for those you know are going through cycles of depression. The worst way to deal with it is to leave it to conservative families that care more about impressions and ""manning up"" than being humble enough to band together when one is hurting and be supportive and nurturing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/brpt7q/my_friend_killed_himself_after_8_failed_attempts/,191,"You are describing me, literally.

I haven't really done any suicide attempts just yet, but fuck, i am suicidal. If someone would hug me and show they cared, i would feel much better too. 
I can say, that ripped body and skills mean nothing when you are depressed, you still think you are worthless.
I hope my life doesn't end this way, because i care about everyone, but most people insult me through jokes because they think that because i am strong and workout a lot i can handle it. Sorry, i can not. It hurts when someone says that i am still not strong or good enough, and that i should not be depressed because i am financially well off or have the ""great body"". 
Please don't think that i want to show off somehow, i do not. I just workout a lot to try and ease my depression, but us ""ripped"" guys can also be depressed and need love and support. Just because someone is wealthy or has a great body doesn't make them immune to stupid jokes, insults and not caring. Everyone needs love. May that soul rest in peace.. ",2019-05-22 14:58:52

I feel so alone.,depression_help,"For my entire life, I have dealt with severe persistent depression (dysthymia as the diagnosis) and anxiety. I have gone through a lot of stuff, especially toxic friendships throughout life. These past few months have been especially tough for me. I got involved in a ""relationship"" that didn't end up in a relationship due to his and my own mental instability. He refused to work together on it and trying to work on some things we both had issues with. This made me feel as if he didn't really care about me. Tonight he told me he definitely did not have romantic feelings for me anymore. After that, my best friend (Let's call her Katie) contacted me for help involving her struggling with suicidal thoughts (not necessarily wanting to kill herself, more so that the thought of suicide made her anxious). Anyways, after I helped her to the best of my ability, I felt great. (I want to be a therapist so this is rewarding to me if I can help anyone.) But then, she told me something. I have had this other friend for a long long time. (Let's call her Amy) Throughout high school, Amy and I had issues because her mother absolutely despised me and created issues for our friendship. I am pretty sure she blamed a lot of stuff on me to her mom so she wouldn't get in trouble for it. As a result, I began getting left out of our friend group a lot and was treated like an outcast. She has been a pretty shitty friend to me. Last year, Amy moved away to go to a different college, which made things so much easier for me, life was going great. But this summer she moved back to town and is transferring to our hometown college. Immediately life started going back to how it used to be. Katie hangs out with them a ton and I am just alone and don't really get invited. I ended up saying something to Katie and asked her if she thinks everyone is going to start excluding me again and I said something like, ""Since Amy moved back, everyone flocks to her like she is crack"". This is not a great thing to say but I was frustrated and panicking at the time. Katie was with Amy and another girl at the time, and I thought Katie wouldn't show anyone and this was a private convo (my mistake for thinking that would be true). Tonight, after feeling the gratification of helping her, Katie decided to tell me that the other girl she was with and Amy read what I said. I genuinely didn't say anything super mean, just that I was frustrated that as soon as she moves back, I get dropped. Katie told me the other girl she was with said: ""that is just disrespectful and out of line"". and Amy said, ""I'm glad I know how she really feels about me"". Sorry for the long story but now, I just feel like nothing. I feel that I mess up every friendship. But at the same time, I am frustrated with the fact that if they do anything to hurt me, it means nothing, but if I do anything I am automatically this horrible human being. They act as if they have done nothing to me.

Honestly we’ve all been there one way or the other and usually things end up working out when it comes to friends. Friendships can and will come to an end sometimes, but it usually happens over a period of time- it’s more of a drift apart rather than a breakup, but even when friends drift apart there’s still opportunities to become even better friends in the future.

As for the guy- those things don’t always work out. Even if you said things worked out with him today, it’s still not always for the best.

235,g6k2kb,False,STORY,16,"I want to share my story (molestation, anger issues, and depression). I’m scared, but I’m doing it for you guys. You are not alone.",depression_help,"Hi guys,

My name’s Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s the story of my years-long battle.

I would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.

After that night I had never felt the same. 

A year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.

This anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.

On a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.

Now, a year and a half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? 

-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.

-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.

-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. 

I hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.

I'm just a shell of what I was. What was once curiosity is now just static, ignoring everything that's outside of my body. I try to follow your words. I try to understand. I am tired. No one sees it. Nobody cares. I can't pull myself out. The advice I used to give turned to passive agresiveness and criticism. It's not my fault please understand. My love was meant to get the best flowers out of two seeds growing together. I became selfish. I still want the best for you but there's nothing good left in me. I want you to enjoy life. Can you even do it with me? Does wanting you closer make me selfish? I treated you so badly lately and I'm so painfuly sorry. I can't stop it. I'm scared to take meds. What if they kill me. I'm really paranoid. I need help. Who would help someone as evil as me. someone please force me into treatment if you love me so much. How do I know if the treatment will work. I'm going crazy.

269,epjex8,False,MOTIVATION,6,After Years of Struggling with Depression I've Decided to Make a difference,depression_help,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

225,erxx2i,False,PROVIDING SUPPORT,25,Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,depression_help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results.

449,dne431,False,REQUESTING SUPPORT,61,19 years old and its pretty obvious there's no reason to go any further,depression_help,"Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like ""crackhead"" or ""you look like an old man"", ""you look like a hobo"", ""Looks like Albert Einstein"", ""Do you wash your hair?"" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is ""illegal"" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless.

Three years ago I was goning throught a moment on my life where I always was thinking about suicide. I felt usseless, a failure, and thought that no one loves me etc. I was all the time angry without any reason. The doctor give me a pill, only one, and even though I am what I am, a shy person with a poor self-esteem, I started to see the world different, the bad thoughts like no one cares or loves me, went away. I could face the life with a bit of confidence and hope.

Also, even though sounds stupid,  a dog, is the best, best,best friend. If you take care of them, automatically, they take care of you, also I met a lot of people because of my dog. Furthermore, you have to go out every day to take them a walk and exercise is essential for a healthy mind.

I care about you, you deserve to be happy. Never take a decision when you feel bad. Tomorrow will be a new day, that is my favourite quote. ",2020-05-20 00:16:04

317,e5konu,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,100,How do I (14 M) talk to my (Typical Indian) dad about seeing a therapist?,depression_help,"Tl;dr at bottom

Hey guys. So, for context: I am a 14 y/o dude from India. I have a typical Indian dad, so that means conservative and not so open-minded, and we aren't close either. We haven't really talked about anything else other than studies and me being a failure in the past... 3 years or so. I have been depressed and suicidal for about 2 years now and have been cutting for about a year. I think I might have anxiety, but not really sure about that. So, with that in mind, here's what's I need help with:

About a month ago, I tried talking to my dad about my cuts. I went to him and showed him my recent scars and he asked what they were. I told him they were cuts with a razor blade and he didn't ask me why but instead started screaming at me about me not studying and that I cut myself because of Youtube (As it had ""rotten my brain""). He told me that he would have listened to me and helped if I had gotten good grades (Like, above 95%) but since I haven't gotten good grades (I have like a 75-80% overall), he doesn't give a fuck. I couldn't even tell him about what was bothering me. The first thing I said was insecurities, and he said I don't know the first thing about being insecure. Then I said anxiety and he went on and on about how I have no anxiety and it's all just due to Youtube. This went on and on and I just stopped speaking. Like half an hour in, he told me that I should just take a knife and slice my wrists so I can die once and for all and how it would be great and he wouldn't give a shit (This was pretty descriptive. He told me exactly where to cut and how much time it would take me to die. Also, to slice them in the bathroom sink so the bedroom doesn't get dirty)

After like 1.5-2 weeks after this convo, he came into my room and told me that he got irritated because he couldn't understand what caused me to do it and he had cried later that night. Now I don't know if I should believe him or not. Anyways, this was just the backstory and here is what's going on now:

I want to see a therapist to talk about my problems but there is no therapist where I live. The closest one is like 3 hours away. One of my closest friends lives in Chandigarh (It's a big city) and I asked him if he could find out about any therapists there. His mom used to be a dentist so she knew some people and one of her close friends is a reputable psychologist in Fortis hospital. He told me about her and I was like ""Well, so can I call her and talk to her about wtf is going on with me"" but turns out she needs to talk to my dad first because since I'm a minor I can't be diagnosed without parental consent. So this means that I will have to tell my dad that I need to see a therapist. He will ask me why and I will have to tell him about my depression, suicidal thoughts, etc.

Keeping in mind how our last convo about my mental health went and our not-so-good relationship, can you guys give me some advice about how to talk to him?

(PS: He gets irritated very easily and he rarely listens to me, and even if he does he will say I'm wrong since I am younger and that I never listen to him.)

TL;DR: I am a 14 y/o Indian dude with a typical Indian dad. Our last convo about my mental health went not so wonderful and he told me to kill myself and how to do it, and that he doesn't give a fuck about it. I want to see a therapist for depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harming, etc. but the closest one is 3 hours away. I need parental consent for even basic diagnoses, and I have no idea how to approach my dad about this. We have a poor relationship and haven't talked about anything else than studies in the past 3 years or so. (Skim through the upper paragraphs because I might have left something out, I tend to do that)

&#x200B;

Update: So while talking normally, I asked my dad what he would say if I asked him I wanted to see a therapist. He reminded me that I had already asked him and he said that since there are no child therapists in India, it wouldn't do me much good. Also, he said that my issue is a lack of focus and confusion (And it is this confusion that led me to cut myself) and that since I do not have a psychological problem like depression, I can just meditate and go for walks and I'll be okay. The funny thing is, I was amused when he said that I don't have depression lol (Hopefully it didn't show up on my face)

Also, I talked to him about why he had talked the way he did when I told him about my cuts. He said that he had a long and tiring day and when I told him he couldn't process what happened and got irritated (Which is his kind of go-to emotion. Mine is laughing). I know this doesn't excuse what he said, but it's at least a reason I can get behind. He also told me to talk to him about whatever is bothering me instead of a therapist, which I won't be doing

&#x200B;

UPDATE #2: Here is the link to the letter I will be giving him. If you would like, you can go through it and let me know if I should change anything (Names and stuff changed): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mPqoXtyLRbuWboCQuACZyAZntW835uzHB3QQUFjYHZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

UPDATE #3: So my dad got me an appointment with the therapist I mentioned for tomorrow at 11 AM. I'll be talking to her tomorrow and I guess I will give the final update when I come back home

&#x200B;

FINAL UPDATE: So I went to see the therapist today. We talked for about an hour and in the end, she diagnosed me with mild depression, anxiety and BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). I have been given meds for mood stabilization and am on some sort of anxiety program. I'll be going to her once every week for at least 3-4 sessions and then once every 15 days.

I’m 16 years old and have clinical depression and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I also might have OCD. Both my parents have chronic illnesses that made high school difficult, so I put in a lot of work and graduated early. In this process I lost most of my friends and I now have nothing to do with my time. I was struggling when I was in school, but it was at least a distraction. 

Now after several failed attempts at trying medications prescribed by my gp I’m waiting to see a psychiatrist for a med change. I’m also not in therapy anymore because my therapist left to join another field of work. 

I feel so helpless and alone and I anguish in the pain of my anxiety ridden mind every second of every day. But it’s like I’ve been put in limbo. Just waiting for the next appointment, where they’ll refer me to someone else who I’ll have to wait another month to see. 
 
All of this waiting is because I’m terrified of dying or getting hurt so I could never self harm or be suicidal. This makes people not see me as a priority. But I need help and I need it now. I feel like I lose my mind a little more everyday. I feel lost in self loathing and disappointment because I can never do what I want or need to do. And I’m so very exhausted. I lay awake at night scared of everything from inadvertently starting a fire and killing my family, to being killed by a home intruder.

304,g21pxr,False,REQUESTING ADVICE,11,"How to be ""you"" when you are not sure who ""you"" is",depression_help,"&#x200B;

I am a 20 yr old in college. I used to think I knew who I was.

Example: I used to think I found beauty in math. Then I delved into more and more difficult math courses, and I eventually convinced myself I was too stupid to do it and could not appreciate its beauty any more.

I used to think I knew a lot of other stuff about myself too. It was comforting. Events took those certainties away from me, and now I realize myself as a dynamic being, and my identity can't really be defined by anything nor am I really comfortable defining it, since it is always subject to change, always subject to something I hadn't seen before that I can see now, or at least realize I can't see. Why pigeonhole myself to believing the same thign all my life?

To be in this constant state of questioning and openness to change is in a way terrifying. I feel as if there is no stability in who I am as a person. People say just to be ""you"" but the thing is I'm not sure who I am. Because to me it all depends. Who I am right now could be different from who I am tomorrow. And moreover I am not *confident* in the person who I am now because I know how little I know, and how ill informed most of my decisions likely are. This is a huge source of depression for me.

On the flip side I feel like people who think they know who they are are ignorant. I believe we are all constantly being changed and affected by the experiences in life and people's personalities change depending on context. And if people try to act the ""same"" thorugh it all it just means they are shutting themselves off, preventing themselves from being sculpted by life.

But is that a bad thing? Should you completely open yourself up to life, and let it sculpt you? What if your life has been traumatic? Should you not let life sculpt you at all, perhaps retain idealist values and cling tightly to them, maintaining the integrity of the sculpture, making it stand the test of time? Somewhere in the middle maybe?

**The verdict is I am struggling to develop a healthy relationship with myself.** In one way, I don't want to associate myself with any form of identity because its limiting my growth as a person. On the other hand, I feel like some form of identity is absolutely necessary to a healthy being with a good relationship with oneself. People find other people who have a strong sense of self attractive and fun to be around. While I might've used to be this person, I just can't put so much faith into my self anymore, its so unfinished, so incomplete, I feel pathetic.

Perhaps to find myself I need to revert to my emotional urges and impulses, but I don't want to submit to those really, because they are not much healthier than not having a self. Perhaps I need to make my identity some sort of wanderer, and gain my certainty from the act of wandering and navigating through the eternal grey area that is life.

**I DONT KNOW, and I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN KNOW.**

Someone please give me your thoughts, and thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/g21pxr/how_to_be_you_when_you_are_not_sure_who_you_is/,103,"You get this disassociation, because like you said - you don;t want to limit your growth and to grow you have to get out of your comfort zone. The thing is, it can be uncomfortable and unpleasant at times, thats why people cling to their ""values"" that are negative or limits their growth. People subconsciously are this way where they think ""the devil i know is better than the devil i dont"" and my answer to that would be ""yeah.. dont be so sure about that"".

The fact that you are in this uncomfortable zone is probably because you are not sticking to the devil you know and are letting you grow, which is good. But while growth can be rewarding at points, the journey will be unpleasant and scary sometimes, where you forget who you are because of this feeling of insecurity.

That's why its called getting out of comfort zone. Its part of the process of growth. You have to stop sticking to that feeling of security and comfort, just because you don't feel fine during all the course of growth and transitioning inbetween two growth points. You will feel good and hopeful at times, and depressed and uncertain at other times, but you dont stop just because you stopped feeling good. This is literally the reason so many people refuse to grow, even when its drastically beneficial - its uncomfortable, of course, and they dread this feeling of insecurity as soon as they stop limiting themselves and get out of their comfort zone.

So dont see this state you are in as something you have to avoid, because that's directly correlated with growth and would limit your growth as you say.. Its not a dysfunction or an error in your brain. Uncertainty is uncomfortable. And its not unreasonable to feel anxious and insecure when you leave your comfort zone. Your brain doesnt differentiate when you leave comfort zone because youre forced to by some outside event, or when you do it voluntarily - knowing fully well its letting you grow. People start exercising voluntarily because they fully know the benefit it will over long term, but its very uncomfortable at the beggining. If you listen to your body, you would stop exercising. Well it doesnt always know whats better for it. You exercise anyway regardess of your body feeling out of comfort zone.

That's what is called ""growth pains"". ",2020-04-15 21:57:44

It helped me a great deal with this. This is rally an oversimplification, but one thing we did was to try to recognize the loop early on and SHOUT internally STOP! If it tried to creep back in, STOP!  I also learned to refocusing on another stimulus. There’s more to it than that, but that was the start of a change. It’s sort of just a guided behavior modification system.

Another thing that really helped was to shift my environment at the onset of anxiety or thought loops. I would physically get up and walk outside (didn’t want to!), but I did. I would walk hard and fast, get my breath rate up, deep breathing fresh air, looking at outdoor scenery just in my yard. 

Exercises like that can cause a shift and give you some control over your own emotions. I will say that as long as I allowed myself to stay isolated, I continually got worse until I forced myself to make changes. It was uncomfortable, but tolerable for very short periods of time. 

The more exercise I got and the more I talked with people, the better I felt. Even though I’m an introvert. I would focus my energy on someone else who needed help, or a few minutes of conversation with someone lonely.

It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down & depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad.

And that’s the first step of getting out of a depression by yourself but make sure YOU want to get out of depression.

Here are the things I did. I started practising this every damn day.

I try to write down my diary and track my mood. Think that:

&#x200B;

1. I want to      feel okay. I want to wake up everyday with smile on my face. I want to      wake up everyday filled with a hope knowing that everything will be      alright.
2. I want to      feel lovely, I want to feel what it’s like to be someone who matters.      Someone who counts for something who will forever remain a memory.
3. I want to      feel alive. I want to feel sun’s warmth above my head and grow like a      flower that always experiences spring. I want to feel what it’s like to be      the best version of me.
4. I want to      be in love, I want a love that makes me feel free like a bird flying      towards the blue sky. I want a love that comes from me.

It works for me and I feel relaxing after writing down. It is hard to find a suitable app to write conveniently. Finally, my best friend develop one for me, named '[Stars Diary – Journal, Mood, Note, Password](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sognarestudio.stars)'.

It really helps me, I express my feeling with music and photo and capture them in app. Release my feeling from my brain.

I am humbled and thankful for the Redditt community! I love this place already. Thank you. I am so happy that I'll keep collecting info until I get to 100. Then I'll see if I'm overwhelmed with work, lol. Please follow me! I want to keep doing stuff like this for the community! THIS IS SO MEANINGFUL TO ME. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.*   


Hey There!  :)

I built an algorithm to help people with mental health. It is pretty cool.

I am an anonymous therapist that is tech savvy. I built an algorithm to analyze peoples needs and then compare it to the progress of other people with the same profile. Then it generates meaningful tips that emails people free advice based on what helped other similar people.

The recommendations from my algorithm have been helpful to me and to others. So I run it for other people for free (it's a strange hobby I know, but I like to do it). I have to put the data in manually, so I use google forms to collect your info and I enter it manually later. You can fill it out totally anonymously.

Fill out this google form and I will enter your data and email a list of 7 online resources that may help you. I can do more, but it is a bit of work. lol

Each response is personalized just for you! Know that this isn't a generic test. You'll get personalized resources that helped people who have a similar profile as you.

I only do 50 of these emails per week. So fill this out at the beginning of the week to maximize your chances of getting recommendations.

I hope this helps! Let me know if it does! I love feedback.

[https://goo.gl/forms/TS8r2lI6Jsm7GzDh2](https://goo.gl/forms/TS8r2lI6Jsm7GzDh2)

ps - no, I'm not a robot. But I just made this Reddit account to anonymously post this. Lets see if it works. :)

I am totally stoked that so many people participated! I am totally blown away.

I need an extra day. I really need feedback on the algorithm and the effectiveness of the recommendations.    


My synopsis - I am a real therapist who got into therapy to make a difference, but I have fallen short of my goals. I have been in Mental Health field since I was 21 (I'm 37 now). I worked my way to the top of my profession and was getting referrals from all over the nation (big ones too). I just didn't feel like I was making enough of a difference as a therapist, and I keep seeing former clients take their lives - and it was tough, even traumatizing ([I made a video about it here](https://www.facebook.com/MentalGurusTeam/videos/397204421039783/)). I became somewhat disenchanted with therapy as it is today, and I HATE charging for services that I want to give for free. I hate that people are suffering because they can't afford therapy. I can't tell you how much I hate it (may I'll post on it someday).   


If you are interested in getting to know me and Mental Gurus better - [join my FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mentalgurus/), or please [like my page](https://www.facebook.com/). I am trying to grow Mental Gurus into something good. I am not making money on this, though I hope it will support my family eventually.   


Because I hate the idea of people suffering because they can't afford therapy - I am trying to build something entirely FREE! Something useful and beautiful, that really helps with mental health. By taking part in the google form, you are part of it. You are helping make Mental Gurus better. I really appreciate it because healing others is how I heal my own heart. I put all my money into this project (don't worry, I'm already poor as dirt, lol). Mental Gurus has consumed me as an obsession. One I want to do forever. I just hope it makes a difference. I just want to help people not suffer.    


So thanks for fulling out over 100 of these google forms! I can't tell you how wonderful it is to have your anonymous feedback.   


If you want to help make Mental Gurus better and take one of these tests, and tell me what I could do better. :)   


Oh - and if you want to get a report that will tell you about the level (aka severity) of your depression, [take this eval here](https://dev.mentalgurus.com/takeassessment/18). I wrote this myself and would love your feedback. [Here is the one about anxiety](https://dev.mentalgurus.com/takeassessment/16).

My name is Nick Casaletto and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 12 years now. I’ve seen therapist, been on countless medication and have the support system of an amazing wife. But, my depression would always creep up unexpectedly, as I’m sure a lot of you can relate, it’s not exactly fun. 

My only outlet has been movies. Since around the time I started to notice my depression at around 18 years old, I found myself sitting in my bedroom and finding solace in cinema. It was the only place I would feel comfortable being myself, my only escape from the world. 

After all of this time, my depression has matured with me. What started out as something I dealt with by countlessly drinking until I was black out drunk, to my now current quiet depression. The kind that makes you stuck in your thoughts that’s on a constant loop. I thought, (loving movies and having become accustomed to the craft of editing) why not make my voice heard. Not as a cry for help, but for others who feel like me, and can relate to the visual medium. 

Please note: the short movie is to a song that really inspired me, I was blessed enough to have the licensing and support from the band. 

I hope some of you will watch and relate.

[Originally posted on r/Advice as ""Why am I such a pathetic loser and how do I fix it before it gets me killed?"" My request for advice was downvoted there and I'm worried no one will reply because of that. Also, this seems like a better place to voice these concerns anyway.]

I'm 26 years old. My problem is this. I'm a quitter with no willpower. I give up on everything before I've even had a chance to really try. I'm afraid of putting in effort, and if I'm *forced* to make an effort, I do quite well for awhile, and then freeze up at some point late into the process, panic, dig my feet into the ground, drop everything, and stubbornly persist in inaction until all my progress has been sabotaged. This attitude and approach toward everything I do has ruined my life.

Through elementary school and high school, I was eccentric and asocial, but brilliant. My performance was excellent, far above the curve, right up to the end. Then, in the middle of 12th grade, I stopped trying. I didn't mean to stop trying. It was more like I couldn't try anymore even if I tried to try. Like my try engine was busted. My performance declined immediately, and it was only because I'd done so well up to that point that I still managed to graduate with excellent grades.

My performance up to that point got me a few merit scholarships, none of them in the area. One was for a school in Pennsylvania. I'm from the bay area in northern California, and my single mother was poor and we wanted to save money by any means possible, so I moved to Pennsylvania to go to college. This was perhaps too bold of me. Because I was used to succeeding, I was spoiled and believed I could do anything effortlessly. I believed I wouldn't have any transition pains. Friends, don't be smart, it makes you stupid.

I did well for one year, but I was miserable. Then I did pretty badly for most of another year because I froze up again and refused to make an effort. I felt like the world around me wasn't real, like every person and every building was made of cardboard and nothing I could do would have any consequence, so I just stayed in my dorm room all day every day. I wound up having to withdraw to avoid having it on my record that I'd flunked out, so I moved back to California to be with my mom again.

My credits from Pennsylvania couldn't be considered, so I had to go to community college for another, well, two years, I think? Then, with my grades already ruined and age having made me less attractive a prospect, we bit the bullet and sent me to a local university without a scholarship as a transfer student, with money we didn't really have per se.

I did kind of well for a year, and then started resisting my own progress again and having mental breakdowns. My second year, I wound up having to withdraw because I refused to make an effort any longer. I then repeated my second year and finished it. The year after that, my mother passed away unexpectedly and I had to withdraw again (though, for once, it's understandable).

It's been 2 years since then, and everything since then has just blurred together and left me confused, but I think what happened was something like this: I came back to try again when I felt I was ready, I was wrong and wasn't ready so I had to withdraw again, I came back again, and (very recently) after fighting a losing battle to stay afloat, I just completely gave up and decided I'm fundamentally not good enough for this. I withdrew permanently, on the very year I was meant to finally graduate.

I'm morbidly obese. While I was at the university back at home in California, I lost 130 pounds. I thought I could keep it up and achieve an acceptable weight. Since my mom died, I've gained it all back.

Also, through all this school BS, I've never learned to drive, never gotten a job or even tried applying for one, and until three months ago, I never even lived on my own. Now I'm renting a place with the money my mother's life insurance company paid out to me as her designated beneficiary. It's quite a significant chunk of money, so I'm fortunate enough to have some time to figure out how to be the adult I'm long overdue to be. But my time isn't unlimited.

I was also very dependent on her. Right up to when I was around 21 or so, she still bought me most of what I owned, still cleaned up after me and did my laundry, still drove me around, still arranged most of my meetings and kept track of the rest for me, still talked to people on my behalf because I didn't have the guts. I've since learned to do most of these things on my own, but even as I type this, there are around 15 bags of garbage in my studio apartment not taken out. I usually take out the garbage like any sane person, but for the past several weeks, I've been ""forgetting."" I also don't brush my teeth and hardly ever get haircuts. I'm basically barely capable of caring for myself.

Also I don't have any friends. Well, it's more like I refuse to have any. I show people a good personality, and they like me, and try to be my friends, but I freeze up and shut them out. I don't want them in my life. I don't want to hurt them by inevitably not being there when they need me, and I don't want to get hurt, either. Even a disgusting slob like myself could get laid if I wanted to, people have even made advances on me maybe two or three times in my life, but I refuse connections like that, too. If anyone tries to get close to me sexually, that's an even bigger red flag to me than if they try to be my friend. I go into panic. I've literally physically fled sobbing from a situation like that once before.

Please don't judge me too harshly for this, but because of my refusal to be with others or be vulnerable, I'm so touch-starved that I actually bought a love doll. Worst decision of my life. I don't know what to do with it now. I have nowhere to put it, and having it in my studio apartment, just existing, staring at me, judging me, makes me feel really horrible. I am going to have to order a hacksaw off Amazon, take the doll apart, and discreetly throw it out with the trash.

Like I said, I have a financial buffer to figure things out, but my time isn't unlimited. I don't believe I'm capable of holding down a job. I couldn't even hold down school. My mental problems are just too frequent for me to function in society, and I don't even have any aspirations left that I actually still believe in or appreciate. But at the same time, that kind of attitude, where I'm willing to say I'm not good enough for a job without even ever having tried to work one, is exactly what I'm talking about when I say I'm a quitter and too afraid of making an effort at anything.

Once my lease ends, I'm seriously considering either disposing of most of my belongings and entering into voluntary homelessness, or moving out of state again in search of a less competitive housing market, one where I could work a job simple and solitary enough for someone like me to handle, like carrying boxes around, and still make enough money to afford rent. Or both: disposing of most of my belongings, moving out of state to somewhere where it's safer to be homeless and no one I know can judge me, and dipping under the radar and into the urban wilderness.

Speaking of safety, that's where ""before it gets me killed"" comes in. The only thing keeping me from diving headlong into homelessness is that I don't want it to get me killed. Well, the same could probably be said for most people, right? Who would spend hours of every day making someone else richer if they didn't have to do it to survive? But if I don't become a better person soon, I won't have a choice. I'll wind up homeless, voluntary or otherwise, and if I'm not prepared for that, it very well might kill me. Also, my obesity might kill me if I don't slim down.

I know what I have to do. I've known that much for my whole life. I know most of the pure pragmatic *how* as well. What I don't know is how to find the strength.

I don't remember ever not being miserable. I remember this time when I was 9 years old and kept wailing in a grocery store and pulling on my mom's arm. Did we pass by a snack or toy I wanted? No. Hardly. I'd just felt a surge of emotion come over me for no particular reason I could discern, and I was literally begging her to end my life because I was too afraid to try it myself. I was hanging off her arm and wailing out ""kill me"" in the middle of the store. I don't know why I've been so unhappy for my whole life, but I guess my senior year in high school was just when it all culminated and I couldn't put up with it any longer, and I haven't really been able to ever since.

Therapy seemed to help a lot, but needing therapy so badly you can't even get it together to actually leave your house to go get it can be quite a predicament.

How do I fight this?

Am I just not good enough to live?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/dz6ir2/lifelong_depression_has_stunted_my_personal/,163,"Hey, if you're reading this I hope you're doing well. please don't give up on yourself, and the fact that you're sharing your struggle and going to therapy just shows that yes you're good enough to live. I feel it's important for you to know that you shouldn't be harsh on yourself and try to live day by day. it's kinda how I manage to overcome my suicidal attempt this year when there was no one there to help me. it's hard for sure and wanting to live and finding the will power can be tough to navigate but in my case how did I find it is that I let myself take its time to heal and time can heal and with a little bit of a push I tried to find anything to be my source of motivation to want to live or makes me feel better. Slowly, I felt better but externally my life was still a mess so I tried to find what I can change in my life that I have control over and set goals and what can I do to achieve these goals and it shouldn't be something big, even small simple things that you can achieve in a day can do. these small things that you achieve might help you feel better and see progress and have some order in your life and motivate you to continue. I don't know if what I wrote is any help but I read your post and really wanted to help and if you need someone to talk you can reach out to me and please take care of yourself.
