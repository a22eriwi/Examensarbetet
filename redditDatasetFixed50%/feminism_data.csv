830,94i79k,False,,81,WHY SOME WOMEN AVOID GOING OUT LIKE IT IS THEIR JOB.,Feminism,"STORY TIME BECAUSE I AM ANGRY.

*****IF YOU ARE A ""NICE GUY"" WHO CLAIMS TO RESPECT WOMEN, BUT TURN AROUND AND CALL US ""BITCHES"" ""SLUTS"" ""FEMINAZI'S"" WHEN WE REFUSE YOUR ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL ADVANCES, THIS POST IS NOT FOR YOU. I, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR OPINIONS ON HOW WOMEN (AND MEN) ARE TREATED. WE ARE NOT HERE TO LISTEN TO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF.*****

I was at the bar earlier, walking back in from having a smoke, and some wife-beater-wearing-fuck-boy GRABS my waist, forcibly pulls me in, and demands that I kiss him. I looked at him and with a calm, but VERY stern voice, told him to let go of me, and to not touch me again. He was persistent, grabbing me with more force and continuing to demand that I kiss him.. 

He did not let go of me or stop grabbing me until I looked at his group of guy friends with a stare that said ""come get your fucking dog off of me"". One of them stepped in and told him to forget about it, they were leaving anyways. Only then did this asshole loosen his grip and walk away from me. 

WHY DO YOU RESPECT YOUR FRIEND TELLING YOU TO STOP MORE THAN YOU RESPECT A WOMAN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW TELLING YOU TO STOP? So I'm really angry.

Not once did I give even the slightest indication that he could touch me. I honestly didn't even notice his presence until he put his hands on me. I should have hit him square in the face right then and there, after I very clearly told him to take his hands off of me and he refused.

But that's the problem right? Us ""feminazis"" are overreacting. We are ""violent"". Our cries for help and our demands for personal space and respect, our screams of being uncomfortable, it is just us ""crazy bitches, sluts, whores"" getting what we deserve. 

This has turned into a drawn-out ramble, I am aware. But I think its very important. I guess the main message I want people to take away is, instead of saying ""NOT ALL MEN"" try saying ""THE MEN THAT ARE GIVING YOU A HARD TIME NEED TO BE STOPPED"". Once again, a very important PSA from yours truly.

ALSO, why am I being made to feel like I was in the wrong? Why am I made to feel like I should have brushed it off because he was drunk? Why am I trying to make excuses for HIS obscene and brash behavior? 

For far too long, men and women who have been harassed or abused in any way have felt the need to make excuses for their abusers behavior. ""They were drunk."" ""I started the argument."" ""They are only angry because they care so much."" 

THAT IS ENOUGH. NO MORE EXCUSES. Drunk guy at the bar isn't being held accountable for his actions? Then neither am I, tell your face to say hello to the curb üôÉ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/94i79k/why_some_women_avoid_going_out_like_it_is_their/,638,[removed] ,2018-08-04 10:27:58

935,9s9nub,False,,58,"I just watched ""Feminists"" on Netflix. It has completely changed how I see the world.",Feminism,"I am 25 years old. I am from Canada. I have always taken equality for granted. Within my living memory, I have perceived little to no inequality. I was not raised by a feminist. My mother was a strong, independent woman who was the breadwinner for our family. I always assumed that women's rights have been entrenched in society for a very long time. I don't know exactly how long ago I assumed that these rights were achieved, but I never really thought about it.

I just finished watching the Netflix documentary ""Feminists."" I don't even know what prompted me to press play. But oh boy, was it an eye-opener. The images of the rallies, the stories from women who had terrible experiences, and they're not even that old. It wasn't so long ago.

I had no idea how much these women had fought for. They built a better world for me, and I took it for granted. Some of them, I even knew of in some capacity, but nothing beyond the superficial surface of their work. What especially bothered me as I watched the documentary was the memories of my family making fun of Jane Fonda because of the time that she had done aerobics videos. I wonder if they knew about her contributions to furthering women's rights, or if they chose to just ignore this and reduce her to a ditzy actress, just in it for the money.

I cried a few times during the documentary. I want to reach out to these women and thank them for all they've done to make the world a better place for the next generations. It's so sad how people my age view feminism now; we don't fully grasp why it's necessary and so many people equate it with ""man-hating."" I myself am guilty of shying away from the term, preferring to say ""egalitarian"" when asked. From now on, I will be proud to say I am a feminist, and will dedicate time to learning about the history from which I benefit.

Edit: It's so upsetting. I saw a girl speak up about something revolting that happened to her and then this guy thought it was the right time to express other issues about men.

Edit:

This isn't an example because I saw this in a comment section on YouTube.

But anyways in a nutshell: Girl speaks up about sexual abuse, guy comments under her comment and comments statistics about mens issues which has nothing to do with her story. That's it. It was disrespectful. Good intentions or not just inconsiderate.

I did it because she wanted to finally call out the perpetrator but was afraid, so I offered to do it for her. It included a story about a teacher's failure to investigate the matter after she reported it.

After posting it, plenty of people who graduated at the school started reaching out to me about sexual harassment and bullying either done by or enabled by teachers. I've discovered this has been a long cycle of abuse, and I decided to contact someone from the school. My complaints have fallen on deaf ears, though. They just flat out told me that times have changed, the school wasn't the same as it used to be. And to be careful about posting about the school because I might get sued. 

I can't just ignore all these girls being sexually harassed by their teachers. Some of them have recently graduated and confirmed that this is still happening today. I want to fight for them but I'm also afraid to get into any legal trouble. (I live in the Philippines)

I've learned a bit about feminism growing up, but it wasn't until I began entering the world as my own, individual person, that I ever felt much of a connection to this so-called 'feminism'.

But then, I grew up. 
I entered the real world. 
I learned of injustices ranging from severe human rights violations, down to subtle differences in social acknowledgment.

I began hearing of atrocities happening around the world, while also becoming more and more aware of when people treat me differently than a male counterpart.

And, to be honest? I'm tired.
I'm tired of explaining why that joke just isn't funny.
I'm tired of explaining why his advances are inappropriate.
I'm tired of explaining why progress doesn't negate the fact that there's still work to be done.
I'm tired of keeping my composure during someone's inappropriate behavior.
I'm tired of justifying why bodily autonomy is so important to me.
I'm tired of holding my tongue while his eyes slide over my body, as if I'm a piece of meat being considered in a market.

I'm tired of explaining that, no, feminism isn't about hating men.
I'm tired of breaking down the need for feminism to someone who has no interest in actually hearing them.
I'm tired of having to demonstrate that feminists care about issues involving men as well. 
I'm tired of having to prove why my experience does, in fact, matter.

How do you know? 
Why don't you care? 
How can you justify that? 
What do you feel that you are owed by us?

If people wanted to argue that more young women turning to sex work for money Is a growing issue, I would be on board. A woman shouldn‚Äôt feel like selling her body is her only option. That would be oddly enough, an actual way to help women in need and protect teenage girls. Of course that‚Äôs not the case. None of these men want to help these women, none of these men would even consider donating to a women‚Äôs charity because they don‚Äôt think the oppression of women exist anymore. Societal views on women are enough to argue that we are not ‚Äúequal‚Äù and aren‚Äôt treated with the same respect as men. Just because women can legally ‚Äúdo whatever they want‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean women don‚Äôt face a significant amount of societal pressure for so many things it‚Äôs ridiculous. A woman can‚Äôt even own her own body without men putting their 2cents regarding it. 

For clarity, I‚Äôm speaking about the men that shame women for sex work. Apparently, a woman benefitting from her own body is so obscene that these men feel the need to retaliate and get angry at women they don‚Äôt even fucking know. News flash, just because you are attracted to a woman doesn‚Äôt mean her actions are of ANY importance to you. YOU.DO.NOT.OWN.HER. I‚Äôm sorry that a chick you would fuck in the right circumstances isn‚Äôt all what you hoped to be, go look at the other women you thirst for on a daily basis. You are not loyal to her, so why would she have loyalty towards you or any of the other men that follow her only because she‚Äôs hot?

Women are grown ass adults that can hold themselves accountable and know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. We don‚Äôt need men‚Äôs approval and I don‚Äôt know why these men react to Onlyfans as if we do.

Judging by social media, a lot of men have an issue with the use of the word ‚Äòmen‚Äô. They‚Äôre so quick to take the blame off of other men by pouting ‚Äúnot all men!‚Äù It‚Äôs as if they are purposely taking feminist/women out of context. Of course we aren‚Äôt talking about EVERY SINGLE man in existence. If certain men are willing to be offended by the general use of the word ‚Äúmen‚Äù, they should be willing to accept and admit the privileges they have as a man. If I say, ‚Äúmen created beauty standards for women‚Äù do not respond with ‚Äúnot all men!‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt make what I said any less of a problem and doesn‚Äôt generate hope for men because I‚Äôm not talking about the men who don‚Äôt perpetuate the problem.

Two men who sexually assaulted a female soldier in Korean army for ""being lesbian"" both separately have been found not guilty by the High Court for Armed Forces.

in  2010, a female soldier ""A"" was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Lieutenant Commander ""B"" and was made pregnant.

After she got an abortion, she told Commander ""A"" what happened, but instead, he sexually assaulted her as well. 

According to her, after she told ""B"" about her sexuality, he replied ""That's because you don't know about men. I'll teach you how it feels"" and sexually assaulted her.

Suffering from PTSD, she reported it in 2016 and the perpetrators were arrested last September.

 She pressed charges against them, in a first trial, ""B"" was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and ""A"" to 8 years.  But the HCAF overturned the first ruling, acquitting ""B"" today(Nov. 19. 2018). Commander ""A"" was already acquitted on Nov. 8.

Because you have to fight against 'boys will be boys', but what does that mean except males being a form of predators? ",2019-07-09 11:17:48

She was allegedly being held as a sex slave at the home of Jeffrey Epstein, who was a friend of Trump's and is a convicted pedophile with a preference for young girls. After the alleged attack from Trump ended, the girl says Epstein proceeded to rape her. An employee of Epstein's witnessed the rape and corroborates the survivor's story. Trump has been accused of a violent rape before by his ex-wife Ivana Trump, and of attempted rape by a former business colleague.

The mainstream media hasn't reported on this lawsuit, reminiscent of the underreporting of the Cosby rape allegations for over a decade. Another sign that the media reflects the interests of the wealthy and powerful. Infuriating.

Now I feel guilty and awkward and awful. He is always so nice to me, he is a good person. Once he commented on my Asian heritage (out of sincere interest), it bothered me but I said nothing.

I knew it was a problem, but oh my god I did not know how far-reaching of a problem it was. Here are some articles I found (and significant points). Please add any resources or articles that you know about. I am floored that I haven't heard more about this (and that it's legal to begin with).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child\_marriage\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage_in_the_United_States)

* Until 2018, all 50 states in the US allowed child marriage
* 48 US states allow child marriage (New Jersey and Delaware have banned it)
* 17 US states have no minimum age for child marriage

[The legal loophole of child marriage enables grown men to get away with raping girls](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-marriage-state-laws_us_59a5e70ee4b00795c2a27e19)

* ‚ÄúMore than 200,000 children under 18 were married from 2000 to 2015‚Äù
* ‚Äú2000 to 2014, over 800 children age 15 or younger in Missouri were married‚Äù
* Girls who marry as teens are 50% more likely to drop out of high school, 4x less likely to finish college, and 31% more likely to live in poverty later
* Common motivations for child marriage include religious beliefs about premarital sex and pregnancy, arranged marriages, parents‚Äô desire to stop providing for the child, and covering up rape
* Married children are not legally emancipated and do not have the full rights of adults
* State labor laws and runaway laws prevent married girls from leaving abusive situations
* Children can get married even if they are not legally old enough to consent to sex

[American child marriage laws leave married children vulnerable](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/opinion/sunday/child-marriage-delaware.html)

* Most domestic violence shelters do not accept women under age 18
* In many states, a married underaged girl who flees her home is legally a runaway
* In some immigrant families, girls face pressure to marry distant relatives in order to allow them to move to America

[Child Marriage in America](http://apps.frontline.org/child-marriage-by-the-numbers/)

* Approximately 3500 minors married in New Jersey between 1995 and 2012
* At least 207,459 minors were married in the US between 2000 and 2015
* 87% of married minors are girls
* 14% of minors married other minors; 86% married adults
* Law enforcement rarely charges adults with statutory rape if they are married to their victim, even if that victim is under the age of consent
* In most states, minors need a parent‚Äôs consent to marry. In some, they need a judge‚Äôs approval.
* 9 states allow a pregnant minor to marry without a judge‚Äôs approval and sometimes without parental approval
* Minors in rural areas and from poor families are most likely to marry young

# Individual states

* In 2001, 3 10-year-old girls were married to men aged 24, 25, and 31 in Tennessee
* In 2006, an 11-year-old boy was married to a 27-year-old woman in Tennessee
* Data from 40 of the 50 states establishes that more than 200,000 minors were legally married in the US between 2000-2015
* More than 1000 children 14 and under were granted marriage licenses from 2000-2015
* A 14-year-old girl was married to a 74-year-old man in Alabama
* A 17-year-old girl was married to a 64-year-old man in Idaho
* Chris Christie vetoed a bill that would have made child marriage illegal in New Jersey because he said it defied religious customs

[Florida law enables the sexual exploitation of children](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-viewpoint-florida-child-marriage-20171024-story.html)

* 16,400 children as young as 13 were married in Florida from 2000-2017
* Data suggests that many of these marriages were between pregnant girls under 15 (who cannot legally consent to sex with an adult in Florida) and their rapists

* 80% of teenage marriages end in divorce

[2018 Kentucky child marriage bill](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2018/03/why-conservatives-objected-to-that-kentucky-child-marriage-bill.html)

* Senate Bill 48 would have raised Kentucky‚Äôs legal marriage age to 18 (from 16; or, if pregnant, no minimum age with a judge‚Äôs approval)
* If the bill had passed, 17-year-olds would have been able to get married to someone within 4 years of their age with judicial approval if they provided evidence of maturity, stable housing, and a GED or high school diploma. Parental consent would not be required and married 17-year-olds would be automatically emancipated.
* Conservative lobbyists (notably the Family Foundation of Kentucky) opposed the bill because it defied ‚Äúparental rights‚Äù since parental consent would no longer be sufficient for 16- and 17-year-olds
* The bill specified that parental wishes are not ‚Äúsufficient evidence to establish that the best interests of the minor would be served by granting the petition for marriage.‚Äù

43,cnirwr,False,,329,Their shouldn't be any billionaires,Feminism,,https://i.redd.it/9k7geiqeq6f31.jpg,2587,"The heck. This is based on a poor understanding of economics. Money can be created or destroyed at will by federal reserve banks. So you can't ""run out of money"" by having people earn more. 

&#x200B;

In addition, spending money isn't universally ""good"". What, exactly, do you propose people spend their money on? A lot of essential items, like food, are already quite cheap. Others, like housing, do not increase in supply in reponse to increase deman (actually nothing does). In fact most people spend too much any way, especially poor people. Overspending for anyone but the rich incurs debt. And debt destablizes economies. So we really should do more to curb spending. 

&#x200B;

May I blow your mind though? If you look at any inflation adjusted stock index, it has gone up over time. Inflation adjusted meaning this is not explained by increases in money supply. Why is that? Why is it that wealth is created out of thin air? The reason being that econmic growth is not measured by mansions and yachts, but by increased productivity?

&#x200B;

Why do you think everyone can have a car these days? And we can all get medecines? And cell phones? Over time businesses have made these things more available and cheaper to manufacture. That didn't occur without innovation and risk. And the people that took said risk end up billionaires. 

&#x200B;

Here is the thing. Billionaires are a sign of progress. They are a sign that people are rewarded for working harder than the rest. They show that you take an idea, nurture it, and you will reap the benefits. And I get it. It is annoying that people are richer than you, but entertain the thought that they actually deserved some of that. 

&#x200B;

Now I am all for things like providing education for poor people. Doing something about drug companies taking advantage of price inelasticity. And reducing the cost of college. But we need to be sensitive to the actual price indicators and not be emotional and resentful of those that have more than us. 

&#x200B;

Because someone will always have more. Don't focus on them. Focus on yourself. By believing you are disadvantaged, you will be disadvantaged. But most of us, esp. in america, have a ton of potential. And the sooner we realize that, the better we  will all be. ",2019-08-08 08:25:08

On top of this, we have this horrible piece of news reporting that in some parts of Uttarakhand, a state in India, no female children have been born for the past three months. This means every female foetus in these parts were aborted simply because of their sex.

The man's parole officer developed a strategy for allowing him to ""meet his sexual needs"" by purchasing sex - without any concern for the sex workers' safety and despite the fact that purchasing sex is illegal in Canada. 

The parole board considered a convicted murderer's ""sexual needs"" - as if he is entitled to sex - as a matter of higher priority than the safety of the women he was visiting. They didn't even inform the women of his criminal history. To these people, women are disposable - particularly sex workers.

The obvious issue of how this man was being or not being supervised in the community appropriately is should be investigated which I imagine has been.

Or will they over simplify it and just focus on the fact that he was allowed access to a sex worker? The issue is much more complex than that. 

Now looking at sex work side of things - if it was legal and appropriately regulated would these brothels have done a better job at protecting this girl? Would she have gone to the hotel to meet him? If the girls were well supported and they had strong policies in place and had authorities to report this man to, would it have happened? I mean, sure we can consider the parole aspect, but if he didn't have a parole officer and he was released with no parole, it still would have happened. This also needs investigating and reviewed.
