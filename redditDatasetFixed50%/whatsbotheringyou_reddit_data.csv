902,2jjcmy,False,,5,"My crush is seeing someone else. It's not bad, but it still hurts.",whatsbotheringyou,"Background: I'm a 19 year old male, studying at college.

I've met this awesome girl, let's call her Julie. Julie was good looking, fun, a nice person overall. I'd give her a 7/10. We started talking after she asked for my help during Programming class. It seemed like she was interested in me. We texted a lot, talked a lot, all that stuff.

Then she became colder and colder. She didn't talk to me with the same interest as before. Then Julie started talking to this other guy. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""she's just talking."" Then they started dating. 

The worst part about liking someone is when they don't like you back. Maybe I bored her, or maybe I was just misinterpreting her. But even worse than that is when they begin dating another person. EVEN worse is when both are in the same classes as you. You're forced to watch them kiss, hold hands, hug, be happy, while you're lonely and bitter because you don't have a girlfriend and never had one. It's like a psychological torture...

You know that one moment, where you walk out of the classroom, and see your crush and her bf kissing? It got me by surprise. It was a Monday, they started dating on Saturday. I walked outta the classroom, and saw they kissing. It's that moment when your heart stops for a second or two. A friend of mine described this feeling: ""It's like a guitar string snapping"".

And the same thing happened last year. First year of college, met another awesome gal, I'm gonna call her Mary . She was interested (I'm 100% sure of that), but due to my stupidness (and a small misunderstanding), Mary started hating me, and then began dating someone else. Of course, as time passed, she forgave me, and now we're good friends, though she is still dating the same dude.

I know that being bitter because of a girl sounds stupid. I'm not angry nor bothered by the situation, because I know it's my fault.

I got a friend who's been through a similar problem. Yesterday we talked about our failed love lifes, comforting each other. He then jokingly talked about becoming gay, because ""happiness is at the tip of a dick"".

That last part was unnecessary, but it was funny. Anyway, sorry for my rant and my poor grammar (English isn't my first language).",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2jjcmy/my_crush_is_seeing_someone_else_its_not_bad_but/,9,"It's rough dude, I'm sure you got that massive stomach dropping feeling when you think about it. I can't say it doesn't suck, because it does, but I wouldn't try and think about her too much if I were you. Go hang out with some friends, try and meet someone, don't get too caught up.

957,1k9r65,False,,9,The thought of being in a relationship opens the floodgates of negative emotions.,whatsbotheringyou,"I've dating and had a few relationships before, but I've been single for about 10 months I guess.  
Since the last relationship I've tried dating, but it hasn't worked out.

But I've developed, sort of by accident, an almost-dating relationship with someone.  
We spend a lot of time together (2-3 days a week), we go out to eat every other week, we're close intellectually and at times physically - but the concept of us ""dating"" or being in a ""relationship"" does come up directly.

But when I think about us being together, and all that would come with that, I feel just horrible in ways that are hard for me to put into words.

My grandmother lives with me and my father visits recently. Whenever she or my father sees me working on anything (not just this hobby) they tend to look at me tilt and ask ""what are you doing"" in a tone that, to me, implies I'm doing something strange. 

They don't ever discuss my hobbies with me directly. They have a tendency to ask my brother questions about my interests. So, if it ever gets brought up, I feel really embarrassed talking about my interest and hobbies.

Am I nervous? A bit.
Am I scared? A bit.
Am I excited?... yes. Very

When my coworkers ask what opportunity I am heading to and they react in a judging fashion about me heading to unemployment I am undeterred. I feel sorry for them! not me. I had the courage to take a leap of faith in myself.

I only lied so I wouldn't scare her off because I knew from the moment we started talking that I would develop amazing feelings for her. Well she mentioned it last night and I told her straight up that I was just getting over the old girl but we were not together while I was texting her(which was mostly true).

238,dk63qp,False,,4,I really hate my life.,whatsbotheringyou,I'm tired of this shit. I can't believe that I'm 27 years and I'm the way I am. I'm still stuck on a dead end job and can't figure out what I like to do for a stable career. I still live at my grandmothers place and still haven't gotten my shit straight to get on with my life. Im literally a fucking loser. I hate that I put myself in this situation. I have no social life or no friends so in order to keep myself busy I have no choice but to go to my moms house where she acts narcissistic. I feel like I stuck myself like this because I'm afraid to put myself out there and break away from this comfort zone I'm in. I've always been afraid to get too involved with other people and I isolate myself. I don't know why I'm like this. It's now taking a toll on me and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just tired of this lifestyle and it's only causing more stress. I still can't even choose a career. I'm tired of feeling like I can't financially support myself if I move out. I'm just a empty human being. I don't even know what my problem is and why I'm doing this to myself.,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dk63qp/i_really_hate_my_life/,17,"Oh my goodness that is such a heavy load to carry and I and I can tell that you're in a tremendous amount of pain.  I've been there and I know how tough it is, but I know with some work and commitment you can turn your life around. 

The only way to change things is to start and I think in your case you should pick just one thing a little outside your comfort and do that.  I like to recommend you try volunteering.  Look through your community for organizations that are looking for volunteer sign up and do that at least once a week.  Commit to at least 4 visits in one month.  After that, you can decide if you think you will benefit from it and continue or look for something else but commit to volunteering for at least 6 months.   Volunteering helped me so much when I was in a similar situation as you and I still volunteer to this day.  Helping others takes you out of your own mind just for a little bit and after you're done it just feels good. 

The second thing I can suggest is for you to start to develop a self-care plan.  It doesn't have to be very complicated.  Figure out something to do for exercise, whatever you like to do and do that three times a week for a minimum of 15 minutes.  Then when it feels right add something to it and then continue on like that.  Then start working on your diet.  Slowly start to incorporate more fruits and veggies into your diet, then slowly take away things that may not be the healthiest for you.  If you don't know how to cook then start experimenting with recipes.  Make sure you are getting an adequate amount of sleep.  Reduce the amount of screen time.

If that is overwhelming then break it down even further.  The important thing is that you just do something.  I know you can get out of this funk. Your whole life is in front of you, make it happen. ",2019-10-19 16:35:07

What inspired this topic and made me feel guilty was I could hear him spanking her HARD. **WHACK** and a moan. **WHACK** and a louder moan. I can hear her talking dirty. I can hear how fast he's fucking her because the bed creaks. I can hear them kiss (I assume not just faces). I hear *everything*.

And I feel guilty, because I enjoy listening to it entirely too much. I feel like I should leave when they're going at it, but 1. I don't want to, and 2. They bang it out at random times during the day, usually three or four times, sometimes more.

88,1kk9i0,False,,16,My mom is worse than a bill collector.,whatsbotheringyou,"Let me preface this by saying that for the past year or so I have been slowly, slowly working my way out of a mountain of debt.  I work in fast food while I am finishing up school, and money is unbelievably tight.  I'm not on any public assistance, and my paychecks only average about $430 every two weeks.

About a month ago, my mom was listening to me complain about how I couldn't afford to renew my license plates and I didn't know where I was going to get the money to do it.  My mom makes great money (If I remember correctly, 65K last year, and she has been working full time this year) She offered to loan me $200, which I was extremely grateful for.  However, ever since then, she will not quit hounding me about it.  Every time I have spoken to her on the phone it has ended in me bawling my eyes out, or her hanging up on me.  

She keeps saying ""Well I need that money, lolacherokee! I am so broke, your siblings need school supplies, etc."" This just pisses me the fuck off because just last week I went out with her while she shopped for new beds and mattresses for my brother and sister.  She told the salesman that her budget was 5K, and she was going to write a check.  She didn't end up finding anything she liked, so we left.  Just a few days ago she took one of my sisters to the mall, and she called me saying she had ""only"" spent $300 dollars.  

My mom grew up poor.  She knows how hard it is to make ends meet.  But she worked hard, was a frugal person, saved, and now she has something to show for it.  I can appreciate that.  However, I don't think she realizes that $200 she can make in five and a half hours takes me twenty three hours to earn.  

The icing on the cake today was when I told her I was hungry, she said ""well if you can afford to buy groceries, you can afford to pay me back.""  Actually mom, I have only been eating my free meals at work the past four days because I only had money for either me to eat or my cats, so I bought cat food.

They both have multiple tattoos all over, I have none, so I was a bit hesitant at first and said I probably wouldn't, even though they managed to strike a deal with the artist for a cheaper price if we all went together. I reconsidered and said yes a week ago, I wanted to, and they were both ecstatic. One of them tells me casually on our way to class that they decided to make the appointment tonight to get it done in another week or so. I was a little taken aback as I expected more time to decide on a design and everything, as I wanted something a little more ornate than them. I asked why, and she said that because of the various trips they were both planning (some of which we're going together on) and other tattoos, they should just go ahead and schedule it. I expressed that I was upset that they went ahead and planned it without mentioning it to me or taking my preferences into consideration, since this was something we were supposed to do together. She responds that ""I guess we just forgot you weren't involved in that conversation"".

They have ways they make money, but none are sustainable or consistent (thankfully they're not into mlms if that's what you're wondering, I'm just trying to remain vague). I see their roommates putting out their gofundme's for doctor appointments and fixing their cars. What does my friend ask for? Hobby supplies. New electronics. You get the idea. They have the nerve to try and blame every single one of their problems on the corporations and the government and what have you, and I get it. I'm anti-establishment, I wish I didn't have to work under a corporate-mandated system or kiss ass for my shitty paycheck but that's the only option I have. That's the only option most people have. And you know what? Some of those people end up moving out of their shit hole apartments and moving on to better places. It's broken, its backwards, but if it's food and Healthcare you need, you can't just wait around and hope that it'll be handed to you. I sympathize so deeply. There isn't a moment that I don't worry about what will happen to me if my current situation falls apart, but I'm not at people's doorsteps arguing about how privileged and gross people are because they live in a house instead of a rinky dink apartment. 

Cuz that's what my friend is doing. All they do is talk about how many meals they had this week and how they were soooooo pissed that they had to drive past a nice neighborhood to run an errand. Are you really that jealous and petty? They started making videos about and people called their bluff saying that not everyone they're angry at is a shitty, one-percent old white man who never knew poverty (and of course many were unkind and insulting but a lot of them were just honestly confused and hurt by their words). And what does my friend do? Screenshots their comments and talks about how much hate and ugliness they're getting from voicing an opinion. 

And honestly? I don't want to hear it anymore. I admire my friend's creativity and personality but this misguided (amd frankly hypocritical) hate is so much. And they have so many people rallied around them that if I so much as say that they're wrong that their friends and roommates will gather around and burn me at the stake.

However, I never have been in a relationship and even now when I got to college I am still single. I have managed to get several replies to me on dating sites like OkCupid and POF. A couple of them are mistresses who are looking for a submissive male and they seem really nice and attractive. I am currently talking to one of them but I am not so sure how the relationship is going. I never had a girlfriend before and this is kind of depressing for me. I would like to get a girlfriend sometimes soon because I fear that I will be forever alone in the relationship department. I have a hard time getting around since I do not have the available transportation. I want a girlfriend but I would like to know what are some tips on getting a girl to like you and go out with you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3k00om/i_am_21_and_i_never_had_a_girlfriend_before/,11,">Transpiration is the process by which moisture is carried through plants from roots to small pores on the underside of leaves, where it changes to vapor and is released to the atmosphere. Transpiration is essentially evaporation of water from plant leaves.

So I'm not really sure what you mean by you not having the transpiration... but anyways, if you want a girl to like you or something, don't focus on trying to get a girl to like you. Find something you like to do, join a club for that thing, do that thing, be confident in yourself. Girls will see that confidence and be drawn to it. And also don't get down about not having a girlfriend by 21. There are posts on here everyday about that same thing so it's not that weird. Also if you *do* like a girl, just ask her out.

I'm not so conservative (though prior to this year I hadn't done anything you can really call scandalous).  Anyway, last semester one of my guy friends asked if I wanted to have a one-night stand, and I said yes.  I was a virgin (which I told him) before that.  Anyway.  He was really nice and we messed around a few more times.

Then over Christmas break he texted me telling me that his therapist said he really shouldn't be messing around (I'd known he was seeing a therapist and that he tried to kill himself and was hospitalized last year).  So of course I didn't want to give him a hard time about that because I mean he's been having a shitty time anyway.

When we got back to school it was pretty awkward though (mostly my fault) but eventually we smoothed things over.  Then after about a month I saw him for an actual conversation for the first time since.  And he told me he'd tried to kill himself again.  I didn't tell the admin (DON'T GIVE ME A LECTURE I SWEAR TO GOD I'VE HEARD LIKE TWENTY ALREADY) but someone did and so he's at the hospital now.  Well he has been over a week and last year he told me he'd been there a week.

I'm worried I guess.  People just keep telling me like ""oh don't worry, at least you know he's safe"" but it's getting so annoying because YES I KNOW he's physically safe but I don't even want to think about how he's doing emotionally right now.

Now I know exactly how hard it is to be away from my best friends, family, and pets, and I am dreading having to leave them after only having a few short months with them. I don't adapt well to change, and for some reason college seems to be a hurdle I simply cannot overcome. Other people act so nonchalant about it, and I wish I could be like them.

I do have friends in college, but we're not as close and I think my sadness at being away from my best friends is causing me to have difficulty making and maintaining new friendships. I worry that my friends and I will grow apart, that we will all meet better friends and go our separate ways, and it's tearing me up inside. 

On top of this, I have strong feelings for a friend, and had many opportunities to express those feelings, but chickened out every time. In two days he will be moving ~1000 miles away to go to college. I know that ship has sailed, but it doesn't stop me from feeling deeply regretful.

I feel so overwhelmed. I wish I could just stop time. When I'm away at school I feel like I'm underwater-apathetically letting myself be carried any which way by the current, experiencing a muted, unhappy life and keeping myself going by thinking ahead to breaks and other times I'll see my friends.

So after nearly breaking down at the thought of living there for the rest of my life (I wanted to stay for my friends), I moved back home.

I guess I want to say from the perspective of having got to the other side, you can always move back. Four years is a long time but it goes by quickly. Many of the friends I grew up with have moved back or stayed local and some days it feels like college was a bad dream.

I felt like there was really something wrong with me being homesick as a senior in college (and some of my friends had seemingly forgotten about home by thanksgiving break freshman year), but I think everyone is different. It's perfectly reasonable to feel how you're feeling, to want to stick it out, to make whatever decisions you want to make.

&#x200B;

All I want is someone to watch endgame with

&#x200B;

Right now I'm on a greyhound in between Las Vegas and Magic Mountain, not even two hours into a six hour trip. It is 5:30 and we should reach the hotel by 9 pm. If I decide to post this, it'll probably have to wait until I get to the hotel. To be honest, I've had something to say here for a very long time, but I didn't want to talk about it in case I was wrong. But I'm not wrong about what I feel.

I'm writing this in Notepad on my laptop, so apologies for random line drops.

It's a Senior end of school trip, and I know everyone's name just as well as they know my name. Yet, I am somehow just far enough not to be able to talk to my own clique -- Tom, Noah, and Anne -- and close enough to read their faces and hear their conversations. Who I would consider my three closest friends are sitting  just ahead of me in two rows of two seats. There is a fourth empty seat, but I can't sit there because the person sitting there, Noah, says he gets claustrophobic, and after knowing the kind of stuff he deals with on a daily business, i decide not  to challenge him on that.  So the people in my general vicinity are all listening to music and catching up on sleep, and I can't help but watch my closest friends on the bus ride of their life. I'm one of those kids that ends up moving schools a lot. I spent each year of  middle school somewhere else, and I'm graduating high school from the third  high school I've attended. It even cost me taking a calculus class since I kept switching curriculum's. Though I don't feel knew to the school, it's been only a year here since my birthday in march. Of Tom, Noah, and Anne, I've known each person for different amounts of times. Noah, i met first in elementary school, and met him here again after I had thought I said goodbye to him for the last time in middle school. A lot has happened to him since then and I'm still learning piece by piece. Tom, I met after shadowing him a week before I was enrolled in this newest school. We ended up having a near identical schedule except for Latin, so it was pretty easy to become friends with him. We even became Public Forum partners and took our skills to a tournament in Arizona. And then there's Anne. I knew Anne by name when i first started  going here, but it was only since the beginning of this school year that I  started talking to her more. Between us, we are the only seniors on the speech and debate team, meaning it was pretty easy for us to keep close. But then there's this curse that anyone who's always switching schools carries: the moment you truly feel close, you're on your way out the door. In this case, we left for Magic Mountain right after a college declaration assembly in which Noah said he'd go to UNLV, Anne to SUU, Tom to Washington State, and myself to UNR. These are our last moments, and I can only watch them. The worst of it is that I never even felt like a close friend to these people, rather just the  fourth guy that showed up one day. To them, I feel like only a PF partner, only a Speech and Debate teammate, and nothing more. 

All I wanted was someone to watch endgame with. It's been I think three weeks,  and not one of us four had gotten around to seeing it. Because it's about the end of the school year now, AP exams finally out of the way, I thought we could see Endgame together. I asked Tom first, but he told me he was busy. I'm always left to assume with him because he's always busy and then I ask him Monday how his weekend was and he'll tell me he didn't do anything. I was on my way to ask Noah second, but I didn't even bother with him. He got into really bad trouble  that kicked him off the Debate team and his mother doesn't let him leave the house anymore unless it's a mandatory school event. And then Anne. Now if I can take a second to be fully honest, I am in love with Anne. It's not just one of those teenage crushes you get every 7 seconds you spend with a cute girl you wish you might hang out with more often. I know, because I swore off that at the beginning  of the school year, and every second with her, the thought never crossed my mind. I only realized how I felt about her when we hung out at prom. I told her that I  wished I asked somebody, anybody, out to prom and she asked me who, and I didn't  respond because in my mind, I was about to tell her ""you."" Anyways, I ended up asking everyone else, kept getting the same answers, and ended up watching the damn movie by myself in the dead of night at some little theater out of a casino. I'd give it an 9 out of 10. I really liked the scene where Steve Rogers picked up mjolnir. Tom already dated another ex of mine this year. Jane. Last year, I took Jane to  Junior prom, and we lasted about about two months after that. For the longest  time, Tom and Jane were always fighting with each other, Jane being Chinese, Tom liked to show her pictures of Tienanmen Square and say ""That's you, lol."" I don't know why they decided to forget all that for six months to have some sort of show-up romance. I actually don't take it personally, but it really bothered me because Jane was still uncomfortable talking to me and wanting to take Tom away from me so that they'd have more time together. That's why I'm scared that the more time they end up spending together, the more likely they'll be dating when I finally say something.

That's why I've made a promise -- and I don't make promises too often -- to tell Anne before the bus ride home Friday morning. Now there's another three hours left to the hotel. I can only hope I have a chance to talk to her some more when we get there before.

702,1k3frh,False,,19,"Wasting money on buying clothes that I like, but then society/my mother/myself makes me embarrassed to wear it.",whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry this may be long.
This has been an on-going problem for me.  Ever since I started to develop and mature into a woman, I outgrew my ""Junk Foods"" T-shirts and tried to find trends that I liked/were somewhat popular in the times.  However, I've grown to dislike certain aspects of clothing, such as: sheer clothing (I don't like to layer, though I've forced myself to for years), things that show imprints of what you're wearing underneath (tight pants show underwear lines, and my mom won't let me get thongs, or bra lines that show against shirts), long sleeves (I end up rolling them to my elbows), too tight/too loose shirts, lots of cleavage, shorts that are too short, really skinny and really flare jeans, etc.  I don't know why these bother me so much, but it really limits what I buy.  

But I could live with my stunted clothing choices if my mother didn't come into play.  I love my mom, and I value her opinion in my life.  Since I still live with her, and have not gone into college yet, she has a lot of say when it comes to clothing.  And it's not the typical, ""don't wear that demeaning clothing"" because I don't like the new daring trends.  She pushes me to wear ""pretty"" or ""sophisticated, trendy"" clothes of today.  And it's weird because I look at the clothes and think ""I might actually look good in/like these"" but then I get uncomfortable.  I don't know why, but I think it might be due to my mom's past criticisms of my clothes or the fact that I've dressed basically one way for my entire life, and if I changed people would notice.  I would often wear a t-shirt and jeans for school, but right on the way out of the door she would look at me in disgust and say ""you're going to wear that? wear something nicer."" So that puts me off when it comes to the clothes I like.

When it comes to the clothes she likes, I think that if I wear them, people at school and people I know would comment with something like ""I've never seen you wear clothes like that, etc"" These could be things like skirts, nice blouses, or layered cardigans.  I think I would enjoy them, until I realize people would take notice, which somehow makes me feel uncomfortable wearing them.  Also, if I do wear them, I get uncomfortable in public, and begin to take off layers and change pieces throughout the day until I'm basically at a bare minimum when it comes to jewelry, layered clothing, uncomfortable shoes, makeup (which I never wear btw) and etc.

Sorry this has been long.  Basically, I spend too much money on buying clothes I like, my mom likes, and new adventurous pieces that I end up not wearing because I realize I dislike the fashion, my mom puts me down for wearing such things, or that society would take notice.  I don't know what to do, and this is especially killing me since school is coming up.

Part of maintaining them involves being outspoken and, if necessary, confrontational. 

I've found that, for myself, viewing grudges as allowing others to have control over me helped me let go of grudges most of the time.

A grudge can change how I respond to others. It can influence my decisions and cause me pain. How does that help me? How does it further my goals for myself? How does it move my will from daydreaming into reality? If it doesn't (and in my experience a grudge never helps with those things) then it's restricting me. In holding that grudge I'm letting someone else have power over me.

That's fuel to propel me away from holding a grudge but it doesn't necessarily stop me from holding one. Actively letting go of a grudge is very personal and I do not have a road map for it. Hopefully you find this mindset helpful. It helps me let go of grudges and avoid letting them happen in the first place. ",2020-05-09 01:00:19

3,1k3sis,False,,15,Girlfriend of Last 5 Years Passed Away,whatsbotheringyou,"Hello everyone. Long time reddit user here, first time posting. So I'm sure the title pretty much explains everything, but I'll try and give a backstory that isn't too lengthy, or gives our personalities away.

So I met my girlfriend (ex?) my freshman year of college. Both of us were involved with other people at the start of college, but our paths crossed and started dating Junior year of college. We're both involved in the performing arts and I've been working shows here in NYC and throughout the country, and she's been singing on cruise ships. Long story short, we both said that we would make our relationship work as best as can while we're away from each other. It worked....magically. Both of us were working in our fields of work, but unfortunately away from each other. She got offered the last ship she hadn't worked on, which would've meant she would've traveled to every continent, and practically everywhere worth visiting.

I told her not to go to the last ship in hopes of starting things earlier, but of course I wasn't going to prevent her from seeing the world. We both agreed on holding until September of 2013, where we would move in with each other and both promise that we'd both work in NYC. Unfortunately, she passed away within the first month of working her last contract. This happened 6 months ago, and they still have no idea what was the cause of death (they've ruled out suspicious activity, and are leaning towards natural causes.....she was 24 years old and perfectly healthy).

Fast forward some, it's been 6 months, her birthday is.....very soon, and we're drawing nearer to the date where we were supposed to move in.

I'm very lucky and have had ZERO experiences of anything remotely like this happen (both of extremity, and dealing with death). I guess what's I'm throwing out there is....

Is there anyone out there that has dealt with something remotely close to this? I don't want to get into specific details in the intro, but god damn.....this is just ridiculous, especially with her having passed at 24, and me being 26.

Has anyone out there dealt with a similar situation? I've went to therapy twice and pretty much thought it was a waste of time, and was very open to my thoughts and my 'ideology' on therapist sessions. This was during the second month, and I'm going on Wednesday for the first time since then. Love you guys and everyone who has to read this, thank you.

DM",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1k3sis/girlfriend_of_last_5_years_passed_away/,62,"I dealt with a similar situation :


- Your age more or less
- Girlfriend died just before living together after a period of long distance relationship
Not much hinsight though since it was a few month ago but here is my strategy.

Carry on with life and try to make the best out of it until the final day. Concerning possible culpability for the future (fading memory, someone else coming into my life), I understand that these feelings will eventually come. Therefore I try to make a work of prevention on myself accepting life and the human condition: death will come one day or another so why make it sooner. Since I accept the time I have left why not try to live it fully while I'm here ? In a way culpability would mean my life mentally stopped when my girlfriend died which is not the case. This point makes culpability somehow absurd and is enough to be reassured, for the moment.

I hope you will find the strength to go on, I strive to.

Maybe you have some tips I didn't think about, I would be glad to hear it :) ",2013-08-10 19:58:32
845,d72jbz,False,,1,My mom thinks I won't be able to keep a job because I changed hobbies,whatsbotheringyou,"So last night my parents asked where we prefer they move for retirement and I told them they need to move wherever works best for them. They said what if I'm still living with them and I said ""what, you guys are moving within the next two years?"" And they said ""no probably in eight years."" These people think I'm gonna be living with them in 8 years?! I already have plans to move out after community college (lucky enough that they're letting me live at home), or maybe even while I'm in it (depending on when I get hired as a sheriff service officer since it takes at least nine months).

I tell them all this and my mom says ""well you change your mind a lot so."" I said that's for hobbies and she's like ""well you don't wanna do orchestra anymore so."" I said that's a hobby and having a job would be different. She said ""you can't quit a job right away just cuz it feels awkward or something."" I said that I'm quitting orchestra next semester because I'm *burnt out* from my former *passion* which is why I'm not gonna have my passion be my job so I don't get burnt out and want to quit or be miserable anyway or whatever. Plus I'm doing orchestra for the rest of the semester anyway and I do/have done other things I didn't wanna do anyway so why wouldn't I do that with a job?

She thinks that because I don't wanna do violin or orchestra anymore that means I won't be able to keep a job ever and I'll be living with my parents for *eight years* because of it. Wow. Ignore all the shit I'm doing to be more responsible and be able to live on my own and provide for myself, and pay attention to my fucking hobbies instead (she also brought up ASL cuz I was super into it at first but not anymore).

Then she brought up I wanted to be a musician but not anymore, and I told her I decided not to cuz it's not as realistic and I probably won't be able to support myself that way (on top of losing passion and stuff) so I decided something else. I dropped an unrealistic career for a more realistic career, but since I changed at all that means I won't be able to keep a job.

My dad was on my side luckily. He said that I'm right about a job not being a passion and just being something cool. He also said that an SSO is a good job. Being supportive and encouraging basically, instead of doubtful like my mom. I'm finally starting to get a solid and reasonable idea of my future and it feels like she's trying to tear me down.

I hate how my mom thinks I can't even move out of the house because my hobbies change. When I still did violin she had no second thoughts on anything,  I ditch violin and suddenly I'm gonna move out of state with them in 8 years still living with them and probably unemployed.

56,frechs,False,,2,"Dear life, please. Get better.",whatsbotheringyou,"I do honestly feel like I am going crazy right now.

I know that right now is strange time for everybody But I feel like for me everything is going down way worse.

So basically my university got shut down around three weeks ago. The Monday after it got shut we got a message that one of our fellow Professors we had lessons on Friday with, is Corona positive.
I showed some symptoms of Coronavirus after that but still did not manage to get a test done, since I am very low in the queue of my local doctor. 
By now I'm feeling better but not with my mental health.
The thing is that I have been writing an exam around one month ago and i really feel like that I messed it  up. I will get the results on the second of April, however I really feel like I messed it up. If I mess up that exam when I will lose my job.

So basically before this whole Corona  shit started i was already mindfucked. Problem now is that my girlfriend did not really support me. At that time we have been a couple since one year and eleven months. On the first of April we would be a couple for exactly 2 years.
However since around that time she is trying to meet up with her old friends and stuff which is good and all but I wanted her to be there for me in the time when I felt really like shit.
Which she obviously wasn't. 

Ever since that day things have changed quite a lot for worse. 
As of right now we are not a couple anymore but we are not broken up. We are basically doing a break.
In the past few days we have been calling each other and we really had want talk when we were really talking about having sex together again and  we would love to see each other again which was not possible because I was in Quarantine. 
Quarantine ended on the 27th  of March, however I'm really feeling very very very bad in the past few days because I do not enjoy gaming anymore. I have been gaming since I was 11 years old, which is 9 years ago.
I don't have to go to university anymore and I cannot see anything or basically i have nothing to do.



So my problems right now: i have a girl that I love more than everything but I don't think that she loves me anymore.
 I'm probably about to lose my job and since I don't enjoy gaming anymore i feel like I'm going crazy because I have absolutely nothing to do during the day. I have been doing sports in the past three years and I'm still doing it but since Coronavirus is there at the moment there is no possibility for me to do it outside and you know I cannot train everyday at my home.

I really just hope that there's something in the next few days that will cheer me up again. Because of right now I am hoping that the second of April all the first of April will do something for me.

Maybe the first of April will do something for me because that would be the day for me and my ex girlfriend when we would be a couple for exactly two years. 
Second of April might do something for me because then I will get the results. That will let me know if I have to start everything all over again, with studying and so on. 

Don't get me wrong if I lose my job right now I have something else that I will study and it's no problem at all. It's just that I really want life to get better by now.

797,1sfvc6,False,,8,I'm starting to feel lonely,whatsbotheringyou,"Hello, first of all, thanks for taking your time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I'm a man, 24 years old and never really had a girlfriend. I've dated a few girls once in a while but it never got serious and never lasted long.

I was really ok with that in the past, I haven't really felt the need to have a relationship as I see most people do, I always tough that I'll have someone worth it when its time.

But obviously you cannot choose who you have a crush on. As far I remember, I had 7 big crushes, basically one each school grade or new job during the last years.

The problem is that I never knew (in fact, I still don't know) how to deal with a crush, I remember always pretending I was talking to her and planning to, on the next day, finally talk to her but ended, on the last moment, doing nothing and feeling disappointed with myself for that and every time it happened I hurt myself a little more.

I feel like all this happened because I was afraid to lost a real good friendship which caused me to never know what exactly to say, I'm really introvert and don't talk much, so when it comes to talk about my feeling I normally freeze and no word comes out. When it comes to talk about something else, I have no issues at all, even when I have to talk or perform something to a crowd.

After all that I think I learnt how not to have a crush on someone to not hurt myself, it's about 3 ~ 4 years since the last one and I was still ok with that until now.

I'm starting to feel the need to have someone closer to me, to hug someone not just to compliment, to share some laughs, to discover things together (new good musics, places, movies, books, ...), to enjoy someones else company. 

I always see happy couples having a good time together doing all that things mentioned before or just by enjoying each others shoulder/nap and want the same.

I'm not hasty, I know if I push to hard for it to happens it might be a bad experience and that's exactly what I don't want right now.

Besides that I have absolutely nothing to complain about, I have a really good family, I'm healthy, so are my family and friends, just finished college last year, have a good and stable job, no debts, ...

The only thing I want for now is this anguish to go alway from my chest, that's all.

It was for the best, but I'm having a hard time staying positive now that I'm single. I'm a college student (undergrad). I've always been overweight, but over the past 2 years I've lost over 100lbs. I've been hitting the gym more often since the breakup just for something to do. I'm still overweight, but I'm working on it. I try very hard to dress up every day and make myself look my absolute best for classes, the dining hall, etc, because I'm seriously so anxious that I will ruin my chance to find someone new if I ever for even one second look too frumpy. I've made it a personal policy to try new things and talk to as many people as I can. I've even gone out to a couple of bars on the weekends with some friends to try and meet somebody.

All I really want right now is companionship. I really want to go out and date somebody, even just make new friends to talk to. Hell, I'd just like someone to text me now and again and make me feel like I'm loved by someone, instead of me always having to initiate conversations and feeling like a burden as a result. I'm frustrated because it isn't happening. I do understand that the world doesn't just make friends/boyfriends appear, but I'm just scared that I threw away the only person who was willing to put up with me, my personality and my weight, and now I'll be alone forever. 

On top of this, I have a lot of anxiety related to school stuff (applying for internships, scholarships, finals coming up etc) that is really eating away at me. I've been so emotional lately that it's getting in the way of me getting things done.  What can I do to stay focused on what's really important (school), without feeling depressed? Also, with winter break approaching, I'll be moving back home for 6 weeks, and the prospect of being completely isolated for that long makes me extremely unhappy. My school friends live too far away to see them regularly, and I don't feel comfortable asking them to skype me all the time because I'll feel so needy and gross when they're trying to enjoy their home-friends. I just don't know how to be happy by myself anymore. Any advice is welcome.

341,1xy826,False,,5,I'm a failure,whatsbotheringyou,"Two mays ago, I graduated and soon dated a wonderful young girl.  I had quite a few close friends, was in a band, had great grades in high school, and life was pretty great.  This was probably the highest part of my life.  I then went to college, and didn't really meet anyone who stuck around to stay in touch with me.  Guess I never had much to say and didn't have strong enough interests to get involved in things.  

Anyway I guess I became depressed or something, and my mind became restless with weird existential thoughts.  Everything felt pointless, from classes that didn't interest me in the slightest to making new friends since they would be gone from my life like my old ones to even my then girlfriend, whom I cared about more than anything.  Just knowing that it would end made me crazy.  

So then, in whatever weird mental state I was in, I essentially gave up.  I failed two classes and was kicked out of university.  I pretty much lost touch with my former friends, and I became bitter and shitty, which ruined my relationship.  

There's worse stuff out there in the world no doubt, but I'm a spoiled white pos so this is all I've known.  

Turns out I was terrible at breaking old habits, and had to withdraw from another course and the tech school that I went to the next fall.  At that point I started seeing a doctor for depression, but both medications I received didn't have a noticable effect, and my mother seemed to think I was feeling better over Christmas break so we agreed to cancel future appointments.

I got off to a bad start this semester too.  If I have to withdraw this class again I don't even know what comes next.  

This is obviously all my own fault but it drives me crazy.  Just the tip of the iceberg.

Also it blows to come home, visit your grandparents (of course that part was nice) and then they show you that your ex is on the front page of the local newspaper essentially for being an exceptional musician.  It's good to see that she is just as amazing as ever and I didn't hold her back, but goddam I would kill to be part of her life again, just to cheer her on and watch her grow.  If I somehow just knew that I could've had some kind of lasting relationship I think it would've been enough to hold it all together.

Anyway, incoherent rambling beside, I just don't know what to do

there's enough stuff troubling to write about for days, and I guess I just am not strong enough to cope with it or keep it internal and not affecting my other aspects of life

0,1jy7px,False,,41,I was raped and I don't know to fix it.,whatsbotheringyou,"I recently went away on a family holiday. My cousin and I decided to go out for the night just the 2 of us. Everything was going great and we had a nice catch up as I hadn't heard much from her since I've been away at Uni. She was very drunk but I'm used to dealing with that so it didn't matter. I wasn't drinking as I've been having trouble with my breathing and didn't wanna be drunk when an attack came on in case I couldn't sort myself out. Again, not a problem.

My cousin is single and so did meet a few guys throughout the night, however I have a boyfriend so when she was making out with a guy I'd usually just talk to his friend or someone nearby and met plenty of lovely guys and girls. Until 2 guys came over to talk to us. She immediately got off with one of them and I was left talking to the other. He seemed nice enough and I told him about my boyfriend, he had just gotten out of a relationship, told him about my new flat, he had just started renovating his own, told him about my pets etc etc. 

Then my cousin decided she wanted to move on, but they followed us to the club and the guy my cousin was with insisted on buying her drink - he then asked me what I would like. I've always been very cautious about people buying my drinks but since I was only drinking water - what could go wrong? When I saw that vodka and redbull was being poured for me as well I turned to point it out to my cousin and she just shrugged it off and said it was probably easier to order the same for everyone. I agreed and thought one drink isn't going to mean I won't be able to pull myself together if my breathing fucks up. 

From then it's a blur. I remember a brief moment of waking up and I was in a hotel room and this man was on top of me. It was the most horrible feeling. Like my brain was working but my body wasn't. I couldn't feel anything happening to me but I just know something did. I attempted to move to push him off but I couldn't control myself and my arms flopped to my side and I was out again. I was woken up by my cousin around 9am, still feeling rough. I didn't know where I was. There was a man sleeping in the corner and the main door was open for some reason. We some how managed to run and I don't remember how we got to the cab but my cousin told me we went to reception to ask for one. It was all still a bit hazy and so we didn't think to look at the hotel and the room number. 

Eventually we pulled up at the villa. We both felt sick, numb, ashamed and just decided we didn't want to tell anyone. Everyone assumed we just had a crazy night out and we left it at that. The last 3 days of the holiday it wasn't spoken about at all.

As soon as I got back home I broke down to my boyfriend and told him happened. He's still the only one I've told. But I feel like a horrible person. I've only ever been with 2 people both of whom I was in a long term relationship with - 1 being my current boyfriend. And I was always proud of that, but now I've had it forced upon me and that's ruined it. I feel angry and dirty. I feel numb, embarrassed, just so horrible that I accepted that one drink despite it not being what i asked for, and now my boyfriend isn't the only one I've been with in this relationship. 

I haven't left the house yet and my boyfriend works full time so I've been alone a fair bit. I keep just breaking down wherever I am in the flat and drop to the floor crying, until I remember I'm not that weak anymore and manage to pick myself up. But this is just a cycle and it's not fixing anything. I don't know what to do. For myself or my boyfriend. He needs help as much as I do and whilst i have him to comfort me and tell me it will all be okay, that doesn't work for him and I don't know what to do.

316,g5g4n3,False,,21,I need advice on a really difficult situation.,whatsbotheringyou,"This is incredibly personal and long and I made a throwaway account just to get it off my chest, I’ve tried to omit any identifying details because of the nature of my story, but I had to get this out and honestly I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because really, I’m not the one who needs sympathy here. I have a dear friend, we’ll call him Noah, who has a twin brother we’ll call Jamie. I’ve known Noah and Jamie since we were children, we grew up together and our mothers were friends before Noah and Jamie’s mom died when they were teenagers, they lived close to us and we were always together as kids. We went to school together, and they are both wonderful people, but Jamie is very sick. He started acting “strange” when he was a child, Noah says it was around 7 or 8 that the family started noticing it.

Sometimes he would say things that didn’t make any sense, or respond to something no one had said, or laugh at completely inappropriate times. He was screened for asperger’s and other types of disorders on the autism spectrum, but it was determined that his issue lay elsewhere. He was diagnosed with disordered schizophrenia at the age of 16, and by that point he was not doing well at all. He and Noah had always been extremely close in that stereotypical twin bond sort of way - they always seemed to know exactly how the other was feeling, what they were about to say, even when they couldn’t possibly have known. Noah has always been fiercely loyal to his brother, to the point of getting into fistfights at school with kids who made fun of him.

They’re 30 now. Noah was dating a girl I’ll call Stephanie for almost a year, and he seemed happy with her, but she never liked Jamie. Jamie, when he was thinking clearly, went out of his way to avoid talking to Noah about Stephanie or interacting with her whenever his brother was around, because apparently she was really mean to him sometimes but he knew how much Noah cared about her and didn’t want to be the cause for his relationship crumbling. Jamie spent some time briefly institutionalized after a series of upsetting incidents in which he kind of lost it and ended up hurting himself during some kind of violent, screaming, terrified fit. Noah tried to explain that he wasn’t a danger to anyone, he’d just been so scared of what he thought he was seeing or hearing, but Jamie ended up in the hospital for several months.

So Jamie comes home eventually, and since their father is an asshole, Noah agreed to become Jamie’s legal proxy of care, being responsible for Jamie’s well-being entirely. Jamie moved in with him, he was taking his meds and going to psych appointments and seemed to be doing well. I would go over to their house and play video games or watch movies with them, and whenever Stephanie came over Jamie would just quietly retreat to his bedroom. Noah picked up on the tension between them, and asked Jamie about it, but Jamie insisted that he was just shy around girls and Stephanie made him nervous because he wanted her to like him.

One night about a month ago though, Noah canceled a date night with Stephanie because Jamie was having a bad, really depressed night. Noah curled up on the couch with him and made him eat something and put on his favorite movie and texted Stephanie to apologize and explain what was going on. She was absolutely furious, and she went off on him for it, but he firmly told her that his brother is always going to come first for him and if she can’t accept that, then they weren’t going to work, and hung up on her. She came over to his place a few days later to “make up” but the minute Noah left her alone with Jamie for a few minutes to run down the block and get something from the store, she pulled out some bullshit.

She told Jamie that he’s being selfish, that Noah’s entire life has always revolved around taking care of him and keeping an eye on him and protecting him and that deep down, Noah resents him for it. She told him that if he really loves Noah, he’d try harder to get his shit together and set Noah free from the burden of him, she said all kinds of terrible things and triggered a massive depressive period for Jamie. Noah couldn’t get him out of bed in the morning, he wouldn’t eat or shower or anything, and he’d been doing so well the previous day that Noah was like “Jamie, what the hell?” and Jamie cried and told him that Stephanie had been right, which led to Noah storming over to her apartment to scream at her like “What the fuck did you say to my brother?”

This resulted in a major fight between Stephanie and Noah in which Noah called her a bitch and told her that she’d had no right to interfere with his family business, and she was a piece of shit because she didn’t even care if she pushed Jamie into a suicide attempt as long as she got what she wanted, which was for Jamie to leave them alone. She told him that she’s the only person in their lives strong enough to be brutally honest with Jamie because everyone else is afraid of triggering him, and Noah told her that he didn’t want to see her ever again and came over to my place to cry on my shoulder.

The thing is though, I get it. I get why Stephanie was frustrated, even if she was an asshole to do what she did. I know it must have been hard to be in love with someone and have their entire life dominated by someone who needs him so much and so constantly. I know it must have sucked to have Noah always canceling dates and things that were important to her because his brother needed him. I know it must have been hard to have Jamie there with them all the time, just sort of hanging out when she’d wanted alone time with her boyfriend. But I also know that Noah could never be with anyone who didn’t love Jamie too, and who didn’t understand that Jamie is always going to be his priority.

The problem now is, we’re all in each other’s mutual group of friends. There has been a lot of shit talking and taking sides and everyone is splitting off into smaller groups now because it’s awkward for all of us to hang out. Stephanie has a lot of support, because apparently Jamie being 30 years old means that he needs to get his shit together and stop relying on his brother to be his support system, and Noah absolutely refuses to entertain the notion of sending him back to his psych facility. Personally, I’m with Noah on this one, none of our other friends have a twin and none of them could understand. Jamie is literally all Noah has, but things are really weird and tense between everyone now and I don’t know how to fix it. I hate how things are right now, especially with all of us quarantined so we can’t all just get together and talk this out in person. 

Noah is a mess, and desperately struggling to deal with maintaining his brother’s schedule and well-being while dealing with losing his girlfriend and about 75% of his closest friends all at once, and he’s been leaning pretty heavily on me for emotional support. On top of all of this, Jamie has been extremely depressed ever since the night with Stephanie, and no one can pull him out of it, which is awful for him and making things harder on Noah. He is trying so hard to be strong and pretend everything is fine and normal for Jamie’s sake, but Jamie knows him too well and he feels incredibly guilty. Any advice on how to deal with this situation, or help either of them, would be really appreciated.

I wish I had some magic words of wisdom for all three of you. I really don't like Stephanie, I'm sorry. There is frustration, and then just plain mean/selfish. She falls into the latter category.

These days I'd be more interested in a Star Trek universe, where it seems everyone is allowed and encouraged to seek self-actualization. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs 

The Star Trek world is like an open game world where you can choose any path that freedom sounds nice. On the other hand in a star Wars scenario we feel we are compelled to throw ourselves and all our energies into a fight to protect all we love and value.

Fiction, sci-fi and historical are popular and universal because it is human nature to imagine other worlds. Some better and some worse. This is biologically adaptive. 

If you feel overly sad about living in this time, place and environment look for ways to make it more rewarding by comparing and contrasting what you would like with what is. See if this can help you make the here and now more fulfilling.

Soon after this decision I realized how much I was holding in and the need to talk about my issues.

I also tried running, playing an instrument, journaling, paying attention to proper nutrition, focusing on my schoolwork, focusing on my sleeping habits, meditating, hanging out with my friends more, and getting out of my house to break routines all while receiving help from my doctor and counselor.

565,1z7usg,False,,5,"I don't confront my problems, I feel like crap all the time and I lost my mother a week ago... (Long post)",whatsbotheringyou,"Hello. I am a 21 year old male who's in a weird situation at the moment. I spend a lot of time in front of the computer, I drink too much coffee and I don't get enough sleep. I also spend too much time by myself. I think I'm addicted to the internet and isolation.  

I've been doing this since I was fourteen, but I had a big breakthrough two years ago. I decided to become a better person and I did something about it. I started to work-out, eat healthier, take risks and be more social. The ""golden era"" ended last summer. I don't know how, but I gave up all of a sudden and went back to my old habits. 

I know that I'm being an irresponsible, lazy brat who's not doing anything productive, and I know that I should do something about it, but it feels like my motivation and sense of responsibility have disappeared. It's as if my common sense and my decision-making hate each other. It doesn't help to know that I should get out of my comfort zone and take small steps toward progress every day. I've tried that and it usually ends with that I give up after two or three days.

I also lost my mother a week ago (which sucks a lot by the way!!!). She had been struggling with cancer for nine years, and she got really sick in November. The doctors told us that she only had two months left in December. Me and my family spent as much time as we could with her. I feel that I didn't do enough to show how much I appreciated her, even though I helped her a lot, talked with her and was told that I did a good job. I was tired most of the time (due to my habits) and I didn't get to say all the things I wanted to say because of that. 

My shitty computer-coffee-staying-up-late-addiction/habit ruined my last months with my mother, and it sucks to know that I did that towards her. I *think* she appreciated the help she got from me and my family, and my emotional state *might* affect my perception of reality, but still: How could I be that selfish and useless?! 

My mind has been a beehive for the past couple of months, and I'm worried that I'm about to get a mental disorder or something. I've been to a therapist several times, but she thinks I'm fine. Baaaaaaah... Sorry about the long rant. 

Anyways; I would appreciate any advice on how to become less lazy, self-absorbed and self-destructive, and how to cope with the death of a loved one. 



",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1z7usg/i_dont_confront_my_problems_i_feel_like_crap_all/,14,"Well, I've totally been there. In fact I still am, but slowly making baby steps out of it. So I guess I can relate. I have spent the last 2 years basically in front of a screen, gaming addiction, reddit addiction, internet addiction. I have alienated almost all of my friends(oh, who am I kidding - all of them). I just stopped interacting with people, even online. I couldn't post on reddit for a while(I still am a little scared to post btw). And motivation? What's this? I almost went broke after almost a year unemployed and was considering homelessness for the fear of interacting with people to get a job. 

But enough about the past. This post should be uplifting and motivating and stuff. :)

So, what helped me, OP? I'd like to tell you one day I woke up and decided to change for the better, but that would be a lie. It happened gradually, with many ups and downs. One day I'd be all excited and vigorous, the next - back in the pit. Go for a jog 3 days in a row, make a post on reddit, check job postings, get outside, felt the sun and the air and everything's so fresh and beautiful. The next day - back in the pit, back to self-doubt and anxiety, back to the complete lack of any desire to do anything. 

But you know what happened after a while? The uplifting sprees got longer. I stopped smoking and started some mild exercise(like seriously mild), changed my diet a bit. Of course, there were days, when I got back to my pit, days I ate shit and didn't move from my chair. But as I said, you just keep going. You learn to forgive yourself, to love yourself, to be patient. What would you think if the person you loved failed from time to time and needed support? You'd support them and still love them. So why go hard on yourself? Don't set yourself impossible goals and don't punish yourself for failing. Embrace failing, failing is a part of the process, it means you're trying. 

Also, if you are afraid or not very good talking with people(I am incredibly bad and the 2 years of isolation certainly didn't help), you can try volunteering at a retirement home. It certainly helped me a lot. The people there do most of the talking and you can learn to read body language and to observe. Also the stories you'll hear will give you perspective on how young you are. You can literally do whatever you like, strive for whatever goal you want the next 5 years, fail, and still have the time to start again, twice. Time is on your side. So be patient with yourself. Get to know the person in the mirror and find out what you both want. And then when you are certain and when you have forgiven your past you, when you love the present you unconditionally, then you can gaze in the future and start dreaming again. 

Good luck, and I sincerely wish you the best. I believe in you and want you to find the strength to become the person you want to be.  ",2014-02-28 22:41:24

She's diagnosed with stage four lung cancer on Saturday. They do a biopsy on her lung and a petscan the next day. The nodules are the size of golf balls and are basically everywhere in her lungs. There was talk about chemo and how they'll do and MRI on Monday to see if it spread to her brain.

She's exhausted and embarrassed because she couldn't breathe well enough in the MRI machine.  They don't mind, you can do it in the morning when you feel better. I tuck her into bed. It'll be okay, Grandma. 

Tuesday, they find two tiny spots in her brain. The doctors don't seem too worried. They decide to only go ahead with chemo instead of both radiation and chemo. We're told she can come home Wednesday.

She calls us from the hospital saying that they haven't told her when she can leave yet. Actually, hang on, the nurse has some news, call you back. We get her oxygen and room set up.  She calls back. She'll tell us what the nurse says when she's home. 

She comes home and our dogs are so happy to see her. She says they're smiling at her. We get her settled She's happy just to be home and to be in her own room. So what was the news, Grandma? 

They did another x-ray, just to compare with the initial one. The tumors are much larger. It's growing rapidly.

I would sometimes arrive home feeling like absolute shit and I would cry in my room and only come out for basic things. I haven't had much luck getting a girlfriend either and this always has bothered me and can bring me to tears just thinking about it cause since childhood all I've ever wanted to feel loved and have someone to love back, to be with me and I feel hopeless and scared of dying alone. in 2016 the bullying finally stopped but I was still a bit of an outcast. in 2017 I finally managed to get a group of friends who, to this day am still with. despite this, I was always the butt of jokes and got pushed around by them but I didn't leave them because I had no one else and they knew this too and took advantage of that. I became depressed and would cry myself to sleep almost every night. after some time I finally had a small light of hope come to me, I developed a crush on a girl and do to my lack of social experience I would do many weird and cringey things to get her to notice me (thankfully I've learned how to interact with people properly). the one normal thing I did for her was a poem I wrote. I took an entire week to write it, to make it perfect. then I gave it to her, it turns out she had a boyfriend, I was heartbroken and also felt ashamed of myself. I felt hopeless like no one would ever love me. my friends made fun of me for that it got so bad that one day I attempted suicide. failed. am not glad I failed, but neither would I want to do that again.my parents are religious and they think mental illness is stupid and that even if I killed myself I would still be a sinner in the eyes of God. my parents are not abusive thankfully, they are just ignorant I suppose, but it still hurt to hear that not even god cared about my problems. and by the way, I am male so my father telling me to ""man up"" is a bit of a problem.2018 was quite calm, my depression calmed down, my friends started to respect me more, not much but still something. I would often cry about past events though.now in late 2019, my first year of high school began, I made friends with this girl, she was by far the nicest anyone had ever treated me, she suffers from depression and anxiety and so we would relate to many of each other's problems. I have become close to her and also a bit attached. I deeply care about her and do everything to try and comfort her when she's down. it turned out she has a boyfriend but I have recently reached the point of loving her.

80,eb8wzu,False,,6,4 days clean from everything and it hurts really bad,whatsbotheringyou,"I’m 20 years old

I’ve been struggling for years now with major depression and I spent too long masking it and hurting myself even more with drugs 

I’ve never done “hardcore”  drugs but I used to abuse prescription amphetamines until about 2.5 years ago, with a one time relapse a year ago

After I quit those, I went straight to cigarettes then vaping which kept me hooked until a few months ago now with too many failed attempts at quitting to count (thank god it’s over now)

My most recent vice was using a LOT of Kratom on a daily basis (20-30 dollars worth DAILY) and while I was using that for about 6 months I didn’t go to class and failed all of my classes and finally told my parents (I still live with them) and they basically cracked down on my behavior by having me do more chores around the house and stuff to keep me busy

They aren’t the most empathetic people, but the mood I’m feeling at this exact moment is telling me they’re only doing the best they can to be pragmatic about it

I have a wonderful girlfriend that I’m in love with and if I need to break into tears, she’s there for me to do it. It hurts me so much to put that kind of emotional weight on her, and I try to curb it when I can. 

The bottom line I guess is that it’s my fourth day clean from anything but caffeine for really the first time in years now and they’ve been some of the longest days I can remember 

Maybe this is how days are supposed to feel, maybe I’m not supposed to zone out on some substance or another for hours on end until I eventually crash and repeat the cycle. I know I have to get used to this

Even though I feel lost as hell right now, there are some good parts of me coming back that I missed for a really long time. 

I don’t get angry when customers don’t tip enough because I won’t be able to pick up kratom and vape juice after work. I see dust on my shelves and spills in the bathroom sink. I can lay down and listen to music without having to have my hands busy at the wheel of my car or playing a video game. 

These moods come and go on a minute by minute basis, and have been doing so while I’ve been writing this. I think it’s going to get better. I think I’m in an upswing. My cravings scare me but I have to push forward.

544,2lp8my,False,Update,6,I Surrender,whatsbotheringyou,"TL;DR I got divorced, lost my job, burned through savings, and have completely run out of hope.

Today, I finally called to get help with my bills and expenses. This is the latest stop on an 18 month slide. Go grab a snack...

18 months ago this week, my wife of 8 years, mother of my 3 sons, gave me a letter for my birthday. The letter was many pages long, detailing every way I had made her miserable since the day we met. At the end, she gave me one week to move out of our home, or she would be taking the children and leaving. Meanwhile, she sat in her office and wrote a check to completely pay off her student loan, wiping out our entire savings account.

I moved out, begging for counseling, or at least a chance to understand what she was talking about (many of her examples of my failure to do anything right did not make sense and were clearly untrue).

I took my paycheck and some money my parents had sent for my birthday, found an apartment and enough Goodwill furniture to sit, eat, and sleep.

The shock wore off, she initially set 6 months as the break, then 2 months in I stopped to pick up my kids (I was seeing them almost daily then) and said, ""You're never asking me to come home, are you?"" She laughed and told me how much fun she was having, she had a realtor ready to list our home for sale, and said she'd be filing for divorce. A few weeks later, she followed through.

At this point, a lot of very close friends simply abandoned me. I cut a few off, they only helped make me more angry. I didn't blame them, it was their own shock, hurt, and empathy coming out poorly, but I didn't need more anger. The majority just quit calling, and I didn't blame them either. I wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Not a lot on my mind except this out-of-nowhere disaster. The few conversations I had with friends and family boiled down to, others have survived it and I would too.

Still, all was tolerable. I was still working, still seeing the boys almost daily, and as the first year passed, it actually wasn't bad. I took my tax refund and sent myself on a 10-day vacation to Europe because I'd always wanted to go. I bought a house because she wouldn't allow the boys to stay overnight with me in my studio apartment, and now they could. Our joint custody meant they were with me half the time, and actually a little more than that due to her work schedule.

Then I lost my job. I was told my position was being eliminated and that was that. I had no desire to contest, it was a miserable job, which made me so miserable I am certain in contributed to my divorce. So, I set out for a new adventure, sending out 3 resumes per day to jobs I was well-qualified for or even positions I had held before.

I had managed to rebuild some savings after my trip and house purchase and that got me through 2 months. Then I cashed out the modest IRA I had wisely set up many years before, and it lasted about 4 months. 

Now here we are today. My mortgage payment is a week late, I have a little under half of it. My electricity is due next week, might make it, but the furnace (set at 55) keeps kicking on. I realized last week my car insurance was due 3 months ago, but I let it slide because I can't pay it and eat or put gas in it to go job-hunting.

The divorce is dragging on. I've convinced myself she is stalling until I completely self-destruct, at which point she will demand full custody and move with the children out of the country (we're in the US). 

I have applied to close to 500 positions in the last 7 months, from my old job titles to entry level. I have had several professional job-search helpers and resume assistants. I have done everything every website says, even the ones that contradict the other ones. I have been referred for jobs by contacts within the companies with openings. I have had two interviews. One required me to work every evening and weekend (which translates to no custody of my kids) for $8/hour. The other, I just found out, opted for the other candidate. In total, I've had 4 responses to applications.

I have one friend. Leaving out all the Facebook buddies, who are quick with a Like and a happy comment every once in a while, not actually friends, I have been completely abandoned. I told my mother two days ago that I was scared, she has not replied. 

How and why has everything failed so completely? Hundreds of people I know could have stepped up to do something. They could have talked to my ex, tried to make her be reasonable. They could have helped me with a job. They could have called once. How did I manage to go from solidly middle-class a year and a half ago to food stamps and the beginning of losing my home and losing electricity and the furnace it powers? 

I can't stop thinking about how completely abandoned I am, how many people failed to help when I finally gulped down the shreds of pride that were left and cried out for help. I can't really put my best effort into job searching, because no, I don't believe Mr. Job Coach and Miss Resume Helper that THIS will be the one. I can't sleep because the furnace keeps kicking on and I know it's the last few days of heat. The only thing I do know is that I'm not suicidal because there's still one little scrap holding on that maybe, maybe, there's a way. I just don't want to wait any longer. I'm so tired.

Updated: Somebody added on their prayers or something, I got a great lead today, and I got scheduled for an interview. Not out of the woods yet, and even if I'm hired this week, it will be a lousy couple of months until the paychecks flow smoothly and things ease up, but it's something. A good leap from where I was the other night.

533,3m0vkk,False,,3,Broke up with ex-girlfriend of 6 years. Never will get closure or reconciliation.,whatsbotheringyou,"I broke up with an ex-girlfriend of 6 years a few months ago. I left her because I highly suspected she was cheating on me. I do not know this for sure, but all the suspicious behavior was there.

- She had stopped wanting to have sex with me. I had asked to start using Condoms because we had a bad close call with an unwanted pregnancy but that's not a good reason for no sex.

- She had started guarding her laptop and cellphone with her life, and would get upset if I even glanced at the screen when she was on facebook.

- We never went to bed at the same time anymore, and all of a sudden she always needed space, she was complaining I was always around.

- I been told that when you confront a cheater, they blow up on you, and my ex had quite a temper and would become very angry that I ""accused"" her of cheating.

- She would accuse me of cheating on her all the time, and I also heard cheaters will do this to cover their own guilt.

- She had been hanging out with this male friend more towards the end, and putting on make-up and stuff, plus working out more. 

To me it seemed she had moved on, and I kind of don't blame her, I had waited too long to confront a trauma disorder issue I had which caused me to quit jobs and break-down a lot.

However, I wish she had been more unfront about it, and until this day she denys she cheated, and I would have been more apt to believe her, and even apologize for accusing but, she never even tried to talk to me about it.

Anyways she texted me today after not speaking for two weeks, and I thought it was going to be the start  of working things out, but instead she told me to stop talking shit about her. I do not even know what she is talking about because I do not talk about her on facebook, with mutual friends or to her. 

If she does come up, its in brief passing. I don't know I am crushed because I really miss the woman, but in the end she still has the same flaws which is the inability to remain calm and solve a problem.

Why I am attracted to her, I do not know, but deep down I miss my best friend very much, our relationship may have been shitty but she was still the person I loved to spend my time with the most.

739,5qker7,False,,3,Trying to get my life moving where I want and my mom isn't helping,whatsbotheringyou,"I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables(perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

---

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make, and my coworker constantly make me feel inadequate. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving the quality of my life and well-being.

---

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications but so far no interviews (the response was today actually; I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all relevant jobs.

Now to what’s been bothering me. For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

the day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that fi it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom, and I haven't heard back from either of them since.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items; this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) that I’d only told a few very close friends of because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s blabbed about to others. I’ve basically decided to keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t remotely true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family.

edit: My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and what she had said to everyone else; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time I had mentioned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/5qker7/trying_to_get_my_life_moving_where_i_want_and_my/,11,"Jobhunting is really soulsucking and depressing.

422,fb9i5l,False,,4,The fear of getting fired,whatsbotheringyou,"I work a (shitty I guess in terms of pay and overall feel but not shitty because of the people/management) fast food job while juggling school. Work at a mall and hopped from one food place to another (whole different story). This one is infinitely better than the previous one. 

Couple of weeks ago, for the first time since I’ve gotten cashier experience, the cash register came up short 40 dollars. Don’t know how the hell it happened and it petrified me. Don’t know what happened but knew it was my fault 100% because I’m the only other employee there. Just 3 people total work there . They were, as expected, super cool about it. I offered to pay them back and they said no but I was ultimately stubborn and they took it.

This past Sunday was a shit show. It was short again. Don’t recall the amount that was said first because I think the owner said he forgot to put my tips of the day into consideration, but the end result ended up 5 dollars. Still just let them keep my tips (I insisted because they’re genuinely good people and it’s fine if I had fucked up) and like last time, came up with the 5. Doesn’t stop there though. To add a cherry on this shit Sunday, it was discovered that I knew the admin/owner/manager login to the register.

*No*, not for any scandalous reasons, I swear. Not like I can steal money knowing their login or edit transaction amounts. I knew it as to keep track of my credit card tips (I can see from my end when I get a tip and how much but not the total amount of tips I received) and to check the cash flow/how much is supposed to be in the register since in my end, I can’t see it. The first situation scared me shitless and I wanted to myself see where it was at and count it when I could. I also don’t have keys or anything to open the register, owner does. The only time the register is open is when I have a cash transaction. I was in lunch that day and noticed both of the owners (it’s a couple - that’s the “3 of us” part of this post) were outside and looking at the cash register screen. This is unusual because one of them is always outside to be out front and the other is in the kitchen. When it’s me out front, both are inside, doing everything inside the kitchen - prepping, cooking, washing dishes etc. Because of this, a bad feeling immediately washed over me and I feared I was short again, which would be confirmed true as I stated earlier. Once back from my lunch, I was going to see the cash flow and count to make sure it was all in there the next time I had a cash transaction. The login didn’t work anymore. They didn’t wait a day to change it or even confront me about it. They have had to see me login when I wasn’t looking because it was working fine right before my lunch and they were both out there. There’s literally no other reason as to randomly changing the login unless they somehow caught me logging in. Nothing was said to me and all resumed “normal”. 

It’s nothing major but it eats at me because I can only imagine how I must look to them now. Not only is the register short *again* but I knew their login? It eats at me because they’re good people. They’re nice. It’s a small business which is why the employee situation is the way it is and why I 100% wanted to give whatever money was gone, back. I only work two days (already have another job lined up to start in may so either way I’m leaving this place regardless but again, cannot stress how good people they are) so tomorrow is when I’ll finally show face again after all this. Nothing was said about firing or the login thing and the owner even said he’ll see me tomorrow at the same time when I was leaving. I’m just expecting the worst I guess and would hate to be fired when I hardly have anything to my name at the moment and am counting on this job to keep me afloat until at least May. My mind has been going mental gymnastics regarding the whole thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/fb9i5l/the_fear_of_getting_fired/,14,"Haha I can tell!

I can imagine it must be pretty stressful for you, sorry to hear that, but ultimately you have little ability to influence the situation - it is what it is, which I know is absolutely not helpful at all, unless acceptance that it may happen brings you some level of peace/reduces some stress.

I imagine you’re already doing this after the first time but try and check yourself if you find you’re being complacent with counting what you receive and give back as change, I get complacent all the time in some things and have to check myself. If no one took the money the only way it doesn’t balance is a systems issue or counting issue when receiving cash and giving change.

875,48vj2x,False,,1,I doubt myself too much.,whatsbotheringyou,"Hi.

I'm not sure if anyone else has ever felt this feeling but I suppose it has to do something with my low self esteem. For some reason I can't help but feel insecure about my relationships with my friends. I find myself doubting why people want to associate with me. Probably because I've been alone for such a long time, growing up, that I'm not used to this or perhaps it's because I don't understand, but..

I doubt myself at every turn. I don't want to. I want to believe that people want to hang out with me, but there's that voice in the back of my head that keeps going ""Why?"". I don't think I'm fun, in fact I think I'm rather cringey. I think I'm annoying.

I don't know, it's depressing me lately and I'd love to just believe but for some reason I can't.

It's tearing me up inside. Worse off, at the end of the day I feel like I'm not even needed.

I'm really not. I'm just a placeholder until people get bored. I fail to be interesting or show any knowledge of anything other than video games. I have a hard time picking up on things and am very slow mentally entirely. It's hard to not think that people are just being with me out of pity.

It hurts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/48vj2x/i_doubt_myself_too_much/,10,"You're totally fine the way you are! And even if your self esteem seems to be crushing you right now just know that other people seem to genuinely like to be around you. That's judging from the way you describe yourself, when you haven't said anything that makes me think that the reaction is coming from others. 


You'll get through it. You'll find friends and realize that they do care about you. You may already have those friends, but aren't admitting it to yourself. So, I hate to say it, but you'll likely feel bad for a while if that doubt isn't going away or seems to be getting worse, but hang in there and have as good of a time as you can. You'll definitely find a place to be happy. 


This is especially true if you're in high school or earlier. We're all cringey, even through college and beyond. The only difference is that some people know how to own that cringey-ness. So don't worry, be yourself, and enjoy the times you can! If you're feeling depressed when you're alone with your thoughts, but you tend to forget about it with your friends, then I think you're perfectly normal and liked, but may need to get deeper with your friends sometime to recognize that they appreciate you. If you're feeling bad all the time then I would still recommend talking to someone close, but don't be afraid to try exercising, getting into reading or movies, or anything else that will make you healthier mentally and physically. 


So, just to summarize, have healthy and deep relationships, be healthy, and be busy. Above all, remember that everything you're feeling happens to everyone else too, and it gets to some more than others. To me it sounds like you're a great person, but it's going to take you to convince yourself.  So feel better, we're all wishing the best for you.  ",2016-03-04 03:13:25

We had been a long distance all throughout highschool and she moved in with me while we went to college. I thought I was going to spend my life with this girl. But apparently she needed independence, and to grow, and to hang out(and fool around) with a guy who has a car. 

I don't know what to do. I helped her through so much. I saved her life. We were going to grow old together. I had my problems, I'm a bit of an introvert, and I spent most of high school at home, talking with her(lest she get upset) and didn't really learn how to fun outside easily. She had her problems, such as huge jealousy issues(which I overlooked) and anxiety

she still treats me the same(except in public, which I'm not allowed to show her any sort of romantic affection, but that fucking ass hat is), seems to be hurt that i'm hurting so much,
but that doesn't really change her plans much(aka hang out
with this fuckwit as much as she can)

i'm so broken, i don't know what to do, she was everything to me, she tells me I need a ""life"" outside her but I did have one, how is that supposed to change how crippling this is to me? i live with her
so i can't avoid her, when i'm away from her i break down, i've missed class because I can't get myself out of bed in the morning,
i've broken down at least once a day, i'm still a total sucker for her
and baby her when she's at home because I'm a fucking dope, right?

i'm so lost. i've tried to start improving myself(finally getting my license, which is due to insurance issues more than lack of want; and starting to diet and work out), do more things with her, but I
thought she'd understand that with my full time schooling(i'm at school 75% of the week) it's hard for me, especially with our conflicting schedules

I'm just, so so lost, i can't enjoy anything, i enjoyed breaking bad,
but i'm all caught up and there's nothing to see until sunday, I'm an absolute wreck, i can't even tell my mom, because I made promises to my ex that when she moved in with me that i'd make sure if we broke up her housing wouldn't be compromised because of it, and i know if my mom knew her rent would be jacked up, and the whole house would be tense, etc.

i'm just stuck. and it's impossible. i don't think i'd ever find
a girl i felt so perfect with, and i'm stuck like this in a nightmare
that I never wake up from, just resume the next day

He was awesome and saved me but sacrificing a 7 year friendship, long story, don't hate him.).

Shortly, after and right before the break up I didn't want to tell people about the troubles we had because I knew I'd only be telling one side and that people would give me bad advice because I could only tell one side. I BELIEVED I DESERVED IT. 

Sure, I was a bitch sometimes, I'd withheld sex a few times (I regret that), would become overly jealous occasionally. I learned from a therapist later that he was manipulating me into doing those things and behaving that way so he could he justifie his 'punishing' me. 

**REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE DONE IN THE RELATIONSHIP GET THE FUCK OUT.**

Seriously. You are too close to the fire to have a clear head. Walk away for a while, move out. Go live by yourself of with a friend, or a parent. Remove contact for a while and re-eval your life.

You are awesome, you do not need someone who is abusing you like this to make you happy. be selfish for a little while and do something that you've wanted to do that she wouldn't let you. reconnect with some old friends. Please, at the very least get out of there.

I am typically a very placid person and not aggressive at all, so when I was at a club on the Gold Coast of Australia and was ""king hit"" from behind for no known reason I just couldn't believe it had happened.
I didn't know the guy, speak 2 words to him or anything so when the police asked why he did it I couldn't give them an answer.
He fractured my jaw and smashed 3 of my teeth with over 10k worth of dental work I have to pay for (which I can't afford).

I struggle to befriend new people because I do not connect with them on an emotional level. People think I am cool initially but they never find me all that memorable. I really want to change that but I don't know how...

I feel like it is telling stories about myself when they are related to whatever we are talking about. But also I am just trying to find my emotional motivation behind things that basically make up my life. I imagine it is important for when people ask what major I am or why I chose to join the Air Force. And I just have no idea what my emotions are behind them. I started writing down what I believe my emotional reasoning/motivation behind what I do and I showed it to my friend and he told me ""You're kidding yourself with some of the stuff you said"" so I guess I don't know what my emotions are behind them- if I even have any. 

So as you can see I am a very logical person. Everything I do in my mind is just because of logic. It just makes sense for me to be an engineer and it just makes sense for me to be in the AF but I mean...at some point it must've started from an emotion even though of course both of those things will lead me to success in character and money-wise. Maybe I just need to evaluate what my goals are in life first?

Just a side note: I am a 20 year old engineering student in AFROTC who was put on zoloft about 6 weeks ago due to depression and anxiety. Although I am starting to think that zoloft is not the answer. I feel like I have difficulty concentrating and finding motivation and such because I have low dopamine, not serotonin.

Since you suffer from depression and anxiety, it would be a good uneducated guess that those conditions contribute greatly to your plight. Depression and anxiety can often cause people to ""disconnect"" from themselves and others. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia ) would be an interesting wiki page for you to check out. Part of solving this problem is relaxing. Almost laughable to tell someone with an anxiety disorder to relax, but unfortunately it's true. I also struggle with extreme depression and anxiety and it didn't get better for me until I started to ~breathe~. Just calm down. Don't force it. Don't let people's expectations of your emotions make you feel like you're lacking. Emotions are fluid, impermanent things and you can't feel them if you always fill yourself up with worry. It's taken me years to see little bits of progress (because I've done this on my own), but if you talk to your doctor and ask him for help or a referral to a therapist I bet you'll have more luck than me. There is no overnight or easy fix, but you *can* do it and it's not *as* hard as it seems.

Anyways, we went to the yearly county fair yesterday, I invited my best friend and her husband so they can finally meet this guy I couldn't seem to shut up about. Lets call him Jim. 

We're having a blast the entire day, then we all start getting hungry. Usually at county fairs here where I live, all the food is deep fried. I'm talking ""death on a deepfried stick"" ranging from deep-fried sticks of butter to Klondike bars deep fried with added whip cream & a cherry on top. He gets a donut covered 2-patty with 2-cheese burger. I go with the traditional mac n cheese grilled cheese sandwhich. My friend and her husband get their own food. I'm enjoying this cheesy heaven melt in my mouth when out of no where, Jim's hands is in my dish. I look at his plate and its gone... WE LITERALLY BOUGHT THE FOOD 3 MINUTES AGO.

At first I didn't mind because he took the side dish of my main meal. So I let it slide... but he kept eating it, and eating it, until there were no more sides left. I'm almost thinking in my head *this fuck-tard better not ask me for the rest of my heavenly cheese sandwich*... but he does... 

""You're not going to give me a bite?""
""No, you ate all of yours and my chips"" 
""really? But it looks so good""
""I know it does, which is why I bought it. Not my fault you ate yours so quick""
""well fine""

And I finished my orgasmic cheesy filled sammich. Out of the corner of my eye I see him, in shock. After last night, I am NEVER going out with him again.

I just moved back to my apartment from visiting home because my first day of my senior year of college starts in the morning. I was reluctant to leave because I kept having this funny feeling about going back. 

Since I got here several hours ago I keep crying because I’m so homesick and sad and I just want to go home more than anything. I miss my parents and my boyfriend so much and it really hurts. 

I’m scheduled for 35 hours at work this week which is going to put me behind on school work already on the first week of class. On top of that I don’t think I’m going to be able to keep up with my hectic schedule this semester. 

Feeling so sad and overwhelmed before school even starts gives me a bad feeling. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety problems before and I’m afraid this is the start of falling back into it which worries me. 

Despite how I feel it doesn’t seem like I can do anything about it since the semester is already paid for and my lease would still need be paid regardless of whether or not I moved home. I’m not even sure I’d be much happier moving home since living with my parents has its challenges. 

I guess the point of writing this was to get off my chest how unhappy I feel and to just acknowledge the fact that I have no clue what to do.

I still love her way too much, even after realizing that she was basically cheating on me (emotionally) with this guy for the last 1 1/2 months of our relationship. Even knowing that, I can't seem to let her go or move on from it. I haven't had any contact with her for 2 months now, and have deleted her #, texts, pictures, etc. I even deleted her off facebook almost immediately, but curiosity still gets the best of me every few weeks and I check out her page which has some stuff open to public view - that's how I'm seeing these pictures of the two of them together.

Anyway, there's a TON more to go along with all of that, but basically it has led me into a horrible spiral of depression that I can't claw my way out of no matter how hard I try. Some days are good, some bad, but it seems like there are WAYYYY more bad/""blah"" days than there are mediocre or ok days.

The worst part about it is that he lives halfway across the country (about 600 miles) from her (us), and she is somehow finding tons of time to go visit him (2 week trip this last time from what I heard), whereas she could hardly ever spend time with me when we were together.

351,1nf2ot,False,,6,My ex is back in my life...,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry for the long post... trying to summarize the best I can. 

One year ago I met this guy one night and we immediately hit it off. It started as a hook up and we just couldn't stay away from each other after that. About a month later I went 8 hours away to college. We Skyped every night and became really close and were dating, even though it was never official because he had some issues caused by his last relationship that he couldn't get over. 

Anyway, things ended around Christmas in a huge fight and we went 6 months without talking. In the mean time, I dated one guy for a short time and am now dating another man. Me and my current bf, have been dating for 3 months and are very hopeful for a long future together. 

Here's the problem: My ex is now back in my life. He's been here for a few months but we are just now starting to really talk again and it's so nice. He's opening up more than he did and we joke about the past. He's told me that he misses me and regrets some of the choices that were made. And I'm caught because he was the first guy I've had a fire for, and it never really died. But I don't know if it's because I still love him or because he was the best sex I've ever had and I'm dying to have that again.

Not that my current love life isn't good but it's just... my ex does this thing to me. I don't want to lose him out of my life again and I really do enjoy having him around but he's making me double think my current relationship, especially if I even love him because there isn't the same flame. I know it's stupid but I so desperately want one more night with my ex, but i'm sure that would just turn into one more and one more. 

It's basically how I'm living my entire life. Unpaid internship vs. paying job, college vs. traveling... it's all about planning for the future. I want the instant gratification of having my ex back now, but I just know that it could never work out between us. We want different things and we are different people. And my bf is the future, I can see myself with him in a long time, we get along and have similar values and want the same things. 

I'm just sad and torn because on the one hand, I really want to try again with my ex even though I know it wont' work. I just want him back. But at the same time, I can't think about giving up my current bf.

755,2jyptw,False,,3,"I messed up with a girl, everyone tells me to move on even though it's my fault...",whatsbotheringyou,"So started hanging out with this girl.

We clicked at an extrinsic level at the very least. All the same interests and similar personalities. 

Hooked up after a ball I invited her to. Got her sick. She's incredibly busy but she agreed to clear her entire day one day so we could hang out all day. But she got mad at me for getting her sick/was resting so that was scrapped. 

I was somewhat annoyed and went out to a party and ended up hooking up with a random girl. She gave me a hickey.

Next day I see my girl and she sees the hickey. She texts me later asking about it and I just fudge around with her about it because she said it is no big deal.

So I keep inviting her to hang out and she keeps on flaking or saying she can't. 

Finally after telling her I like her for her personality etc. etc. (like after a month of flakes) she FINALLY gives me the time of day and we hang out for an hour or so. 

At this point it is finals time and we try but fail to hang out. 

Over the summer we text some and we both like adventure so we agree on me driving all the way to her house, 2 hours away, sneaking into her house on a Thursday. (Her family was going to be gone the next morning, for the weekend)

So we do that, smoke weed the next morning, and end up hooking up some. I get her out of her shirt/bra and start fingering her but she starts giving all these reasons why we shouldn't go further. So after some persistence, I give up and the day goes on rather normally. We hangout with her friends and they all did crazy ass drugs while I drove 'em around. 

Then around 9 PM she goes across her yard and starts talking with a couple of her girl friends...next thing I know she tells me she doesn't feel comfortable staying with me the weekend and is going to sleep at her friend's house...she says I didn't cross any boundaries with the hooking up and she just realized that she didn't feel comfortable spending the entire weekend with someone she doesn't know really, really well...

I act calm and collected and actually stick around for a bit before she brings up that she is surprised I stuck around and a switch flipped in me and I basically said ""you know what, I should leave."" and leave. She is saying sorry and all this crap whilst this is going on and I just say ""actions speak louder than words"" and she leaves me in my car in the garage all upset. 

She texts me apologizing again. I don't answer her for a week or so before deciding that maybe I was also in the wrong. We had only hung out 10 times and considering the sluttiness I already exuded she probably felt like I was just another conquest to her and she herself felt like a slut. 

So in comes the next semester. She flakes or can't hang out with me again and again and again. I finally tell her I like her and all but if she isn't going to make the time for me to hang out or if she doesn't even like me then don't even bother texting me. 

So she says she'll make time. We hang out. Everything seems pretty good in our little world.

Eventually things go to shit as they always do. She was telling me how she was on tinder just for when she was bored to talk to guys so I felt no problem going on tinder too. She texts me saying her friend saw me on tinder and she was happy to be in one of my pictures...so I just say how I don't want to be on tinder and that's because I like you but I never see you. She goes on to say she doesn't wanna lead me on and she isn't sure whether she likes me and thinks she would by now and all this bullshit. I couldn't believe it. So I get all sappy and smooth and try to get her to give me one more chance and that I know she liked me in the past and needs to look past the whole hickey issue and all because we clicked in the past. She ignores all of my emotional opening up just to say ""hahaha ___"" ___ being some random anecdote I mentioned in my text. 

I don't text shit after that. 

Then I bought pot brownies from a guy she knows about a week later and for whatever reason she decides she needs to text me to let me know to only take half a brownie because they are really strong. I ignore of course.

And she has been snapchatting me ever since. Everyday. 

So I feel like shit and can't get her off my mind. I feel like I fucked up by making her feel like a slut and she also probably associates me with bad feelings because she decided to kick me out of her house (she said that was the worst thing she has ever done to anyone...). 

But things are more complicated than that as it doesn't even make sense that she was mad at me for the hickey crap...she was actively hooking up with a dude whom she apparently ""really liked""...though I do imagine she means moreso the way I treated the situation by fudging around/beating around the bush. 

So I don't know. I want her bad. I find her adorable...we click at an extrinsic level...I feel like we'd have a good thing going if she ever gave me a real chance. But maybe she is a bitch like all my friends, guys and girls, say and I should just move on...but my heart doesn't want me to. 

Thank you for reading and even more so if you let me know wat do. 

My birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks so what I THINK I should do is just see what she does...I am hoping she texts me and I can then say ""we should talk in person"" and mention that I am frustrated that she's overlooking the great times we had before the hickey incident and that I am upset at myself for being such a jerkoff and I acknowledge that my actions made her feel like a slut and a dirtbag. But if she gave me that day she promised me way back when, I'd charm the hell out of her, with pizza.

799,1rlcm8,False,,6,"My studies bore me, the girl I love lives thousands of miles away and I dont really know what I want",whatsbotheringyou,"Hey folks, let me introduce myself first:

I'm a 17 year old aerospace engineering student from Germany. Although the following will sound cheesy as fuck (I know it is) bare with me:

About 2 months ago I met a girl on omegle and we've been talking twice a day for almost all the time now. A few weeks ago I confessed that I kinda like her (a bit more than that) and she admitted the same. To make it short: we basically confessed that we love each other. Whenever I'm talking with her I'm feeling great but lately it's starting to fill me with sadness because everytime we talk I realise that chances are that I'll never see her in person. It's gotten so far that it actually keeps me down for an entire weekend. 

Furthermore I've found out that aerospace engineering isn't what I really want to do and despite already having an alternative plan what to do, a friend of mine recently gave me the idea of maybe going to the US to study. But because tution fees are very high I've been looking for a scholarship online and haven't found one that's either realistic or relevant yet. I'm kind of afraid that our 'relationship' or whatever we have there will slowly but steadily fall apart. Obviously I don't want that to happen but I don't know how to prevent it either. I know it might just be stupid teenager love (and it probably is) but it still bothers me. 

I also don't know whether I should just accept my fate or try my hardest to travel to the US or maybe look to study in the US. 

By the way, on the last topic: does anyone know of scholarships for foreign students that can't afford to pay (the entire) tution fees?

Distance especially is tough, if the two of you really care about each other and are both willing to put the effort into it, then go for it.

Could it be because I speak too much? Sometimes I feel like that must hinder myself because it ends up making me look silly. I'll say something that is self-deprecating, for example. Which I don't mind because I like to make people happy. But perhaps that is the problem. Maybe they don't respect me and such. 

I imagine if I am leaving everything out there with girls that isn't good either. Sure I know everyone which they must be attracted to but I feel like if I say the occasional dumb thing or use self-deprecating humor they'll be less likely to be interested. 

Maybe it also stops people from taking me seriously. I imagine that makes it bad for myself. I have a very serious side to myself, but I only show it when a person needs advice or on an intellectual topic. So perhaps people just never bring that stuff up to me, which makes up half of a relationship with a human being and thus it makes us less than friends.

So he's in constant pain and the doctors won't give him pain medication. He also can't afford to go to a doctor on his own and only goes when the state or his old job or whatever is paying for it (I have no idea how the whole American medical/workman's comp/injury at work situation works).

Anyway, a couple of months ago I guess one of his buddies gave him some heroin and he's been smoking it for the pain. He only told me about it a few weeks ago and has several times expressed a desire to go to rehab and get off of it, and mentioned how much he hates it and hates being addicted. I told him to talk to one of my friends who was in rehab recently for the same thing and he refused, saying he doesn't want anyone to know. In fact, he swore me to secrecy when he told me about it.

I don't know what to do. Our parents don't have any money so they wouldn't be able to help him even if they did know. I have no idea who his current circle of friends is so I can't even contact any of them to ask if they've seen him. Our mom said she talked to him on Tuesday. 

Also, his girlfriend broke up with him last week and told him she had been seeing someone else the entire time (it was only a few months I think, but still), so I know he's been depressed about that. I really don't know how I can help him. I'm all the way on the other side of the country and I'm in the military, so I can't just drop everything and go home to look for him. I don't want to send him any money because he'll probably just use it to buy drugs, and I don't really have money to just be throwing away at him. I've already loaned him way too much money (that I'll probably never see back) over the past ten years.

And I just got an e-mail from my mom saying that he got a letter saying he was turned down for some sort of treatment for his back, so that's just another turd on top of the shit heap that is his life lately.

Remember that at this point he isn't family because he would do anything for drugs. All he cares about is herion. Try and get him to go to NA or a similar group and you should go to a group for people who have family members that are drug addicts. It will help you a lot. ,2013-09-26 20:17:07

217,1p64ux,False,,23,"My parents took $8,000 from me.",whatsbotheringyou,"I'll try to keep this a little brief.

I'm a sophomore in college. My grandma on my dad's side gave my 2 younger sisters and myself $8,000 each in trust funds when we were very young.

Last year, I commuted between campus and my parents house. Because of this, I agreed with my parents that using *some* of that money, and not *all* of that money for a car would be the best option.

I felt like saving money in that fund for emergencies like rising tuition or car problems/insurance was a great idea, and it would give me a cushion if I needed it.

My father took all $8,000 and bought a truck, without consulting me. I never drove that truck when I was home, in fact I was banned from it. Instead I drove the family Crown Vic.

Now I'm an RA on campus. In order to continue to pay for tuition here (it's a private school) I have to keep another off campus job. This new job is about 15 minutes or so away. 

Tomorrow is my first day at this job. I wasn't able to find a ride with our on campus shuttle to get there, so I decided to call home and ask for a ride. I felt that was logical, because my sister was available for said ride, and wanted to give it to me. So I set up plans with her for that

My mother called me on the phone, was very angry that I would ""have such guts"" to ask for a ride to my job when I should be able to find rides. ""It wasn't in our agreement""

I was also told by my father that our shuttle service runs *until* noon on weekends. It in fact *doesn't* run before noon.

What would you suggest I'd do in this situation?


Longer than I thought, but 
**TL;DR My parents took $8000 to buy a car I never drove, now I don't even have any car and I'm still short a lot of money for college**",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1p64ux/my_parents_took_8000_from_me/,21,"It doesn't matter whether you need a car or not. That's really not the issue here, they're just bringing it up to distract you from the fact that they took $8000 that your grandma gave you and spent it. 

Definitely contact your grandma about this if you haven't yet. I know everyone says 'sue them' but well, it's not always that easy with family. Call your grandma and tell her you're in a bunch of trouble, you're short a lot of money for your college, your parents took what she gave you and now won't even give you a ride to work. Don't be afraid to exaggerate the whole thing; just make sure you get your point across and she's bound to put some pressure on your parents. I strongly suspect that the amount of money you're going to get back or whether they're going to give you the car depends on how distressed you will come across to your grandma. 

As for your parents, as long as you don't get anything from them, start showing them exactly how much you resent them for taking your money. Make it a big deal, because currently, they're obviously not taking you seriously. Whenever they ask you to do them a favor, tell them exactly why you're not going to do it. If mom says anything about 'your agreement' again, tell her that they broke that agreement when they stole your money. Hell, break any rules of 'your agreement' until you see the money or the car. You screwed things up the second your father showed up with the truck you didn't agree on buying, and you didn't challenge him about it. You made matters worse when you let them forbid you from driving the car they bought with your money. Because of that, they don't see you as someone they should take into account; they got used to the fact that you'll more or less swallow whatever they do to you. To battle that, you have to become enough of a nuisance that it will be easier for them to give you your money back than to deal with you.

Warning: this is a nasty way to do things. I do it sometimes with my family when they get manipulative with me, and while it does work, I feel like a horrible person for doing it. I know it's their own damn fault for trying to use me, but I really dislike being nasty to people. If you're not willing to go through with this, you might as well not start, because if you give up in the middle, they'll just use this 'bad behavior' of yours as an excuse to do things their way.

949,1na33p,False,,13,Long term girlfriend and I are having serious problems at the same time someone I'm interested in has become available,whatsbotheringyou,"I am very confused right now and I just feel like I need to get it all out. I made a post a few days ago that my girlfriend was unsure if we should be together anymore, now another big complication has arisen.

My girlfriend and I have been together for several years, and through that time we have seen our ups and downs. We live together and have been building a life together and we have very similar interests and we both care about each other. We get along fine most of the time, but that ""spark"" has diminished a great deal. She doesnt feel like I am passionate about her and I dont fulfill her romantic needs, while I dont feel satisfied sexually and havent for some time. We have talked about marriage several times, but always in a ""someday"" context. 

A few months ago, I became very close with a female coworker of mine at another job. Over the course of a few months we became very good friends and texted each other constantly, mostly about mundane things but overall we had a great time together and enjoyed each other's company. Nothing explicitly inappropriate happened, but it made my girlfriend uncomfortable that we got so close. There was definitely some mutual attraction between the two of us, but she was in a long term relationship as well and there was never any chance of anything happening. I feel guilty even typing this, that there were times when I wished things had turned out differently - if we had met under different circumstances maybe we could have given it a shot. But I never pursued it, and I never made any steps to cheat, at least not in a physical way.

I came to realize after a certain point that part of why I connected with her so much was I liked how she made me feel - she thought I was smart and funny and made me feel confident in ways that I hadnt felt with my girlfriend in months, maybe even years. I had this emotional relationship with her that I was using to supplement how lacking my own one felt was at home. I realized this after a blowout with my girlfriend, and decided to try and cut ties and salvage my relationship. That happened about a month and a half ago.

Recently, my girlfriend went to a wedding and seeing the other couples there made her start to seriously question if we were right together. She is afraid that we are together now out of comfort and habit more than anything. We got together in college and we have both changed so much since then, she feels like maybe we just grew apart. She is worried that we are going to end up being just good friends who live together, rather than two people in love. I still love her and care about her deeply, but I have had the same fears at times. Sometimes I feel like she just isnt happy with the person I am naturally and wants me to change to fit her needs. I've been trying to reassure her and show her that we can make it work, that the things we have gone through are natural and happen in all relationships and that we can fix things if we work really hard. But honestly, I dont know if thats true because I haven't dated that many people and I dont have enough context to be sure.

I just found out that the other girl, who I felt so connected to, recently broke up with her long term boyfriend as well. I feel like this just adds another huge layer of complication to what I was already going through. If I broke up with my girlfriend now it would be a huge, painful, complicated mess, but I would be free to pursue this other person who I feel strong chemistry and attraction towards. Sometimes I feel like my current girlfriend likes me for who I was and who she thinks I have the potential to be, whereas this girl likes the person who I am now. But maybe thats just because things are fresh and new and I had used them as an escape from my problems.

I'm not planning on breaking it off with my girlfriend anytime soon because we have invested so much time and effort into being together, but I cant help but wonder if we are just forcing it when we could be happier with other people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1na33p/long_term_girlfriend_and_i_are_having_serious/,12,"Both you and your girlfriend have zero faith in the relationship, why are you still together?

Almost all of my friends go to a very different school and I talk to them maybe once per month at best.

I have known this one girl for less than three years through work and for a substantial portion of this time we were great friends.  I grew feelings for her early on, but did not press on anything due to our work relationship.  We spent a significant amount of time together inside and outside of work and I definitely felt like an emotional support for her.  She knew I was there for her and we enjoyed spending time together.  

I think she knew I liked her, but I just kept it moving forward as it was until I eventually brought up how I felt about her and she said she wasn't ready for a relationship at this time, but she should be dating someone like me.  However, even though she said these things to me she started having sex with another guy and she knew this hurt me and actually apologized, but continued to fool around with him anyways.  I should have moved on at this point looking back at it, but I continued to remain friends even though I still had feelings for her. 

We stayed pretty close and people regularly thought we were dating.  I felt as though our relationship was more than just friends, because it felt like and we would treat each other like we were a couple.  However, we never kissed or went any further than a hug.  She was always very open, comfortable, and giving me her attention when we were alone, but when we were out with a group she was regularly very cold towards me and almost ignoring my presence.  Even though this was the case, she would always end up reaching back out to me after whatever social event.

I eventually wanted to know where this was going, because I felt as though I was being put on the backburner or she was getting the benefits of a boyfriend without being in a relationship with me.  I had a talk with her and all she apologized and said she felt terrible, but wanted me to move on.

I still see her, but I don’t know how to act at this point.  This really has me torn up inside and I’m sure she can sense that, because I have not been spending much time with her over the past few months and have kept the communication to a minimum.  Also, we do not talk as frequently, because I have been only letting her initiate the communication, but it still seems she wants to be friends or at least hang out.  I have not been rude to her and have been polite when we talk, but I keep short and to a minimum.  I feel as though I haven’t moved on yet, but she continues to reach out to me.  When she does speak with me now, she seems a lot nicer to me than she has in the past, but now I am the one acting cold.

Ultimately, I want her to be happy and she knows this, even if she is not with me.  But, I am too unhappy remaining friends with her at this point when I still have feelings for her.  The rejection stings too much right now.

TL,DR; A good friend I have feelings for told me to move on, so I have distanced myself and don’t communicate with her as much.  However, she keeps communicating with me and will ask me to hang out.  I still have feelings for her, but being around her reminds me of the rejection.

171,2rxohw,False,,3,My friend just beat the shit out of this guy,whatsbotheringyou,"He just told me that it happened earlier today. 

It's his birthday. He went to the mall with his girlfriend. He tells me it was great. I ask, ""Yeah? Did you get any action?"" He says, ""No, I got to beat the shit out of my girlfriend's stalker."" Pause. ""What?""


He tells me that there's this guy who's ""been texting her"" and ""making her cry"" as of late. Apparently, he broke his nose and knocked a few teeth out. I ask how the fuck that ended up happening, and he tells me that his girl and him planned it. Pause. ""WHAT?"" He tells me he went to the mall, had his girl text this guy and have him ""meet her"" there. ""The rest is history,"" he says. 


Bewilderment is my initial reaction. Why? Because someone got their face smashed in for one. Why should that matter to me? Here's my worry: she fucking loved it. She probably suggested the idea. She probably told him, stop, he's had enough, please, stop...and relished the whole thing. 


My friend, he's very susceptible to control. If he says he likes cars, and I say I don't like cars, he'll reassure me that cars aren't all that great. 


When he tells me about this girl, I remember the little things. Things they do together, things that are always her idea. I'm worried about him. If what he did, he really did over some guy who apparently texted his girlfriend, then he does not have an breezy future with her.

I got out of my poor living situation.  I thought this would help greatly but it's the same problems, just better scenery.  I got a job I like over the summer, it helped greatly as it distracted me from my problems, but I don't have the time to work during the school term.

Some problems I've tried to fix, but they keep persisting.  I have no friends, so I tried to put myself out there.  I joined a couple clubs on campus, and went to some social groups organized over meetup.  I had a good time and met some people, but after a few months of this I've only managed to make more acquaintances.  I've tried talking to a school counselor, but I can only see him every 7 weeks because there's so much demand.  He recommended I see a therapist but it costs more than I can afford on a student budget.

Good job! 

Okay, let's get to the critical point of the situation. I do understand that you are invested in clubs, which is good! One thing I may ask though, is that do you actually enjoy this club? I personally am also in college, and though I was intimidated to join certain clubs, due to ""social stigmas"" that people may have had towards me, I joined them anyways. My primary example towards this would be joining the eSports club here on campus (specifically League of Legends). Here I was able to meet some people that had more ""personal"" common characteristics that I had. Furthermore, no one ever gave me crap about the clubs I joined. 

The people I met were similar to myself in many aspects, and the gaming in teams is a good break to the constant workload that I receive. Whether it be an Anime Club, eSports club, brony club, or basket weaving club, make sure that you choose something you are PASSIONATE about. 

Finally, I'm gonna tell you this. **Everything is mindset** If you don't believe you can be fixed, no one can help you. That may sound harsh, but it makes sense. I can't make you think one way, because ultimately, you are a unique, special person. However, fixing that mindset, and opening up yourself to opportunities that the world has to offer, believing that there is more to just trying to fix the unfixable, and dealing with the beautiful idiosyncrasies that life throws at you can really change the way one can see everything. 

The journey won't occur overnight, at least mine didn't. Give yourself some time, get yourself out there, and little by little, you'll notice things that aren't there, but are. These things are the little things that keep us going.

(that I never really enjoyed) I play the alto sax, am good at playing it, reading the music, but am not really all that good theory. 

Other the summer I got a job working at a factory and my father holds a high level position there so I was able to have some time doing maintenance work even though it was not what I signed up for. I enjoyed it. A lot. And there are far more jobs for this than in Music.

I'm thinking of switching because I don't want to sink tens of thousands of dollars into university were I would most likely hate the courses, sitting there listen to a prof ramble on for hours on music theory etc, when I can go to college, learn a trade which I like doing, hopefully find a good job somewhere and live comfortably.

I go in thinking this is just routine with me having been ill etc, only to find out I should have been locked in my house the moment lock down was announced as I take two different Corticosteroid based medications.

GP has advised me that I have next to no immune system due to the medication I am on, and as one of them is for my lungs, I would end up critically ill if I contracted covid.

55,gv23ha,False,,1,Racism. My Thoughts. Discussion?,whatsbotheringyou,"This post represents what I think about what's currently happening in my country today. In it, I share my first experience with racism and the biggest lie about racism that's still being told now. It is a post that I wrote out of frustration, disgust, and fear. I wanted to share it here, to vent, but hopefully to start a discussion. 

Please mods, if it's not allowed, remove it. 

Currently, I'm a white woman living in the Deep South of the USA, what we call the Bible Belt. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, I've seen some of my (now *former*) friends and family members either try to justify, defend, and some outright agree with the racism that is happening in my country. I sent the contents of this post to them and asked if I was somehow misunderstanding what they were trying to say. Almost all of them replied and all of the replies broke my heart. After they so proudly defended their ignorance, I replied, ""As much as it pains me, I'm not comfortable remaining in touch with anyone whose values oppose mine so radically."" and I blocked them. 

I saw this put beautifully earlier and it's stuck with me: ""You cannot say 'All Lives Matter' until black lives do. 

The atrocities being heaped upon our black communities should make you sick. There should be crying, wailing, and gnashing of teeth at what we're hearing about right now. There is no justification or excuse for such heinous actions. 

Do you want to know what one of my very first memories is? As a kindergartener (age 5), I remember coming home from school and telling my (then)stepdad that I made a new friend: Stephen. Then, I said that me and Stephen were gonna get married. That's the first (but not last) time, I can remember being asked, ""What does Stephen look like? What color is he: does his skin look like yours or is it darker?"" I got my ass whooped for that one and told ""Not in my house"", but with the worst language you ever did say, much less direct at a 5 year old.

In sixth grade, my entire class was made to write an essay. ""My Eyes Don't See Color."" As I remember writing that essay, we were made to explain just how much we didn't notice the color of someone's skin. As 11 year olds, we were required to write a paper to show that 'racism no longer exists'. 

You cannot sit there and tell me that racism no longer exists. To have the nerve to think that we 'don't see color' and everyone is treated equally is demeaning, ignorant, and downright dangerous. The racism in this country has been shown to us, time and time again. Yet, time and time again, we turn a blind eye to their plight. 

We, as white people, need to do better. Stop and acknowledge our privilege. Realize that we did nothing to earn this privilege. Understand that our privilege comes at the detriment of others. That just because we live in a country that values our white skin tone above others, certain aspects of our lives have been made more simple.  

I refuse to stand by any longer. This injustice will not be tolerated. My outrage will not be silenced. I will fight alongside you for as long as it takes. I will use my privilege to instigate change, to bridge the gap of inequality between us.

Living in the south I have come to believe that the racism we see here comes from a deep rooted history of racism, but also from ignorance and lack of exposure and relationships to those on the other side. It is hard to be empathetic when you do not experience the strife and struggle of the other. In that way, I would also encourage that rather than blocking and cutting people out from your life, be a part of leading them out of ignorance. Continue to have challenging conversations and expose them to the things that they have been either deliberately or inadvertently blind to. I believe that the growing extremism between the ""right"" and ""left"" that we see across our country stems from both sides having decided to cut each other off and surrounding themselves with only those who think and believe in the same things. This has created an echo chamber where beliefs cannot be changed. I would encourage you to be a bridge to your fellow human who does not share the same beliefs as you and seek to understand why they believe what they do and work to show them that their beliefs are wrong and built on centuries of racism and prejudice. Don't let your anger and hatred at what they believe cloud the fact that they are human and they are capable of change.

850,bveqiv,False,,2,How can I accept the life that awaits me?,whatsbotheringyou,"This is gonna be awfully long, I understand if you don't want to read this. You can scroll ahead.

&#x200B;

I like to think I'm aware of what's waiting for me ahead. I'm 22, I dropped out of school, I've never worked and I've been isolating myself for the past 5 years... there's no way I'll have a decent life.

&#x200B;

I say isolate, but that's not entirely true.

&#x200B;

I live with my family and I don't have a room so I'm alone only in the bathroom. I even go outside with a friend, even if it is only 5 or 6 times a year, attend the local cosplay con once a year and go to my father's for some days twice a year.

&#x200B;

The fact is, I can't even show how I feel for one moment. I can't be honest with my family so I'm faking happiness, without even doing it right, and that's kinda tiring. 

I could be honest with my friend, but she has a lot of problem of her own so I don't wanna burden her with mine, she can't even help me so I'd just make her worry.

At the con and with my father is even worse. I don't really know how to approach people, so I kinda have created a fake personality to exhibit in such occasions, but people try to befriend me and I'm not strong enough to stop them so I just let myself be dragged... after the con reality hits back, I lose contact with those I met and feel incredibly shitty about myself as a result, thus my self hate keeps growing.

&#x200B;

As for my father, I've piled up a huge number of lies and the only way to not make everything crumble is to keep lying... I do feel bad doing it to my father but there's no way back, I even told him I graduated from high school! As things stand now, I can't go and casually say I've told him a bunch of bullshit for years and that my life is actually shit but I'm fully aware that one day everything will be destroyed...

&#x200B;

The solution to all my problems, even partly those with my father, is far too known to me: go out and work.

&#x200B;

Sadly in my country even to clean the stairs they want an high school degree, that cuts me off from about 90% of the jobs, and that's just the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

I'm paralized by fear, so there's no way I can just go out and work. I'm scared of changing the fragile balance that's created in my house and, since what I'm afraid the most is confrontation with other people, the only thought of doing something that's different from my usual routine terrifies me.

&#x200B;

The other problem I have is that I can't bear the thought of spending my life doing something I hate. I know I'll never have my dream job and that I'm far too miserable and ugly to find a lover, but if i leave those out what's left?

In the best case I'll get a job I'll hate that makes me scrape through life until retirement, when I'll be too tired and empty to do anything but wait for death quietly.

In the most realistic scenario I'm just gonna have to nurse my relatives all my life and live off their money like a parasyte.

&#x200B;

The fear problem is gonna solve itself, for better or worse, in a few months when I'll move in another city and my family will kick my ass towards employement, and since I'm a spineless coward, I'm gonna quietly obey.

The other one still remains though, how can I accept the shitty life that awaits me? I've already crushed my dream, suffocated my hopes and negated my wishes, but it worked only partly and didn't even resolve a thing, it just hurts a lot.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna ask all those of you that have experienced life more than me, is there a way to accept life? Am I just automatically stop thinking about it while working my ass off? Should I keep destroying myself by exposing me to all that stuff I've been avoiding because it hurts until I'm an empty shell? (By the way, the last one is what I'm currently doing)

&#x200B;

Before you reply therapy or something similar, that's not an option. That would man face my family and there's no way I can do it. Online therapy also isn't an option, as I said before I can't really hide stuff in my house, even for writing this I had to leave another browser page in background to switch to.

&#x200B;

If you fear I might commit suicide don't worry. I am depressed and suicidal, but I'm not gonna end my suffering to make more people suffer, I'd rather keep the pain for myself.

Thanks for staying with me for this gigantic rant, kudos for your patience.

To like football, to be a douchebag,  to placate others through soft emotion, to wear what you want, all of these things are subjective to YOU. Not requirements given by the title you believe you are. They are level and human qualities, not categorical stipulations.

Shit, I[M] love makeup. Did yall know it Makes you less ugly than you think you are? I was taken back, like ""you tellin' me I can look better but not look like a crossdresser or clown. What? That's ridiculous.""
So why do guys, who have figured out how to alleviate the beautification standards set by others around them get treated like they broke some unmentioned law of the universe.  Just because it is a predominantly female asset does not mean I am female, nor does it mean I wish to be one. I wish to be me...just better looking. 

The same for girls. You do what you like. Being a douche nozzle is not a selectively male trait. Choosing shorts and comics, over skirts and barbies does mean you should be a guy, nor be treated like one.
 It means you like what you like and do what you do because you like it. Save for those who have the chemical anomalies which make them  uncomfortable in their physical form, there is not a goddamn thing wrong with you in your own form.

What the fuck is acting like a dude or a girl anyway? 

Being an asshole means your an asshole, being tough is tough, having a soft heart means you have a soft heart. There is no ""acting"" like you completely replaced your reproductive organs for a few minutes as a spider landed on you.

485,1pjrdr,False,,9,I Don't Know if I Should Join this New Fraternity,whatsbotheringyou,"Hey all...so this has been bothering the absolute hell out of me. 

I don't think I am a big frat person but I feel like because it is a new fraternity, I can make it cater to the above average joe who doesn't wear boat shoes with a pink shirt everyday. I want to be in the most well respected fraternity if I join one. I want to have one that is full of gentlemen who know how to treat both guys and girls well. I don't care if the person has a differing personality or different values as long as they are selfless and respectful. 

So fraternity life probably isn't for me...but I like the networking, the brotherhood and the sorority girls. And if I can get rid of the things people hate about fraternities in this one, I think that'd be beneficial for myself and all. But that is a lot of work. I have to hope the other guys have similar views. 

The dudes in it vary. Most seem like your average joes, but there are some weirdos and perhaps a couple fratty dudes. That has turned me off because I don't want to be associated with weirdos and disrespectful lames. One dude of course said ""You're a fag"" while we were just walking away from a meeting to someone...and then seconds later a kid whom I know walked by and you guessed it, he is gay. I don't like that s%8t. I am all for morbid jokes about whatever if they are well done...but just calling someone ""gay"" or ""retarded"" etc. is just unnecessary and immature. Girls don't like that and most respectful people don't. 

But hopefully with the good guys in the fraternity and myself, we can make it a great place to be. 

So should I do it?

Some other things: I am in Air Force...so I feel like being a founding father wouldn't be as ""wowing"" on my resume once I get out...they'll just love I have actual leadership experience and actual engineering experience out in the field for the AF. 

It is also 744 the first semester...180 every semester afterwards.

I was also thinking maybe I should just join the school's engineering fraternity. It is more likely that I'll be able to network obviously, it'll be cheaper and lastly...access to past tests for all my hard classes! But obviously it will not be as fun...

I wish I had better friends so I didn't have to consider being in a fraternity really. But I just don't see how I can meet girls and friends in general without it. Let's be honest, it is unlikely I'd like the people in the video games club or the photography club. But I didn't meet friends freshman year that I really clicked with and I am an engineer.

Also, I don't really like partying all that much. I enjoy it if I know the people there...so going to house parties doesn't really work for me which is why a fraternity would be nice. I'd know all the guys and hopefully I'd know some of the girls beforehand.

I have just been so burnt out from all my decades of working, and finding incompetent companies, incompetent managers, and corrupt corporate culture, that I just don't trust myself to find a place to work, that won't be just like my worst nightmares.

I don't mind working, but at age 51, I don't want to go back and work for crap fast food, telemarketing, or programming jobs. Where the pay sucks, management incompetent or chaotic, treated like a cog where I don't matter.

I want to go back to college to study Economics and Politics, because I feel that inside my head is a few ideas and solutions to solve our massive incompetent and ineffective federal government. I won't talk politics here, just that I want to be a part of solving our national problems, even if in a small fashion.

I have this complex of wanting to make a difference in my life, because at age 5, I was told I could never have kids. 

So how else will I be remembered, If I don't leave a mark in some fashion?

I am interested in learning economics and politics, but today I took a math assessment test, which went fine, I passed, but didn't do great.

But in the experience of that, what such utter disorganization, miscommunication and chaos, reminds me why I hated my days at other colleges I've been to.

I am very cynical, but I've had many experiences that feed that cynicism. 

I have no friends, outside of my youngest brother, but he's married and he's expecting his first child. So he's pretty busy with his life.

I just want my own life.

My girlfriend, died about 2 years ago, My Cat died 5 years ago, I broke my right leg 3-4 years ago. 

But I am tired of being a victim and feeling like a victim, I want to be sure that I am taking the right path.

I am so afraid of making the wrong move, that sometimes I make no move.

The kind of person I want to be, is the kind that see's patterns, and provides tools and methods to solve our problems. 

I have zero interest in trying to persuade or sell or give speeches. I just want to help solve real problems.

For the former, try and pursue a passion and get involved with others. If you become involved in a group doing something you think is important, it may give you more of a purpose and improve your happiness.

For the latter, consider reading about [positive psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Personal_Finances) to learn about what you can do to design a lifestyle that it well-suited to happiness. For example, going back to college may help you become engaged in a community of peers who have similar goals.

71,1kuz2z,False,,10,"My selfish, abusive mother disowned me while dealing with kidney failure that she caused. Let me explain... (Incredibly long, but I need help so bad...)",whatsbotheringyou,"Part 1: The Setup


My mother has never been good to me. She has always adored my twin sister, to the point that, when my sister smashed me in the head with a rock when I was nine, I awoke to see my mom comforting my crying sister. Because she was the victim.

If I got into every detail, I'd be here all week, and no one wants to read that. But mom would lose patience with me and after age eleven refused to discipline me. She would tell my dad lies about what I had ""done"". He handled my discipline; at age nine I called him ""Igor"" in my diary - the willing servant. The most damaging entry has to be when she accused me of groping my pubescent sister.

I was the Stoop Kid from Hey Arnold! I wasn't allowed to leave my yard, and kids used to ride by my house and laugh at me. As a teenager with a girlfriend, she got worse. Her controlling behavior became so bad that she often accused me of things I could prove I didn't do, but it didn't matter: mom's word was gospel.

I was required to stay home four nights a week, and I had a ""dating rulesheet"" I had to adhere to that specified holding hands as ""the same as sex"". She had a weird love of popping zits and blackheads, and one day she wanted to get a tender one residing along my spine. She climbed on my back and used her weight to force me on the bed when I wasn't expecting it, and I pulled a muscle in my back. Once face-down on the bed, I rolled out from under her, and she screamed at me for ""hitting"" her. Dad hit me for ""hitting"" her.

So many stories, so little space...

But dad was also my hero. He defended me from mom when he could, but he could never understand that she was doing 97% of her abuse when he wasn't there. I told him that she was lying about the things she said I ""did"", but mom's word was gospel.

When I lost my virginity at sixteen, she locked herself in the room and went through a ""grieving period"", because that's normal, right? She chased me to my room one night, and I told her to get out; I was rewarded with a palm to the ear, which ruptured my left ear drum.

Oh, but that's not all:
 
- I was hit in the kneecap by a toy thrown by my dad, and left with a deep bruise which encircled the entire joint. During marching season.

- I was punched in the throat for hanging out with a friend who wouldn't date my sister.

- My 85 lb body was pinned against the wall by my 220 lb dad, who called me a pussy and dared me to hit him. My mom crossed her arms and smiled, having accused me of putting a virus on her computer.

But again, not enough time or space.

Dad always came back and apologized for what he'd done; mom has never apologized for a thing in her life and meant it. And in my brainwashed mind, I thought I deserved this treatment. I thought an apology would absolve the problem, and I was convinced that an apology meant it would stop. So mom's a sick, conniving bitch, and dad is an angry, gullible bear of a man.

Around age sixteen, at 135 pounds, I finally pushed back. Literally. I locked arms with dad, and held my ground. His face went from red to pale, I shoved, and dad later said, while apologizing, that I was getting too big to tangle with. I was no longer intimidated.

But dad was also my best friend. I could tell him anything. He'd lock my secrets up like the Fort Knox of filing cabinets. We crossed the country by highway together. I think that's what I miss the most. If mom weren't in the picture, things with us would be okay. He'd have never done those things to me. But if mom's the president and dad's the army, then he is still bound to use judgment in deciding the execution of orders. And he fucked up. A lot.


Part 2: The Sickening

When I was eighteen, I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Mom decided soon after that she would find the cure. She spent thousands on internet cures, and I tried them to be a good sport. More often than not, I got much more sick than without them, and I stopped taking them. I tried one method for eight months, losing weight and energy the whole time, and after stopping I got the phrase that I was so used to by now: ""If only you'd done it longer, it would have worked. You always 'poo-poo' (dismiss) all my ideas. I've wasted thousands...""

But like a good (brainwashed) sport, I kept trying the homeopathic/alternative bullshit. I developed horrible arthritis - and a painkiller addiction - because of all of her ""treatments"". Then I moved off for my bachelor's degree.

What I left out until now is that I suspect mom of Munchausen's and Munchausen's by Proxy. If I got the hiccups, she got them twice as often. If I had diarrhea, she was also vomiting. My first girlfriend was in the hospital with leukemia, and mom hit the ER at least twice. I swear to God, if you said your dick was big she'd say hers was bigger. And none of it has ever been true.


Part 3: The Burning

I moved with my fiancee of eight years into an apartment near campus, 70 miles from home. I was taking a vitamin regimen my mom set up, and I was in both incredible pain and shedding weight. I skipped a lot of class. I would wake up, start bawling, lay my head in my fiancee's lap and cry until she had to go to work. So I'd sleep eight hours until she got home. Something was wrong, but I didn't know what. I moved from six 10 mg lortab a day to Fentanyl patches, then to four 10 mg percocets a day. Then I began taking probiotics, at mom's suggestion.

In January, I stayed with my parents for a weekend before a spinal surgery to finally fix my pain. The night before, mom told me about the new extra strength probiotics she'd bought, and told me to take two of them. I did.

The next morning, I was standing in the bathroom when the pain hit. I hit the floor and started vomiting. At the ER, I was abused by a nurse who grabbed my face, called me a wimp for crying and bellowing once, and informed the doctor that I was drug-seeking. I went to CAT scan, which revealed the pancreatitis that was about to kill me.


Part 4: The Failure

I spent a week in ICU, during which time my kidneys failed. I was in a virtual state of lucid coma. The Versed kept me awake, yet incapable of forming memories. It also made me extremely suggestible. During this time, mom made arrangements to move me back home, coerced me into denouncing my fiancee (who was then confronted at my house with bullshit allegations), forged my signature and opened a credit card in my name (legitimately for me, but still...), and begin accusing me of faking my pain for drugs.

The cause of the kidney failure? The combination of supplements I was on had chemically burned and scarred my kidney cells. The pancreatitis? The probiotics the night before.


Part 5: The Nightmare Begins

Mom began a crusade against the drugs that were keeping my pain under control and keeping me sane during my two-month hospital stay. She cornered my doctors and nurses, who willingly violated HIPAA and listened to her bitch about my ""addiction"". She screamed at me every night. She threw a water bottle over my head and into the wall. She slammed my laptop on a table. My dad couldn't control her.

I was put on a special and very restrictive renal diet. I was only allowed food that the cafeteria would send me according to my diet, but mom somehow grew convinced that I was cheating on my diet. Going home after two months was bittersweet: I missed my dog, I missed my bed, but I knew the monster I was moving in with.

My dad put my clothes and all my essential things in my room as they were before I left for school. I opened a drawer and saw my neatly folded clothes, and I hit the floor. I wasn't going to make it without dad. He and my fiancee had a burden, but they'd never failed me. Not in a situation like this.

Mom made all my food. The dialysis left me with little energy, and when I wasn't sleeping, I was either eating, shitting, or seeing my gal. I went out every week or so with my friends for a long time. I just didn't have the energy, and I always left early to crash. I was doing everything I could to hold myself together.

But mom decided that I was ""partying"" all the time. She accused me of breaking my diet, even though my nutrient blood tests came back perfect without fail. She told me that I wasn't going to ""hurt"" myself in her house. I lost touch with myself; I lost hope. It fucked with my head. I thought I was doing something horrible to myself without realizing it. After all, dad and my sister were with mom on this one.

The screaming happened daily. My dad was free once again to jab, scream at, and intimidate me. They said it all. I wasn't doing enough work around the house. I was sleeping too much. I was eating all wrong. Tests proving otherwise didn't matter. She demanded that I ask permission to eat certain meals and snacks. When I told my mom that I was thinking of suicide, she made fun of me. When I told dad, he told me I needed help and walked off.

But I didn't need help COPING with the bullshit - I needed the bullshit to stop. A therapist can't do that.

I moved in with my grandparents and aunt, who took care of me, but doubted my claims. My mom then made an appointment I didn't request at the Mayo in Minnesota, without my permission, when I wasn't ready to go. She said she was going to pay for it, but it actually cost me $1700.

On the trip, dad said that the bullshit would stop. If it didn't, he said he'd have failed me.

Just a few days after going back home, dad started in on the bullshit himself. On top of that, I developed chronic pancreatitis. Strangely, mom diagnosed herself as having a precancerous pancreas. She also began claiming she had mold poisoning, several years after legit poisoning had been resolved. She began fearing the NSA, the FBI, the FAA, and started claiming that my family was being targeted by bioterrorists bent on population control. She was fucking insane.

I told her all of that was bullshit, and behind closed doors my dad and sister agreed with me. But to her face, they supported her nonsense. After dad jabbed me in the ribs hard enough to be bruised just an inch from my dialysis catheter, I left again. The other end of that catheter is in my heart.


Part 6: Disowned

After I left, mom began claiming that I was kicked out for ""abusing"" her. When asked how I abused her, she just said that I had told my dad to ""control [his] woman."" I'd admit it if that was true, and even if I had, that's nothing compared to the treatment I received.

She calls anyone who'll answer the phone (a dwindling roster of ladies) and tells them that I'm trying to kill myself by breaking my diet, as though she's seen me eat in the last two months, or as though I don't have a .45 in my truck.

Dad claims that his marriage to mom is paramount. He has taken her side on every occasion, although attempting to appear fair. Over beers, I told him of my suicide plan back when I tried to warn them. He was apologetic and remorseful for missing the signs, and we parted as friends again.

Now, my fiancee and I have decided to buy a house. We've never had anything of our own. I asked dad to go to the bank with me to walk me through the loan process and to look at a property. Dad walked out to the car already pissed. He started a fight with me and blamed me for not accepting that I won't get an apology and for not ""burying the hatchet"" with my mother.

He screamed at me, called me names, and criticized me for wanting a house instead of an apartment. He complained about his life and claimed that my kidney ""issues"" were better than what he has to ""deal"" with. I took it all, but quietly changed course to take him back home. He then said something that REALLY got me: he told me that I should stay under mom's thumb longer. 

I saw red. I punched my steering wheel repeatedly, almost sideswiped  a van, and screamed back. I told him that I only wanted what he had at 25: a home, a family, a job, etc. He claimed that he was ""miserable"" at 25, to which I replied: ""Oh, and so I have to be as well?""

He then called me an idiot, and I let him have it. ""DON'T CALL ME ANYMORE FUCKING NAMES!!! I HAVEN'T CALLED YOU ANYTHING, AND I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! AM I CLEAR?!!"" He didn't answer, but he did bail out of my truck at 20 MPH. I learned shortly after that my mother had disowned me. Dad was pissed because she had threatened him for ""aiding the enemy"". Because her own son is the enemy.

So now my brainwashed father is threatening me on a regular basis, and my mom is phone-bombing everyone to tell lies about me. My sister is also pissed at my mom about their own conflict, but she can't rationalize that I'm going through the same thing with her. My own twin won't even look at me.

The plan was that I'd move in with the boyfriend (who's currently living about 2 - 2 and a half hours away by train), go back to school for two years, qualify as a teacher. Get a job, get married, have a family. But now I'm not going back to school. And sure, I can apply again next year, but I don't want to have to add another year on to basically starting my life.

Why not? You'll be in a career for 40 years. What's 1 year now to that 40 years of your career? I guarantee it will be worth it if it takes you an extra year to land your dream job. A year is not that long.

There's no way around this, you have to use this setback to fuel the fire and get motivated. Get feedback from the universities etc... (chase it if you need to) and find out what exactly you need to do for next time. It doesn't matter if its for university or for a job, everyone fails the first few interviews (I must have had at least 5 mock interviews with various people but I still screwed up my first uni interview, I still screw up the first one or two interviews when applying for jobs) but you have to learn from these.

Make sure this next year you do something relevant to the career you want. Want to be a teacher? Try to get a job as a teaching assistant. It doesn't even have to be where you live, you can take a TEFL course and teach English overseas, in fact I don't think you always even need that. Anything that shows a drive for your chosen career will look good when applying next year. If you have to move far away for it then so be it (so long as you can afford it of course). A long distance relationship isn't too hard for you for a year is it? And if it is, you should really evaluate the reasons why you think it would be so difficult.

Don't worry about the driving for now. As you've said yourself it isn't a priority. Focus on what is a priority instead.

654,29o8qn,False,,6,"Now that I'm losing weight, I no longer love my body like I used to.",whatsbotheringyou,"My entire life I've been overweight. Now too overweight, but just barely in the unhealthy zone. I can remember being 5 years old and crying to my (crazy) mother about how kids called me fat in Kindergarten, and her response was, ""It just means you have a skinny back"".

Bullshit of my life story aside, I had to grow up fast, and stand up for myself. And when I did, I became confident in my abilities, in my intelligence, in my personality, in my beliefs/morals. Basically instead of working on losing the weight for other people, I worked on my self confidence. And it worked! I know I'm strong. I know I can hang with the guys, because my size is partially body fat partially muscle. 

But this summer, I started eating healthier out of moralish obligations. No soda, no fried food, more vegetables and fruits and less red meat. I also started going to my friend's bootcamp to support her. On top of it, I'm not participating in Ramadan, and the not eating, but continued work is making me drop inches. I wish I could tell you how many I've dropped, but I don't know the beginning number. I would say maybe 3 or 4 inches.

Here's the thing. Now that I'm smaller, I don't identify with the ""Big Momma"" trope that I had always aspired to be.

747,34na0h,False,,5,Rebuilding after depression.,whatsbotheringyou,"Tl;Dr: I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again.


I've been a depressed for years- sparked by an existential crisis and botched suicide attempt in grade 9- and within those years of chronic depression I was lively and didn't give two shits about anything. I could talk to anyone about anything because I was **out there** , masked by not giving a shit, burying my pain in comedy, ala the clown of the group (being alone at home was a totally different experience) It wasn't healthy, but it gave me a close circle of people who cared about me for what I was, because they experienced the depths of depression themselves. 

I eventually even started to love a girl who was just as crazy as me, but disaster struck home. One of the closest people to me, my best friend for all intensive purposes, took her life last year.

I *shut down*. 

That lively, depressed, jovial asshole, people loved and hated loving, instantaneously transformed into your classic depressive cynic. A textbook troglodyte terrorizing my truest companions. There was no mask, no joking, no smiling. I stopped laughing. Stopped caring in the slightest,  and if you did anything that agitated(regardless if you meant to or not) me you'd end up unjustly roasted by verbal hellfire. Imagine Carlin attacking every member of his audience. 

I got with that crazy girl of my dreams at the worst possible time (a month after the death) and spiraled from there into the darkest depressive stupor I've yet survived.  

I lost the girl of my dreams, but it kinda didn't even matter because I was going to take hangmans exit anyway, until I saw how she looked at me. I've never had another, especially someone I loved, look at me exactly how I felt. 

It shattered me.

 I was confused and fighting myself, and once my mind was under my control I stepped up and cleaned house. Within the last 5 months the depression seemingly drifted away, of course I still get sad and weird sometimes, but I can handle it. 

Except.... I can't talk to anyone. I don't know how to be jovial. The part of me that could be friends with anyone and could talk for hours on end about everything appears to be buried with my friend. That crazy girl who is still of my dreams I cannot speak to for more than a few messages. I can't talk to my closest friends, I don't know how to talk to anyone anymore.

I am finally no longer severely/suicidally depressed, but now I'm hardly capable of being social,  even with my closest and oldest friends. Sure I know much of them, but that didn't stop me before.. I was more talkative, fun, and open when I was regularly depressed. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, nor do I remember how to be those things again. I don't even remember much of the last year, which saddens me greatly. I look in the mirror and see a stranger of whom I admire little.

Any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/34na0h/rebuilding_after_depression/,10,"Heya,

I'm going to start with the (probably) expected, you gotta stop talking to this girl of your dreams, give yourself time to get away from the epicentre of it all and be able to see the situation for what it truly is. The saying ""love is blind"" is true in so many ways. 

It sounds like you're just getting out of this bad bout of depression, give yourself some time to get back into the swing of things. But you clearly want to be proactive, join a club if you can stand it, go to music events of people you like, you already have one thing in common and I've made friends at these events, add them on Facebook/social media and then you can chat to them about latest releases, the next event they plan on going to and I've made a point of saying to these guys that if they're going to event that I'm going to and they have no one to go with, that they're more than welcome to chill with me and my friend. Try reconnecting with old friends who you maybe haven't spoken to in a while and miss a little.

And with your old friends, speak to them and tell them what has happened, ask them to help you out and tell them what to do! They may not have dealt with a situation like yours ever before and simply don't know what to do. 

Being a friend will be like riding a bike, you'll be a bit rusty at first but you'll soon get the hang of it

My name is Alex, as you can see in the title I am 23yo and few weeks ago I became unemployed.

I was working for a small online gift shop company for 3years where I was dealing with everything there from A-Z: Contact suppliers to order the needed stuff, talk with customers, use all the machines we have to craft the products that we were making, doing new desings for new products, everything that was related to the online shop, literally everything. 

2 and half months ago I asked for a promotion/salary increase since I started to have issues with my budget, and ofc my ""boss"" declined as the business during the summer doesnt have that much income. Then since my apettite for work  decreased alot due to not enjoying anymore what I was doing and the rewards I was getting, so I have tried to talk with him for one more time and again the same story, so I decided that will be better for me if I will go somewhere else to work. I was still working there until 3weeks ago where I said enough its time to move on with my life and my career.

Since then, I am constantly looking for similar jobs since its something that I already have some solid experience and I somehow like doing, you see, I like everything that is related to computers and graphics.

Now my biggest issue is that I live in a small island(Cyprus), there are not many jobs in simillar domain, and I feel that I dont want to have a boss anymore, I would love to make something for myself, have my own thing, that will make me wanna wake up or not even sleep some nights and build it, I would like my own business , but I dont know where,how and what to do as I dont know what I really enjoy doing with my life. I love talking with different people, have weird convos about the universe, about our existance, about this type of stuff. I like reading others people personal experiences in life, business experiences and so on. I like editing photos in Photoshop as its something that I have learned and still learning since I was 10 because was something that I really love doing. I like fizing computers, trying to figure out why is not working and so on. But at this point I feel that I have no energy for life, I feel that I suck and that I cant do a shit anymore.

When I had the chance to visit him I walked in on him crying with his mother saying, ""I'm just so tired of this life. Why does it have to be so hard?"" It hit me really hard hearing him say those words. I held his hand and cried with him. It just really baffles me why he would want to end his life.

Short story, she wanted me to help pay for her to come to America. Boy was I dumb, and naive. After talking to my parent's I realized how naive I was. 

And this was over 10+ years ago.

I'm 51, about 2-3 week's ago, stupid me, placed an advert in the craigslist, and got a response. With this lady named Shannon. 

Said she lived in my state, and but had family in Phillipines, etc.

I had indicated that I wanted to meet her, before deciding how well we got along. Almost immediately she ignored that, and kept giving me lovey dovey talk.

Then I got an email about 5 hours ago, saying she had medical problems in the Phillipines, and wanted me to send her 300 bucks.

I just sent a response, tolding whoever this was to ""Get Lost"".

I know I am a lonely man, but why do I let these idiots scam me and hurt me so much, lol.

Just very frustrating.

My life is moving forward, joined Toastmasters, going back to college in the Spring. Volunteering at the local community to help with English Second Language.

But outside of that I have no job, no friends, no one really show's any interest in hanging with me.

I am just tired of that I have to be always the one to show interest in others, why do other people refuse to show any interest in me?

167,bmiyl0,False,,10,"I went on a bender that ruined my mental health, my relationship, and maybe my job.",whatsbotheringyou,"I’ve been dealing with depression and panic attacks for years. I take meds to help with the panic attacks, and so far they’ve worked pretty well up until this point. Though they really don’t do a whole lot for depression, and that aspect has been getting worse and worse.

I took off work last Friday to go to a friend’s bachelor party. Now this friend is a mild mannered Christian guy, so very different from me, but I love him all the same. I guess I kinda lost it Thursday night and just started drinking. Heavily. And then Friday rolled around and I said “Screw it, it’s a bachelor party”. So I woke up and continued drinking. This kept going till Sunday. By Sunday I was more hungover than I’ve ever been, and more depressed and anxious than I’ve been in a long time. I also had to deal with the fact that I acted like a complete drunken fool the whole weekend to my Christian friend and his other Christian buddies. They basically said they couldn’t hang out with me anymore..

Monday rolls around, I’m feeling almost worse. I take off work. I spend the whole day doubled over, body locked up, shaking and weak. “Must be the hangover” I thought.

Tuesday, I feel like shit still but go into work. Everyone tells me I look like death, that I should go home. I try to stick it out and almost pass out so I leave. I’m still shaking and losing consciousness. I go to the doctor, nothings wrong.

This continues until today. I realized last night that these are panic attack symptoms that I haven’t had in a long long time. I’ve basically drank myself into having panic attacks again. I took off work again, making it 2 days and 2 half days. People at work are wondering what’s wrong, and I feel like I might lose my job. And the worst part is last time I dealt with these issues of panic attacks it took almost a year to get over them before I could function enough to have a steady job. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t get a grip in the next few days. 

I’ve never posted on reddit before, but I figured this was a good start. I’m at rock bottom right now.

I think potentially you subconsciously went on this bender because of your anxiety and depression. It will take some time to get over this obviously but forgive yourself. You made a mistake but don't keep beating yourself up over it. Drink plenty of water, eat well, get a little exercise and do things that are calming. You will fix this one step at a time but if you don't forgive yourself, you'll just draw out that time. Maybe you should deeply consider not drinking, at least for a while.  
If your Christian friend and his buddies hold all that against you then oh well, they weren't that close to you anyway. What happened to the tenets of Christianity? You know, like forgiveness, patience, and the other virtues.  
I've been on many benders and some of them altered the course of my life but you just focus on positive things in your life and you'll get better. If you lose your job, you'll get another one but hopefully you learned a good lesson. Take care of yourself! ",2019-05-09 12:06:10
400,1shd70,False,,4,I can't stop thinking about some old explicit text exchanges I found between my GF and another guy,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry for the throwaway. I think I just need some of you guys to slap some sense into me.

A few months ago I was concerned that my GF of two years was lying to me about something. Turns out she was. It wasn't a huge deal, and we've discussed it and since worked everything out. Thing is, to FIND this ""truth,"" I did some snooping. I'm not proud of myself, but I looked through her phone.

In addition to what I discovered, I ALSO discovered a number of old texts between her and a former fling. Now I KNOW these were before me, so really I have no reason to be upset. But they were sexually explicit. And in some ways, they were more sexually explicit than any exchanges that have ever occurred between her and me. She seemed more aggressive, less inhibited. 

We love each other very much and know she's the one, I just can't stop thinking about what I read. And to top it off, she's still kind of friends with this guy. They don't talk or anything, but he still comes around when a bunch of other friends do.... and while I openly know they ""dated"" (or whatever), she obviously has no idea I know about their exchanges - or any details of their sex life.

516,edbey4,False,,4,I just want to know why,whatsbotheringyou,"That’s something that’s been bothering me for years. Every time I have emotional breakdowns and meltdowns; my train of thought tries using logic so that I can at least understand and help myself. I ask myself why am I like this, and naturally my mind responds that it’s the childhood trauma that drilled into my mind a depressing and anxious view of the world (or so my old therapist said. It’s very hard for me to admit that I even had “childhood trauma” because I was always reminded that *other* people have it worse.) 

I still question why. Why would someone look at a 9 or 10 yr old, freshly moved out of her mom’s care, and get so angry at her over losing track of training bras or running out of clean clothes that they slap and squeeze them in the face? 

Why was I later yelled at for “creating marks on my face to make me look abused” when I didn’t? 

Why were things like not keeping my backpack and room clean met with shouting and my book bag thrown on me while I tried to sleep?

Why is it that when I tried telling them (both my guardian and the counselors at school) about being bullied, absolutely nothing was done to stop it, rather, I was the one sent to another room to “speak with the guidance counselor”?

Why were my attempts at reaching out and telling others that I was depressed... ignored? Treated as if they were my own fault? My first suicidal thought was when I was 10.

Why is it that I was damn near rewarded for keeping quiet about it all? I remember that any time I was hit that morning, I didn’t go to school. We’d later go out someplace to eat after both of us “calmed down.”

Why was it that I had needed glasses since MIDDLE SCHOOL, but I was actually faking it. Even when the doctor said I failed my eye exam, to look at me dead in the eyes and say smugly, “Ya know, you’re not supposed to lie on those exams!” When there was *NO REASON* for me to lie.

There’s more I could add. But most importantly, why is it that if that happened to any other child that I wouldn’t hesitate to call it abuse? Yet I struggle to call my own aunt abusive; she *has* done a lot for me.

I hate how badly I struggle with my emotions now as an adult. I feel robbed. That maybe I never deserved a good support system or anything. I look at pictures of me when I was around that age and I keep telling her that she didn’t deserve it. Maybe it’ll echo into the past and I could finally heal like I always wanted.

Anyway, thank you to those who read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/edbey4/i_just_want_to_know_why/,12,"I'm really sorry that all happened to you as a small child. It's just a sin how your guardian and other adults in your life treated you. Even abusers can be nice and do a lot for you, that doesn't negate their abuse. I often feel the same way about my upbringing.  My parents didn't physically or verbally abuse me, I was emotionally neglected. I was raised by a narcissistic mother and an emotionally neglectful father. From the outside, it looked like we were an idyllic family so I was a bit shocked with I started having horrible anxiety attacks and health issues.  I had to have a therapist tell me that my childhood would be considered abusive.  Maybe I felt that way because I was told all the time how lucky I was compared to other children.  It's even hard for me now to explain my abuse because each incident doesn't sound that bad. I feel when I try to explain it I sound like an entitled brat.  At least in my head I do, especially when I see other's dismiss what I'm saying.  People who had a great childhood never understand.

I feel like a piece of shit.,whatsbotheringyou,"I was at my friend's house for the first time and got to meet all of his friends.  It was a party and we all got more and more drunk as the night progressed.  I recently (about a month ago) broke up with my girlfriend and haven't really talked to any girls since.  I ended up getting drunk, and the girls (who I have never met, and will never see again) all seemed so hot and attractive, and a majority of them seemed interested in me.  Late in the night, one of the girls sort of backed into me and started grinding on me, and I was totally for it.  From then on we started making out and stuff, and I got really touchy feely.  I was groping her ass pretty much nonstop and I started thinking about sleeping with her.  Soon, everyone at the party starting warning me about her, telling me she has herpes and stuff like that, so I (thankfully) decide to not sleep with her.  She goes upstairs and ends up passing out on one of the beds, and me and some of my friend's friends find her a little while later.  We kind of try to wake her up, and one of the guys slaps the girls ass a few times (she wasn't moving, she was totally knocked out)  I checked to make sure she was still breathing, she was, and after the guys left me and her in the room and I ended up kind of groping her some more (she had her jeans on and everything) even though she was passed out.  My drunk logic had me thinking it was okay because she was fine with me doing it to her when she was awake.  The next morning she was still totally into me and was like touching me and messing with my hair and everything, but as I slowly recollected everything that happened and how I acted with her, I felt worse and worse.  I always try to treat women with respect and I look back at my actions that night in complete horror.  It was like someone else had taken over me.  It might have something to do with being recently single, but still... it makes me not want to drink again if I turn into some kind of monster.  :(

ALSO:  With a little facebook stalking, I found out today that she has a boyfriend.

I try not to make too big of a deal out of it. I don't comment on it, I talk about it only when I'm asked, except with a few very close friends. 

Yet so many people still frequently comment on my weight. Some of them because they are concerned, which I get, yet others because they are jealous, which I think is downright insulting, *and I'm just so done with it!*

978,cuo8xy,False,,1,"I miss my old college crush. I still have feelings for her, and just can't quit thinking about her.",whatsbotheringyou,"Over 2 years ago. When I was in college, I met a girl I had a real connection to. Cute as a button, I honestly think she may have been ""the one"" but I never took the initiative. I liked her. A lot. After 2 years, we've gone our separate ways. We haven't talked at all, but I still have feelings for her. Strong feelings. I have always regretted it.

I actually thought i loved her. I might still, i know i still have dreams about her.

Actually, if I tell about how we met and everything, tell me, do you think I would've had a shot?

Here's how we met. It was my first year of college, there was another couple group of friends i used to hang out with in high school. They were sitting in the lobby, talking. So i joined them. She was with them. One of our friends introduced us, and said she was new in town and didn't have many friends here. We talked a bit and the next day, i saw her again, so i went up and said hello. We talked for a bit, and every day after that we would talk to each other, sometimes up to a half hour.

We were very similar. Seriously, like scary similar. It really felt like i met, like, a duplicate of myself. Except, you know, female. We were similar in a lot of ways, similar values, hobbies and even similar personalities. Plus, neither of us drove. We both got picked up by somebody. We also hate tomato, yet love ketchup and spaghetti sauce and pizza. The only difference I ever really between us was that I like anime and she doesn’t. The biggest part for me, however. Was politics. You see, i am a conservative. That's just how i've always been. Now, i've always heard about how left leaning college campuses are. I never honestly expected to run into another conservative. especially one so incredibly vocal and active about their beliefs.

I started to like her, she might have felt the same for me, i don't know for sure though. I saw a few signs, nothing certain, but still. I know she always laughed at my sense of humor. I have a very weird sense of humor, i think it's called dry humor, but i make a little ""quip"" about almost everything, and most people think it's bizarre or stupid. It's gotten me a lot of weird looks, but not her, she always bursted out laughing whenever i would. I've never really was able to make anyone laugh like that. And some of the things i said were really stupid. Our first meeting, we only learned each other's first names. The next time we met, i learned her last name. Her last name is also that of a celebrity and i just said ""Any relation to (that celebrity)"". Laughed like crazy, she asked me for mine, i told her mine, she said something about it, like what country of origin it is because i have a fairly unique last name, it's german, then i just said ""Hey, maybe next time, we can learn each others middle names"" more laughing. My celebrity impressions also got a kick out of her. Then there was the time a celebrity died, she was on her phone and said something about it, and I just remarked “well, looks like Hillary just got another vote”. But, i think most i've ever made her laugh was a joke i made. It was something about Hillary Clinton and having something fall on her. I just said ""If that happened, i wonder if her feet would curl up and slink back under it.""

Yes, my quips were stupid, but they got a laugh out of her. Every time. Everyone else gets weirded out and annoyed by my humor, but not her. They always got a laugh out of her. And I enjoyed making her laugh, she always had this cute laugh, which she’d snort. That’s the only sign I ever got from her, well that and she always tried to high five me and shake my hand if that means anything

Anyway, we were also both somewhat shy people, so i never made a move, she didn't either. And for 2-3 days a week for almost a year, we talked every time we saw each other, not just saying hi as we passed each other, but we would sit in the lobby together after class, talking as we waited for our rides to come to pick us up, which sometimes took up to a half hour. Every day, she'd talk to me, just me until her sister picked her up. About life, some favorite interests we had in common. It was really nice and I actually looked forward to it. Then there was the last day before Christmas vacation, I sat at a table, we sat at the same table and talked for almost an hour before her family came and got her. Exclusively me. She didn’t glance at her phone, except to call her family that class was over (we had our final exam that day), but it took only about 20-30 minutes and class was generally 3 hours).

We had the same math class my first semester, but the second, however, we didn’t. Our paths just crossed because we had the same schedule. I mean, I had a girl, with whom, I had a solid connection with and saw every day. But I never did anything about it. My first semester, I didn’t know her as well as I did the day before Christmas Break. I thought that would be it, but the next year we had a similar schedule again. I still didn’t do it. I wanted to, but I just couldn’t formulate the words to do it. I’d always freeze up before I could do it. I just kept telling myself “next week, I’ll surely do it next week” but weeks turned to months and before I knew it, the semester was over. She was gone the next year. She transferred to a university (it was a community college). And my chances were lost forever. I never saw her again.

She was smart, she was cute, she’s one of the few people I’ve met who actually really liked my sense of humor, she always wanted to talk to me and even approached me on her own, she seemed interested in me and I just let her get away.

i kind of miss her, and still, honestly, have some feelings for her. I am friends with her on Facebook, but have never messaged her. I mean, over 2 years has passed since that time. Since we’ve talked or communicated whatsoever. I really miss her, and letting her slip by it definitely one of my biggest regrets. In the time, she's graduated, but she hasn't posted anything about a boyfriend, getting married, or anything. She posted about how fun her summer was, but everything she posted was with her sister. I still have some slight hope that maybe I still have a shot at rectifying things, but she probably doesn’t remember me anyway. I haven’t even bothered trying.

727,aytz59,False,,3,I'm trapped until I'm 26.,whatsbotheringyou,"Greetings...

I'm a 20 year old American still living with my parents and working as a cashier at a dollar store. No matter my grades in school, this is what it's come too. Unfortunately this is as far as I can really go right now.

Let me summarize my life, this might take a while.

I live in a crowded house still with my parents. Since as long as I can remember we've always lived with at least one of my step-siblings and their children. This is possible because my stepfather is a dozen years older than my mom. Currently it's my parents, my oldest sister and her three kids, and my younger brothers and I. Since we all have crap jobs we're struggling. I give half of my $8 an hour cashier wage to savings, and the other to bills. The food pantry really helps us out.

Even though I'm twenty, I can't drive. This makes me the go-to babysitter so I can't leave the house to practice driving anyway. The few occasions where I get to use my permit my mom gets so nervous that she decides to drive or has someone else drive. I'm isolated, and lonely, so the internet is my only escape. I don't even want to date because of my situation.

Debt is hurting a few of my siblings, and that scared me away from college for a year. Now that I want to go, I can't because I'm still on my parents taxes and my mom is scared of filling out the tax information for my FASFA. I don't know how, but the questions make her feel stupid and she literally yells at the screen when I try to get her help. My dad is usually busy with work because of how our schedules work, or whatever other excuse they can come up with.

I think I've become too useful and my parents secretly won't let me leave. I tried to point it out to them and they pulled every guilt card they could get away with. They won't let me leave, and most of my other family is across the country so I have nowhere to go.

Given that I can't drive, and don't have any education other than a diploma, I'm nearly unhireable, unemployable. I can't get a job that pays living wages to get me out of here.

I'm trapped as a permanent babysitter until I'm twenty six when I don't need my parents to file a fasfa and get scholarships.

Also, this isn't what I'm saying. I'm just saying I don't like the way she talks to all her guy friends so regularly. 

Basically, she has a ton of guy friends. Like, a ton. And I don't know any of them. They're all either from her work or from her old schools. She texts them a lot, really regularly. As well, her female friends text these guys from her phone. So one of her friends might use the phone to hit on the guys, without the guys realizing it's someone else. That's worded kind of confusingly - basically, a friend will text a guy using my girlfriend's phone. The friend will call the guy 'sexy' or something, without telling the guy it isn't my girlfriend. So the guy will think my girlfriend is calling him sexy. 

Also, I feel uncomfortable with her talking to all these guys because they're either her exes, or at some point have had a crush on her. Each one has confessed their attraction to her, and she's turned them down. That hasn't stopped her talking to them, though, and they're accidentally being led on by her friends. I just really wish she wouldn't talk to them quite like that. Another thing is, when talking to her friends about them, she'll call them sexy and hot. Like, right while I'm there. It doesn't really help my self esteem. 

I'd love some advice on how to change my opinion on this. I don't want to make her stop being friends with anyone, I just wish I didn't feel so uncomfortable with this. Thanks in advance.

Also, as a sidenote, her lesbian friend makes advances on her all the time. They both joke about it, but I don't really like how this girl can do inappropriate things and pass it off as a joke.

College started out great. Made a lot of friends, got to learn cool things, etc. However, it has slowly but surely been getting worse and worse and worse, and it's entirely my own fault. I made mostly A's and B's my freshman year. But starting in sophomore year, I got more and more C's. My GPA within my major is horrible. 

All this because I can't seem to make myself do *anything* anymore. Even this very moment, I should be starting a take home exam I had a week to do, which is now a day late. An EXAM. I want to make good grades, I made fantastic grades in high school. But I just can't seem to make myself put in the effort...

I cant remember the last time i got higher than a C on a test that wasnt blatantly easy (because my school has rather poor tests that dont really test your knowledge, but instead test your ability to remember a bunch of facts for the 20 minutes that you need to write them down)

I've always been told by teachers that im intelligent, which is annoying because i believe them. When i enjoy a subject, i do really well in it. The problem is, i enjoy nothing in school except talking to people and sharing my funny stories, and ""people"" includes teachers.


I love my teachers, i think they are doing beautiful things in my life and i cant thank them enough for providing me with advice to improve my current life and my future.

I've been out of high school for almost a year now and I've taken time off to work and make money and have a break from school work. I hate my job, I wash dishes every day and only see my friends at night. I've been feeling really unsatisfied with my life and realized that I miss school even with how awkward I felt a lot of the time. 

I miss when I would learn about stuff that actually interested me and I miss meeting people with similar interests. I never realized how hard it'd be to meet people once you're no longer in school. Since I've been thinking about school so much eventually my thoughts turned toward a girl in the same grade as me who I had 3 classes with my senior year and who I crushed on hard pretty much the whole year. 

She's cute definitely, curvy if nothing else, but what I really liked about her was her mind. I think intelligence and confidence are extremely attractive and this girl was both intelligent and confident. Or at least she seemed to be. The reason I say that is because one of my friends worked with her and they texted sometimes and he said she was actually really insecure which blows my mind because there was literally no reason for this girl to feel like that, but anyway. 

She was really smart and had a sarcastic sense of humor just like I do, literally every thing I heard come out of this girls mouth made me like her more. In one of the classes we had together I'd play music sometimes and I would play stuff like Beck (I'm very big into alternative music) and she would be into it which I loved because it's hard for me to find other people into the music that I'm into. She also always dressed really nice which seems random but I like dressing well myself so it stands out to me whenever girls do the same.

Let me see what else... she also hated the small town in Pennsylvania we lived in (she went to school out of state) and was into theater (I took four years of drama classes in high school), drinking (I prefer smoking weed but hey whatever), and books (I used to read a book a day) among other things I'm sure I would have discovered had we ever hung out. 

Despite all this, I never asked her to hang out once when we were in school together. When she signed my yearbook she even said she'd wished we'd been better friends.

829,1iji5g,False,,26,I just feel completely overwhelmed.,whatsbotheringyou,"A few months ago my family and I were in an [accident](http://i.imgur.com/Ijujvq2.jpg). Our S.U.V., which had been a gift from my uncle, [rolled over](http://imgur.com/a/HgiRp) and I was [horribly injured](http://imgur.com/a/Ra2WQ#0) (warning some images potentially NSFL). Having found out upon calling my insurance co. to report the accident that my policy had in fact lapsed I found myself in a real bad situation and it has been a few months with no transportation.

Clarification as to how my insurance lapsed: Our policy began towards the end of Nov. when we received the vehicle from my uncle. I thought that my S.O. had paid the entire 6 months of the policy. We moved in the middle of Dec. For whatever reason (still not sure why) nothing from the ins. co. forwarded to the new address. My S.O. believed that I was paying the monthly bill., I thought it was paid, clusterfuck ensued.

No transportation means that I also can't get any follow-up medical care that I need for my head injury. I had an intraparenchymal hemorrhage and had to have reconstructive surgery done on my scalp to cover the  10 cm x 5 cm area where my skull was exposed. Right now it looks pretty lumpy and gross and scabby, I have no feeling at all in parts of it and extreme pain in other parts. I also still have nightmares and have a lot of trouble sleeping. I used to be a voracious reader, but can no longer read books, though I have worked my way back up to short stories and articles which is a huge improvement over a few months ago. I'm supposed to see a nueropsychologist in August to have my brain functions evaluated, but I figure that will be yet another appointment that will be cancelled without being rescheduled.

No transportation also means that my S.O. wasn't able get to work, he lost his job and has had no luck finding a new job within walking distance. With no income coming in the bills have been piling up. We had the water shut off 3 weeks ago and have to get water from a nearby spring for washing-up, cooking, flushing the toilet etc. Our landlord has been amazing and understanding through this but things have reached the point where he can't be understanding much longer.

The investigating officer upon interviewing me said things that completely contradict what he put in the police report. The skid marks at the scene in no way match up with the skid marks drawn on the police report. There were multiple witnesses at the scene who said that the other driver told them that her child had thrown something at her and she lost control of the car and she hit me, this is noted in the police report (at least it's noted that one witness said it, all other ""witnesses"" in the police report saw nothing at all). Yet the police report says that I sideswiped her. Her insurance company has not yet denied the claim, but they haven't done anything else yet either. I feel like my lawyer is barely even working for me at this point.

For comparison sake: [the other vehicle](http://i.imgur.com/5y1vxyV.jpg)

Meanwhile my entire life is falling apart, I am in tremendous amounts of pain and can't even go to the E.R. because I wouldn't be able to get home from there. I have been trapped inside my house since April, I had to explain to my child that we would have to live without running water for an indefinite amount of time, I know that worse is coming and I need to prepare myself for it.

I know that there really isn't anything that anyone can say to make this better or less overwhelming for me. I'm sick of being judged for it though and having people not believe me about it. I have a huge fucking crevice in my head, that's not something I'm going to lie about. Thank you anyone who took the time to read this.

TL;DR: Missing a chunk of my head and life fucking sucks.

717,cd8inm,False,,8,Found out my girlfriend does drugs and I can't stop thinking about it,whatsbotheringyou,"A few disclaimers/apologies:
-I currently working for another 7 hours and I'm working on this throughout my shift between rushes. I'm sorry if my thoughts seem to jump around.
-The drugs aren't anything of the major ones ex: heroine and cocaine

Ok here's a few placeholder names and ages. Coworker (cw) is in his late 20's and girlfriend (gf) and I are both 17

So this is what's bothering me. About a month ago I found out that my girlfriend used marijuana recreationally (no it is no legal in my state). J found out one day because after our shift we were headed to get wings with our coworker. I was slow clocking out because I felt the need to help out a little after my shift. Eventually I walked out back and saw the two smoking together. My first thought was ""Oh yikes I didn't know she smoked"". When cw saw me he asked if I was ready to go and we headed out. Before we sat down cw turn to my gf and said ""I wonder if it was a bad idea to smoke weed, cause now I'm about to drink a beer. Hope it isn't dangerous"". At this point I am just shocked. The rest of the night was me pretending to space out while my gf, cw, and CW's friend were eating. The next day I talked things through with my gf and told her that she can keep doing what's she's doing as long as she keeps herself safe (like not endangering her body or getting into trouble with the law). I also told her drugs were a touchy subject with me and to not talk about it in front of me.

Fast forward about a month to today. I'm in for a 10 hour shift with cw. While working I hear him mutter to himself, and I asked him what was on his mind. He turns to me and told me that he was wondering if he should start his mushroom plot (no not normal mushrooms) for my gf before or after he leaves for his vacation.

Now I get if you're scoffing at this and saying that I'm overreacting over something so small and I totally understand that. I was raised by a very strict dad and a paranoid schizophrenic mom. I hate to blame my mom but I think my habit of over thinking/worrying about every small thing comes from her. Ever since I was a kid, I was taught to be the type of person to always follow rules and to stay in line. This definitely made me a more reserved person who is afraid of taking risks no matter how small. Because of these things my brain is always running wild and it has been for the past 5 hours now. I'm just scared that she might get hurt while on drugs or even move on to stronger and more dangerous drugs.

I know you guys are going to say, so here's somethings I can answer now:

Why don't you ask your parents for advice?
- My parents wouldn't allow me to continue seeing her if they found out about this

Try to talk her into quitting?
- She is a free spirit who hates limitations/restrictions being put on what she can or cannot do. Also it is her life not my life and I shouldn't interfere too much.

Why don't you talk to her family about it?
- Her only family (mom and grandma) actually do these types of drugs as well

Any advice is greatly appreciated and even if you don't have any, thank you for reading",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/cd8inm/found_out_my_girlfriend_does_drugs_and_i_cant/,12,"Let me preface by saying yes, you can trip out on marijuana and have a bad high. And the risk for bad highs are hundred fold for magic mushrooms. However, the risk of long-term mental damage is very low.

You cannot be physically addicted to either of those substances, but can be mentally addicted or addicted by habit. As these two drugs are disassociates, meaning they allow you to separate emotionally and mentally from reality, the biggest question is why does she feel the need to do these drugs. 

As a boyfriend, you don’t own her life so you cannot tell her to not do drugs. However, you can be there as her guide in life and someone who wants to understand the reason behind why she makes choices you do not understand. 

Many people do disasscoiative drugs to deal with stress or pain, and if they do it everyday, the drug starts inventing reasons for you to keep using. Back pain, creativity, stress, sadness, loneliness, fun, food. All of these can be solved via sober means, and these drugs offer a shortcut to certain states of bliss and self realization. Occasional use should be tolerated. Daily use should not be tolerated and the root cause for such daily drug habits should be uncovered. 

I recommend asking the following questions from an understanding standpoint:

If you are 100% happy, would you smoke weed or take mushrooms?

Why do you feel the need to do these drugs?

If you stopped doing these drugs, would you feel bad? ",2019-07-14 21:27:29

But I'm starting to realize that its never going to happen for a few reasons. I can't afford to get any decent higher education, my dad is very rich but I'm basically not his kid anymore since I chose my mom over him because he was physically abusive and he told me to never expect a dime from him. I'd consider myself to be somewhat bright, I make straight A's in average classes, but there are kids who are ten times smarter than me in the higher classes and they would get a scholarship over me in a heartbeat. Right now I'm looking at a steady job as a coder, it pays well and is pretty easy work. But I know that that won't make me happy and that being a conservationist is what I've always wanted. I've always thought about how lucky people like the Irwin kids are who were bound to get my dream before they were old enough to want it. I've been so depressed, but it's not like I hate myself it's the fact that I hate what my future is looking like.

I'm also a huge fan of the Irwins and I'd love to visit them someday.  Being able to work or volunteer at the zoo would be really cool too. 

What can you do to get yourself there? 

1. Keep working hard, good grades count. You don't have to be smart to get good grades, but it helps. Good work matters more (take it from somebody with a Master's degree). Ask questions when you don't understand and your teachers/professors will enjoy having you around. :) 
2. Now that you've worked hard, apply for some scholarships and ask the teachers you impressed to write you good letters of recommendation. A lot of scholarships is luck- finding one that fits you, winning it, etc.- but you will have MUCH better chances if you have strong letters!
3. Apply to colleges with awesome study abroad programs or programs along the same vein of what you'd like to do in the zoo. Go to those colleges, do well there. 
4. If you can study abroad in Australia, DO IT!!! I think the zoo does offer internships; I've looked it up. 
5. Don't give up hope!!! You've chosen a dream job that can be very difficult to achieve. Anything is possible with hard work, especially since you're still young. 
6. If it's worth anything, when I was 15-16 I really wanted to go to university in Australia for biology. I looked into different programs there. My life has taken a drastically different turn since then (I am now a proud I/O Psychologist) but I remember being so excited to talk to people about my dreams!

700,1khjr9,False,,10,I'm holding on to hope,whatsbotheringyou,"Recently out of a relationship that, to me, was magic.  I was older, she's in grad school, it was an LDR.  We were engaged.  She broke it off because she was confused and conflicted.  Didn't want to be a step mom or really a wife.  Wanted to live a little first.

Had she said, ""I don't love you any more"" or ""I'm seeing someone else"" I'd have been devastated, and I'd have moved on.

But, she said, ""I don't know what the future holds.""  And ""I just need to be on my own for a while.""  And ""In a few years, who knows?""

Now, I know, as a grown person with a lot of relationships under my belt, that these are all nice ways of saying she doesn't want to be with me any more, and she wants to be with someone else.  My problem is, I can't let go of the hope.

This isn't a matter of forgetting her, or not loving her any more.  And I haven't talked to her in weeks.  But I've had worse relationships before and I've had a hard time letting go.  She was the best thing that's ever happened to me, I celebrated that every day, openly told her, shouted from rooftops.  I'd planned to quit my job, leave my kids with their mom (joint custody) and move to be with her.  I'd have given up everything.

So now I'm insanely holding onto the hope of maybe.  I'm holding onto ""who knows?""  I'm 40 now, how long do I wait?  How long can I wait?  To me it's worth waiting, but I don't know if I'll be able to.  I can fill the time while I'm waiting, but when do I stop?

Knowing how relationships end, and what you're supposed to do is one thing.  But how do you deal with removing that hope?  Has anyone else ever hoped and waited and won out?

I'm sorry to say it, but don't hold onto hope.  Were you important to her?  Yes.  Are you still and will you always be?  Probably, but just not in the way you'd like to be.

I was planning on getting married a number of years ago.  I was going to move to the city she lived in, and we were looking for apartments together, etc.  Then she left.  I don't know her exact reasoning, but it wasn't because she didn't love me.  It took me years to get over it.

Now I have a new girlfriend who I'm pretty crazy about.  She's not better or worse than the last one, but a completely different person who also makes me happy.  Had the last relationship gone as planned, my life would be very different now; not better or worse necessarily, but different.

Right now, you're sad that things didn't go as planned, because you're experiencing the painful results of that.  Eventually you'll experience other wonderful things in your life that you wouldn't otherwise have, and the pain won't be so bad.

I also have a short answer:  you shouldn't be with someone who would hurt you so badly.  I know it sounds terrible to have someone say this about the person you love more than anyone, but they aren't all that, and you deserve better. ",2013-08-16 13:45:21

My aunt was good friends with one of the teachers, who could tell something was wrong and tried to help.

Article Two: One of the year 11 students jumped from the top floor balcony when I was in year 9.

One of my best friends was in the building at that time - about five minutes before I arrived - and she saw it happen. The school went into lockdown and classes continued like normal after two hours but everyone was hysterical and refused to do anything. Most of us ended up sitting in classrooms listening to people screaming and crying about what happened. His sister had to be taken out of her lesson and sit in the office for a while. No one got sent home but no one really had lessons that day, either. The year 11 student did live past the event but I don't know what happened to him after we both left high school.

I've got a HUGE deadline looming at work. I've only got 3-4 weeks remaining, but my immediate bosses keep changing what I need to do or forcing me to start a fresh.

I'm putting in 60-70 hour weeks and getting nothing but, ""we need you to start again, but do it differently"" out of it. The work I'm doing is not possible with the tools I'm using, but management wont hear any of that, they just keep telling me that it ""must be doable. If not, try using this tool/technique that we found after a few seconds of Googling,"" which has lead to me wasting days on end collecting evidence that something can't be done, rather than it just being accepted and worked around.

Every few weeks, I'm being taken away from my current project and told that I'm spending a week doing completely unrelated tasks, ""because someone has to do it,"" which is impacting on my ability to reach the deadline.

Because of all the above, I'm not sleeping or eating properly, neither am I getting time to exercise so my health has taken a direct hit. I'm supposed to be taking a big exam (that has nothing to do with my employment) soon, but studying for that has been put on hold (which means that I'll forfeit my entry, or will do poorly). My relationship with my SO has taken a *HUGE* hit, too. She lives 150 miles away, and I'm not getting the time to go see her or her to come see me.

My colleagues seem to know more about my current (deadline) project than I do, which tells me that someone intentionally isn't telling me what I need to be doing for a reason. The extremely exhausted, *VERY RECENT* stomach ulcer suffering side of me is left thinking that there is a very specific reason why folks are telling me things (paranoid, I know).

Whenever I have to call someone I don't know (e.g. making an appointment, calling customer service, calling a store to find out their hours/if they have something in stock, or anyone I don't really know), I end up staring at the phone for up to several hours trying to put it off. And when I eventually do end up dialling the number, in those long seconds of dial tone, my heart is pounding and I get really sweaty as I try to remember what I'm about to say because as soon as someone says ""My name is ________, how can I help you today?"" I will automagically forget everything I had rehearsed in my head. Hearing ""this call is being recorded for quality control purposes"" makes me even more nervous because it makes me think that they are evaluating and judging *me* even though I rationally understand it's probably the specialist being evaluated.

The same goes for leaving messages. Sometimes I think this is even worse than getting a live person because I know that whatever stupid things I say are recorded and can be listened to and replayed many times. Once I hear the beep it's time for me to go but I simply end up stammering and trying to piece together ideas that I wanted to say (probably in the wrong order, too). The worst thing is I'll hang up when I think I'm done and I won't remember what I said and what I wanted to say but forgot.

This anxiety doesn't stop at phones. I am also horribly afraid of (inflated) balloons. Just the rubber ones, not the aluminum ones. When I see a balloon I freeze up because I know it could pop at any instant without any warning. **Seeing a balloon makes me want to talk on the phone all day with complete strangers.** I have been ~~forced~~ persuaded to play ""balloon popping"" games where the objective is to pop as many as possible and I basically end up with a panic attack, and when I explain that I'm afraid of balloons nobody takes me seriously. I mean my sister has even threatened to blow up a balloon and pop it if I don't do what she says, so I am forced to comply. I wish I could get therapy for this but I don't have enough money or time (as I'm in university).

I thought I had another close friend, but he was telling that same circle of friends what I had been confiding to him all along. 

So I feel betrayed.  My family is falling apart.  My stepdad has been cheating on my mom and was recently found out.  I broke up with my boyfriend (it was mutual) two weeks ago.  

I'm in grad school right now. I made a huge mistake.  I don't want to do what I'm going for anymore and I'm in a very specialized field so if I want to change careers I have to go back to school.  I'm in a ton of debt so I can't go back to school.

When I try to talk to family about my problems, my mom just says ""God has a plan for you."" Which is almost insulting and is certainly infuriating since I don't believe that at all.

Granted, these people don't casually appear overnight. I would just try and strike up as many conversations with as many different people and try see if anything works out.

Don't get bummed over it. One of my teachers went to University of New Orleans then went to grad school at Yale, it can happen.


Keep that rejection letter with you and let it fuel your desire to enter it, let it give you the energy to get good grades.

310,h7bqzo,False,,5,Speaking about my teenage problems,whatsbotheringyou,"My name is Javonte and I’m a 15 year old boy who’s a nerd that has no life and is socially awkward. I know this might just be a teenage problem but I need to talk about it somewhere. Since I’m socially awkward I have no friends, no life, or no girlfriend all I do is sit in my room watching YouTube and play whatever game I can find on my xbox of course with no friends. 

  I really want to fix these issues but it’s hard for me because I have no one to talk to about this. I’m starting to think about what my future is going to be like whenI try to go for a career if I can't even hold a conversation for more than 10 seconds or will I be able to have a wife and kids( I doubt many females like awkward guys). Having no friends also gave me low self esteem so I tend to avoid having to talk to people because I don’t want to make it awkward so I become socially distant even from family. 

  My awkwardness probably came from my hard time being vulnerable that’s why I’m speaking about my problems on Reddit( it was hard enough for me to write this) and not to my mother because her words won’t really help it’ll feel bland and not very sincere(it’s because I live with her and she knows everything about me except this) I also feel like I’ll be judge upon in a bad way from many people. The answer would be to obviously speak to people more but it’s harder than it looks because I’ve been dealing with as long as I can remember and I can’t just do it because my mind will start to think negatively and I’ll look down upon myself thinking that they probably think I’m weird and strange for whatever reason. 

  I don’t want to be like this forever and I know I have to put effort and work into fixing it but it’s extremely difficult for me and I’m sure how.

782,1ypjvz,False,,17,Have you seen the opening scene from Idiocracy?,whatsbotheringyou,"That feels like my life right now. I've been feeling very lonely lately and I am watching each of my friends get everything right the wrong way, while I sit here doing things (mostly) right and I'm getting everything wrong.

All I've ever wanted in life is to raise a family. I'm not a crazy girl; I've known people who have their marriage collage they created when they were ten who have been dreaming about getting that perfect rock from whatever man is pleased enough with them to ask them to spend the rest of their lives together - that's not me. I'm not baby crazy. I just want to meet a great guy that can be my partner and equal and wants to raise a family like I do.

Meanwhile, all of my friends are irresponsibly and accidentally getting pregnant, having children, and somehow finding their happiness in all of this. I'm not talking about ""best-of"" happiness, I'm not simply trolling their Facebook pages and looking at the surface of their edited lives, we're talking about people I'm very close to that I know well. People whose houses I spend time in and not as a guest. They really are pretty happy. Not perfect, nobody is, but happy.

Why do I have to be the one watching everyone else get what I want in life simply because I'm responsible with my birth control and discerning about my choice of bed partner? Why am I alone when I'm the only one of us working on personal growth and trying to better myself to be in a great position to achieve my goals? I'm the only one of my friends that even knows anything about children at ALL and yet they're popping them out like candy.

Please understand, this is a moment of weakness. Normally I let these things slide off and I understand that it simply isn't going to happen yet; what I'm doing is still right. I'm not going to poke holes in the condom of the next guy whose dick I trip over just for a fleeting chance at happiness. I know I'm on the right path, even if it's taking longer for me than it is for so many others. I am truly happy for their successes, it would not make me feel any better if they were failing.

It's just hard some days.

Some weeks.

In addition to this, a close friend of mine placed me firmly but gently in to the friend zone. That's a story in and of itself. He's not put off by my family attitude - in fact, that's something we agree on - but there are mitigating circumstances. It simply adds to my frustration in that...well, a guy who is up to the standards I would require of a future partner and father, someone perhaps a bit more attractive than I think I deserve, with all of these great qualities...isn't interested enough to give it a try. It's a blow to the ego, no matter the circumstances.

I know what to do about it, I'm just looking for a little bit of understanding. I obviously can't take this to either him or any of my friends with children without it being somewhat awkward, so I entreat you to give me some sorely-needed compassion. I just need an e-hug. Thank you.

TL;DR - Everyone is having babies except for me and I'm sad about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1ypjvz/have_you_seen_the_opening_scene_from_idiocracy/,11,"I hate to say this, but that opening scene could end up being your life, if you don't do some rather drastic shit soon.

I am trying to get you to be a little more realistic and I'm pretty sure baby fever talk will ward off potential partners if you bring it out too soon.

853,9c794y,False,,6,I was dumped,whatsbotheringyou,"I was just dumped by my girlfriend last night, and I don't know what to do. ""I can't really say I'm in love with you"" is what she said. This just came out of nowhere and I feel like I can't breathe. The day before yesterday I thought we were still madly in love, now I'm heartbroken. 

&#x200B;

I just wish I knew what went wrong. I wish she would tell me that I did something wrong, tell me that I fucked up, tell me I had abhorrent personality traits, at least then I could make \*some\* sense of it. But she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. She loves me but she's not \*in love\* with me anymore. How am I supposed to react to that? How can you say you love me on Sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on Friday? She keeps insisting that I didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am I supposed to understand that? I'm just hurt and confused.

&#x200B;

She stopped by my house last night to return some things I left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents I gave her for Valentines this year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent all night crying, I feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. 

&#x200B;

It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Whenever I was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. Despite all the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis, I always felt alright, because I knew that no matter what happened I had her beside me, and she made everything alright. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the year.

&#x200B;

The worst part is how nonchalant she was. She seemed just so apathetic about it. Our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and I was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. But when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. We were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. She said she doesn't see us having a future together; I saw us potentially getting married one day, I definitely saw a future with her. And she used to see one with me, I just don't know what changed.

&#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with this. Without her I just feel dead inside. Just last week I was so happy, now I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, now I feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. She said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. I don't think I could ever find anyone else as amazing as her.

&#x200B;

The only one I feel like I can turn to at this moment is my best friend. They try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but I'm a crying mess right now, and I don't feel ready to try to date again.

Being young is like being stuck in a bubble- the bubbles of your parents/friends/community. You're probably bored with that bubble. College will definitely help to show you what more there is to the world. Maybe for now you should go out and do things you normally wouldn't do within your bubble. Talk to the kid you don't have anything in common with. Do you like sports? No? Go join one. Listen to music you think is bad, and then dance to it. Go explore and have an open mind.

I know my fear of learning and asking questions likely comes from when I was younger, and my mother would yell and scream at me for hours when I tried to do my homework (if I messed up the answer to a question). That makes it hard to actually focus on my work to this day.

They want you to succeed, they want you to prosper. Just tell them you're having trouble. Nobody utilizes office hours like they should and I just think its ridiculous. By far the biggest difference between high school and college, in my experience, is how far your instructors will go to make sure you're comfortable in their class and are keeping up. If your professors have office hours, just go by. Worst case scenario is they kind of blow you off. Maybe even let them know its a big deal to you because you're afraid of being wrong and needing to be told how to do things.

I tried to organize it a little bit so similar issues are near each other and it flows a little bit, but it's almost 3 am and I've been awake for 18 hours on 4 hours of sleep.

Just to preface this with a little bit about myself: I'm 23, in my sixth year of college and what should be my last year of engineering school. I grew up in an upper-middle class family. My parents pay for my rent, school, car insurance, gas, and cell phone. I had an internship over the summer and they liked my work enough that they're letting me work part time from school (about 10 hours away; they gave me a laptop and I connect remotely).

One of the classes I'm in is being offered for the last time this semester and I don't know what will happen if I don't pass. Everybody is expecting me to graduate in May, and I don't know if it will happen. I just want to be done with school, but I can't make myself put forth enough effort to pass any of my classes. I would love to talk to my family about it, but they don't seem to care. If I get a bad grade, all I hear from my parents is things along the lines of ""We know you can do better"" ""Are you talking to your professors and getting help"" and ""Are you still going to graduate on time."" I would talk to my professors, but when I actually do manage to do my homework, I procrastinate so much that there's no time for me to go see them. I was a straight A student through high school and got a 28 on my ACT so they expect me to be a straight A student in college. I mentioned that I was planning to stay at school and take one last class over the summer, and my parents' reaction was asking if I could take the class in the spring semester because they want to stop paying rent. I understand what they're doing for me is expensive, but there's no inquiry of why I'm taking a summer class. Even though I'm so close to finishing, I really just want to take time off of school and figure out my life.

My mom is also obsessed with losing weight. She lost a bunch of weight a few years ago and still complains about being fat (for the record, at this point she is probably underweight), but that's an issue she has to worry about. What bothers me about it is that she's always pushing me to lose weight. I want to lose weight, but I barely have the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. At one point she said if I hit 250 lbs she would take me to get some form of weight loss surgery. I understand that she wants me to be healthy and live a long time, but the way she goes about it just makes me feel like a fat piece of shit.

And if that doesn't kill my self-esteem and confidence enough, I've never had a girlfriend, or even been on an actual date. One girl kissed me at a party once and I obsessed over that for a week. I have plenty of female friends, and I have no more problems talking to girls than I do guys, but I either can't read the signs when a girl is into me, or they just don't seem to be into me. I feel like part of my problem is that I suck at/hate small talk, but I'm so self-conscious about everything that I can't seem to carry a conversation unless I'm really comfortable with the person I'm talking to.

I seem to spend all of my time on Reddit, Netflix, or both. I used to love reading and video games, but now I get bored within a few minutes. The only game I seem to be able to play for extended periods is Fallout 4, but even that gets boring after an hour unless my friend is on Teamspeak with me. I remember when I was playing Fallout 3 and New Vegas I would just get sucked in and play all day and have a blast. I miss being able to do that. 

I feel like I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about my life. I tell my friends the ""fun"" stuff, but I seem to pretend that if I don't talk about what I'm really dealing with, it doesn't exist. It works great for evenings out, but it's not working long term. 

This post took me an hour to type when I really should be working on a lab report that's due in 5 hours. I haven't started, and the reports for this lab class take longer than that to get a passing grade on. At this point I'm just going to sleep for those 5 hours and force myself to go to class. It just all feels so pointless, especially this late in the semester.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3utqra/pretty_sure_i_have_depression_not_sure_what_to_do/,9,"OP I know you don't want to hear this, but try to get some exercise.

157,1pzfl0,False,,12,My dad is heartbroken because I accepted a job 100 miles away.,whatsbotheringyou,"**EDIT: The title should say 1000 miles away. Sorry about that..**

I am a 24 year old woman and I have been looking for a full time job in the creative field since i graduated from college last year. I also have been wanting to move somewhere new and see and experience more of the world. I've lived in Tennessee my whole life and I've never experienced living somewhere completely new and different. Just to the next town over for school. My boyfriend moved a thousand miles away for grad school, and we don't want to do long distance anymore. I got an offer at a company I really like where he is that is perfect for me. I accepted it today, and I have to be there on Monday. So it's pretty quick.

I told my dad about the job offer today and that I would be going, and he's really upset about it. My father is very traditional in that he grew up in a rural area where most people don't move more than a few miles from home after they get married and start a family. I've been taught my whole life that family and the farm we grew up is pretty much the most important thing on earth. Family sticks together and stays together.

He went to the same college 50 miles from where he grew up (and where I grew up). After he graduated, instead of moving to where he could have gotten an engineering career started, he moved home and helped his parents run the family business. And he got married, had a family and never left. He claims he has no regrets he chose to move home to take care of his parents. He felt it was his duty and privilege to do so and be there every day. (They both passed away over ten years ago.)

We are very alike in many ways, and he expected I would do exactly what he did with his life. But I've gotten an urge to go somewhere new and see the world. I am almost 25 and I want more out of life than the family business and family farm. I went to the same college he did and graduated and had to move home a few months after due to being unable to find a job in my field. Now he wants me to carry on the business and use my skills in the business to make pretty good money, or start my own business. But that's not really what I want to do. Not right now, anyway. And I have no friends here. Just my dad and cousins and younger brother. (And the place he lives is 20-25 minutes by car to town. It's very isolated, but a beautiful place to call home.)

My mother and I are estranged, and she hasn't really been in the picture for half of my life. When she left us, he made a lot of sacrifices to take care of us as a single father. His whole life is focused around me and my brother. And he sees me as ungrateful for all he's done for me. He always tells us that the farm is ours when he is gone, and he's saved all of it for us, his children. But it feels like the price of his gift of raising me is living up to his expectations and the life as he's planned out for me.

I told him about the job, and he got really quiet and acted like I'd broken his heart and betrayed him. He knew that I was looking to move there, but I think he didn't expect it to happen. I am going against everything he raised me to be, and he believes I don't care about family like he does.

He also isn't ok with me moving to the city my boyfriend is living in, and staying with him. Our relationship is pretty serious, but we aren't engaged or anything. I think this is the right thing for my life, though, and I just wish he could be emotionally supportive. It's already a scary transition, having to make new friends and start over somewhere new. His negativity and complete disapproval of my choices makes it seem 10 times harder. I feel like I owe my dad so much for the good live he's given me, and I feel awful for hurting him.

**tl;dr** I am not living up to my dad's expectations of living on the family farm and working in his small town family business. I accepted a job offer in the city where my boyfriend is in grad school and he's very upset with me and I feel awful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1pzfl0/my_dad_is_heartbroken_because_i_accepted_a_job/,19,"Yikes, yeah, that zero makes a big difference.

769,28gdjo,False,,5,I am an incredibly ungrateful child.,whatsbotheringyou,"So, I'm probably a terrible person. I'm 15, and I've been routinely stealing money for my parents, for no better reason other than 'I want sweets' and 'I just want money'. My mother found out, and she came and talked to me the most upset she's ever been. I'm extremely disrespectful to my parents; I ignore them and stay in my room when I come home from school, and I know that I am incredibly up myself in terms of I think I know everything. and the worst thing is, though their parental methods have maybe been a bit harsh (sometimes being gently hit, yelled at a lot), they don't really deserve it. They really do a lot for me, pay money for me to go to an expensive school and go on extra curricular programs and what-not even though my mother revealed that we are apparently not as well off as I believed. 

What I need to know is this:
a) How I can fix my relationship with my parents
b) Stop habitually stealing from them,
c) Generally fix above mentioned personality flaws.

It has around a 6% overall acceptance rate, so I was never terribly optimistic in the first place, but I really fell into the delusion that they would accept me. I'm honestly not upset about the decision itself, but rather I'm a bit angry with myself about how I'm at peace with this. The reality is that with this rejection I need to take the next two or three weeks to write the remainder of my college applications and do well on my finals, but it's just not sinking in quite yet. I know I need to finish this semester strong, but it's honestly hard, especially when I counted on my acceptance as almost insurance for the remainder of the year. I don't need to hear that I'm still a strong student, because I am proud of my standardized testing and the culmination of my four years of high school but I'm a bit at a loss for words right now.

895,2pvdqf,False,,3,Lost,whatsbotheringyou,"So I have been in a depressed state for over a year now, I'm 23 and and I recently just dropped out of college to try and get my life together. My girlfriend and I broke up a little over a year ago and I can't seem to find the motivation to do anything anymore. For the first time in my life I was able to be completely comfortable with someone and be myself, no reservations. We dated for close to 3 years and I admit I wasn't the best boyfriend. I became too comfortable with my position in life at the time and had started to take her and other things in my life for granted. So she graduated in the spring of this year and ended up moving back home, about a 14 ish hour drive. Even though we broke up a year ago and she graduated this spring, we had been talking every day and hooking up still but she was also talking to another guy back home. So of course she ends up dating this guy as soon as she moves back home and I feel like absolute shit. They broke up after only a couple months of dating and we have still been talking on and off while they were dating because we were very close and shared a real connection. She says she loves me but she is scared for what could happen to us because of the situation we were in before and how it negatively affected both of us. And although I can't argue with her on that point because we ended on a stupid fight that was my mistake, I know in my heart that this is the girl that I am supposed to marry and I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore for myself. Nothing seems worth the effort to me anymore, I don't find humor in anything and I am overall just filled with regret day after day for over a year now. I've hooked up with other girls and hung out with friends more and done all the moving on advice, I have even gone to therapy for about 7-8 months and took the pills they gave me but it didn't seem to do anything for me. I felt like an emotionless zombie while I was taking the pills and no matter what I did that day I would always be lying in bed for a few hours thinking what could have been and what should have been if I wasn't such a shitty person and took advantage of the great opportunity I had in front of me. Now I don't even care what happens to me. My uncle committed suicide nearly 25 years ago and I don't think I could do that to my family and my Dad after what they have been through with all of that. So I have been talking to this girl a lot recently over the past month or so and she just got back together with her new boyfriend after breaking up with him less than a month ago. She talks about moving back down here when she has the money saved up in a few months because she doesn't enjoy living back in her hometown. And part of me believes her because we talk so much and I know she doesn't like it there from her job to her situation at home with her stepdad. She tells me she doesn't know what she wants from her new relationship with her ex boyfriend now that they are dating again but I know if she were to give us and me another chance, I could be everything and more she has ever wanted. It's just if I am not her everything, I might as well be nothing. And I know it sounds sad to feel like your happiness is so dependent on another person but I really haven't been happy my whole life. I remember in high school before I ever met this girl in college I got so drunk over spring break and locked myself in a bathroom threatening to kill myself. Honestly I don't consciously remember doing that but I know that there was probably a reason behind it and that these suicidal thoughts and depression were something that was ingrained in me without myself really knowing they were there. I just feel that I could get my life on track and make myself and my significant other so happy if she would just give me the chance. I don't know what else I can say to her that I already haven't to try and prove to her how serious I am about us and our relationship. She even went as far to say recently, while she just got back with her boyfriend, that she wants me to be the father of her children and spend the rest of our lives together because it is something I know we both deeply want and have talked about multiple times while we dated for 3 years. I just feel so lost and do not know what to do with my life, I feel I have the wits and capabilities to do anything this world offers me but I could not care less unless I am sharing my life with her. I know things are supposed to get better with time but every single night for over a year I think about her and just fill myself with regret for what I let slip away. I feel I don't deserve to live anymore because I haven't done anything significant with my life and I haven't thoroughly enjoyed anything for multiple months. Right now I am at the point where I have realized that not everybody can live a happy life and I will just be floating on feeling like shit until I eventually die one way or another. When you know nothing else will make you happy but you can't get the one thing in the world that will make you feel like you are worth something, what are you supposed to do with the rest of your life?

483,1qyt38,False,,11,"My roommate is pregnant and in jail. Now I'm home alone with her boyfriend, who I hardly know.",whatsbotheringyou,"This is suuuuch a long story so there may be a wall of text. Bare with me.

So I'll start with this. My pregnant roommate is E and her boyfriend is A.

We met A when E and I first moved to Idaho from California. He was quiet, shy, but really cool. So fast forward until about two months ago. E and A start dating and he tells her that he had a malignant tumor removed from his testicles a couple years back, making it hard to produce children. E has ALWAYS wanted kids, but she accepted it and continued the relationship. So about 3 weeks ago, I went to go buy a pregnancy test for myself and she mentioned she hasn't gotten her period in over a month, but she wasn't even considering that she could be pregnant, given A's medical history. I bought a 2 pack. One for me and one for her. Hers came back positive, mine negative. Even though she wanted to be married first, she was ecstatic. How could she not be? The guy only had a 7% chance to make a baby, right?

He's sleeping as this is happening, so she goes to wake him up to tell him the amazing news! What does he do? Wakes up, acknowledges her, and goes right back to sleep. For someone that has that small of a chance to get someone pregnant, he sure seemed totally lax about it. 

Next day, he starts to seem more excited. Maybe he was just tired. Whatever. 

Recently, he's been giving E a lot of shit for staying in contact with her ex husband. Totally acceptable. She still talks to him for multiple reasons. He is the one person that knows her best in this world, and he has being seeing a therapist due to his military related PTSD and she wants to make sure he's doing okay. They don't talk often.

He has threatened to leave of she doesn't cut him out of her life. She tried explaining that she would like to ween herself off him, because he has always been her best friend. A has threatened to leave her, pregnant or not, multiple times. 

So today, I got a Facebook message from someone that has deleted their profile, so it just said ""Facebook User"" with no picture or anything. This is what it said:  

""Tell your friend. (E) to check her messages in the OTHER folder I sent her a very informing message.. or better yet you send it to her if you care about your friend.

Just to let you know [A] has a kid he prolly hasn't even mentioned to you.. he hadn't mentioned to me neither. He is a pathological liar and most of the things that comes out of his mouth are nothing but lies.. he is what? 30 now and has accomplished nothing and you seriously need to get Tested for Hep B and HPV im just letting you know for your babys sake or unless he lied about that too. He is a cheeter and lies to make himself look cool. He prolly even told you he wrote a song about you and its the same song that he sings to every girl.. wich he doesn't play well at all. You will see his true colors eventually girl im just giving you a heads up. All he does is live off of others and cause drama. He even slept with his brothers wife and prolly still does. I was only 17 when we were together and he was 29 but told me he was 22.. keep that in mind. you need to look in his facebook messages so you can see what he has been writing to me saying he is just with you because he doesn't want to be alone and other things... go check it out... His brother was the one who told me about his kid he doesn't even try to see so I contacted the girl and she told me he was running from child support and not once has he seen his daughter but yet he tells people he cant have kids because he has ball cancer wich is a total lie by the way! her name is lauren magby if you want to look her up and ask her about it. 


give her this message please!! thank you! (:""


So, naturally, I tell E about it. 

Long story short, they fought and he grabbed a knife and threatened to kill himself, blah blah, he trie to take her laptop from her so she pushed him. Then when she read Facebook messages of him blatantly flirting with other girls that were sent TODAY, she threw a styrofoam cup of coffee at him and now she's in fucking jail. He officially moved in about 2 weeks ago, so I just have to deal with him...and I can't believe a fucking word that comes out of his mouth now...  

Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have extreme confrontational anxiety. But when a knife became involved, I went in to where they were (in her bathroom) and said, ""Did I just hear there's a fucking knife involved now!?""

A: ""No""

E: ""Yes, he sitting on it!""

A: Wo cares, I'll only be hurting myself!""

Me: ""Are you seriously implying that killing yourself wouldn't hurt her!?!?""

A: ""She's going to leave me!""

Me: ""Anytime I've heard any mention of anyone leaving, it's been YOU threatening to leave HER! She is fucking pregnant! Man the fuck up!!!"" 
Then I left for work.

Sorry, needed to get this off my chest because I normally vent to E.

You choose the people in your life, if your concern is evicting him will cause him to be all dramatic you're probably right. So finding a safe way to take care of the situation but still removing him is probably a good path to go down.

61,g7fhoz,False,,9,I learned how to set boundaries and it made me realize how toxic and manipulative my friend/roommate has been towards me.,whatsbotheringyou," Hello,

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships.

Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. 

I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 1: Accused of stealing butter [https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4](https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4)

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years.

443,34iw04,False,,6,pregnant ex gf,whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry it's long.  

Moved to a city with a girl about a year ago. Before moving, in the early stages of our relationship, I got her pregnant.  We were using, minimally and incorrectly, various forms of contraceptive...it was stupid and bound to happen. We talked about options and went with abortion.  It was a hard decision that neither of took lightly, on the contrary, it is a very heavy decision to make.   
So fast forward a few more months, we decide that we are the real deal and that our early tribulations are only a testament to our devotion, yada yada yada...moved across the country for a change of scenery and to kill time (i'm working on getting into professional school in the mean time).   
A few months in, our relationship heads south- the details do not really mean anything to this story, only that it's turned south for me meaning I am the one falling out of love, not her. I end up breaking up with her, but we still have a lease together and still really only ave each other in this new city. So to avoid breaking lease, which we couldn't afford, we just rode the lease out. Me sleeping on the couch a lot (we had a 600sq ft apt).  Now, there was no animosity or real contempt or anything. I just fell out of love with her and made it clear that once the lease is over, I'll be gone. She said she would rather spend this time with me doing fun things together than just to lose me now and possibly never see me again (i had plans to move back across country having gotten into my professional school) Under this pre-condition, we still spent lots of time together. We slept together once every couple of weeks, sometimes more sometimes less.  This went on for the months of february and march, I left in april.   
We haven't talked much since I've been home.  I've gotten over the relationship. It's harder for her.  We have mostly stopped talking. Until yesterday. She texts and calls. It was my birthday yesterday. I didn't want drama. I didn't respond. She sends a text this morning.  She is pregnant. She didn't want to tell me like that, but I didn't answer my phone when she called.  She sounded angry. Then she told me she is just angry at herself.  She had lied to me about taking her birth control for the month of march (even though I made a point to ask every time- sorry but she really sucked at taking the pill when she first started on it was necessary).  
I just can't even... why? It's so silly and so irresponsible.  She has told me not to worry about it. She is having another abortion in a couple days. She doesn't want my help, she says. She can do it on her own, she says.   It's all arranged.  I don't know what to do. I've made myself available to her (i told her this). If she needs anything I told her to let me know. Is this enough?  I know I share responsibility, but I'm angry that she lied to me about the birth control... i just don't, like why the fuck... it doesn't matter though. What's done is done. Happy birthday to me and my unborn children. fuck.

I absolutely see myself marrying him, raising a family with him, growing old and wrinkly and incontinent with him. The works. My family adores him, plans on him being an in-law, and I feel very welcomed and loved by his family as well. There are not enough good things I can say. 

That all being said, I have a nagging worry. When my BF first went off to college, he went to an exclusively engineering-centered college. Long story short, he hated it, got very depressed, and essentially flunked out. It probably didn't help that I'm going to a different school but am doing absolutely fantastic and love it. He's been nothing but supportive, but I can only imagine that it would be hard for him (I guess the mentality of, it seems so easy to her, why can't I do that?) 

Over the past year, he got back in touch with a great connection and is now pursuing a completely different degree. It won't be easy, but it plays into a part of his life he is very passionate about. Since being accepted and getting ready to leave (in just a few days!) he is acting similarly to the way he was when we first started dating. Very happy, more energy, even just a different look in his eye. This really helps me feel like he's in the right place, but I'm still scared. 

He says that what caused his downfall at the last school was that he'd either get bored with a class or confused or whatever and just stop showing up. He'd start gaming and just not go to class. He's got a lot more pressure now (everyone is keeping a closer eye on him, and not wanting to let the person down after they helped him get set up with the school), but I just hope that's enough.

I'm also afraid to tell him that there's a lot more at stake here than people being disappointed. He knows that my mom's ""blessing"" for us to marry is important to me...while she adores him, she has said in the past that if he can't, for lack of a nicer phrase, get his shit together, she personally feels that I shouldn't promise a future with him. I understand her reasoning, and while a marriage is so much more than a career or an income, her input has always been valuable and, honestly, spot on. 

Part of me doesn't want to talk to him about this because I don't want him to feel like we are anticipating him to fail or add more stress. But at the same time, I feel like this is a big deal and I kind of want reassurance from him. 

It's just been, you know, bothering me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3h9rdx/my_boyfriend_is_leaving_for_college_deep_down_im/,16,"Struggling with our own ambitions is an issue that can take a lifetime to tackle and even then many don't find it.

The only thing you can really do is be supportive and honest. If he's fucking around sometimes a helpful push back on track can be amazing. Just don't nag about it or anything if the problem arises instead just try to open his eyes and hope he makes the right choices.

I find there's nothing wrong with bringing it up, it opens up the channels of communication. Want to marry the dude someday? Get used to tough conversations. It's really important to have them and be open with each other cause the other roads a bad one.

He's probably anxious as shit about it too, talking might be therapeutic for both of you. It's all about how you approach it, hey I want to talk about stuff and see where your thoughts are is nice. HEY FUCK YOU DONT FUCK THIS UP THIS TIME CAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKUP is an extreme version but it's the same conversation in a very negative way.

He's gonna get bored and confused again, shit always happens. Hell instead of diligently working I'm posting this right now. It's very hard to stay on track for extended periods of time. He's gotta make sure he's tackling this in a new way or he'll fall into the same traps. It's a fair concern and nobody should be upset that their SO brings it up. (Nicely) ",2015-08-17 03:03:20

Last Monday, I woke up and had a pretty bad mood already, from the fact I had to do homeschool that day and I had quite the headache. My grandparents live across the street. I go look out the window to see my aunt’s massive Toyota van there. I was rather disgruntled, because my aunt is incredibly entitled. She hasn’t been following any of the measures meant to slow the spread of coronavirus. She hasn’t been wearing a mask in public, and she didn’t self-quarantine for the mandatory 14 days, and she both came from and showed in up hot spot states (Massachusetts and New York, respectively). Her local Walmart had 41 employees test positive for COVID-19, and she definitely didn’t wear a mask. This would’ve been just a coincidence, albeit a rather bad one, if not for the events I’m about to mention. My grandparents both came home from the hospital last weekend (grandfather for a urinary tract infection, and grandmother for rather extreme constipation). On Friday morning, an ambulance showed up over there. My mom went over there and found out why the ambulance was over there and also my entitled aunt mentioned that she had noticed a cough. As of right now, we aren’t sure if he has COVID, because he often coughs while eating and other times to clear his throat. And did I mention that he is a VERY high risk person, as he is going to be 87 in June, and relies on others for his most basic needs.

Have you tried understanding why you don't have any friends? It's maybe only because you're maybe shy. Be more outgoing, talk to people, especially the ones you have common interests with you. It'll be much easier to find friends that way. You could also spend more time on studying, and watching YouTube videos on topics you struggle might help you understand the topics better.

224,1j7ij1,False,,10,I attempted suicide today.,whatsbotheringyou,"And I feel I'll do it again shortly, the only thing stopping me today was that I was interrupted by an unexpected phonecall from someone who cares, but very little has changed about my situation.  
I'm twenty-two with two serious mental disorders, one is constantly stigmatized and portrayed everywhere as something dangerous and so I feel ashamed and scared to talk about it lest I hurt future employment opportunities, and the other only doctors accept is real, the public doesn't.  When you have an illness that affects every aspect of your personal life from who your friends can be, to your diet, when you can leave the house, what do you tell someone who asks about your employment when you know they'll brush you off as a lazy, incompetent youth who needs to suck it up?  What if I try and then am fired, over and over again for things not my fault, how would that look on employment records?  

Also I said something extremely rude indirectly to a friend and someone I deeply respect recently while I was intoxicated for a medication I'm on, and hearing how much it upset them today put me in so much shame that I couldn't bear it, and it was just a final straw to a very large pile that's been growing on me for a long time.  I feel even further shame that I almost killed myself without apologizing to them for being so rude, and still wouldn't hesitate to do so now.  I imagine I'll send them a suitable apology soon, god I hope they forgive me and that I haven't hurt them permanently.  Why was I such an idiot, I should have just turned the computer off after taking my pills.  And then I dragged someone into my own idiocy by accident, I'm sorry friend.  It was all my fault and I hope they aren't upset with you

The funny thing is, the incident that started my final step today?  Taking these fucking pills that turn my filters and smart functioning part of my brain off.

Firstly, I'm a 21 year old college senior majoring in Psych. The first 3 years of my college career went quite well- I worked in two research labs, got a grant to do my own research, joined the McNair Scholars program, started an honors thesis, and a worked towards a bunch of other academic pursuits. It was stressful, but I was lucky enough to not need to work, so I could devote all of my time to my studies.  However, I burned myself out and got depressed towards the start of my third year in college. I ended up withdrawing from 2 semesters of classes, and I watched my dreams of going straight from my B.S. to a PhD program deteriorate. I'm doing far better now, but I still have a lot to work on. 


I have to pass the quantitative section of my GRE and get my apartment in order. (My depression pretty much confined me to my room, and the rest of my apt suffered for it). I also gained about 20 pounds due to eating takeout all the time. 


I have a close friend who has expressed a bit of interest in dating me, but I'm starting to get frustrated at the conditions he's decided to place. He told me that before we start any type of relationship he 'wants to see me get my act together'. He wants me to lose the 20 pounds, get my apartment in order, get  into a Master's program, and start wearing make-up again. I feel like he should be more patient- studying for the GRE is taking up most of my day, and I don't want to get involved in so many things that I fall apart again. 

His life isn't completely together, hell, he dropped out of college. I don't expect him to change anything. Is it wrong of me to feel like he only wants to date me if I'm perfect?",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1v84ds/a_close_friend_of_mine_wants_me_to_get_my_act/,20,"I feel like this guy is trying to push you to do better.

Everything’s was going well.

766,2ayhb9,False,,1,What I've been through the last year or so and what I've done to get over these issues.,whatsbotheringyou,"Hello /r/whatsbothering you,

I'm making this post because this subreddit has done a lot for me during a difficult time in my life. I wanted to give a little perspective of myself, what I've been through, how I've overcome the obstacle I've faced, in hope that this may help someone out there. This'll probably be pretty long, so buckle up haha.

I'm going into my third year of undergrad as a biochem premed student and I've always done very well in school, until last semester. Something happened; I wasn't myself, I was stressed, and unmotivated. What I realize now is that it was intense burnout and depression. It was crippling to my relationships with people and my academic career. I was anxious, exhausted, and very depressed. If I could go back, I would tell myself that it was ok to admit that I needed help. This was the biggest barrier for me: fear of my own humanity.

To overcome this horrible empty feeling I tried everything. I tried exercising, learning new talents, trying a new sleep schedule, just working harder, etc. But there was no solution, I felt lost and I felt like I was spiraling into mediocraty, and the worst of it all was my inability to change anything.

So earlier this year I made a change. I've journaled for a long time trying to process my feelings, but when that stopped working I reached out to the counseling service at my school. This was what jump started my road to getting back to my newer, refreshed self, but it took a long time, and that wasn't the only thing that did it for me. The benefit from counseling came from having a person who could sit and talk through your emotions and get passed irrational thinking. Also it gave me insight to the issues in my life aside from academics (i.e. non-ideal family situations).

Along with counseling for a few months I:

* ran as much as I could

* learned guitar

* began reading

* focused on unhealthy habits like staying up too late, not having a consistent sleep schedule, working on stuff in bed, watching netflix in bed (I switched to [radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/) and it helped soooooo much with my sleep).

But it wasn't until recently that I felt like I was back on top and improving myself and from what I can tell it was a combination of these things that got me through a tough time as well as:

* being around and socializing with people

* **Nutrition**, it helped more than you can imagine. Having a balanced diet made me feel so much better and gave me more energy. This really came from cooking for myself and being aware of what I put into my body.

* Choosing something you are passionate about and learning about it (for me it is learning languages, music, and scientific material).

* Making sure to get out of the house.

* Separating my work, rest, and leisure areas and being very strict about it.

* The realization that I have the ability to choose how I feel and I have an active role in making sure I am happy.

* And finally, this is a big/hard one: **not procrastinating**. This is difficult because no one likes to do work, but the farther ahead you work the better education you will get and the more actual free time you have greatly increases.

That's pretty much it. A few other things that have given me inspiration is reading: [Think or Sink](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Sink-Choice-Changes-Everything-ebook/dp/B0036FTN3Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1405607716&sr=1-1&keywords=think+or+sink%3A+the+one), which explains how to actively choose how to think as well as the radio lab segment called [Secrets of Success](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91971-secrets-of-success/), which describes ways to come about success (it's long but worth it!).

Anyways, I've rambled on long enough. Hopefully someone out there finds this helpful, and if not I still want to say thank you to this subreddit. This community has helped me and I will continue to support it when I can.

While the planning for the wedding felt like it went on forever, the wedding itself (and the entire weekend, for that matter) was over in a flash.  He and his new bride have ventured off to their new home town to start their lives.  We couldn't be more proud of them.  

Since they have left, a depression has set in.  Not for the loss of my son, but I'm realizing that I am indeed getting old.  

I live a very structured life.  I'm very process-oriented.  Everything has a place and all action have a set of instructions and logic to follow to ensure proper completion.  For me, it's necessary because I am very forgetful and misplace things all the time.  MY life requires Six Sigma.  I find illogical actions and ""drama"" highly annoying. 

Through life, I've always kept a mental scorecard of the order of how things should go.  
Birth, go to school, graduate elementary, middle, and high school, job, marry, kids, kids graduate and become adults, kids move out, kids marry, grandchildren, death. 

I'm reaching the end of my ""process"" and it scares me. I have a lot of energy left for life.  I appreciate every single passing moment.  But every moment that disappears comes with a keen understanding that it is lost forever, never to be experienced again.  Every sunset is another day gone by never to be had again.  

*I'm heading towards death and there isn't a single damned thing I can do about it.*

On one hand, this should prompt me to *ENJOY* these moments and get everything out of them I can.  But that nagging voice constantly reminds me and drags me down.  Is this a mid-life crisis?  Is therapy in order?  What am I to do?

858,7vtq9a,False,,3,"Everything feels awful, and I’m not really sure why",whatsbotheringyou,"Sorry if I start rambling in this post. I have a lot I need to say, and I don’t know exactly where I’m going with this.

I’ve been feeling perpetually sad for a while now, and I feel like I don’t have the right to be. I have a nice life. I have people who support me. Income isn’t great, but it is good. Yet every day I feel completely drained of happiness, and I don’t know what to do about it.

I have a lot of inspiration for things I would love to do, but I don’t have the motivation to take the necessary steps to actually achieve those goals. It’s been leaving me desperate and wanting for something that I don’t feel I’ll ever reach, and I don’t know how to turn that attitude around.

I feel alone. I’m terrified of talking to people outside of my family and the few close friends I have, and even then, I am still nervous about some of the things I say. There are some things I love, one in particular that I don’t want to say, that are completely harmless, but I can’t talk about because I still feel some embarrassment towards letting them know so much about me.

My brain feels like an emotional mess. With those things that I can’t talk to people about, and I can’t find anyone in person who shares those same interests without specifically announcing it myself, it all just feels built up in my head, and it keeps weighing me down, and yet I am to nervous to talk about it anonymously or in person.

I feel like I have no true direction. Although I don’t like where I currently am, I don’t know where I want to be that would be realistic. I want to be a part of something, but I don’t know what I want to be a part of. I just feel like it’s all completely hopeless, and that I will ultimately be forgotten in the future, no matter what I accomplish.

Nobody really likes me outside of my close group of friends. More than anything, I probably just get lost in a sea of background characters in other people’s lives, just trying to carry on while other people have something that they actually feel like chasing.

It feels like there is just a hole in my head, and all of my thoughts get lost in there. I have a multitude of thoughts, but it’s all a mess, and whenever I try to reach in there and get something out, it makes little to no sense, and it keeps me from actually being able to talk to people about anything.

I don’t want to be a burden on others. My biggest fear is that people only treat me okay because they feel obligated to, not because they actually like me. I don’t want to cause other people pain or discomfort, and I always try to please as many people on each side as possible, but it also results in me being the last person I take into consideration for these things, and it is really starting to hurt.

My life feels like it’s made up more of distractions than actual choices. I will constantly be doing something simple to help ignore and suppress how awful I feel and how awful I am, and they are honestly one of the main things that has been keeping me going outside of my involvement with a group that I’m so embarrassed about that I won’t even talk about it anonymously over the internet, even though it is one of the main sources of happiness in my life.

I feel like I’m dying, and that I have already accepted my death, and that I’m not doing anything to prevent it, as I have completely given up on life. I don’t feel suicidal, but I do constantly wonder how people would react if I died.

Although everything seems stable, it feels like my life is falling apart, and I don’t care enough to stop it. I feel broken, awful, unlikable, lonely, disappointing, directionless, meaningless, etc... and I feel bad for feeling these things, and zi feel bad for how others will feel about it. What the hell is wrong with me?

Sorry for the long post, and sorry if some of it isn’t described well. There’s a lot of this that I honestly don’t know how to explain myself.

53,1ki6le,False,,17,My dad is trying his best to screw me over,whatsbotheringyou,"tl;dr- Sued dad for charges on credit card he opened in my name. He claims I lack consideration and have a misplaced sense of entitlement. 

Long story short, my parents opened credit cards and lines of credit in my name when I was 17. Essentially, my identity was stolen by them. Since December of 2011, I've been evicted from a rented house I was never on the lease for (and now have a $4600 judgement for nonpayment of rent), had $1750 stolen from my paypal account from a very valuable item of mine that I sold, and $8000 worth of debt from a chase credit card I never opened, a billmelater account I never used, and the wells fargo credit card I opened just to establish credit when I was 16. 

I had a combined total of $8000 credit card debt, $4600 judgement against me, and a missing $1750. I graduated college in December of 2011, and had no job. I moved back to our home of 13 years only to find out 2 weeks later that the home was forclosed and we had to move in early January. My parents rent a house up the street and used a Chase credit card in my name that I hadn't known about. They had used it to buy Christmas presents despite my dad earning over $200,000/year. They took out $3000 in cash advances to pay for the houses security deposit, maxing out my $3000 credit card to $4800 dollars -- something I didn't even know was possible. I was unaware of this at the time, not finding out about this credit card until May of 2012. 

May 2012 my parents start getting a divorce. My dad refuses to pay my mom spousal support until court ordered, resulting in evicting procedings. Both parents hid from me that, despite me never having signed the lease, I was also listed on the eviction. They both file answers, hide my court summons from me, and let me take the fall since I didn't show up for a court date I never knew about. 

I never knew about my eviction until December of 2012 when I tried to get my own apartment so I didn't have to live with my mother anymore. In July, I file small claims cases against my parents to repay me this debt. My mom and I come to a settlement and she's been making payments to me every month and still owes me $3000/$5500. My dad fought me tooth and nail, claiming my mom was to blame for everything. He has tried having me sign shady legal documents while trying to settle the case which would have me forefeit all the money, and an additional $46,000 he stole from me in 1997 that he never told me about. The judge granted me a full judgement as of July 31st (our court date). I discovered my dad has filed a supplimental opposition to my small claims lawsuit stating that ""Alexinedh is 23 years old, lacks consideration, and has a misplaced sense of entitlement. His mother and I paid for all of his expenses until he was almost 22 years old, and I helped him get a job with [Dad's employer here, not mine] where I have worked for many years."" 

This statement specifically infuriates me. I just want to be repaid for stuff I was never spected to pay for, such as his sewage/water bills, vacations he and my mother took without me, and a $1200 storm door they bought for a rental property THEY were renting. I don't even work for the company he works for and never have. I currently have a job that required 4 YEARS of applying for, which has a requirement of a very specific college degree just to apply for, at a company he has NEVER worked for. 

Most likely I would win an appeal process, it just bugs me so much that someone says this is my fault.

794,1tvedm,False,,7,I'm mentally and physically fucked.,whatsbotheringyou,"Where to start... 

I'm unhappy.  Straight up.  I've gotten into rut a that I'm not sure I can make it out of, and it's costing me the (so called) best years of my life. 

I'll try and speed this up so I don't bore any of you to death.  

It started two years ago when my  SO of ~4 years broke up with me for the 2nd (and final) time.  I was a typical depressed mess, as are most people in that situation, but I reverted back to my old habit of wrist cutting.  Focusing on the warm red burn helped me to take my mind off my ex and everything else I attempted just reminded me of them.  I got over it eventually, but something lingered.  It changed me. 

I used to be a fairly open person with my friends.  I could talk about anything, even some dark memories from the past. I could speak to them about my struggles with eating disorders, self-harm, and about how I was raped a long time ago when I was a much smaller person.  But now I am a closed, locked, double bolted, chained, welded shut door.

I don't even like my friends anymore.  I feel like they just put up with my shit so that if I kill myself, they'll be able to say ""at least we were there.""  

They always come to me with their problems because I listen and try to give the best unbiased advice about whatever is bothering them, and afterwards they will sometimes ask me how I am doing.  ""Fine.""  

Sometimes I like to see what I can get away with around them.  A couple months ago while we were all getting ready to go out for the night, I crept into my room when nobody was looking with a filet knife.  When it was time to head out, I sliced a pretty decent chunk right out of the inside of my forearm.  Half way to a house party, one of them noticed the blood trickling and told me I was bleeding. I played it off as though I was drunk and must have collided with something.  I also like to joke about killing myself.  They think its funny and sometimes they make suicidal jokes too.  

My self-confidence is pitiful.  I've resorted back to starving myself for a few days and then smoking weed and binging for a night.  I know I'm underweight, but I've never had an accurate image of what I look like.  I'm pretty short (5'5) so I feel like I will always look fat no matter what I do.  One of my friends (who's known me long enough to know about my eating disorder) says things to me almost daily that drag me down even further.  A couple examples: last spring a week before break I was encouraged to stop eating again before we went on vacation (and I did), a few days ago I was complimented on being thicker than I was at the end of the summer (I've lost 8 pounds since).  This person also has an outstanding history of cock-blocking me. 

I don't know if my hair has always shed this much, or if it's all falling out.  More than a year ago I noticed that I could run my fingers through my hair (like a comb) numerous times, and come up with a huge clump of hair.  I do this every night now.  I just sit here and run my fingers through my hair and keep track of how many of my hairs fall out.  Before long my keyboard is just a mess of hair balls.  Sometimes I put the clumps of hair into this little drawer.  There's probably enough to donate in there.. but my hair doesn't look much different, and I've become obsessed with proper hair hygiene. 

Falling asleep at night is a struggle at best.  I sit like a drone at my computer until 6 in the morning, and then when I finally decide that its time to try to sleep, something strange happens.  Just as I can feel myself drifting off to sleep, my heart goes absolutely crazy.  It's like a shot of adrenaline.  I'm not talking about a falling dream, or something like that.. My heart just starts racing out of nowhere.  

Waking up is near impossible.  I never feel well rested.  I skip a lot of class and I'm late to work every day because I just can't get up.  

Sometimes I physically feel what I can only describe as hate.  It's like an ice-covered firestorm in my skull that slowly corrupts the rest of my body in the form of a chill, shivering down my spine.  If it wasn't for my immense love for my pets and all animals, I don't know how I would cool down from this.  

The last thing I'm going to mention for now are my feelings for a person.  It's wrong, but I really like someone who is dating another one of my friends.  Sometimes I think that this person feels the same way.  Others have also expressed that they think this person is into me, but I deny it to them because even if they were... it would never work.  The person they are dating has been a friend for a very long time.  It is difficult to bury these thoughts sometimes.  


I don't know what I'm hoping to achieve by putting this stuff on here... but maybe letting some of this out will make me feel a bit better.  It's past 6am, so I guess I should try and get some sleep.

932,1xouu8,False,,3,My father killed himself 19 years ago and his family have completely shut me out.,whatsbotheringyou,"It's an incredibly confusing and knotted situation so I've bolded the ""off my chest"" rant, the paragraphs before the bold text are just background.


My father died in prison 19 years ago when I was five years old. and I feel like my aunts shame towards him has been pushed onto me and my sister.


From now on we will call her Susan.


Susan seems to have a control complex where if nothing goes her way, she pushes it out of not only her life but the rest of her families life too.


The best example that I can give of this is this: I last spoke to Susan when I was seven, but three years ago I found her on a genealogy website and contacted her again, hoping to learn more of this family that I had been shut out from.


Something happened, we didn't get along and she seemed in denial about her brother which made her tell me truths which ended up being false.


I met my other aunt a year later on the same website, we will call her Rachel... Me and Rachel got on extremely well but Susan was on speaking terms with her, what happened a few weeks after me and Rachel were getting to know each other is Susan found out and told Rachel that I went to Susan's house and caused trouble, to the extent where the police had to get involved and this made Rachel cut off contact with me.


It wasn't true, I'm nothing like my dad and I haven't seen Susan in roughly 15 years


A few years later (Last year, July) I e-mailed Rachel asking why she cut off contact and she explained everything but then explained that Susan had been lying to her about a number of things and that they weren't talking anymore so Rachel was prepared to give me a chance.


This was amazing, someone giving me a chance and not painting me with the same brush they paint my dad with! Fantastic! And These past six months with her have been fantastic, through Rachel I met my sister (My Dad wasn't on either of our birth certificates and I had no idea about her name or anything until a letter Rachel gave me helped me trace her). and I found out that I'm an uncle... I love both of them, my cousins and my two Nephew's to bits...


Though I digress, the main ""off my chest"" rant is this:


**Susan has contact with the rest of my cousins and another aunt, none of them speak to Rachel and Susan has been known to go to Rachel's house and cause trouble... I know all of my cousins names and even their Facebook profiles but even if I sent them a message I am 100% sure it would trickle down to Susan and Susan would give Rachel abuse for it... So I'm stuck, I have family who I can see but they're family that I can't let myself touch (For lack of a better phrasing)...**


**It's horrible, all my life this family has been shut off from me and because of this sociopath of an aunt I don't think I will ever get to meet them... It's so damn frustrating**",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1xouu8/my_father_killed_himself_19_years_ago_and_his/,11,"I imagine how frustant that must be. But I think that eventually people will stop being under Susan's influence, just like what happened to Rachel. I imagine that at some point, someone from the family will contact Rachel. And then things will get better.

756,2jhtfu,False,,9,So when are you having kids?,whatsbotheringyou,"My wonderful mother-in-law has been so kind to keep asking me for the last two years when I will finally be giving her a grand baby. 

My husband and I married three years ago after I had graduated college. I have an insane amount of student debt and pay over $1200/month just in loans. Because of this, we can't get a house, I can't buy a new vehicle, and for the love of god I can't afford a kid. My husband knew this going into it. He's super supportive. I love him very much. 

But today I finally snapped. I told my MIL that she will not be getting any grandkids out of me anytime soon and she better get used to the idea. A child would be wonderful. Yes I want to carry a baby and bring it into this world and love it but it is not an option at this point. A child, at this point in time, is an expense that we cannot afford. We cannot give it its own room. And I've seen the prices of diapers alone and there is no way I could afford those on top of everything else. So I have to tell my baby-hungry-uterus no. No babies. Not until the loans come down and the pay goes up. Not until we have a house. Not until we can give it the life it deserves. 

I had her in tears. I feel terrible. Part of me says that she had this coming. Part of me sees the lonely mother whose four babies are all grown up and left her with a big empty house. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to look her in the eye after this.

230,fq50i6,False,,5,I'm in a friendship that I know is toxic but I'm struggling to get out.,whatsbotheringyou,"So this is a story that has taken place over almost ten years so I'll keep it short and include only the most important parts. I'm wanting to make sure I'm in the right and maybe seek some advice from others who have been in similar situations.

When I was 17, I started my first real job working at a local store. Being in a small town, many of the younger people working there also went to my high school so I kind of knew some of them but had never really interacted much as I had always been a quiet kid who mostly kept to my own small group of other kids like me (non-rebellious, introverted, anti-alcohol). I don't know why I was like that. I came from a family that was totally cool with partying and normal teenage antics as long as we stayed safe, but I think because I was also a gay kid who had not yet come to terms, I isolated myself from regular circles because I didn't allow myself to be "" the real me"".

When I made my first friend at the store, I was introduced to people who finally made me feel comfortable with myself and within a year I was taking part in the bigger circles, had started drinking socially, and in general felt like life was more fun. This friend and I became very close over the next few months and soon we were calling each other ""best friends"". This is when I started to notice red flags.

I won't get into everything but it started as little control things. She would make me and our other mutual friend in a circle of three feel like it was a problem if we brought anyone else into the group, but when she wanted to hang out with other people it was fine. If we did anything outside of our little circle without her, she would make it clear (passive-aggressively) that she didn't like it. When she went off to college, she would be annoyed if we talked about anything we did while she wasn't there as if we were supposed to wait for her to come home before continuing our lives. It was some time in here that I started to feel anxiety whenever I would get a text from her. This anxiety continues to this day.  We would occasionally get into a fight over something ridiculous that should never have been a fight in the first place. Stuff that I just didn't see as a problem -and no reasonable adult would think it was- but she did. If our other friend was dating someone (I didn't date in the small town because I had no options), she would act like her friendship should still take precedence over the relationship. She was always number one and had to control everything. If something good happened to me, I knew she would only be happy if it didn't mean taking me away from her (or out of her vice-grip). I was constantly walking on eggshells. 

We both kept our jobs at the store and would come back between school and other jobs we were doing on the side. Eventually after going to school for a year (I was 21 at the time), I decided to come back to the store and start working my way up and developing a career at the company (let's not go into whether this was a good idea or not. I've just always been lost in terms of what to do with my life so I ended up taking the option that was in front of me). Eventually I moved out of state and took a management position at a store in the city. I would go home and we would hang out sometimes and it felt like the distance was a good thing for me. I no longer felt so controlled. 

The first summer, she and another mutual friend (our old bff had moved on and we had balanced the creepy little private friend group with a third member) came to stay with me for a few days so they could go to a festival that I wasn't interested in. When I left them alone in my house, she snooped through my bedroom closet and found some private things (don't ask lol). Needless to say, I was not happy to find this out later when she made fun of me for it. *She would later go on to retell this story without me present to people I would never share with*. I italicize here to emphasize the severity of this breach of trust in my eyes. I am a very private person and, frankly, I don't think it's unfair to see someone's bedroom *and especially their closet* as off limits when visiting. When confronted about it, she brushed it off and made it seem like I was overreacting and it was funny.

I eventually moved on to a new store in the same city and soon found out that she had decided to come back and move up as well despite having finished a degree. At this point, I was having work related anxiety and had closed myself off and hadn't spoken to her in a few months. I thought I had finally cut the cord and I could let the friendship die. That's when I found out that she was coming to work at the same store as me. This was not planned as she didn't know I was working there. I just about puked. We reconciled our friendship because we both thought it would be awkward to work together and have this rift between us. 

Almost ten years after the beginning, I'm now 26 and still entangled with this person I can't seem to get rid of. She still tells the private stories I have shared with her even after asking her not to. I no longer share anything with her outside of work talk because I know it will come back to haunt me. I never text her first because I keep hoping she'll take the hint but she never will. She still tries to control me and makes me feel guilty for any social activity that doesn't include her. I now try to hide the evidence if I even hang out with other friends. It's a feeling of anxiety that overtakes any fun I might be able to have. I feel like this is high school stuff that has continued into my adult life and I just want it to end, but because we work in the same building in equal positions, I am terrified to cause problems. I am trying to move on to another job but with this COVID-19 epidemic, it may not be for a while. We are essential workers and I have really strong job security at the moment and make decent money.

As I write this, I'm feeling unnecessarily stressed out because days ago she had said she wants to hang out tonight. I don't want her to text me because I know even if I say no, she will pressure me and make me feel guilty. I just don't want the confrontation and if I say no to her, she always makes my feel guilty.  I know if I go over there (and yes I know we should be distancing because of the virus - she doesn't care because we work together anyway), we will spend all night talking about how to fix my problems and she will tell me what's best for me and eventually I will agree just to shut her up even though I actually don't. *I feel that I am at a weak point in my life right now and I would rather be a recluse than have friends who don't make me feel good about myself.*

I'm just done feeling anxious and I want to be free to move on to new social circles and start rebuilding my life. I feel like friends shouldn't cause anxiety and when just a simple text gives you a sense of dread, it's time to cut the cord. I just feel like every time i find the scissors, she finds a way to get them out of my hands before I can.

So much for short lol. It's mostly a vent post, but if anyone has been in a similar situation, please feel free to chime in. I know I'm not the only one dealing with toxic friendships, but it's hard not to feel alone when you're in one. Thanks for reading!

TL;DR: I'm in a toxic friendship and am struggling to get out of it. Basically the title.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/fq50i6/im_in_a_friendship_that_i_know_is_toxic_but_im/,17,"I will apologize in advance if I come across like an a\*\*hole in this comment but the fact that this person is pushing you around and you've been letting them for 10 years aggravates me and I'm not sure how else to go about it.  

In my experience, people like this will push you around for the same reason a dog will pull on a leash: Because it works.  The only way to stop them from eliciting the bad behavior is to stop allowing the bad behavior to benefit them.  I know you don't want confrontation but I don't see any other way around it.  

First:  Friendships are reciprocal.  They are mutually beneficial to all parties involved.  If you're not benefiting, then it's not a friendship.  

Second:  You need to tell this person how you feel.  Stop tip-toeing around the issue, stop dropping hints.  You don't have to be a d\*ck about it.  And I'd suggest not blindsiding her in the heat of the moment either.  Just get a good handle on how you feel (write it down if you need to ) and Just lay it out honestly.  

Third:  Stop feeling guilty about how you feel.  Your feelings are YOUR feelings, PERIOD.  The are NOT up for discussion or debate, and they are DEFINITELY not contingent on anyone else's approval.  She can disagree with your feelings if she likes, but that doesn't change them.    Don't apologize, don't back down and for godsakes don't feel guilty.  

Again, I'm sorry if this comes across as harsh but, jeezus.  It's been 10 years.  Enough is enough.  It's time to put on your grown up pants and take your damn life back. ",2020-03-27 20:29:36

31,gjbfk5,False,,3,My dog had cancer. I had to say goodbye to her today.,whatsbotheringyou,"My little pupster was only three and a half, she was the sweetest dog.  We only found out about the cancer two weeks ago.  We were told it was too late and there was nothing we could do but take her home and spoil her until her quality of life was too bad and it was time to let her go.  It was lung cancer and it happened so fast.  She started coughing and wheezing a few days before I took her into the vet.  By Monday she could hardly walk, she stopped eating and she couldn't barely hold down water.  Last night she cried all night and today I knew it would be cruel to let her be in any more pain.  

It doesn't feel real.  It happened so fast.  I called the vet this morning and told them she was in too much pain to go on.  My husband came home to stay with our boys.  I took her to the vets office.  They let us into a little quiet room with a comfortable couch and a soft rug on the floor.  It was very quiet.  I sat and cuddled her.  The vet gave her a shot and she fell asleep while I told her what a wonderful girl she was.  I wish I would have left then.  But I didn't want her to go without me there to hold her.  So I stayed and pet her while they gave her the second shot.  It was the worst thing in the world when she stopped breathing.

She was such a sweet girl and she should have had a much longer life.  I went home and tried to be a tough guy for my husband and our little boy.  But I keep getting hit with these waves of sadness.  It hurts and I miss her.  She was such a funny good sweet baby.  She loved camping.  She loved barbecues.  She loved loved loved car rides.  Even her last car ride.  She couldn't put her head out the window like she always did because she was too weak too.  But she wagged her tail the whole way.  

I can't talk it out at home.  The boys don't need mama falling apart and my husband is doing his best but he is taking it hard too.  We are just hugging a lot more then usual and being quiet.  Thank you for reading as I needed to get it out.  I miss her and it hurts that I will never pet her head again or hear her running through the house after the boys.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/gjbfk5/my_dog_had_cancer_i_had_to_say_goodbye_to_her/,41,"..

815,1l8fuo,False,,10,revenge,whatsbotheringyou,"when i was 18, a senior in highschool, my art teacher (jennifer havrey) told me “youre going to grow up and do nothing with your life”  i already have very low self esteem, and this killed me. it took everything i had to not cry in front of the entire class. i just played it cool. “ok whatever” and continued to put my head down like i didnt care. im 20 now and not a single day goes by when i dont replay this scene or repeat her words in my head. this has effected me more than anything else in my life. its only fair i effect her the same way she has effected me. every night i go to bed and i fantasize and think about how i can effect her psycologically the same way she did to me. ive been studying psychosis and mental illness and what causes these things and will continue studying until i can prove to her that i “did something with my life” and can show her not only did i do something with my life but also how a simple sentence can effect someone so deeply and emotionally. and she will experience the same pain that i experience everyday. she will understand whats its like to hate yourself. she will understand what its like to have people constantly laugh at your dreams. she will understand suicidal tendencies. its the wrong thing to do but you have no idea what ive been through, you have no idea how this has effected me. it will be done. jennifer will feel just as bad, if not worse than i feel about myself. (i will not lay a finger on her, or even see her in person, she will not be physically touched) give me 7 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1l8fuo/revenge/,12,"It sounds like you're focusing exclusively on the straw that broke the camel's back and forgetting about the rest of the straws. You said you already had low self esteem, and that's not the sort of thing that happens overnight. There had to be plenty of other things that contributed to you feeling that way, so why focus on just one?

There's a difference between ignorance and stupidity. Ignorance is being unaware of the wrongness of one's actions, stupidity is doing something despite knowing you shouldn't. You said you know what you're planning is wrong, so I'm sorry to say that not only would doing whatever you're planning make you wrong, it would also make you objectively stupid.

No amount of petty revenge will make you feel better. Getting revenge isn't suddenly going to cure your low self esteem. All it will accomplish is making her and likely plenty of other people afraid of you, which will only serve to make your self esteem worse. The blowback from your revenge will be exponentially worse than the benefit you gain from it. Nobody is going to hand you anything on a silver platter because ""you sure showed her"".

So here's what you do. Work on improving yourself instead of trying to impose your own flavor of self-centered justice on the world. Aim to contribute to the world rather than forcing the world to contribute to yourself. There's plenty of cliché advice to throw at this situation like ""Two wrongs don't make a right"" and ""The best revenge is to live a good life."" You hear this all the time, and eventually it just becomes background noise. But the reason it's stuck around to be heard constantly is because it's right. Seek to understand that and you'll be a much, much happier person.

Best of luck to you, friend. ",2013-08-28 02:44:13

We moved rooms, and she moved with us.

393,2372qs,False,,9,I'm fucked,whatsbotheringyou,"AMA.  I need to be an open book because keeping things inside have ruined my opportunities, relationships, and life in general.

Long story short, I've been depressed and had suicidal thoughts for over a year, flunked out of one school and about to be on probation on the one I'm at now.  I handled depression terribly, not even going to see a doctor for the first 9-10 months or so, despite my ex's encouragement.  I went from 3.8 GPA in highschool to getting kicked out in one year, and that kinda blindsided my parents.  The feeling of disappointment pretty much killed me for the next 3 months.  Now I'm going to have to feel that way again, as well as they probably won't let me try to fix things next semester.  If so, I can't blame them.  Nobody but me would fuck up two semesters the way I did.

I don't know why I stopped seeing the doctor.  I guess when my mom said she thought I was feeling better I felt it would make her happy if I said I was rather than disappointing her, even though that way I might have been able to deal with it.  

Might as well add some more shit to this.

-Have one friend who lives near me I talk to occasionally, a couple others I only play online games with.

-Only dated one person ever, pretty clueless and have nothing to offer in a relationship.  (Of course when I fucked things up so badly this is currently the least of my concerns)

-Honestly I don't even know how to make conversation with people, even my friend who I used to talk with for hours.  I quite often go an entire day without using my voice.

-No ambition to do anything.  The only thing I do is distract myself with shows and games so that I'm not thinking about wanting to die or something.  My mind races so I spend pretty much every waking moment avoiding real life.  This is an absolutely terrible lifestyle, but I guess I just took the easiest way out.

-I was an entirely different person two years ago.  I used to have hobbies and do well in school, and I used to be a human being.  People knew who I was, and I enjoyed life.  That's something I can't really say anymore.

-The last time I was overall happy was over a year ago.  The end of last march I went on a vacation with friends and my then gf.  The day after when I returned to school was the turning point where everything went downhill.  

I got carried away, probably should have left details for any questions anyone had.  

Feel free to ask anything

I want to go back to a doctor and try therapy this time

Otherwise I don't know what to do.

I want to try again, like go back to graduation and this time I could handle it better.  Or maybe just get in the car and drive away.  That would be better than offing myself but still hard on my mother, besides, I'd be just as fucked wherever I went.


e:  Thank you everyone who has helped with this, your contributions are greatly appreciated.
e2:  I think I might be able to break from this problem in some time.  There's still the big issue of school and my parents, but I think if that goes relatively well (they let me go back to school) I can break free from these issues with the help of a therapist and self improvement.  I think I'm ready to turn this around; it's just that I hope I didn't already ruin that opportunity.

Thank you guys so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2372qs/im_fucked/,14,"I am not a weight building type myself, but I have participated in a number of sports.

If I might ask, was the depression the sole reason you felt like everything went wrong? Or might it have  been a series of events they mad you feel depressed? 

Personally I find dating to be a tentative fix at best, the relationship could become really unstable, leaving you in a worse state then when you started. Working towards friendships might be a better long term benefit.

What could you reflect on that has caused you to feel trapped in this current situation? Perhaps a change in schedule is in order? ",2014-04-16 17:26:59

17M, from Russia and im really afraid of whats gonna happen to me when i graduate from school and in the next 1-2 years. 

3 months before the exams and im still very bad at what im currently studying (ive picked computer science, math and english as a planb). Im sure i can enter my local university but my town is just a shithole, friends of mine would go to Saint-Petersburg and a perspective of living alone in fucking Cherepovets and having no one to spend time with scares the shit out of me. 

i tried to start preparing more and having a schedule but when i try i just get scared of the amount of shit i have to master or i just practice something and then think that its enough studying for today (most of the time such ""practice"" just gets left in the past). 

i have a large passion on playing electric guitar and customizing clothing  and these things really bring me happiness. i have a couple of good friends i like to hang out with as well. The problem is i always choose to entertain myself instead of trying to focus on exams and picking between universities.my  focus is always on some art or entertainment BS like youtube, music bands, custom clothing, movies etc. i know a lot of info on such things but this just wont make any sense to me if i want to safely continue life without having to worry about finding a job or having no place of accomodation. my other problem is that many times id love to write a song or to design a clothing piece but every time i try to put my artistic thoughts into something i start thinking about exams being right behind my back and i just lose myself in figuring out what i should do first.

 right now my knowledge of computer science and english is waaay not enough to have a life where i wont bother too much and would have enough free time to really put all of  my artistic thoughts into music or clothing. i can master my skills of creating music or i can invest my moms money into making clothes and try to sell them but imo at the end of the day its only luck when it comes to making money on such things. i really want to start improving my knowledge but most of the time i just sit on my ass wanting to do shit and at the end of the  day i have nothing but controversies in my head.

i dont want to be all that successful and wealthy. i think my most cherished and desired wish is not bother too much about job and spend most of my free time hanging out with friends, play guitar and all that stuff. but when it comes to buying essentials, paying rent, having enough money to buy new equipment and enough time to master my art, i think that only a well-paid job with high entry threshold can provide me all of these things at the same time. but even if i start studying and having schedules i will probably get lost in it, spend all my time studying or working and have no time for life and it just sucks

200,ejlb2b,False,,4,Worried about my lonely widowed mother.,whatsbotheringyou,"My mother was widowed 5 years ago and lives alone in a small town on the other side of the country. My brother lives in the same town - on the same street even - but has little to do with her as he is quite self-centred and only associates with high status people, which my mother is not. I live where I do for medical reasons, there is a treatment here for my condition that is not available elsewhere in the country.

I try to visit her regularly and invite her to my city to visit me, which she sometimes accepts. I took all of August to go home and spend with her, she came to my city for a week in November, which I also took off work, and I took another week off over Christmas to to see her again. She pays for my travel to come see her as it's very far and very expensive, so travel costs are not an issue. 

But I cannot keep taking time off work. Luckily my job is unconventional and therefore more flexible, and my boss is very understanding, but I feel like I'm starting to push it. I'm finally in my 30s getting into a career path that I love, after many years of small jobs (so I could spend the summer back home to be with family). 

She does not seem to understand this - though i have explained it multiple times - and keeps making plans for ""us"" to go travelling to India, the Bahamas, etc, which I then have to tell her I can't go on. She says i can quit my job. She used to travel a lot with my father and now she has no one, and it's so sad. She also will only travel to resorts and by cruise, which I detest (but that's an aside). 

Very much a First World Problem and I feel stupid even writing it out. But yesterday she just sent me yet another invitation for a week long trip in February - I had to tell her *again* that I cannot just take random weeks off and go. She is disappointed and hurt. I don't know what to say.

Sorry for the giant wall.,whatsbotheringyou,"Like the title says, I posted this to r/SuicideWatch a few months back, but it got removed the same day so here I am. The mods never gave me a reason. Maybe my post was too edgy or maybe they thought I was trolling. But I assure you that what I'm about to tell you is 100% real. I wrote this from a place of anger, so keep that in mind. You can PM me if you want. I didn't get much of a response from the other sub anyway. I just need to post this somewhere to get all this shit off my chest and liked the look of this sub. The only reason I've waited so long to post this is because I'm afraid and embarrassed. It's kinda stupid that I'm afraid when no one really cares anyway. Sorry for the wall.

The fact someone like me exists is surely stunning evidence that there is no such thing as a loving god. Day in and day out, all I see inside my head is death, pain, gore, murder, torture, and all thoughts obscene and extreme. These are the thoughts I fall asleep to almost every night. You'd be horrified if you stepped into my mind for just one minute. But I was not always this way. I remember days when I was optimistic, happy, kind, and social. I wanted friendship. But I've changed. I post and comment every now and then on my main account, but I'm using an alt because...I dunno. In the deep recesses of my black heart, the final bastion of goodness cries out for compassion. When I'm in public, people see my manners, smile, and good looks but they don't see the darkness that lies beneath the surface. I just need to get this all off my chest and hope someone out there can hear me and understand why I feel the way that I do, because it feels like the world is my enemy right now.

I wasn't born from Satan's sperm or anything like that. My birth was like any other, with crying parents, excited grandparents, and all that shit. Why bring this up? Because when I was born, my parents were faced with a decision, one that would not effect them, but would greatly effect me, and they chose the wrong one. But I'm not going to tell you what this decision was, because it took me 18 years to figure it out, and I want you to experience my life in the order I experienced it. If you're one of the few who feels the way I do, then maybe you've already guessed what that decision was and can see where this is headed. For both of my parents, I was their first son. I lived a sheltered childhood growing up in a literal crack-den, because my parents are poor as shit. I had no friends or social interactions before school, so going to school was the first time I really began learning about myself and about the world. One of the first things I learned about myself was what a romantic I was, of course I didn't know the word at the time, but you get the idea. I remember even having a crush on a girl as early as Kindergarten for chrissakes. I was such a sucker. Only problem is it's hard making friends when you're the weird kid who smells like drugs and dresses like shit. I was able to find some, though.

Despite my poor upbringing, I had rich neighbors. There was one family in particular we'll call the Walsh family (none of the names on the post are real). The Walsh family had a son a little older than me named Jesse I hung out with a lot. He was a bit of a dick, but it was worth it because he owned tons of video games and also because of his older sister, Kelsey. I had a huge crush on her until the whole molestation thing soured my feelings. Kelsey was eight years older than I, and she could tell I was into her. Every now and then, she'd blow me a kiss, call me 'prince', or something like that, and I'd get that warm fuzzy feeling inside. Seems innocent on its own, but that all changed one autumn afternoon when I was 8 years old. The parents in the Walsh family were each in high paying professions that took a lot of hours, so Jesse would go play sports after school, but Kelsey preferred staying at home to study by herself. None of the neighbor kids were around to play with me, so I went up to the Walsh house to see if someone was there. I cringe to type what happened next. Kelsey was the only one there, and she invited me in. I asked if she wanted to play outside, but instead she just said, “No, but c'mere. I wanna show you something REALLY cool.” I remember those were her exact words. She leads me into her bedroom, sits me down at the computer, and shows me what I didn't realize at the time was porn. It took me a while to realize that what I was seeing was sex. My parents already had “the talk” with me, but I never knew people had sex for pleasure or what it really looked like. Kelsey started touching me through my pants and encouraged me to do the same to her. When I left an hour later, she threatened, “You can't tell anyone about this. Our parents will be REALLY mad at you and me if someone finds out, so don't, okay?” Exact words. And being the big, smart, sixteen year old high school student twice my age, I trusted her. Now, if I were smart and told someone, that'd be where the story ended, but confusion, fear, curiosity, and my stupid feelings drew me back to Kelsey. I think when most people picture child molestation, they imagine rough, violent rape. But my experience was one of masterful manipulation and was...affectionate for lack of a better word (sorry I don't really know how else to describe it). And obviously it evolved into things more graphic than touching through pants that I'm gonna spare myself from detailing. The bitch would lie to me the whole time that she loved me and would use my feelings to guilt trip me into doing shit I didn't want. “But don't you love me?” “I'll love you forever if you do this for me.” Also shit like, “This is why no one likes you.” “Don't be such a loser.” Cunt. Even though disgust and violation eventually set in, I stupidly kept going back. I was so confused and curious and wanted answers, but more than that, I wanted her to love me back. And I stupidly believed every proclamation of her love. Feeling like the cutest thing in the world was juxtaposed with feeling gross and disgusted. Feeling violated with feeling loved. I guess my parents never were suspicious because it's normal to hang out with neighborhood kids, right? Right. They also trusted Kelsey. I think she reminded my mother of her two daughters from her previous marriage. And what kid wants to hang out in a crack-den all day anyway?

In a twist of fate, Kelsey left for college early after nine months of this shit, and I never heard from her since. I guess she was real smart or something. There's no such thing as justice. Bad shit never happens to bad people, only good people. And that was it. I felt simultaneously relieved and sad at her departure. But after a while, I just stopped thinking about her. It wasn't until I was eleven that new feelings about what I went through popped up. I hated what she did to my body, I felt gross, hurt, sad, self hate, guilt and regret, but most of all I felt pure, astronomical hatred. It eats me up inside knowing I won't get justice for this. Puberty hit me harder than a nitro powered freight train, and as I started exploring my sexuality, I hated how I was aroused by kinks she had previously acted out on me. I've tried to get rid of them, but it's like they're fused deep into my brain. I felt tainted, like my sexuality could never truly be my own. I know the stereotype of a molestation victim is a person who is terrified by everything sexual, but rarely is the opposite outcome talked about where you become a hyper sexual person with several of the most extreme kinks. I've always wanted answers about why she did what she did, and I've heard everything from pedophilia being a disease to being an unconventional sexuality, but I've never seen an answer that satisfied me. I never told my parents because the idea of having any sort of conversation about sex or sexuality with them makes me cringe. Nor did I tell Jesse or his parents. Instead, I scoured the internet for answers on what to do. Quickly, I found my plight dismissed, told I was lucky to be abused by that bitch, and ridiculed. But that's just the internet, right? Surely, my friends wouldn't feel the same. The few friends I had ridiculed me when I opened up to them. They told me I was lucky and that I should've liked it. Because she was a conventionally attractive high school girl, so surely the problem was with me, right? I left the friends behind who rejected my plight. In the end, I was left with only two good friends. One was a dude we'll call Casey, and he was the first person to actually listen, but we've never talked much about because of how clearly it makes him uncomfortable. We're the type of friends talking serious with is hard. The second was a girl we'll call Isabel. She was a cynical misanthrope, and the first to actually have a face to face conversation with me about this aside from ridicule. During this conversation, she said to me, “But you're still you.” And those words changed my life.

I thought so hard about what Isabel said, and she was absolutely right. I lost control for a while, but in the end, I was still here. I was back in control. My body was the same. It was still mine. The fact Kelsey did this to me didn't matter. I was in control. My body was the same. So much of the violation and sadness I felt faded to the back of my mind all at once. It was an incredible feeling, like seventy thousand tons of death had been lifted off my shoulders. That night, I shed a tear for the last time. Ever since, I've been physically incapable of crying, though sometimes I wish I could for the catharsis. But there was one thing that remained: the pure, unfiltered, aggressive hatred I have for that cunt. I've grown up since I was eight, and nowadays I'm over six feet tall, muscular, and I've had over a decade of training in martial arts, so if I want to hurt someone, I'm terrifyingly capable. And that's what I want. I want to obliterate Kelsey. They say vengeance is an eye for an eye, but I value my body a helluva lot more than I value my enemy's. Vengeance never actually goes that way. It's more like ripping her left arm off and using the jagged, exposed bone to gouge out her eyes. I would love to stab her guts out, to use a knife to violate her body the way she violated mine, to kill her the way she killed the version of me that was happy, social, optimistic, and has never heard of r/SuicideWatch. She'd be so helpless and weak at my mercy, just like I was back then. But she wouldn't dare show her face near me. She wouldn't dare if she knew the bastard I've become, because there's no way a short, skinny woman like her would ever be able to put up a fight against me. But I won't do anything because the law forbids it. The sound of her crying and begging would be music to my ears, because whenever I think of her, my blood runs a helluva lot colder than hers or anyone wasting their time by reading about my stupid ass. I wonder what kind of man I'd be had I never met that cunt. Guess I'll never know. Maybe I sound like a monster for wanting to inflict the most inhumane torture your worst nightmare could never come up with on her, but you know what? From where I stand, it's Kelsey who seems like the monster to me. And that's why I don't want eye for an eye style revenge. To me, my eye is more important than her eye is to me. She deserves it. Maybe you can't relate because you don't know how it feels to be violated. But I bet you'd feel a similar excruciating, colossal rage if I were your child, if I were your lover, if I were your sibling. Imagine the person you love most in the world getting raped by some degenerate. You'd scream for vengeance. When you push someone's buttons enough, we're all the same primal beast buried beneath the lie we call civility. All of us are capable of feeling the same bestial rage when we've been fucked with enough. It's weird that we have a suicide hotline, a subreddit, and all sorts of resources, but there's no homicide hotline as far as I'm aware. No one wants to talk about it. People like to pretend they can't understand why someone would want to take a life, but that's bullshit. Deep down, they understand it. I'm suicidal anyway, and from where I stand, killing my enemies doesn't seem much different from ending it all. I'm already dead inside anyway.

It was at this point I became what I call a soft misanthrope. I didn't actually hate mankind, but I was perpetually disappointed. Humans are such obstinate beings, and everywhere you look you'll find poverty, pointless violence, abuse, and irrationality. Most will not accept harsh truths even if they stare them in the face. I quickly concluded that the “golden rule” was true. If we treated everyone how we'd like to be treated, there'd be no violence nor avoidable suffering in this world. And to truly adopt this principle, an individual would need to learn to love everyone as much as they love themselves. I think it was Ghandi who said be the change you want to see in the world or something like that, so I decided to strive to be what I would call the ideal human. I was kind to others, optimistic, I'd listen without judgment, I never lied, I immersed myself in academics, and I tried my damnedest to be a good friend to everyone. But deep down, I always knew why being optimistic about humanity is bullshit. As long as this bestial, primal shadow deep within our subconscious exists, there will always be suffering. We hurt others by living life on a whim without even realizing it, and birth hate into this world without realizing it. I'm not going to do it, but if I killed Kelsey, many would call my vengeance justice. And I could stop her from grooming someone else. Though most would never vocalize it, deep down many would cheer the inhumane torture. But at the same time, I'd steal from two parents their daughter, a brother his sister, perhaps children their mother. And all of them would want to kill me and deliver to me the same justice I had to Kelsey. This primal, animalistic shadow controls us in more ways than we even realize. We feel it every time we lust for another's body, every time we gluttonously devour junk food, and every time we watch Kill Bill and cheer as Uma Thurman kills her enemies. See? Whether or not you want to admit it, the shadow has still infused the capacity to take a life into you. We like the violence in Kill Bill when it's done by Beatrix Kiddo but not by Budd because we relate to Beatrix. The only reason you can relate to her without hating her is because you too have the emotional capacity to commit her violence if you were standing in her shoes. Strip away all our material possessions, material desires, relationships, and social conditioning, and we're just beasts who eat, kill, fuck, repeat. Peace is not the natural order of mankind.

People do not form their worldview and beliefs through critical analysis and the indifferent pursuit of truth, but instead through the passive unconscious process of cultural osmosis. That is how one is simultaneously capable of being appalled by rape when done by a man to a woman yet look me in the eye and tell me I was lucky. They have no principles. Just random, unoriginal ideas absorbed from the culture around them. They project their fantasy onto reality and perceive the world filtered through their cultural brainwashing. When you take an honest look around at this fucked up world, filled with bastards like Kelsey, like me, filled with poverty, populated by humans so greedy, so dishonest, so obstinate, so cruel, so irrational, so passive, so indifferent, so uncritical, perhaps I'm not insane. Maybe sadness, depression, anger, misanthropy, antisocial behavior, wanting to die, and suicide are the sane reactions to an insane world. It is through this cultural brainwashing that traditions survive. I hate tradition. Tradition is a word we use to dress up inhumanity and stubbornness as something noble, something to be respected, as opposed to moving forward, progressing, trying something new, developing better ways of life. For me, there is one tradition in particular that sets my brain on fire. Many have been hurt by this tradition, but for most it's an unimportant detail of their life. Most barely give it a second thought and passively accept it, but obviously that's not true for me. I hate it. It is the subject of crude banter, yet also outrage from few voices. You'll probably laugh when I say this, because many in American culture and elsewhere would say it is ridiculous to be upset over this. You're ridiculed by others if you confess to being upset about it, and I can practically feel the harsh skepticism, dismissal, and laughter some will give me as this as I type these words. The tradition I despise so deeply is male infant circumcision.

For the first 18 years of my life, I thought something about the manhood department always felt...off. The mechanics and anatomy of my manhood always felt so uncomfortable and inconvenient. Sometimes downright painful. But I never thought anything of it, and I never heard the word circumcision until I was a teenager, and even then I certainly never thought I was cut. As far as I knew, it was only something Jews did, and both my parents are atheists, so I figured I was safe. All of my anatomy textbooks throughout my life only ever showed circumcised dicks without mentioning that they had been circumcised, so I figured I was intact. But in reality I was botched. The doctor took off too much skin, making erections painful and tight, sometimes tearing the skin and causing me to bleed. But I never thought anything other than that's just how it is. I had no reason to believe I had been cut. I never even thought about it. It wasn't until I was 18 years old, watching porn in the privacy of my room I learned the truth. I remember seeing a thumbnail with an intact penis and was instantly intrigued. What the hell was up with his cock? I clicked on it and instantly thought how much more convenient it would be for me to have all that extra skin. And as far as I was aware, no other cocks were like that. They were all like mine, and this guy was just a lucky bastard. Then I scrolled down to the comments. Holy shit. What the hell was I reading? I couldn't possibly have been cut. No way, right? Well, I went over to google and got a picture comparing circ'd to uncirc'd. I stared at the pictures until it clicked and I nearly threw up. I had been circ'd and I'd been living a lie for the past 18 years of life. Instantly, those feelings of disgust and violation Kelsey had inflicted on me came boiling up again. Once again, I had no control. My body was controlled by others. Something I'm against doing to children on principle has been inflicted onto me. But I quickly realized my parents must've had good reason, right? Curiosity got to me, and I started reading everything I could get my hands on about foreskin and circumcision, and I gotta say, the more I learn, the more hurt I feel. I learned both of the purported health benefits and the downsides, the functions of the foreskin, and I realized truths I never knew existed. I never knew that I had been through so much pain and bleeding because too much skin was taken off. I just figured I had the normal amount of skin and everyone dealt with this. I read about so many potential side effects of this procedure, and I recognized nearly all of them in myself. I know most men might be okay with it, but when I finally realized what had been done to me, I felt raped all over again.

It took me a while to grow the balls to ask about it, but when I did I spoke to both of my parents at once. I simply asked, “Hey, you're each atheists, right? So why exactly did you get me circumcised?” I remember they looked at each other before my mother answered. “So you could be like your dad.” From what I hear, this is a common reason parents circ their kids. Again, I wanted to throw up. I already hated that this had been done to me, and it wasn't even done out of concern for my health or because I had some sort of problem that couldn't be resolved with more conservative methods, but out of cosmetic perversion. Out of a sick desire to make me match my father. If it were out of health concerns, I could accept that, but no. Because they wanted my dick to look a certain way. Fucking disgusting perverts. And the look like daddy excuse is such bullshit. Dad wouldn't have cut his cock off if I had been completely botched. It took every fiber of my being to not unleash a torrent of verbal razors in their direction. In that moment, I saw red. I saw Kelsey. But I did nothing because my parents love me, and what would murdering them in a fit of rage get for me aside from catharsis and a prison sentence? There are ways to get revenge that are legal, and if Kelsey taught me anything, it's that love is a weakness you can exploit. I don't want to see my parents again because all the feelings of violation, loss, sadness, helplessness, betrayal, rage, and disgust that bother me come swelling up at the sight of them. Unfortunately, they're still a small part of my life, but I'll be far the fuck away soon. Those fuckers are yet to realize how unfortunate they are to have a vengeful sadist like me for a son. I have a plan for revenge with no scams, violence, or any illegal channels. I'll make them regret their decision, and they're going to feel guilt for it, and they will watch helplessly as I disown them after I exploit them for every penny I can get out of them and unleash my verbal razors on them. I wonder what their stupid faces will look like when I tell them how violated I feel by them, how much I hate their guts, and that they will never speak to me again while I'm out in the world being more successful than those losers could ever dream of being. And it's their own fault. They'll probably feel devastation, loss, powerlessness, anger, and guilt. I probably sound cruel. But what about my loss? My powerlessness? My anger? How I feel violated and humiliated all over again because of them? I can't undo these feelings, but I sure as hell can hurt them to get some catharsis. I don't give a shit. Fuck turning the other cheek. Turning the other cheek is every coward's favorite passage because it lets them glorify their weakness as virtue and nobility. It flips the natural order of the world to make strength weakness and weakness strength. It's a passage for making slaves content in their subjugation. It allows evil to perpetually abuse while the weak gain pride from their suffering at the expense of seeing the truth. They're not going to inflict violation onto me and live their lives like it never happened. I'm not letting them live their happy lives thinking I love them just because that's what society says I should do. I live my life for myself and not for anyone else because I'm not a slave. Maybe if I'm REALLY lucky, each of them will get cancer before it's disowning time, and I'll get the pleasure of watching them die slowly and painfully, all while they falsely believe that I'm just their regular ol' loving son as I laugh at their pain behind their backs and collect the inheritance. They by-proxy initiated sexual violence against me. PAID someone to cut off part of my cock before I could even fathom the idea of consent for their own perverse desires. They can 100% go fuck themselves.

I hate my body, and unlike what I told myself to cope with what Kelsey did, my body is not the same. It was permanently altered without my consent for the satisfaction of perverts, and there's nothing I can do about it. How can my body ever truly be mine when part of me was cut off to satisfy perverts. I'm so fucking tired of people treating me and my body like it's just some plaything. The school bullies, Kelsey, my parents, the doctor. And being a person who is very sexual, I hate so deeply that my sexuality keeps getting altered by the whims of others. God, I just hate everything. History repeats itself, and again I took to the internet for the sake of discussion. I quickly found that even even though some vigorously oppose circumcising children, most were dismissive and ridiculed me all over again if I expressed feeling violated. And you can't change their mind. You can rant and rave until you're blue in the face, cite as many scientific papers and statistics as you want, debunk as many myths as you want, express your darkest feelings in the most visceral way possible and it changes nothing. You can demonstrate truth in a comparison of removal of the foreskin and some other bodily atrocity and people will only condemn one. George Orwell's doublethink is real and fucking terrifying. Unfortunately, though, I cannot get back what was stolen from me. The only hope the future holds for this possibility is a company called Foregen that wants to use regenerative medicine to undo circumcision. But that'll cost about 10k once it comes out, not to mention all the money the supporters have to donate just to make it possible. But why the fuck should I have to pay 10k to get back what I was entitled to by right of birth? To help restore the feeling of wholeness everyone is entitled to? And it's not like any attorney would try to help me sue my parents or the doctor who did this. So instead I'll just break their hearts. You can also stretch your shaft skin out, which I've done and has been immensely helpful, but that's just a mimic and doesn't take away the violation. Doesn't undo that this was done to me. Doesn't restore every function and supporting structure. And the fact I can't remember it creeps me the fuck out. I have so many fucking questions I'd like to ask that piece of shit doctor. He's another fucker I'd love to torture like Kelsey and my parents. But I hate society, too. It's partly society's fault that this was done to me, so fuck everyone. Society is why this “procedure” is done in the first place, so it's society's fault that I'm “living” feeling hurt, raped, and humiliated day in and day out. Every time I go to pee. Every time I go to masturbate. Every time I feel my glans chafe. Fuck, I hate my body! I can't escape the feelings of incompleteness and humiliation, and I can still feel Kelsey there touching me and changing me from the innocent boy I once was to the son of a bitch I am now. I would like nothing more than to have a different body. Or to have never been born at all for that matter.

Most people will defend the subhuman monster who molested me and defend the fact I was mutilated without my consent, so when I look out on this world, you know what I see? I see Kelsey everywhere I look. People who don't give two shits about consent. I tried being a soft misanthrope, but now I'm the real deal. I fucking hate humans. The way they look makes me sick. The sound of their voices is nails on a chalkboard. I want to kill myself every day just so I can get rid of everyone. Fuck everyone. Fuck society. I don't want to live another day in this shit world. Now, I know with what I've written that you must be thinking this is some insane mass shooter's manifesto, but that's not the case. I'm smart enough to know there are angels out there. I'm not that much of a loser. But everyone still looks like Kelsey to me. I have to assume they'll ridicule or dismiss me if I were to tell them these things, because history has shown me that most will. I can't stand anymore arrogant indifference and ridicule. I can only discover whether someone is an angel or not by talking to them, but why would I bother when they disgust me from afar? Maybe they are a beautiful angel buried beneath my projection, but who cares? I used to crave friendship, camaraderie, a girlfriend, and romance. I don't anymore. I'm fine all alone. What can anyone else give me I can't give myself? Ridicule? The sight of humans disgusts me, the sound of their voices grates on my ears, and a lot of them are razor blades if you get too close. I'm out of patience, and I have been liberated from having hope. If the nuclear apocalypse came tomorrow and killed everyone, I wouldn't really care. I've heard people say what's stopping them from killing themselves is the fear of hurting someone near and dear to them. That's not me at all. I realized quickly that because you can exploit other people's love to hurt them, I could get revenge on my parents for their role in making me hate my body by killing myself and leaving behind a little spiteful suicide note. If someone misses me when I'm gone, good. Fuck them. So few ever offered compassion, let alone tried to understand, and the silence has been deafening my whole life, so I hope it hurts. Finally, some peace and quiet, liberated from the body I hate. But really, that's not what I want. I don't want to give in to this piece of shit world. I have big dreams, aspirations, and I don't want the fuckers all around me to stop me from achieving them. The way I see it, if I kill myself I just give more power to Kelsey and to my parents and to the doctor. Fuck that. What I want is to stand tall after having achieved my dreams and regenerated my foreskin and raise a middle finger to this whole goddamn world. Still, though, the other option is really appealing sometimes. I've also read that for many parents, being disowned by your own child can be a more painful experience than having said child die. Not gonna lie, vengeance is part of what's pushing these feet forward. I want to see the look on their stupid faces when I tell them the truth. I don't want psychiatric help. It might pacify my colossal rage and the hate I have for my body, but fuck that. It's not a sign of health to be well adjusted to an immensely sick world. My feelings are completely reasonable. I'm not insane. Everyone else is. I wish none of this had happened. I wish I could have back the good person I once was instead of the son of a bitch I am now. But you and I can't meet him because he's fucking dead. He was murdered. Everyone else pissed on his grave. His tombstone reads, “Just wanted you to love him the way he loved you.” Thanks for ruining my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/b0fstf/my_post_was_removed_from_rsuicidewatch_i_hate/,11,"Part of me feels like you've been so angry for so long that you've rationalized it as being good for you. Angry enough that you don't want to be anything other than angry. I'm not even saying you shouldnt be angry.

It's like you said, how killing yourself would just give more power to Kelsey, your parents, the doctor, etc. And that you have ambitions outside that. At the very least, given what's been done to you, your eloquence in writing, you should try to become an advocate for others like yourself. Maybe that's where you can find power and purpose. 

When you have true power and mastery over yourself, anger evaporates. Anger comes from giving your power to others. Power over your sexuality, over your autonomy and body. I feel you need to reclaim your power. I haven't been in your situation, so I'm not really sure how you would.

830,entm9c,False,,3,People disparaging people from commenting to people about their weight.,whatsbotheringyou,"I've always been too skinny, incapable of gaining weight and it's bothered me. People would always say ""Omg you're so skinny eat something ffs."" Or they would turn to my wife and be like ""Omg do you feed him wtf is wrong with you."" It was pretty simple to be like... Yeah I dunno fast metabolism I guess.

I quit smoking, quit drinking coffee and quit indulging in marijuana. I've gained like... I dunno 20lbs. Now everyone is like... ""Whoa you look good with those extra pounds."" And usually I respond with, ""Thank you."" 

It's 2020 now, we've endured a lot of flurries over the past few years. You know. Lots of snowflakes pouring in. I really think it's about time people realized intent. I'll give another example.

A lady I've known since she was 50 (like when I was born) is now in her 70's, the entire time I can remember she's been overweight. It's never bothered anybody but herself really because she's great and nobody is like..""Damn woman do you ever stop eating?"" She's constantly on diets with her left hand and eating chips by the bagful with her right. Nobody cares because that's her business. When she says ""OMG You're too thin."" and I would say ""Well I'm eating, doctor says I'm healthy, my BMI is good."" She would say ""Well you look unhealthy."" If I were to say maybe, ""haha you seen yourself lately?"" Those aren't compliments and it brings into question the intent of the situation.

If someone is genuinely giving you a compliment and you're going to be an ass and get defensive then YOU'RE an asshole , not them. If you can't tolerate people not knowing every single thing going on your head that doesn't make them insensitive it makes you insensitive and I think people should start realizing that most people have good intentions.

If you're so wrapped up in what's bothering you that you can't understand that people are just trying to be nice then you should work on that, not go after people for simply trying to compliment you. 

It's really interesting how people will lash out at someone with pure intentions but then defend people with misaligned intentions. It would be nice if we could start paying more attention to where comments are coming from and less of what they are. 

If someone were to say ""OMG you're so skinny."" I were to respond with, ""I know, I'm doing my best but I just can't pack em on for some reason."" They could simply say, ""Hey, your body is just built differently don't be so hard on yourself I'm sure you'll reach your goals.""

Or maybe... ""Hey, you've lost a lot of weight lately you look good."" and you were to say ""Yeah it wasn't intentional it's a tough time, I'd rather not talk about it."" they could say ""Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that, I hope things get better.""

You gonna shit on people for trying to be nice and you're going to isolate yourself from people who's intentions were never to hurt you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/entm9c/people_disparaging_people_from_commenting_to/,8,"I see where you’re coming from, but personally, I try to substitute comments about weight with other comments because I know disordered eating habits is a rampant problem where I live.

661,25ibkh,False,,6,My unemployed brother is destroying my mother's life.,whatsbotheringyou,"So my 63 year old mother just got out of the hospital. She recently had to have surgery to remove 6 inches of colon due to a blockage. As if this didn't make her life hard enough, she comes home to find out that her son has taken all the money out of her bank account and then some. She is currently overdrawn, thanks to him. She's already poor and trying to live off of Social Security. But now she has less than no money.

My problem is that I live in another state. I feel like I should try to help her in some way but I'm not sure how. My brother has been leeching money from her since my dad passed away in 2012. He's stolen every piece of jewelry or anything of value that she owns. This includes my dead father's wedding ring. I just don't know how to help her if she won't help herself. She won't send him away. She says she needs him to run errands for her because she's usually too sick to do it on her own. (She has chronic intestinal issues.) However, this means she's putting her debit card into his greedy little hands. Not only is she pretty much setting herself up for theft but she's bailed him out of jail twice.

Would I be able to help her if I lived nearby? I wouldn't mind running errands for her or helping out around the house. Would moving back mean letting him ruin my own life? I'm not afraid to stand up to him. At the moment, I live with my long-term boyfriend who hates my brother's guts and is convinced he'll move on to trying to get money from us if we were to move back.  I feel helpless. I'm just at a loss of what to do. I feel like I owe my mom whatever protection and help I can offer.

I live a life that I should be both happy and content with, and yet I can't help but feel like a failure. I've no idea what I want to do with my life and I don't have a degree of any sort.

Most people will speak of either extremes, but wisdom is always somewhere in the middle. 

That being said, prepare yourself for a lot more of fakery. People’s true colours come out gradually, especially at times like this. However, this is not to say they aren’t worthy of your friendship. If you are like me or thousands of other redditors, you will cut off your fake friends only to have nobody left. That’s a recipe for disaster because it gets harder and harder to make meaningful relationships as you grow up...seriously. 

Instead, keep note of the ways they mistreat you and your loyalty.  Don’t forget this. Anytime you need to prioritize yourself over them, DO IT. If you have to be a bit less considerate of them, that’s fine. Naturally, all humans are egocentric and focus of their own motives first. It hurts to see it at a young age (believe me, I know), but around your 20s you will see that is just how 90% of the people in this world are and even you (if not now, then eventually, when life’s responsibilities and pressures hit all at once with full force).

Knowing the truth instead of denying it is beautiful because you can enjoy your friendships, use it to your benefit and goals, and you won’t expect too much out of them when you’re in need, so you won’t be hurt when they flake. 

If you are genuinely the better friend out the bunch, keep doing you, and in the future most of them *will* acknowledge it and praise your high character. They will experience fakery left and right, and then *they* will realize that you are the rare friend worth keeping. 

In short, acknowledge , understand, and accept that most of your friends aren’t as loyal and genuine as you and KEEP them in your life. Maintain your relationships, but don’t invest heavily in them. You will thank me in the future when they will come in handy for your personal motives and fill your void of loneliness, which creeps in quicker the more you age...! ",2020-01-14 20:39:37

I have a [link](https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/depression-quiz/) for a depression quiz that may be helpful for you to take. I also believe that the first step toward fixing the problem is identifying what that problem is which you have done which is really good. 

Do you have someone you can talk to about this? Like your older sibling or parent?  If that doesn't feel right what about a teacher or other relative?  Maybe by talking to someone they can help you figure out if counseling would be helpful for you to sort this stuff out.  There are millions of people each year who suffer from depression so you are not alone. 

A few things you could do now that may help you feel better is:

1) Eat healthy, a little junk food is okay but don't make it your entire diet

2) Get outside and get some fresh air, go for a brisk walk or ride a bike.  This will help with your sleep.

3) Try to stop playing video games a few hours before you go to sleep.    Screen time delays your body's internal clock (a.k.a., your circadian rhythm), and suppresses the release of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin which makes it more difficult to fall asleep.  A good night's sleep is amazing for your state of mind. ",2020-01-17 18:44:00
93,eyegkd,False,,13,I think I'm a sociopath,whatsbotheringyou," 

\- I always had ""friends"" but I never really truly connected to someone, and I always felt that I had to hide my true self from them (or they would think I'm insane)

\- I have a very nihilistic and materialistic worldview, I evaluate everything in darwinian terms, survival of the fittest

\- I stole a toy from a ""friend"" when I was a child

\- I manipulated my cosein into swaping toys (his toy was clearly superior)

\- I manipulated a girlfriend into getting breast enlargement surgery (I prefer big tits)

\- I have sex mostly with prostitutes. A lot of men say they would not enjoy it because the prostitute doesn't like them / is not attracted to them. For me this point was never important, basically I don't care as long as I get what I want (sex with a hot women)

\- I see most people as dumb and brainwashed sheep who cannot act rationaly

\- I like my family members and don't want harm to happen to them, but I also think a lot how useful they are to me (e.g. I think ""I should play nice with my parents or they might disinherit me"")

\- I'm very introverted (INTP type personality), I almost never think about people, I only care about abstract stuff like the technloogical singulartiy, AI, stuff like that.

\- When I had a girlfriend I always evaluated them on very shallow criteria (how hot they are, how good the sex is with them)

\- I have a high IQ (mensa measured 138)

I was depressed for a big part of my life, mostly because I could not get hot girls to like me.

But last year I got a huge raise, and now I can afford to buy sex pretty much whenever I want.

This was the first time I felt really joyful and happy, and I also felt like I reached my ""deserved"" space in society, because I clearly see myself as superior to most people

It was the first time I got feelings of ""Man it's good to be me. Thank god I'm not this guy""

This was also the first time I got feelings of ""ok so I was depressed because I'm a wolf who tried to fit into a herd of sheep. I should not try to fit in, I have nothing to learn from those idiots""

But I also have some empathic moments, when I was sad about the suffering in the world, I also donated some money. But these moments are extremly infrequent, like once a year.

I can enjoy the company of some people a lot, but I think it's more the mental stimulation they provide to me that I value, I'm not really sure.

I'm also very risk averse, and I have read that most sociopaths are also risk takers.

But I don't see a point in taking risks when there is no possible reward.

So I'm not sure about that one.

I also observed that I act very differently if I know that I'm watched by other people or not. When I'm watched I will do what I think is socially accepted, but when I'm sure I'm not watched I will just do what I think is best for me.

I often ask myself hypothetical questions like ""if you could steal a lot of money from someone and you would be 100% sure you could get away with it, would you do it ?"" and the answer is always yes.

But often, I just think everyone is like me, and they all just pretend to be social and empathic. I mean how can you be sure?

Do you think I'm one? Or just a very introverted guy?

His daughter is his whole life. He forgoes social interaction in favor of being available in the event that his ex MIGHT give her to him for a day or the weekend or an hour.

353,1lxi3o,False,,5,I found out that my most of my coworkers don't like me and went behind my back to get me fired,whatsbotheringyou,"**EDIT: I did not get fired, but they attempted to get me fired
**
I have been working at a company for around 9 months now and I found out today from my manager that half of the project team that I work with really don't enjoy working with me and feel that my attitude at work is annoying and that I don't represent the company well.

Although some of their critisims are helpful and things that I can work on I heard from other co-workers that aside from this they are looking for excuses to get me fired as they don't really care for me. We work in small teams and travel a lot so there is a lot of one on one time with members of the team. I have always tried to be supportive and learn from them in the field and around customers but I think this may have come off as incompetence when I ask questions to them. 

I'm an extremely extroverted and social person and the team members that are having these problems with me are more introverted and cold in compassion. They don't seem to enjoy their work and they take it far more seriously externally than I do even though I do my job competently I know I can outwardly have a more happy go lucky attitude due to my personality.

What really stings is that what I have asked for feedback from my senior team members they have said everything is fine but they still went behind my back to management instead of trying to address the situation and talk to me directly. 

I'm at a loss because now I know while I'm at work that these people despise me and want me gone but I still have to work with them and try to correct my behavior which doesn't seem to fit me, my work style or my personality.

I know people will say I should just quit or transfer, I'm trying to transfer right now but it looks like that might be slow, and I can't quit my job right now.

894,2r89gt,False,,5,I'm so lonely. I can't even imagine what my future will be like.,whatsbotheringyou,"[throwaway]

I'm a senior in college who turned 21 about 5 months ago. That seems crazy to me. The last 4 years have just been so lonely.

Back in high school, I used to hang out almost entirely with girls. These days, my few friends are guys, the list of girls that I can call friends is getting shorter and shorter. They've all moved away or gotten boyfriends or joined sororities, and don't want to hang out with guys like me anymore.

It seems like every girl I try to talk to just doesn't want anything to do with me. I think I'm an average looking guy, but in this college town it seems like every guy is extremely attractive, successful and outgoing, making me pathetic by comparison. The few girls I meet in class don't seem to want anything to do with me outside of class.

All I ever do with my friends is go to bars or parties, where my friends just try to find girls to hook up with. Every girl I try to talk to or dance with just turns me down. On the rare occasion that a girl seems interested in me, anything I do just ruins it. I'd almost rather just stay home, but then I'd have no social life at all. 

I'm not suicidal--I'm very passionate about my science and that gives me plenty to live for. But what if I'm not successful in the field? I'd be left with more debt than I dare to count, poverty, failure, and my loneliness. I think I can succeed and make an impact in my field, but there's definitely a chance that I might not--so I feel like I need something more.

The other night, I spent about 30 minutes making out with a girl that I did not find attractive in any way. Her friend asked me if I wanted to kiss her for new years, and I was like ""sure"". Everyone at the party was taking pictures and laughing at us. She really was quite gross. I felt really bad for her, and I feel really bad saying mean things like this, which is part of the reason that I let it happen. But mostly I let it happen because that was the most action I've gotten in years.

Last night, a couple of my friends almost ordered an escort, after having no luck at the bars. I was tempted to join. I wouldn't have done it, but I was definitely tempted.  I'm worried that I'll end up there in the not too distant future.

I really don't know what I can do, if anything. When I try to get out there and find a girl, I fail. And every time I fail, I become more hesitant to try again. I don't know what my life will be like a few years down the road, but if the trend continues, it'll be even lonelier than my life now.

I've posted this to a few different subs. Maybe somebody out there can help me. If you've read this far, then I really appreciate you listening. Thanks for whatever advice you can give, or if none, then thanks for your time and sympathy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2r89gt/im_so_lonely_i_cant_even_imagine_what_my_future/,9,"Going through life, everyone has embarrassing moments that they wish they could take back, such as making out with less than great looking people, being rejected by guys/girls, but it's never a good idea to dwell on the past.  Trust me, this leads to over-thinking in the future, which may prevent you from several opportunities where you can grow.

Getting rejected from women happens to essentially every guy at some point in their lives.  Talking to girls, even if they reject you gives you experience.  This really attractive girl rejects you? Big deal, at least you can walk away happy that you at least tried as opposed to all the other guys who thought of talking to her.  Eventually, you will find someone out there for you.

If you're as passionate about science as you say you are, then there is a great chance that you will be successful in the field.  It seems to me that you seem like a great guy, but just have confidence issues.  The more you focus on your major, and eventually your career, you will be surrounded by other people with the same interests and drives as you.  As a senior in college myself, college is essentially a melting pot with a bunch of different types of people.  Many of whom, in your case, seem to be assholes, but the more you hone in on your career path, the more successful you will be, and with more positive thinking, you will be able to meet more friends with your mindset.  You're still very young my friend.  Just because the beginning of your 20's hasn't been stellar does not mean the better parts are yet to come.   ",2015-01-03 19:55:17
935,1wq77u,False,,6,I don't like where I'm living and I can't find cheap or free things to do here.,whatsbotheringyou,"I've honestly never been happy with Florida.  I was born and raised in Daytona and have lived in Miami for the past 2.5 years of college.  I feel like I'm letting the city itself keep me from really living my life to the fullest.  I have a good circle of friends, I'm a pretty social guy (but also an introvert), I like trying new things, but a lot of times I feel like my city doesn't offer many new things to try.  Certainly, everything I see that's interesting is really expensive.  I go to South Beach sometimes with friends, which is fun, but I can't always do the same thing.  I've tried Lincoln Road, everything is really expensive, I've become a regular member of my rock climbing gym (but most months don't have money to renew my membership), gone to the Everglades and hiked (there's a half-mile trail and it takes over an hour to get there from campus), and been to bookstores and record stores, most of which are tiny and cost way more than online shopping.  I'm not interested in the Ultra Festival.  When I asked a question about no-money-fun on the Miami subreddit using a throwaway, people laughed and said the best way to not spend money in Miami is to leave Miami.  I've had the same reaction from peers and adults I ask.

The thing is, it seems like the friends I've made since I've been here aren't interested in adventure, and aren't willing to try new things.  I know this is closed-minded of me to think, but I'm getting the sense that it's kind of like that in Miami in general.  Maybe I haven't been hanging out with the right people, but every time I recommend something new instead of routine to any friend group I'm with, I get a strong negative reaction, or called a hipster.

I used to think depression was causing me to hate whatever area I lived in, but I'm not a depressed person anymore and I still hate Miami.  I also love other places I've been to, like Asheville, in a way I didn't love Miami in the times I visited before attending school here.

Less than two years later, I had two thoracotomies to remove metastatic tumors from my lungs and another two a year later to remove more. I then did an experimental treatment but it came back again in the subcutaneous tissue in my abdomen. I was cancer free for about 3.5 years and another tumor was found in my lung last month. I had the surgery again to remove the tumor. 



I am in a ton of pain, and I was told they don't think they got it all. I'm going to have to do radiation in a few weeks. I thought it was all finished with. 3.5 years clear was a huge deal but it seems so small now. 



I have an amazing fiancé who has stood by me through this most recent surgery. I want to grow old with him, but I don't think that is going to happen.

732,9ci1ij,False,,7,cash register came up short :(,whatsbotheringyou,"I’m a college student and work at a fast food restaurant just for the summer. This morning when I started my shift I was put on a register already logged in under my name and was taking orders as usual. About an hour in, I coincidentally overheard one of the managers tell another manager about how some people were missing a certain amount of cash from their till. My name was mentioned and I caught one of them say “[idroppedmycroissant] is not like that.” However, a few minutes after, they awkwardly came over, asked me to go handle non-register tasks, and signed me out of my register for the day. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but they seemed to look at me differently too.

There’s always a camera on the registers and I always make sure to count my change carefully before giving it back to a customer. I’m sure I’ve made a few minor mistakes during rush hours, but it can’t be anywhere near the amount that’s missing since it’s a big enough amount that they no longer wanted me on register for the day. I was so worried and hurt that they would think I’m stealing and now I’m feeling great anxiety over this. I want to go to my GM tomorrow and tell her what I overheard and try to clear up the situation, and maybe request that if I’m put on register again, no one uses my till when I’m not there. Multiple people often share a register under someone else’s names during the day and most of the time I use registers under a manager’s name, and I’m sure they aren’t missing anything so why is it that my till, the one that i don’t use very often, has this issue?

I don’t know how to go about addressing it and it’s eating me up right now :( it doesn’t help that I’m soft spoken and introverted, just thinking about bringing this up with my GM is causing me so much anxiety.

Should I go confront the situation? Or wait until someone addresses me? What should I say? I feel so bad about this.

It really hurt me to think that people would think I’m shady and would lose their trust in me when I’ve done nothing wrong ;—; I like my coworkers a lot and I enjoy my shifts (usually). The reason I got this job in the first place was because my mom didn’t want me sitting around the house .__.

No, that ship has sailed. Its more about the, now certain, failure of my degree and the pain and frustration of the last four, now wasted, years of university life. I'm worried for my future, not just because of my impending academic failure, but the person I now am after what should have been the trans-formative growing up years of my life.

Its hard to start from any specific moment or event, as to how I ended up at this point. Over the course of four years, things in my life just slowly drifted from an organised state where I had real potential achieving my goals and growing up into the adult I should be, to this ugly, passionless, existence where I seem to have regressed in my ability to do anything. I have failed not just my academics, but every other piece of university life - from extra-curricular societies to meaningful friendships, to having something as small as having a clean room. It makes it so much worse that while failing university I was not in the pub, or fucking a girlfriend, or experimenting with drugs, or being 'that douchbag with an acoustic guitar at parties'. Most of my time was spent in my room doing nothing. Fucking nothing. I've managed to take the shittiest parts from all the different segments of university life and mash them together into a frankenstien of shit, apart from its not a frankenstein its my life. 

Its worse when I consider beating my problems, something I've tried again and again. Once a year I'll have a moment, where I realise the issues in my life, I'd wake up to it all and start honestly trying to improve things. I'd visit the doctor and the therapist and start trying to fix things, but as quickly as I gain motivation, it'll die away and I'll stop bothering to come to appointments or do anything about it. This is what really kills me, knowing full well what actions I should take but being aware that in a month or so's time that fire just won't be there anymore. To simultaneously want to get better, but to self sabotage all my attempts to fix it is so awful and to go back to my zombie state of video games and reddit browsing - not because of some evil influence on my life, but because I don't feel like it anymore.

I know I said I wanted to give you your space. I know I implied that if you thought we should break up, I would support your decision. But I don't.
I want to be with you. I want to do anything I possibly can to keep this relationship going. You said that I was your best friend. You said that we would see each other just as much as we did before you went to college.

Now you say you're not happy anymore, that you're not in a place where you think you should be in a relationship. You said you think you're ""cheating me"" by not being available. Every time we talk, you're with your friends! ""That's just because they're here and easily accessible."" I can be, too! I'll take the nearly three hour bus ride to get to you! I'll sit quietly while you and your friends study! Just the thought of your face while you study makes me wish I could see you one more time. You get the most beautiful look on your face when you're really zeroed in on something. I want to see it again.

I just want to try one last time. I know you don't think it'll fix anything, but maybe you've just lost touch with what it's like to be in this relationship. We haven't seen each other in weeks, and I just want to give it one last shot. You don't even want to try. You've given up. After all (I thought) we've been through, I thought it'd be harder for you to let go. I thought you'd be willing to fight alongside me to make this work. But you think it's over. What am I supposed to say to that? Am I supposed to show up to your dorm on my hands and knees and beg you to stay? Am I supposed to trap you in a relationship you don't think you can be happy in? I don't get how this fell apart so quickly.

The worse part is that you think the last time I saw you was a bad experience. You don't get that being with you is all I want. I'll admit that it maybe wasn't the most eventful time I've had with you, but just the fact that I saw you was good enough for me.

Now I'm going to ask if we can still be friends. Not just to clean both of our consciences, but because I really do think you're a crazy cool person. If we didn't become romantically involved with one another and met under different circumstances, we probably would've become pretty good friends.

509,gvqa6h,False,,1,The Haunted House,whatsbotheringyou,"Hi everyone, I am writing to tell you about my absurd situation.

In 2004 my parents bought an old house to renovate it together here in Italy, and to live in complete serenity, Unfortunately 10 years ago my father passed away, and 2 years later my uncle (one of my reference figures).

All this has created an economic situation towards my mother who, after 10 years, is taking a rather difficult turn.

It is not possible to sell the house at a price that can cover my mother's mortgage and in addition we cannot afford to renovate the house, which he planned to do together with my father.

The more time passes, the more the house is ruined, mold everywhere, wasp's nests, broken windows, the air conditioners have stopped working etc.

My brother and I are helping out as economically as possible, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be enough, I am 30 years old and I don't feel free to make my own life, all my thoughts and part of my money are sucked into that house, my brother because of the crisis caused by COVID-19 has recently lost his job.

I am hating that house with all my strength, which is taking away sleep and serenity from me.

I am suffering from this problem of huge anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do, there are times that I hope that house is just a bad dream.

It would be nice to be able to get rid of that house and see my mother finally happy in a small apartment she could manage, but i don't know how to do it unfortunally..

I am ashamed to talk about it even with my closest friends, luckily after years I found this subreddit to be able to let off steam.

Thank you very much guys!",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/gvqa6h/the_haunted_house/,12,"first of all, sorry for your loss. before it was easier to do the task. but now it is harder. with an easy calculation you can estimate the time and money needed for renovating the house. if it is tooo much (10 years or more) then maybe it is better to talk to your mother or brother first about ditching the house and referring to buy an small apartment. but if you with considering the toughies that renovating has, personally don't like selling the house (miss it later), then i would recommend keep renovating it.

178,1uyj31,False,,3,I'm becoming a hater,whatsbotheringyou,"I've always been taught to respect people as if they were myself, to give them the same treatment I'd like to have from them. I've spent almost my entire life looking for my ""spiritual path"" (and I think I found it), and so on.

At an early age I found out myself as gay (I mean: when I was 4 or 5 years old), and due to the education I had I used to see myself as filthy, sinner. More than that I used to think that the right woman would be able to put my homosexuality in a ""dormant"" state. I got married at 23 y.o., and divorced at 27. Then I had my first contact with another man, and, well, I discovered where my pleasure and my happiness dwell.

At that point I realized that being gay was not a problem to me, and I love myself as a gay man. But at the same time I realized that a large number of people hate gays just because they do, and I started to develop a hidden hate for all heterosexual people, including my relatives.

A few years in therapy and I got rid of this generalized hate. But the hate for religious people that label themselves as ""christians"", improved. I know I hate them because I fear them. I am always afraid of going out and being attacked by some homophobic jerk. If I could, I'd move to some gay community somewhere, but at this point I can't afford it yet.

But what's actually bothering me is: in a rational level I know nobody would attack me (because of my appearance, my size, my ""bad guy mood"", whatever), and those intolerant religious people deserve pity, or maybe just contempt; I know this hate I see everywhere is just a projection of my own hate and I don't know what to do with it.

I'd really like to be a better person for me, for my partner, for my mother and brother, and for all the rest of the world, but hating people because of their believes just makes me a hater, someone I don't like to be.

My biggest fear that is giving me the most anxiety is not getting accepted to a good school. No offense, but I think that getting into a good school is what makes or breaks the rest of your life. I know that may be horrible to say but that fact keeps me up at night. I have good grades, averaging an A-, but I'm still scared about this whole application process.

The cost of college has increased by 200% (after you adjust for inflation) in the last 30 years.

The interest rates on college loans have just increased by like 15% for literally no reason other than the United States congress decided to put money into the coffer-sieve through the pocket of the American student.

Not to mention most people (find the statistic yourself if you really care, we both have google) don't get a job in the field they study, and many people don't even get a job. I don't have a college degree and worked at a supermarket in the butcher shop with a woman who had a masters in psychology.

Go to a vocational school. Become a tradesman or a craftsman.

At first it was fine, I went from working McDonalds to this place and it seemed like anything was better than that.  I was told I'd be making 6.00/hr plus tips and working full time.

The first couple of weeks, that's what happened.  I did exactly what they wanted me to - washed dishes, ran deliveries, often made out pretty well in tips (maybe 50/night on the weekends).  The thing is that it gradually dawned on me that I'm not being paid 6.00/hr, but they pay everything in cash under the table so I have no way to report it.  Meanwhile, they reduced my hours and I no longer work any of the lucrative shifts.  I'm now just barely making enough to pay for gas money for each of my shifts (they don't pay mileage and they ask me quite often to go to the wholesale warehouse in my tiny Hyundai Sonata to pick up large orders).  I'm making something like 4.00/hr without tips counting towards anything but my job.   I don't even know when I work until the Sunday before the week starts. I'm asked to stay on call on all my days off and if I don't take their call I can expect to get chewed out when I get back.

When I go in to work, I'm berated constantly for being lazy and stupid, despite the fact that I'm confident that I wash dishes just as quickly as anyone else who works there.  Lately, my managers have actually been getting angry at me for doing dishes.  They say it's ""common sense"" that when the managers look busy, I should be standing by them helping them directly (although they told me from day one that I should never stand in the area they do because I get in the way).  The kinds of things they expect me to know how to do I was never trained for, and yet I lack ""common sense"" when, for example, I don't know their recipe for dough off the top of my head, or don't know how to operate a machine with a blade because no one ever took the time to show me what the each of the buttons do.  They make fun of me for asking people not to put knives in the water while I'm washing dishes where I can't see them, even though I've nearly cut myself on a couple.

I don't let it show when I'm there, I have a reputation for being serious (which is true of me outside of work too), but I'm constantly in a bad mood.

First my mom and her friend, who were drunk, started asking be inappropriate sexual questions in front of other people, mostly men and one of them being my father. They told me that if I don't drink I should at least get high. They were also telling me that if I don't lose my virginity by the time I'm 21 then I'm a loser.

I'm a guy in Grade 11, and I've got a few good friends and several other kind of acquaintances. The thing is, over the summer, I haven't really spoken to any of my good friends. We usually play games every other night or so on Steam, but this summer was way different. To start off, I was away for two weeks at the beginning. When I got back, none of my friends were around. I'd text, message on Facebook, or try to talk to them on Steam, but nothing worked. I didn't want to alienate them by being annoying, so I stopped trying. The summer went on, and we didn't talk once. I didn't even get the chance, as they wouldn't be online when I was and still hadn't responded to anything I'd said earlier in the summer. Now, with two weeks left, I don't know what to do. I've considered talking to them, but I'm wondering if my persistence in trying to talk to them was what drove them away. I just really don't know what to do.

374,62vtyu,False,,3,Communication is so hard for me,whatsbotheringyou,"I seem to have anxiety or something because it is so hard for me to communicate my needs. In my brain my needs are always just ridiculous and I should just keep them to myself, so it takes me days to work up the courage to communicate something sort of important. Or if I get drunk then I will accidentally let things slip that I want to keep hidden because I think its just too crazy to talk about. 

For instance, for a long time I thought I didnt want kids, but now I do. My boyfriend and I had agreed early on that we weren't going to have kids, so I just kept my change in feelings locked away in my mind, and I was just going to try to move past it myself. Anyway about a week ago when we got drunk, I accidentally let it slip. And it turned out very good that I did because it forced me then to talk about it more with my boyfriend, and turns out hes not against having kids, so in a few years time, we are having kids. 

But even little things like asking if I can set up an aquarium or get a pet (not that I really need to ask, but I prefer to) causes my heart to race and my anxiety(?) to go through the roof. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/62vtyu/communication_is_so_hard_for_me/,16,"Fellow poor communicator here. I have always been the type to avoid conflict and want to be easy going about things so sometimes it hard for me to say what I'm really thinking or feeling because I don't know what I'll do if the other person doesn't agree so it feels easier to bottle it up.

Obviously, as you're noticing it sounds like, this leads to big communication breakdowns and can do more harm than good. The way I try to think of it is that these people care about me and what I want matters to them. It's like lying by omission when I pretend that I want one thing (knowing in the back of my mind that I truly want something else). Never discount your needs as ridiculous, I promise you they are NEVER ridiculous to the people that love you.

The exercise that works for me best trying to just make a little lighthearted comment as soon as an idea comes to mind. Basically a joke. Something that relates to what I really want to say, but that doesn't feel like the BIG CONVERSATION that I'm dreading. From there, the door is more open in my mind to either continue the conversation in that moment or later on.

Another thing that sometimes works for me is just writing it down. Going through the conversation in my mind first makes it easier to have it later when I find an opportunity.

Like I said before, usually the person you're keeping the info from is someone that loves and cares about you. If it's important to you, you gotta just get the conversation started in whatever way feels the easiest for you. Send them a text or email if its less confrontational. Have the conversation while driving so you don't have to look at them. You don't have to do the whole ""we need to talk"" moment and sit them down for an interview. Find ways to make it as easy as humanly possible because the most important thing is just getting it out in the open. (You can work out the details afterward).

I believe our drunk selves are sometimes the most honest versions of ourselves, but do you really want to have these conversations drunk for the rest of your life? I know I didn't (I'm an embarrassing drunk person though to be fair).

Start small. and in my experience, it gets easier and easier every single time. ",2017-04-01 21:56:59

We're both college students living on our own, more info inside.",whatsbotheringyou,"Me and my sister are 5 years apart (I'm her older brother), and we will graduate with our degrees at the same time, and we both have a pre-paid college tuition (courtesy of our military widow grandmother.) I have two part time jobs to pay my bills, and my sister works sometimes at catering's for a restaurant she used to work at, and also as a nanny/house sitter/ dog sitter for one family.
I moved out when i was 18, and i'm almost 25 now. When i moved out i was in college, and i got an apartment, and i've been paying my bills since then on my own, with the exception of my phone bill ($15 paid for by my mother, i have a brick phone), and until today, my auto insurance. ($45 a month paid for by my father. I have a small efficient truck and the cheapest possible insurance plan.) I was in and out of college since i was eighteen, but I'm back for my third straight semester of A's as a part time engineering student (2 courses per semester.)

I work part time and I am a part time student. I work 20 hours a week for UPS loading trucks in the early AM, and i work 10 hours a week friday and saturday nights at a nightclub as a bouncer. I also work odd jobs when i have time (working on my friend's motorcycles, small handyman jobs, mowing lawns, etc.) I take no money from the government besides my tax return (principals). With these jobs i make about $800 a month and i can afford my $225 rent (i rent a 4 bedroom house with 3 other guys), and my $100 in other monthly expenses (gym, internet, utilities.) However, i still come up short at the grocery store and the gas station.
What I'm trying to convey here is that i work hard jobs at rough hours and i don't make much, but i live cheaply and simply, and i'm usually broke.

Today i met with my dad to get some old clothes from him, and he asked me if i could start paying for my own insurance, since i'm about to turn 25 and my rate will go down. he said he needed to start giving my sister more money. i told him of course that wouldn't be a problem. He is an out of work contractor with a fair bit of physical problems and his sole income is disability pay from the government.

Him and my mom (divorced) pay for my sister's rent, which is an all inclusive student apartment near the university. It's $550 a month. Before that she lived in the dorm, which cost about the same.
Lately she was complaining to my mom's side of the family that my dad isn't paying her the full amount he said he would to pay her rent.
My dad is pretty broke, and pays what money he has to keep our 40 acre farm we grew up on, (he knows i want to buy it from him once i start making money.)
It bothers me that my sister expects money from my parents for bills she is capable of paying. She says she is being forced to dip into her savings to pay her bills (she has at least 6 grand saved up that i know of). I have 60 dollars in my account right now, and $700 of credit card debt. She makes a fair bit of money with her spare jobs, and she buys fairly frivolous purchases. ( New furniture, custom wall hangings, $100-$200 jewelry items, shoes, etc. She pays for it with money from her savings.) Plus me and my father make her things and do all her home/vehicle maintenance for her. (Usually me since i live 3 miles from her and my father lives 25 miles away.)

I don't say anything to her about it, and i never invite comparison between us in front of our parents. I feel like it's fair for me to pay all of my own bills, after all i'm a part time student and she's a full time student, i'm in community college (cheaper) and she's in University (which i'll be attending as well in 2015). The only thing is i couldn't stop working to become a full time student, my parents can't afford to support both of us.

This is probably just more of a rant, i can repost somewhere else if this isn't the appropriate venue. I don't feel like there is a solution. It could be worse, my sister could be on drugs, she could be failing school, she could have a terrible boyfriend, etc. But she is a well-adjusted person that may just be a bit spoiled. 
I also feel like as the son i should be self-sufficient and as the daughter she should be taken care of.
So i don't mind doing my part to help my dad, but i wish she would stop taking his help for granted.

TL:DR. my sister has all her living expenses paid for by our parents and lives above the family's means, i get 2% of my expenses paid for by them and live very cheaply. We are both students. I work 30 hours a week and she works 5-6 hours a week. My father just stopped paying my auto insurance so he could pay her rent.

For our sophomore year, I couldn't live on campus but he did. As soon as he moved on campus, I heard less and leas from him. I thought he was just busy with moving in and whatnot so I didn't think much of it. Throughout that fall semester, he would ask me to drive him to Walmart and I would cause I thought ""hey, at least I get to spend a little time with him.""

I forgot to mention that for my birthday in September (of my sophomore year), he said that he loved me which further my interest in him thinking that everything was fine between us.

Come this school semester, his birthday was in January and I said I loved him and he said he loved me back. So I'm thinking cool, we still have that bond. 

Today, I send him a text saying that I miss him and he asks where is this coming from and after that I find out that he doesn't feel the same way that I do about him. So now, I feel real shitty and told him that I can't talk to him anymore.

On the back of this one, a lot of folks who can describe a scene from a book have either read it multiple times (even the most avid reader misses details the first few times) or have a photographic memory are are recalling the exact phrasing of the book (Stephen Fry has this, and he attributes this one skill to him graduating from Cambridge university).

Are you being distracted (by you phone, the Internet or something else) when you're trying to read? If so, try turning your phone/computer off for half an hour and read some of your book.

Perhaps it's a line spacing issue (the gap between each line or paragraph), are you reading physical books or eBooks? If it's an eBook, there'll be a setting to adjust the spacing. If it's a physical book, you might be able to find a version with different line spacing.

Have you tried listing to audio books?  ",2014-04-21 19:21:47
249,1yba7u,False,,3,My supposedly good friend has been making out with my ex girlfriend in front of me for weeks now.,whatsbotheringyou,"Well, ""making out"" isn't exactly the right term...i'll get to that later.


That title may bring up a lot of questions. Let me clear them up right now:
- all three of us work in a city theatre department

- he and I have been friends ever since September of 2013 (when we began the production of another performance) We were always talking and cracking jokes at each other. We got along well. 

- her and I dated from February of last year to August of last year. We were working on a show together when we first started dating I eventually ended it on what I thought was a good foot. We agreed to stay friends. We stayed in contact some, but not much. 

My department just started another show in December. When I found out we would be working together, I got a bit paranoid at first, but then realized everything'd only be awkward if we made it awkward. So on the first day of work, we both said hi and gave each other a hug. And it turns out my buddy would also be working with me! Great, right?


Well, they began flirting. Then they started holding hands. Then they started kissing. It's very hard not to notice these things because our building is pretty small. At first I honestly tried to avoid being in their presence as much as I could. But then I got a thought...


After a bit of observation, it seemed like they were intentionally doing this when I was around them (My guess is it's her doing more than his). So now I just stand where I'd usually stand or go where I'd usually go . And it *does* seem to lighten up when I do that. I just smile and try to go about my business.


But ever since i've done that, they've slowly been going nuts on each other. I'v heard how annoyed other people are by it as well. And I can't be sure...but it's like she gives me this look every once in awhile, in between a kiss with him. A look that says , ""eat your heart out."" 


Am I jealous? You may think so from reading this, but I can honestly say that I am not- or do not think I am. I am, however, pissed and depressed beyond my wits. I thought he was my friend, and then he goes and does that with my ex girlfriend? I know she's my *ex*, but still, that's not an okay thing to do without *at least* asking if it'd bother me, right? Or am I wrong?


And then she, while knowing fully well that he's my friend, goes off and does that everyday with me right there. I can't let her know it , but it's killing me. I don't even enjoy the work i'm doing anymore. Now it's about getting through the day without breaking down. 


I haven't spoken to either of them about this, or really in general for sometime. She sometimes says hello, but all I can do is grunt, ""hey."" 
She's always been ""stuck in middle school"" if you know what I mean. She was also brought up in an EXTREMELY conservative and scarily religious family. Not that there's anything wrong with being religious... It's just that it was a bit too much for me. She wouldn't make out with me because she thought it was demoralizing. 


Now, my former-friend, he's a complete horndog. So if you think i'm worried about them having a relationship, that's not it. I'm confident that pretty soon , he'll whip his pecker out and she'll scream bloody murder and run for the hills. What's really bothering me is that they're both doing this willingly with full knowledge of our past and my being there. He's in it for the tail, and I think she's in it to get to me. I say that because, remember, she's ""stuck in middleschool."" She was always a very dramatic person. 


Guys, this is really killing me. Figuratively, of course. I think I'd like to wait until the show is over to say anything to either of them (out of professional courtesy and so it won't be awkward). But I feel like I'm going to burst any day now and fuck the entire production up. I don't want to get fired. We're only a few weeks away from opening. But it's so fucking rough every day.

Basically all I see my future consisting of is me doing something I don't give a shit about and paying off student loans because I fucked around in high school. Not only am I dreading the future but I don't really have anything to hold on to. I still haven't found my ""calling"" or reason to keep pushing. I see all my peers have their passions, but I've always just coasted though everything. My parents seem pretty dead set on me just going to college and getting a normal job. Fuck that. I have daily thoughts of just leaving everything behind and going out and trying to do everything on my own. My parents have never wronged me though and pretty much given me everything I needed to be ""successful"". I'm not about to walk out on that.

It was the most miserable time of my life, and I ended up dropping out, and just finding a job, and I'm much happier.

Don't rush into anything just because its what others want for you. If you go to college, do it because its something you feel comfortable with, and something you want. Take time off if you need it, get a job and make some money, go travelling, figure out what you like and dislike and what you might want to do for a living. And don't be afraid to stay with your parents for a while. Trust me, the best way to save money is just to live at home, and besides, they're your parents.

391,27nqz9,False,,6,My boyfriend is distant towards me,whatsbotheringyou,"A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend of 3 years became really depressed and insecure about our relationship. He felt like that his reasons for being with me in the first place were bad and thought it was a bad decision. In short, he told me he got together with me because he didn't want to feel lonely. Okay, initially, that would be a bad reason to get together with someone, but it doesn't necessarily make it a bad decision altogether. At least, I don't think so. We've been together for 3 years and neither of us have had any fights, quarrels, or what have you. We've had arguments and disagreements like every other couple but we've always managed to work through them. He has done absolutely nothing to make me reconsider the relationship. His main concern was ""If you make a good decision for bad reasons, is it still a good decision?""

I think we all have shitty reasons for good decisions. When I was in high school they offered Juniors and Seniors a concurrent program where you can take college classes for both high school and college credit. Since these classes allowed for me to get out of school almost an hour earlier than high school, I went for it. I didn't even care much for the benefits it would offer me down the line, I just didn't want to be stuck in school until 3:35. As it turns out, not only did this allow for me to get college credit two years earlier than most, I got all of my basics out of the way when it came time to go to college as a full-time student. I also had several scholarships to that same Community College... so ultimately, it didn't even *matter* what my reasons were for going for that program in the first place. That program helped me establish what I really wanted to study.

Another part of it was that he felt that he wasn't good enough for me; that I deserve better, and that our relationship wasn't going anywhere... honestly, I'd only have an issue with the latter if neither of us were in college and we both had jobs and were living together. But for the time being, there's a good reason why our relationship doesn't go anywhere, and it's because neither of us have jobs that allow for us to live together yet, and we're both still in college studying. There's no need to rush into something more when you have important goals to accomplish first. His concern with this was that he thought I wasn't happy about it... but I'm just fine. I can wait until one of us graduates and/or gets a good enough job for us to be able to live together. Again, rushing into moving your relationship forward will cause undue stress.

As for the former... well... I feel like with that logic, I can't find anyone better. He has described me as the nicest person that he knows and he can't even remember a time when I made him mad. I feel the same way about him too. I don't think he really gets that in order to be with someone you have to expect some flaws. Don't settle for complete assholes that don't make you happy, of course, but at least make sure the awesome things about someone outweigh their flaws.

In any case, I managed to have a good long talk with him about it, and even spent a couple of days with him afterward. He was happy. I was happy. We were both happy. Until now.

Now it's happening again, He's getting very distant towards me, and any attempts and reassurances to him about how he can talk to me about any problems have resulted in him saying either a ""No"" or a ""k"" depending on what I say to him. Now today, he's finally told him to leave him be for a bit. I guess it is for the best, and I will give him the space he needs, but given that this is the first time he's explicitly told me to leave him alone gives me a bad feeling of what's to come next. I want whatever problems there are to be solved or at least talked about as soon as possible. I don't want us to split and wind up ruining what we've got, but if that's what he wants to do, then I don't have a choice in the matter.

EDIT: He finally opened up to me last night. As it turns out, he's felt like that I've been blowing him off as of late (Work as given me more hours, I've been hanging out with some friends, and I've also started volunteering at a Cat Shelter recently,) and that we weren't as close as we have been before. He thinks us going on a date would help bring us closer, so we're going on an adventure this Saturday. :) Thanks for your kind words, I really do appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/27nqz9/my_boyfriend_is_distant_towards_me/,16,"*""Another part of it was that he felt that he wasn't good enough for me; that I deserve better, and that our relationship wasn't going anywhere.""*

Although there's no dramatic, heinous act anyone has committed in your situation, I feel that your relationship is not exactly healthy. Relationships don't work well when we think we're better or worse than our partner. Rather, we should be on equal grounds, reflecting the good.


*""In short, he told me he got together with me because he didn't want to feel lonely.""*

I've been in the same situation. For me, loneliness just wasn't enough to keep it going long-term. I also never had bickering ""fights"" in that relationship because I didn't want to lose my best friend at the time. It ended on good terms and we've moved on to new relationships. We still talk to each other daily because we realized that we had many things in common, but just not affectionate, romantic love. 

It took me a long time to understand that you should **never try to love someone else until you've learned to love yourself first.** You should be with someone who falls in love with the ""happy"" version of you, not the ""sad/broken"" you.

Although I understand your logic behind your comparison to your college course units, love is not a side-dish.  ",2014-06-09 00:51:57
154,2513k9,False,,7,Loving you has made me hate myself.,whatsbotheringyou,"You brokeup with me once and I wish it ended there. You knew my darkness but only decided you wanted to be with me when you saw I was moving on. You told me you were insecure and afraid you'd be disappointing. I assured you and tried so hard to rebuild what we were.

I have never misrepresented myself and I haven't changed. Maybe you decided to settle for less because perfect hadn't come along. You could be satisfied with a half hearted love because it's better than being alone.

I know my flaws. I'm short and chubby. I have stretch marks. My hair is starting to grey. I don't look like Kelly Brook or Anna Songs but before I though I still had value. I thought it was possible to be pretty without being perfect.

You haven't given me a compliment in years. You never touch me, even in the rare cases when we're having sex. But you're more satisfied with porn then having sex with me anyway. 

I feel like your maid and your chef but not like a woman you're proud to be with. When we're in public you often walk away from me leaving me running to catch up. You say you can't walk slow, I just feel you don't want to be seen with me.

I have forgotten how to see myself. I'm always looking through a warped funhouse mirror that only shows my flaws. For the past six months I've just wanted to peel my skin off and pour acid on myself until I melt into nothingness. 

I hate me for ever loving you.

But recently things seemed to be ok. Dad still drinks too much, they argue on and off but nothing major. 

They've been doing the kitchen up recently. Mum decided she wants it open plan. So dad took down the kitchen wall. Argued a bit about it, but it came down.

Then he's realised he'll have to sort the ceiling. There's been a leak for a while. So today my dad had the day off work. He decided just to pull the ceiling down.

Mum came in from work and freaked out, understandably, about the giant hole in the ceiling and the bits of ceiling all over the floor. She yelled a bit, grabbed her car keys and left with my sister.

They came back about half an hour ago, and it's been constant argument ever since. Which is ok, I can deal with that. And then I heard a crash. Thought maybe the rest of the ceiling had just come down too.

And then I heard my mum screaming ""what the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to break that too?"" Yeah, he threw something at her. Followed by lots of mumbling from dad, and then another loud bump and then my mum yelling ""don't you dare punch me"" and the sound of a slap.

I have been rejected by all companies national and intenational. I can't    get any clients when freelancing. I was forced to go back home to live with the parents. They said it would be better if i found a job here so they get to see me. But i don't want that but i pleased them.. Everything for them right. I rejected a fucking offer to come live with them. And they keep asking for more.. I'm spent and tired and they keep telling me that they have given me a choice whereas they did not. They think that by getting me to ask them for anything will replace the need i have for making a solo life for myself. I just wanted to be alone make my own decisions.. Have fun, go out maybe date. But here with them.. Everytime i want to go out i haveto ask for money which is embarrassing for me to do specially at age 25. And they keep asking a shiload of questions, and if i come home at 10pm they flip. This is the part they don't get, that i am NOT a baby. If something happens let it happen it does not concern them anymore. Otherwise why did they give birth to me. I did not ask for it nor did i ask to live.

I am from morocco, you know, i love my country for all things it has provided for me, going to university for free and studying is a major benefit. However, not all countries are perfect and whether i like it or not, there are a lot of problems that plague the youth in this country, some of them being unemployment , poor health care, corruption, and a bad education system.
These issues of course plague most countries in different level of intensity, but here in Morocco, it has become lethal. Of course this is one of the issues i am suffering from, parents have had overprotective tendencies ever since i was young but it crossed the limit but i can't say anything to them because i love them so much i'd rather hurt myself than hurt them. My little sister is autistic, she never had a chance to blend in this society or study because Morocco does not have developped centers for autism. That being said, she didn't have the chance to work on her development therefore she will always bees someone to stay by her side. As her sister, it is my responsibility to take care of her which is why i am so desperate to find a job to support the family. I have so many fears and i never believe in optimism because it always comes back to bite me in the ass. I don't want to wait untill my parents are dead because they will be, maybe now, or tomorrow, or one year from now, who knows. I know it seems very silly and a little over exaggerated but..

195,fipam4,False,,16,I feel so fucking lonely,whatsbotheringyou,"Okay before writing this I'd like to tell you that everything I will tell here is totally true except some details I modified to not be doxed. If you don't trust me don't mention it just go away. I excuse myself because I don't speak english very well and because I don't really know reddit, just what people says about it but I've never gone here before. I am sorry if I don't post on the right subreddit, I'll probably flood.

My name is Pierre, I am a french boy. I am 15. I am very good at school with like 17/20 at every test, I have a girlfriend even she's ugly and I don't love her. I like programming, cybersec, philosophy, my PC. Following tests made IRL I do have moren than 149 IQ points, following internet tests and my own opinion I am an INTJ and I could be sadic and with antisocial troubles even if no one thinks it, evryone thinks I am just a kind of Einstein. If you see me IRL you'll just say ""This guy is super intelligent and very introverted, maybe strange"" 

IRL I do not really have friends, I've tryed before but they communicate as if communicating was the very purpose of their communication.

In fact, I don't really care about them and at best I ignore them, at worst they bother me. I point out that it is exactly the same for all members of my family. I use the internet a lot, especially the discords and 4chan. Even if it makes me laugh sometimes I find there also uninteresting people. Well, that was my little presentation: what I am, how I function socially.

The problem is that for about 4 weeks I have been crying every night at home for about an hour 20 to an hour 40 before sleeping.

I believe I have identified the cause of this shit: I believe that I feel alone. When I cry, I wonder why I am so different, why no one seems to suit me. I tried to sleep with my girlfriend in my arms but I wanted to physically hurt her (I already have sadistic behaviors during sex with her, she accepts it completely). For these few weeks, my sadistic impulses have intensified, I have developed a paranoia that comes periodically, I have become completely obsessed with cleanliness, I feel both empty and angry, I have done 3 episodes sleep paralysis.

I'm absolutely terrified, I tried to smoke weed to calm me down but it didn't do ANYTHING for me, usually in a situation of intense stress I do math and it ends up happening but there during the crisis c is absolutely impossible, I can't think.

This morning I heard a vox screaming in pain in my head, it passed quickly.

I am absolutely terrified, I do not know what is happening to me I am going to go crazy my state is getting worse and worse every day. With COVID 19, I will have to stay at home (I live in France) and I know that I will really become crazy without school to keep my mind occupied.

to find me a psychotherapist or I suicide and he’ll do it probably. I precise I do not want to suicide at all, it is absurd for me.
I continue having crisis every day and I feel them poor every day. Sleeping paralysis every night. Some words are in my head « You are alone you will die alone » I dont understand why at all.

411,1l0uza,False,,12,I'm not worth anybody's time,whatsbotheringyou,"It's to the point where I'm not even that sad coming to this conclusion. I feel like my whole life has been a culmination of events that have slowly guided me to feeling this way. 

At parties or social gatherings, I can come off as a happy and easy-going, and sometimes, I might genuinely feel like those things too. But so often, those feelings would dissipate quickly and I would feel down and out. 

For example: Yesterday, I went to a club with some of my friends, met two random girls at a bar and asked them if they wanted to come with me to the club. They agreed and for about half an hour or so, I was hanging out, dancing, having a good time with them and then they just flat-out ditch me to go chill with some other guys. At first, I didn't mind. They were still just strangers to me regardless of how much fun I thought I was having with them. But then I started thinking more into, something I do too often that I shouldn't do, and I just kept thinking and thinking about how I'm really not worth anybody's time. I let things snowball and I can give you an extensive list of life events that I could use to support this claim. I know I shouldn't use this superficial outing to let me down but it's something that I just do out of habit (I promise I'm trying to work on it).

I believe in the idea of true love and things like, but not for myself. Never for myself. I'm not even sure if I want to be with anybody but if I ever truly do, it'd be pointless. I'm not worth the time. I understand that people like confidence, and I do my best to go out there and be confident. In the end, it's all fake. The smile that I put in my face and the energy I devote to being a happy overall person, it's all in vain. None of it is genuine, because at the end of the day, I just feel empty, that nobody should bother with me.

I don't mean to come off as a whiny kid. I do have friends and family that I know care for me and have told me that they enjoy my company. It's just that too often, I breath a heavy sigh. My face feels heavy and I walk with either my head down or just looking away from people. 

I wish I could articulate all this better, but it's hard to go back and edit through things like this. I just want to say that I don't feel like this all the times. There are days where I feel like life's great and that I am somebody that matters to both myself and others.

It's not that it's too high pitched or too low pitched(though it's higher pitched than I'd like it to be), it's just kind of annoying sounding to me. I think it also annoys other people too, though I've never been told it does. When I speak I hear myself differently then the way other people hear me, because when I heard myself speak via video for the first time I hated the way my voice sounded. It sounded completely different than the way I perceived myself to sound. I even went through a period of time when I purposely changed my voice, though I couldn't keep it up for long.. Oddly enough I think it's effecting my confidence, because a lot of the time I'll think if I talk than It'll just come out annoying so I just keep quiet most of the time.

669,1x0tg4,False,,28,"I'm 21, never been in a relationship, or had sex.",whatsbotheringyou,"I have a feeling this is going to be a long rant. How I met your mother inspired me to write this. Its a good tv-show, would recommend. However, here is my story:

I'm 21 now. Played a sport (which I will not mention, for privacy reasons) for 14 years. Got to university to study sport science and exercise, life is good. I just haven't had any relationship.


While were at this, lets look back into my teens. As a teen I had acne problem. Really bad one too. Like, really really bad and long one. Tried pretty much everything (except the prescription ones, which was a mistake, should have tried earlier), but I got rid of it just now. At the age of 20. It did its damage to my self confidence, I mean... how could someone like somebody who had acne all over his face. Also, I got glasses, that gave a huge punch to my self confidence also. I'm still not quite in terms with my glasses. They're big and thick and...well I prefer contact lenses. Never liked my hair either. I would never do anything to my hair. The haircuts I get are ""short, but to short enough for the army. The regular kind of haircut"" I don't do anything with my hair, I just don't like it. I've been playing around with the idea of going to a stylist and telling her to do whatever she wants, full artistic freedom. As long as it looks good. My clothing? I don't know, regular. I suppose. Some brand clothes from some sport store. Whatever.

Now that we got my looks out of the way, I guess its good to mention my social life. I recall having 4 really close friends, but all of the classmates were good buddies, there is no bad blood between us. I played a lot of video games with the closest friends. That was it, video games. While I was at it, I kept on with my sport and had quite good friends from there also. They were nice. 

At some point however, these buddies started hanging out. Alcohol came into the scene, I wasn't really too into alcohol (to this day I still am not), neither did I know how just go out. I didn't want to go out. I found it more comforting to be inside, playing some stupid ass video game with friends, or practicing the sport I loved. 

Speaking of the sport, I was so good at it that I made it to the national team and the world cup. First year, under 18. Was fantastic, everything was fantastic, silver medal, best player award, things were good. I tried out on a team and didn't make it. It was huge bump for me. I couldn't sleep. Next year comes and I make to the team national team again. The media never was too nice on my sport. They like to pick out the bad things and run with them to get the clicks. One day you win and the next day you have the shittiest game of your life. Guess which one makes the news. And which one will get some nice comments such as: Personal_Issues is the weak link in the team, why is he getting playtime? Random people calling the general manager of the team, only to ask why I was playing instead of someone else. I felt like I was in a middle of a controversy. I couldn't stop reading the comments. My teammates told me not to care about them, but I couldn't. I was so curious. I remember the second tournament and the first game. We lost and they wanted to get an interview into news and the first question was: ""You performed poorly, did you even prepare for the tournament?"" Well, fuck you too. In the end, the 3rd place was one goal away. One goal. I'm the goalkeeper, I could have stopped that goal, but no. The third world cup was a major fuckup. When I was asked for 4th time for tryouts I just opted out with some shitty excuse. I wanted to have nothing to do with it. Eventually I just stopped playing completely. I never had a very good self confidence. I don't really believe the goddamn world cups never did too well on my self confidence. I even hate to bring the fact that I ever played there up. I think it became a vicious spiral, I had no self confidence, so I performed poorly. Because I performed poorly my self confidence always found a new low point. Never again, will I be that fuckup in front of anyones eyes. I guess that sort of made me very self conscious. I always try to please everyone and try not to fuck up at anything.

So, what does someone with no self confidence, and not willing to go out do these days? Play video games. I play them, not alot. I have a social circle. I would go online, talk with buddies via skype and play. I play more than I care to admit. That's my social circle. Three to four buddies whom I talk in skype with and some dudes who I met through the video game. I never met them in real life. 

Now i'm watching how I met your mother. Even though is a lighthearted comedy it makes me feel like a failure. I don't want to be this guy who goes to university, gets back home, plays video games until 2 am and wakes up sleep deprived (again). I want to go out. I want to drink with my buddies and have fun talking. I'm not very good at it, but I suppose I could just sit there listening. And be comfortable with it. For some reason i'm not comfortable with it. I'm not comfortable in that kind of setting. I would love to be. I know that once I was, but for some reason no more I am. 

The title of this post is what it is. And its wearing me out. I'm watching how I met your mother and I find myself thinking: How does one find someone like Robin. They're out there. I know, I've seen them. Really, really fine looking ladies. And they are funny, charming, cute, beautiful, everything. But how does one proceed from that? I don't hunt them. I just.... I just assume something happens at some point and stars align and... something. And every single tip and trick and suggestion and whatnot always highlights: Be self confident. Well, I guess before I am not happy with myself I can't expect someone to like me, an emotional mess of insecurities and neediness to show that I am capable and absolutely, totally not offending anyone by anything. And the sex part. I've played with the idea of going into a club, doing a one night stand and just be done with it. I realized that, that isn't what I want. Even though it isn't what I wan't I can't say it is not wearing me out. Everyone else seems to have done it. Everyone seems to know everything about it. I don't know. The sex part is hard to explain. I don't want to just simply have sex, but the fact that I haven't had sex is still kinda bugging me.

Also, the poor soul who read through this. I feel sorry for you. This wasn't supposed to be this long, but well, seems like there is many thins boiling under my skin.

Do some sport! Running or cycling maybe. Or hiking, yoga or martial arts even. Every day! Partake for the health aspects, including companionship when you feel ready, rather than to boost the ego via competition.

I think this will help deal with the other concerns too :-) ",2014-02-04 21:59:43

There is never a good time to hear the word cancer ,but right now it's even harder. My dad has been out of work and fighting a car accident claim that left his back pretty messed up and he does manual labor for a living, my mom is on a fixed income and going through all kinds of medical issues herself . We just lost a dog last year ( had him put down as he was pretty old and had no quality of life left) .
This dog is my baby I've had him since he was old enough to leave his mom, he has saved my moms life a few times and he is what helped us figure out she had a brain aneurysm and were able to get it fixed in time. He is pretty much her service dog , and my son loves him to death . I made a GoFundMe to try and help with the cost of surgery but none of my family and friends are donating , I know that sounds horrible but I have always helped these people when they were in need or had a GoFundMe of their own for pets or other things. I'm just frustrated and stressed out on what to do and how to afford this surgery ,and I absolutely can not lose my dog . I'm selling anything and everything I can .

454,2f3ool,False,,4,"Feeling a little empty, alone, and without direction.",whatsbotheringyou,"I really just feel like writing right now.  Something about putting my thoughts and feelings into words and putting them out there, even anonymously, sounds like it might make me feel better.  I'm not even sure what kind of response I want, if anything.  I hope this post even makes sense when I'm done, because I don't really have a goal here, just to put my thoughts down.

I'm a male and just turned 29 recently.  I've been single pretty much my entire life.  I had a few little flings in high school that didn't last more than 2 weeks, but I don't really count them.  I've never considered myself to be in a relationship, and I don't even know what that means.  

Though with that said, I have a pretty okay life.  I have a great job, my career is pretty secure, I'm debt free... nothing to really complain about there.  I guess in this regard I consider myself a ""success"".  

My family leaves something to be desired.  Don't get me wrong, I love them.  But it sure didn't turn out the way I wanted.  My parents stayed together as long as they could, for my sister and I.  Their relationship was always pretty rocky.  Pretty much right around the time I graduated college, it fell apart.  My mom cheated on my dad, and not long after they were divorced.  Didn't talk to my mom for awhile after that, but we're good now.  Though I can't stand cheaters, and may have some trust issues as a result.  Got into a stupid fight with my dad awhile back, we spent years not talking.  We've ""patched things up"" now but things are awkward and forced when I'm around him.  My mom, dad, and sister all live in their own apartments.  I don't have a home to go back to anymore.  I mean, it doesn't feel like home.  Selfishly, its not what I wanted.

I'm not really in a hurry to get married and start my own family, but I definitely want it.  I want a partner, I want kids, I want a home.  But, if my 29 years of being single is any indication, sometimes it starts to look like I might not get what I want.  I know I still have time, but I still worry that I won't ever meet someone to start a family with.  The idea of adoption has started to cross my mind.  Though 30 is a bit early to ""give up"" and even if I decided to, finding someone to let a single dude adopt in this day is probably near impossible.

There's a girl I like.  We're pretty good friends, I think.  She's younger than me, almost 25.  I'm pretty crazy about her, but it is one sided.  I asked her out about a year ago, but she told me she only wanted to be friends.  I tried to get over her, but it didn't work.  We're even better friends now, and unfortunately my feelings are stronger than ever.  I've started seeing a therapist at work because I let these feelings affect me too much.  We've agreed that I need to talk to her again and let her know my feelings.  If she agrees, great.  If she doesn't, then I need to move on.  I've just been waiting for the appropriate time...

She moved to this area for work, but she's never really loved it here.  There's somewhere else she would rather be.  I find out this week she had a job interview out there, and it went well.  She hasn't decided if she is taking it or not, but she is considering it.  So this girl that I am crazy about might be leaving.  I will tell her my feelings regardless, but I don't want her to go.  Even if she isn't my girlfriend or whatever, she's still my closest friend I have here.

I find myself thinking that if she leaves, my life is going to feel really empty.  And that probably isn't healthy one way or the other.  What am I doing?  I go to work, I exercise, I occasionally hang out with friends, but a lot of the time I'm just at home doing nothing.  Right now, I'm sitting here alone on this three day weekend.  My friends are all busy with other stuff, and I don't know what she's doing right now, but I know she has a lot on her mind.  I'm an introvert, I usually enjoy my alone time, but right now... I want to see her.  But I need to give her space.

Besides.  I don't think she feels comfortable hanging out with just me outside of work.  I've suggested several times that we do something, but she never does unless it is in a group setting.  I couldn't say what the deal is for sure.  Maybe she's afraid of leading me on?  Maybe I've misunderstood our friendship and she doesn't like me as much as I thought?  These thoughts cross my mind.  They make me sad, too.  I would never force myself on her or make an un-welcome move.  Even if she doesn't want to date me or be in a relationship, I still want to be friends, I just really like who she is as a person.

That's pretty much where I'm at right now.  Alone on a long weekend, only one person I can think about right now, and she's thinking about leaving my life all together.  

That's all, really, I guess.  I'm expecting responses of people telling me I need to get over her.  I know.  Like I said, I am seeing a relationship therapist about it.  And we have a plan for me to talk to her so I can potentially move on.  But I'm going to wait for her to make her decision on whether she is staying or leaving.  This choice she is making isn't about me.

There's so much things I would love to tell you because I feel we have a very similar path and approach with women... 

But the thing who attracted my attention was the fact that you are waiting for the right moment. My opinion is, if you want an awesome relationship (and you'll get to it, you always have what you truly want) then you shouldn't focus on the perfect moment. Love, or attraction, must exists in both sides. So go ahead, tell her exactly how you feel. If she likes you as well go ahead and enjoy, but if she doesn't, you would have tried, and move forward. Everyone can find an awesome relationship, so do you :) 

I myself am seeing a therapist these days. And it's saving my life, I'm getting rid of all my demons. Enjoy it while you are still able to change! 

Apparently it's very common to see a therapist when you turn 50 or so,  but it's harder to make quick progress. I'm 22, and it feels awesome to feel at your best inside that young.  My advice would be to keep seeing your therapist also :)

205,9dbllj,False,,2,I don't know how to function anymore and I leave all my relationships in shambles and irreparable. (warning: very long and gross),whatsbotheringyou,"I don't know how to talk about this without talking about my history. 

I was raised by a single mother, my grandmother at times, and 2 different stepfathers. 

My mom had me at 21, too young to embrace her youth. She still embraced it, while she was raising me. She'd pawn me off to her mom or friends when she went out to get drunk or go to a show. I get that, though. How could I not? She doesn't even know who my father is and I'm sure she shamed herself for that and dealt with depression. 

But raising a kid by herself was too much and ended up with this man, Michael Totzke (I don't mind to say his name, because he's dead now, so no harm no foul). He beat me. He would ""bathe"" with me and fondled my testicles. He would beat my mom and beat me in an almost Animal crossing-esque way(gcn original). He would go onto to his character made to beat me, then 5 minutes later get onto his character account that made him beat my mom and not allowing her to go to work. Repeat for 6 years of my life. 

Honestly, my proudest moment other than hopping my first train was when he was beating her one day, kicking her face against our Omaha, NE apartment door, I snuck out the window of my room (which was one of those underground apartment rooms, so the window of my room was met with ground outside), crawled to find a big enough stick to fight back, went back in my room, strapped on a bicycle helmet, and opened my door. 

I let out a war cry in order to fight this man with a tree branch and I ran at him while he was begging my mom not to leave him after he already gave her a dozen bootfuls.

He snagged the stick out of my hand, broke it, and threw me across the room and continued to beat the shit out of me once again. I didn't care, because it took the physical pain off of my mother. 

After a few years of all that, my mom didn't want me around Mike and sent me up to Alaska where her mom, my grandmother, recently moved to so I didn't have to be around all that. I lived there for a year and it was great. But eventually I went back because I had sisters. Half-sisters. Half-my mom, half-Mike. 

I went back and in one year, this man gained like, 200 lbs. He must've weighed close to 500 the night in the year of 2001 that I woke up to the sounds of my mother's screams when she discovered him dead in their bed. Cops and ambulance came. I saw him for a splitsecond. Ghost white. Heart failure, apparently. I sat with my sisters on the couch, them grieving for their father despite being too young to really ""get"" death and unbeknownst to the horrific sins of their legitimately schizophrenic father, while I silently sighed in relief. The evil man was gone. 

So we all moved to Alaska after my grandmother visited us a day or two after Mike passed. She was a great mom, she knew her daughter and grandkids needed her. 

The pain never went away of course and kind of mutated. I have a healthy distrust in men in general and whenever my 2nd step-dad, who has his issues as well, showed any kind of resemblance to Mike, I shut him down when I was a teenager. No man should even approach my mother ever again, I thought. 

I am a giant music/game nerd because I found escapism and solace in the internet, and my life was solely based in escapism. Not from the world, but from my life and how many times I was told that I ""look like a cow"" when I eat from Mike. 

My teenage years consisted of typical poor millennial teen stuff, but with lots of daddy issues, black metal and crust punk. 

I found love online and went to NYC after I dropped out and got my GED when I was 17. I had a secure friend group at the time in Fairbanks, AK. There were 4 of us, all angry kids. Hell, half of us were bastards so we bonded about that. We were the metalheads/punk kids attending the classes we loved but drank underneath the stairs next to the gymnasium during classes we had no care for. But they knew I left them for a chance at love. 

Now, back to NYC. Some people have ""long distance gone wrong when we met"" stories, but I do not. I was staying at a hotel there for 2 weeks. She knocked on my door at 6 in the morning the morning I arrived. I was sleeping, jetlagged, groggy, and overwhelmed by being in *the* major city of the US and I opened the door. We made out for 10 minutes. We got kicked out of Barnes and Noble for public fondling. We went to a Darkbuster show that night (poppunky Boston oi/ska band if you don't know them) and some guy came up to us, said ""hey ladies;) how is your night going?"" without realizing I was a dude at first and I think he wanted a threesome when he thought I was a young woman. 

Either way, 3 months later I decided to move to NYC from Fairbanks, AK. Because I found something. 

She was not my first love, but the first one that reciprocated. First I lost my virginity to. I actually lost close to 100 lbs as a freshman when I first met her on the message boards we regulared at the time. I was tired of being fat, and in order to impress this beautiful princess (my teenage mind thinking that), now's a good time as any to get into shape. That was back when I still had fire in my soul, of course. 

We broke up a year and a half later. She once lost the 600 dollar engagement ring I bought her in the bathroom of a pizza place we had sex in, and didn't realize until we were out of the restaurant. She ran back and it was already gone. Not anything to deal with the breakup, just thought you guys should know. 

We just broke up because my insecurity knows no depths. And we still had lives to live. 

So after that, I hung out in NYC for a bit, homeless and punx as fuck, and then a few months later after different activist activities, I decided to travel. Hop some trains. Lots of trains. 

For close to 9 years, on and off. Met many people that I love. Lost even more to drugs and booze. It became my identity and my personality as much as video games and music did. Which, gotta say, the video game stuff put off some hobo kids, gotta say. I was still a nerd. A dirty nerd but a nerd. 

As I said before, I started drinking at a young age. 14/15. Not all the time, just with friends. But after that breakup, at 18/19, I started drinking hard. Started at a fifth a day, then a halfgal a day, then a halfgal and a 20 pack of natty ice a day. It wasn't until I was 20 that I first had physical withdrawal symptoms. Then by 21, it was just routine. I decided that booze was me and me was booze and it had to be that way. Tethering that line between functional and sloppy is a rope too thin for me to cross, however. 

Apparently alcoholism runs hard in my family, by the way. My grandma lost her brother and her father to alcoholism at young ages. *shrug* we're all statistics, it's okay. 

So, as I said before, my life has always been about escapism and idealism and a bleeding heart for people as a whole. 

So I continued to escape via trains, travel, games, books, drinking, acid, shrooms, h, coke, sex, short romantic relationships etc for many years. But my only addictions have been benzos and drinking. Benzo addiction was shortlived while the booze stays strong. Cigs, too. 

Because I don't know how to cope. The healthiest way I ever coped was when I tried to beat up my samuel hayden of a stepfather with a stick. 

I have had jobs, off and on. Usually shortlived. I had dreams that fade in and out. Never really knowing if I even cared about existing in obtuse capitalism. I lost a good chunk of those jobs to my drinking and depression, it's true. Just the nature of the beast. 

Here's one thing that a junior sleuth could probably tell from this post and my emotional and mental problems that exude from it, I fall in love very easily. I let myself do that. Unlike my teenage years, I was way more successful at attempting those relationships in my 20s. Either purely sexual or romantic, however destructive. 

I tend to befriend exes after the breakups. All but 2, I believe. Not really on purpose, but in recognition of the great aspects of those people that I fell in love with in the first place. They deserve happiness. And of course with that mindset there is always that small part in the brain that's like (dude, sucks you couldn't give them the happiness they deserve, you gigantic scum. Also you have tiny man titties, stretch marks, and you don't understand advanced math as much as you want to because your genes are bad and you will always remain a mediocre musician and you will never beat bloodborne and...).

So I feel like I owe them something. And because of my own issues, I always end up making mistakes *with* my exes after the relationship was already ended years ago! 

Also, when I spent some time in Cambridge, Mass, I brought 4 people onto their first train. It was great times but years later, all but 1 died to the culture I showed to them. The culture they loved. Culture of the lost. 

I once fell for a woman in Michigan who was friends with a woman that I was deeply in love with. So check this, I loved a woman from there, and we finally, after years of loving this woman in a non-stalker way because that's not me and I don't condone that weird creepy ""love"", we finally kissed. And it was great. She seemed to enjoy it as well but she knew falling for me as well, would bring down her life because I am a ""DELINQUENT"". So without my knowledge she hooked me up with a friend of hers who also just got out of a breakup. She was fierce and strong but sadly ignorant to how hippies are on the westcoast. She really wanted to go out west because she wanted to see what ""freelove"" actually is. 
 
I did not want to tell her that, in hippiedom in weed, california, that polyamory is ran by people who just want to fuck. Trust me, these people aren't artists at making love. No one really is. They just like that enigma because it gets them more notches on their belt and/or bedpost. 

But no, she also wanted to see the pacific ocean for her first time. So no, I don't think I can destroy that dream for her. 

We did our roadtrip out west (while stopping at different beautiful national parks cuz her daddy was rich and paid for a parks card) and it was intense. We loved, we fought, we fucked. 

After our 2 months of trimming weed in hayfork, CA, she said we should open our relationship, which I knew she was going to say eventually. She even said it during our relationship, but then continued to treat us as a single unit. 

As we were going back east after we both had significant money in our pockets, in Reno, I told her, drunkenly, that I didn't want to go back with her because I had no place to go because of said weird nebulous breakup. 

She fought to have me go with her but there I stayed in that hotel room in Reno. For two weeks. 

I spent thousands on booze and questionable cocaine and hired an escort who stole 600 bucks from me. At that time, I felt peaked and didn't care what happened to me. There was quite literally a shady gun store across the street from the hotel and I was prepared to end it. Because my baggage was not worth it to anyone and the fucking airport won't take it. 

I told my mom goodbye, because she deserved to know. Sadly, I called her from my hotel phone and she managed to trace it to send cops to my location. 

They arrested me, while I was like, three half gals and half an 8ball into it, and was sent to a psycheward there. I withdrawed hard. I puked so much I busted the bags they have specifically made for puking several times. They kept me there without consent. 

Renova is the name, BTW. 

Three days later, they let me back to my hotel room without compensation for the room I stayed and paid for in that hotel. 

They acted like they saved me but did they really?

Fast forward to early last year. I was in the northeast, traveling around Rhode Island, Mass, Delaware. Cold windy winter. A woman with horrible horrible teeth but amazing everything else I fell in love with in Pennsylvania had to let me go because again, of my lifestyle. She gave me a spider necklace and sent me on my way. Cue whitesnake's here I go again. I was dealing with bad withdrawals, my progress in travel was slow, and I was close to freezing to death multiple times because I could barely exist. My grandma, same one I've been talking a lot about in this shitty little story of mine, called me one day and offered to send me to Alaska so I could get better and she could take of me. I finally gave in after 3 weeks of those calls. 

So I'm back in Alaska. I called an old friend to say hi and she admitted she was in love with me since we were 21. Since then she and I have been dating. Earlier this year she got pregnant and we agreed on an abortion because we are not in ripe situations to have a kid. We both come from poor families and abusive fathers. That is the shit that churns you up and spits you out into this horrific existence that no kid deserves. 

We agreed, but she made her own decision when she saw her first ultrasound. She was going to keep it, she told me. I raged because again, I don't know how to cope. Left that night like a giant piece of snowflake dung because the kid deserved better. 

Baby was miscarried two weeks later. And now me and the mom are together again, but everything emotional seems broken. Sex and intent is all we are now. No actual actions or romance anymore. 

I know this was a long read, I'm practicing because I think I want to write a memoir in my future just because everyone says I should and it invites dark comedy stylings which I feel like I'm okay at. I love this sub so much, it's meant a lot to me through the years. 

But every instance of romantic sensibility I have breaks apart because I tend to especially fall for people who are similar. Broken pasts, broken lives. We can't change our pasts and we all have to remember that otherwise we are going to die and be another stat. 

I just don't know how to deal with any of that. Counseling, meds, friends, nothing has helped. I hurt the people I love because of who I am.

I found a small handful of psychiatrists in the area who take my insurance, a list of phone numbers were provided to me by my health insurance provider. My experiences with said psychiatrists were as follows:

pdoc #1: made ""the wrong kind of appointment"" through his call center service for my first appointment, after I'd taken the day off of work, and sent me home after charging me a $20 copay that his secretary ""didn't know how to"" refund, telling me that they could make the ""right"" kind of new patient appointment for me to see him - 7 months from now.

pdoc #2: was able to see me in a month and a half from my calling him, and when I showed up and mentioned that I've been worried about money he launched into a half-hour tirade about how Donald Trump was an American hero and snowflakes were all too blind to understand his genius.

pdoc #3: called office after being referred by health insurance. Turns out he's DEAD and has been for like 6 years.

pdoc #4: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #5: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #6: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #7: ""patched through"" by the behavioral health facility she supposedly works for. Ended up connected to the personal cell phone of a strange man who picked up and started screaming and swearing at me before hanging up.

I don't know what to do anymore, it's clearly time to give up on finding a psychiatrist but the prospect of feeling this way forever is hideous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dg2kfy/i_could_honestly_cry/,18,"Go back to psychiatrist #2.

Cancel with your counselor, who only cares about their own ""curiosity"" or ineptitude and not your well-being (I had one like that). That's where you should really be focusing your energy on searching for, because a good therapist is one who genuinely cares. Look into LCSW and LPC designations, not just PhD and PsyDs.

188,1l5iko,False,,7,"Long distance relationship problems, he says he doesn't want to do it.",whatsbotheringyou,"Ok... This is kind of long story but I think it will help me feel better just getting it out. Thanks for listening.

I am a 24 year old female and he is 23 and just starting a two year grad program 1,000 miles away. We met a year ago and started dating exclusively shortly afterward. He knew he would be moving away 9 months after we met, and told me from the beginning he does not ever want to be in a long distance relationship. I was fine with this because I figured we would just deal with it later if it is still an issue. I put the thought of him leaving out of my mind so I could enjoy the time we did have.
 
We fell in love, I've met his family and I love them and they like me too, we have had a really good relationship-- I really do think he is someone I could marry. We have talked about marriage, and he's said that he thinks we could get married if we spend a couple years together (in the same city) and things are still great.

This is not my first serious relationship, and I know what I want out of a relationship, and though we do have some communication problems, I KNOW that this is something I want to be in. 

I graduated from college a year ago, and during that time I have applied for jobs in my field in my town and had no luck. I started applying for work in the city he is going to grad school a few months ago, but I had no luck there either. Two weeks ago, I got a job offer in my area (finally!) and I took it. It is a really great job, and it would be best for my career to keep for a couple years at least.

I don't have the money to move to where he is, or I would have gone with him. I have to buy a used car and have the money to move before I can go. I think it will take me about 9 months to save up enough to move there, and at that time he will be (hopefully) going abroad for an internship, or maybe somewhere else in the US.

We have spent 3 months apart so far, and we have seen each other 2 times. The last time was a month ago, I stayed with him and his family for a week just before he moved to where the school is. It was a really wonderful visit. He was very loving and we were equally excited to be with each other. Everything he did and said made me think that he would be ok with doing long distance for a while until i can afford to move down there. He has had his moments this summer where he gets really overwhelmed with the thought of not knowing how long we will be apart and having an open ended LDR (this was before i got that job). 

Last night we were talking on the phone and I could tell he had something on his mind and asked him what was bothering him. We talked for about 2 hours and he said that he doesn't think LDRs work, he's been in two of them before, and this one has a 1 year minimum and that is too much for him. 

And the way he talked about this upset me the most. He basically said that he's reduced this relationship to numbers and he doesn't see any way it can work. I feel that I am up to the challenge, and I realize how tough it will be, but I love him dearly and am determined to make it work. He said he didn't see how his feelings about me were relevant to the situation, either, when I asked how he felt about me and losing me and all that stuff. 

He is a very mathematical and logical person, and isn't as emotional as I am. The conversation ended up with us deciding to ""take a break"" for 3 months and then reevaluate how long it will take for me to move there, and how we feel about that. I think breaks are kind of stupid- usually they prolong a breakup that is already going to happen. The only reason I agreed to that is because the alternative is to break up. Which he was pretty much asking for us to do.

I had the last word in our conversation, it wasnt angry or anything. I think it struck a cord, because he called back and said he was sorry that this conversation went poorly and asked that we not do the break that night, and asked if we could talk today and figure this out. He was showing some emotion at this point. I agreed to that. 

I KNOW that it's probably a bad idea to try to talk someone out of a breakup. If someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with me, I usually let them go. But this is a case of the circumstances of our lives getting in the way, and the fact that we are so damn compatible and great together and we love each other shouldn't be taken lightly by either of us, i think. I think it's worth us fighting for. He is putting it all on me, i feel. I could save up just enough to go down there and try to wing it, but I want to be responsible and not piss off my family by just following my heart with no regard for the responsible thing to do. I told my boyfriend i would leave this great job to be with him, but I am really conflicted about that too. I am choosing him over my career. I would happily do this, though, if it meant we would be together from here on out.

This is also bothering me: I have never lived farther than a 50 mile radius of where I grew up and i really DO want to leave and see the world. If I am with him I will have the chance to do that. He wants to travel and he will have the means to do so after school.

We are about to talk on the phone again. I hope it goes well. I don't want to lose him, but if that's what needs to happen, so be it. Wish me luck. Thank you.

**TL;DR Our relationship is victim of poor timing. He doesn't want to be in a LDR and I am doing all I can to move there but it will be months before that happens.**

259,1lnj27,False,,4,Being Someone Else's Rock,whatsbotheringyou,"It's hard to say where to start here. I'd like to cover all my bases and get it out there before I explode without this post becoming a novel.

Suffice to say, I'm my boyfriend's rock. We've been together for seven years, going on eight, and I feel an immense amount of pressure because I'm his go-to when he feels bad or needs support, which is fine - it's part of being in a relationship - but it's increasingly becoming the focus of our interactions. 

He's having a hard time. He's been diagnosed with depression and was on medication for a while which helped, but since we both are working minimum wage, we can't afford the treatment any more. The doctor he was seeing suggested light therapy, but we can't afford to spend $300 on a full spectrum lamp. Our relationship has gone from long distance to living together to long distance again when my stepfather chased him out of the house. He's never had a family to speak of or help support him, and that bothers him too.

When my boyfriend moved out of my house, he had to drop out of school. He moved in with friends. After finding that living situation disagreeable, he found his own apartment. He kept saying ""I know if I can get a place of my own, I'll feel better."" I sort of knew going into it that he wouldn't - it was a ""grass is greener"" type thing, and that his depression would latch onto something else. It has. His problems now revolve around not having a car and having to ride his bike an hour and a half one way to a minimum wage job that he hates while dealing with frequent flat tires, spending his entire day at work or getting to and from it, and constantly having hints dropped by the manager about how expendable everyone who works there is. He feels stuck. He had goals for his life - things he wanted to do - but now he sometimes says he's not even sure what he wants any more. ""I'm not in control of my life."" has become something of his mantra.

We live paycheck to paycheck. I live with my mom and stepdad while I go to school, and I don't have many bills, so I don't mind giving him money, but it was incredibly intimidating for me to go from almost three grand in my savings account to $200 in about a month. I've never held more cash in my hand than I did when I gave him the money for his deposit, and his apartment is one of the cheapest we found. Since then, I've given him money on a regular basis. He probably gets about 3/4 of my paycheck any given week. Working two full time minimum wage jobs between us, we're managing to pay his rent on time and make sure he has fresh tires and tubes for his bike. I keep enough money to put gas in my car to get to school and work.

I haven't been able to see him in a few weeks, which is hard. I almost never have the time off, and a trip to see him costs me a full tank of gas. However, every time I do go see him, all we do is chores and errands because I have a car with which to do them and we can't afford to do anything else. 

I really do love him, but it seems like all that we do together is talk about how bad he feels, how worried he is about money, I send him money, and when I do get to see him I spend the day taking him to the thrift store and the grocery store and to pay bills and apply for assistance (thus far he's been eligible for a small amount of food stamps and nothing else). I've started to dread taking his phone calls because it's hard for me to listen to so much of his depression and be supportive without feeling pressure myself to help him feel better - though doing so seems something beyond my realm of capabilities. I worry constantly about money and about if he's going to hurt himself and about how bad he feels to the point that I've started having anxiety attacks at the drop of a hat, and my family is pushing me to see a doctor about anti-anxiety medication. On top of that, I feel bad that I think about how _I_ feel and the pressure _I'm_ under because he's the one in the bad situation.

I haven't been able to talk to anyone about these things. If I tell him, he'll only feel worse and panic that I'm going to break up with him (he already feels awful that I give him all my money, even though I don't care so much about that). I can't tell my family because they don't like that I send him money in the first place even though they don't know the scope of how much I support him financially. I thought it would be good to get it out _somewhere_.

Before that, she was as normal and lazy as could be, but no where as bad. Two years ago she changed. Don't know if its a midlife crisis, or menopause or what, but she changed. She started going online to chat rooms, looking up porn sites, trying to be funny about it.. Then she started going out and getting herself toys (I only know because I accidentally tripped over one she didn't put away.. gross), getting herself EXPENSIVE lingerie (She hasn't had a job in 8 years and she lives off my special 8 yr old nephews social security, which that money he never sees) and THEN, she starts going out of town with her friend ""Brenda"", gets a cell phone, starts texting people (she doesn't have any friends. None that I know of in the last 15 years) and finally, she started cheating on my dad with this guy steve ( which I actually went to school with his son).. and this is all driving me insane..

My wife and I went with him to his pulmonology follow up on Tuesday for the results on the PET scan, where it was confirmed that he had cancer.  Tomorrow I'm taking him to  his bronchoscopy where they'll take a sample of the 2.5cm mass to see what kind of cancer it is.  Since my wife is an ER/critical care MD, my BIL forwarded all the reports to her to look at.
   
  Here's the kicker.  She took a look at the radiological interpretation last night and in no uncertain terms, he has stage 4 lung cancer.  PET scan revealed metabolic activity in his lung, rib, sternum, humorus, pelvis, possible neck lymph node, and possible colon.  There's a 5-10% chance of living after 5 years of treatment.  I say living, because with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer it's not about curing, but reducing the tumor and managing symptoms.  Bone cancer is painful.  Lung cancer will make it increasingly difficult to breath.  Ultimately, they'll have to decide how they want to proceed, but this isn't a bucket list situation.  There's no time for that and quality of life is expected to decrease very quickly with or without treatment.

He doesn't know it's stage 4 yet.  The pulmonologist confirmed cancer, but maybe he was relying on the oncologist to break the news.  Only my wife and I know, but we'll probably have a family meeting on Saturday to tell them.  I think it's better to hear it from a family member?  There's a very, very good chance he won't live to see his daughters graduate college/high school.  My sister will be a widow before 50.  We have smokers in our small extended family and by BIL is that LAST person I would have expected to get lung cancer.  He's the stereotypical ironic cancer patient.  50 years old, never smoked, beer once a month.  Ran multiple marathons a year and no other health issues. Now there's a 5-10% chance he'll be around in 5 years.  This most likely will not be a pretty treatment.  They'll probably recommend aggressively treating this with chemo, radiation, and possibly immuno therapy, but it's going to get ugly.

I'm still coming to grips with this but I needed to tell someone.  I feel like an asshole for thinking that there are much more ""deserving"" people in our family (life long unapologetic smokers) who deserve this, not the high school teacher in the middle of his life with two daughters.  His dad died a few years ago, but his mother will have to bury her son.  It all breaks my heart and this is just the beginning.

My dad hurt his knee a log time ago and about 8 years ago we decided to do replacement knee surgery for him. After this surgery his knee was never right, it got infected SEVERAL times since then and he has 5 different surgery's on that knee since then. They had to replace the parts with different material-ed parts and also surgically clean it for infection several times. -=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=- Well, he came down with a bit of a fever and flu like symptons but was able to get over that, but shortly after he couldnt put any pressure on that knee ( about a week and half ago) So my mother took him a doctor who said it was Staph infection and sent him with pain meds only (Should they have put him on antibiotics?) and told him to come back on Tuesday (this was Sunday). They mentioned nothing was wrong with kidney's or liver or even that he had any infection in his blood stream at this point. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, when we brought him back on Tuesday (scheduled surgery to clean it out on tuesday) they found that the infection was in his blood stream and his kidney's were failing. -=-=-=-=-=-=- The doctors did the surgery on his knee to clean the infection out and were hoping this was the cause of the kidneys failing. His Kidney's continued to get worse, the only good news we got since this began was that the infection levels in his blood stream LOWERED but were not gone. -=-=-=-=-=-=-  They did Dialysis and it did not do much to help his kidney's but did remove a LOT of fluids from him. A few days later they noticed the infection back in his knee and also his livers were starting to fail .... This is where we made the hard choice to Amputate his leg. At this point we could try to clean it again and give it time, but with all the surgeries he has had to clean it and now his livers failing ... we thought it was the best idea .... 


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So he had his leg Amputated at 5pm on Xmas (last night) and since this his blood pressure has dropped dramatically - and he has excessive bleeding. They put in 3 pints of blood over night last night and this morning they transferred him to the ICU to see if they can stable him ... 

Should they have started antibiotics as soon as they figured it was Staph? Did we make the right choice to amputate? Does he even have a chance at this point? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1tqmp7/i_might_lose_my_dad_soon/,29,[deleted] ,2013-12-26 15:09:24
892,2xyz6e,False,,5,I don't think he wants me anymore,whatsbotheringyou,"We've been together for more than a year, our first real and meaningful  relationship, it has had its ups and downs (like a normal relationship I suppose), but I know how important communication is, so we've always have found a way to fix our issues. I found so much love and comfort with him, like I never thought I could ever experience... this is why it's hurting me so much, I don't want it to be over.

The past few weeks I've been feeling that he somehow has been losing interest in me, I know I'm not perfect, but he isn't either, I've tried so hard to get his attention, but I don't know if I should even have to try this much. He doesn't seduce me anymore, he doesn't hug me from behind and kiss my neck anymore, he doesn't send me dirty pictures anymore, he doesn't say anything if I send him dirty pictures anymore... I'm 25, I have a boyfriend and I haven't had sex in a month, for one or more reasons we've seen each other very little this last month. So I stopped telling him how much I want him, because I expected that it would make him say he wants me.

He once tried to break up with me because I ""deserved someone better"", I told him I'm the one who decides what I deserve, that I deserved love and that I had that with him, so we stayed together.

Today he said we need to talk about us, that he would try to leave work early so we could talk; he wasn't able to leave work early, and since I have to make an hour long drive to his place and also wake up early in the morning for work, I told him I wouldn't go (this is a usual thing, he knows I can't visit him on weekdays if he doesn't leave work before 6pm). So we said ""fine"".

We've barely seen each other in two weeks, like we watched a movie past Friday and that's it. He said ""well let's see if maybe we can meet on Saturday "".... He knows I had planned to be with him the whole weekend. I asked why the 'maybe' if we hadn't seen each other in a long time and I wanted to see him, he just gave me a sad face emoticon... nothing else has been said.

I think he wants to end it, but I still love him, am I being clingy?, I want him, I don't want anyone else. I don't know if I should try to save this relationship for the second time, or if I should just let him make the decision and not try to make him reason anymore, should I just let it go even though I love him with all my heart?

I'm so scared of losing him forever, I'm scared of getting my heart ripped in pieces.

547,2hkink,False,,4,I have no one to talk to. And I don't trust anyone anymore.,whatsbotheringyou,"Inspired by [this thread on adviceanimals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2hivjr/my_friends_sister_just_saved_his_life_she_doesnt/).

1. I am depressed and think about hurting myself all the time. I think about the people who generally don't care about my life, and how maybe they might realize that I really was a person, if I was gone. or they wouldn't and it wouldn't matter anyway.

2. I used to have people I would call when I was in crisis. I moved in with one of these people. We stopped getting along. He, in turn, is friends with the other three people on my list. One day he accidentally forwarded me a screenshot of me having called his phone three times ina  row with the caption ""He's looking for attention again.""

3. When I was 11, I threatened to hurt myself and my parents had me locked up for 72 hours to scare me out of it.

4. When I was 22, My girlfriend and I had a fight before I went to work. When I came home, she had called the police and told them I was depressed and possibly suicidal. She lied to them and told her I had threatened to kill myself during our fight (I hadn't). I was dragged back to the same hospital, the same room, where I was held for 72 hours again.

5. I have had therapists my whole life. Some prescribed drugs. Some said I was uncurable. I stopped seeing them when i turned 18 until I finally got the courage to reach out to one again. We had one session, and then my mother died unexpectedly that week. I forgot about our next appointment and when I did finally call her and told her what had happened, she told me that because I'd missed the appointment I was no longer her patient. I have been frightened of therapists hurting me ever since.

6. This week, while I sat with a kitchen knife in one hand and a phone in the other, I called a friend from my hometown. I didn't tell him about the knife. I told him I needed someone to talk to, and that I felt alone, I didn't know what else to do. I wasn't looking for attention...I was asking for help. He laughed, said that it couldn't be that bad, told me he had to go, and hung up.

7. This week I put something on my facbook feed. I didn't want to broadcast that I was depressed and needed help--I decided to instead express how I felt and hope someone else had those feelings, too. I posted that I felt like what I had wasn't what I wanted, and what I wanted was unattainable. I posted that I felt like a loser, and that I really could use some happiness right now. Someone on my facebook feed privately messaged me and told me that I should quit with the passive-aggressive statuses, because they're not impressing anyone. I stopped putting things on my facebook feed.

8. My greatest fear is being taken back to a hospital and being put in a room, alone, again. I am afraid someone will use interwebs-voodoo and dox me somehow via this throwaway reddit account and when I get home there will be police there waiting to take me back to a hospital. Please don't do this. I am begging you.

9. My father does not talk to me. I told my sister about my depression. She told me that I should just kill myself because my depression was making her upset. My sister has a lot of issues with narcissism and drugs.

10. I have had friends my whole life. Each and every one of them has lied to me. I hold honesty up very, very high in my life...I can't trust anyone because everyone lies to me.

11. I don't want pity. I want the hurt to stop.

I want someone to talk to, but I've run out of people to talk to. I don't know what to do.

I'm shy not because I'm afraid of initiating a conversation, but I worry people couldn't understand me due to the language barrier and they don't want to ""wait"" for me to finish a sentence. I don't want to ""bother"" people who don't want to listen to me, but I do want people to talk to me. Ironically, this dilemma bothers me. 

I tried many possible ways to gain more chances to talk to people. For example, I joined volleyball club and multicultural club. Also, I applied and got two internships during intersession and in the spring semester. Additionally, I am also a Chinese tutor for local students who take Chinese courses. I also have a roommate who is from Europe. I even applied for jobs in school.

Ultimately, I think that I do not know how to deal with all of the suffering in this world. I do not mean the suffering caused by war, famine, poverty. These things I am quite detached from because I live in a wealthy nation and they do not affect me in an direct way. I know that this is wrong because I do not think of myself as a citizen of my nation, but rather a human who must share this earth with everyone else. I know that we must all work together and help each other out.


No, my problems are so insignificant. But, are they? If my problems are so small, then why do I feel bad if they might affect the people around me. Sometimes I think that I have too much empathy. Sometimes I wish that I were completely alone so that I do not need to feel sadness at something lost or changed. I do not wish to feel happiness, because nothing is forever and I cannot fathom loss. I do not wish to feel sadness because it is loneliness and painful. I do not wish to see my family suffer. I do not wish to be relied upon for comfort, for happiness, for belonging.

I just want to be alone sometimes. I don't want anyone to think I do not want to be around them. I just don't know what to do about how I feel. Should I feel sadness? Yes, I do feel it and it scares me. I do not like when other people are sad, especially people that I care about.

Your title was about one thing and the body about others. There's all this emphasis on other people, as if your feelings should depend on them.

You're the one that should be in control of your emotions, and to do that you really have to be focusing totally on your own life and virtues. If you think about the way you'd like to live, and work to do that every day, then knowing that should have you in a constant state of bliss.

> Why should I look for a girlfriend or a wife when my grandmother is alone, and probably misses my grandfather.

While you should really be doing everything for yourself, if you want to make it about them, well what about how they *want* you to have a girlfriend or wife? 
> Why should I feel healthy and look forward to a future when my mother is tired, and exhausted from her disease.

How about because of how much she wants you to be healthy and look forward to a bright future?

Also, the emphasis on finding a girlfriend is dangerous. I say that because I've been there, and then found one, but it's almost never like you want it to be. Their interests are different, and your lives almost never fully agree. Sure, they don't have to, but what ends up happening to me is I want to be single again... Even sex, I was just thinking about this today. Sex is toted to be the single greatest thing ever in life, the best feeling in the world and the ultimate thing. But when it comes down to it, it's so momentary and it's really not all THAT great. I'm sure countless people could tell you that when they go into a relationship thinking it's what they need and finally they'll have it all together, they realize they were wrong and before you know it (maybe a year and $1000 later, if you're lucky, sometimes it's half a lifetime and a fortune) you'll be back at square 1 wondering what it is that you actually need. Now I'm young, and I know little about love, but I like it that way, and the way I see it, the only thing I can do is focus on myself and my goals. If the right one comes along, she will be interested and just help me out and enjoy sticking along for the ride. No work necessary.

One of the first things I think when I read this is MEDITATION. Try it out or continue. /r/Meditation 

Seems like you're torn up with all these feelings that weigh on every moment but you might be better off stepping back and simplifying. Peace and happiness should be so simple and innate. Easy things. Why do all these people really matter when it comes to your life and your emotions? Sure, it's family, and you should live such that you're making them happy and proud (I'm sure that this condition can be met with a wide variety of lifestyles or choices), but do the things you do for yourself. Man, I know what it's like to be hanging out with people wondering what they think about you and wondering why I'm hanging out with them and feeling a little weird about it and it's all too much fuss over nothing. I've been happy my past couple years hanging out with nearly no one, I'm just getting my school work done and on to the next thing. 

I think meditation could help you clear your mind and really appreciate your position every day and change your perception of what it is to be happy or sad. Maybe you'll gain a new perspective on your situation that you didn't have before, and realize that you are in a great place in life, and that might make you happy in a new way. 

When you say I'm already too selfish, I think you are WAY WRONG. When you say you are too empathetic, I think you're hitting the nail on the head based on what I am reading. Just make sure your daily life and environment are exactly what they should be, reassess your goals and be active on the path to getting there.  ",2014-11-05 04:55:30

My heart hurts and I really need someone to talk to...please.,whatsbotheringyou,"My ex and I began talking and spending time together again over the past few weeks. This whole time she has made me believe she is back in love with me and that we're on the track to dating again. This past weekend, she stayed with me. We had a fun time, and re-experienced emotions and intimacy that hadn't been explored since back when we were dating. The final night she was here, we had sex but it only lasted a few minutes before she was claiming she was too sore ""down there"" and it didn't feel good for her. I respected it, and so we got dressed and cuddled up to watch a movie. I didn't see it as a red flag at the time, because aside from the sex incident, she was very affectionate and touchy/kissy with me....telling me how much she ""loved me"" and had missed being with me. 

So the next day we both get off work and decide to go out and get sushi, then go see ""Captain Phillips""(Would recommend btw, great movie.) Everything seemed fine...we had a great conversation at dinner, then she was latched onto my arm during the movie and kissing on me and cuddling up to me. We get out of the movie kiss, say our goodbyes/iloveyous and part ways. 

Then things just stop. She quit answering my calls, texting me and essentially started ignoring me. Tonight I finally demanded that she give me an explanation and after much prying, she finally tells me this: ""to be honest, having sex with you didn't feel right at all. maybe we've fallen out of love"". WTF? She waits until now to tell me....after staying with me, cuddling, kissing, saying she loves me, and letting me pay for her dinner/movie? She essentially used me so that she could FEEL like she was in a relationship and get my affection.....She led me on. I feel fooled, tricked, mad at her, mad at myself for trusting her and letting myself fall for her again. Why would she string me along like that just to abruptly tell me she doesn't want anything between us anymore? She didn't apologize or anything. She only cares about her own feelings. I'm honestly pretty hurt right now. She fucked with my head and emotions like that and she has no remorse about it. I feel stupid and used.

176,1zdz5b,False,,6,My relationship came to an end today.,whatsbotheringyou,"A few days ago I posted here about how I wasn't sure about my relationship anymore. I was with my girlfriend for 2 years and a few months. The passion wasn't there anymore and there had been a strong disconnect between us recently. I loved her though and she was the biggest part of my life. 

Today she took it upon herself to end things. In all honesty I was prepared for this for like a week just waiting for her to speak up. She had been slowly moving her things out of my house that she kept there for awhile to her place and was essentially erasing all traces of her ever being there little by little.

She started our day by texting me the infamous ""We need to talk"". I already knew what was about to happen. So I drove up to her place and was ready to settle the matter in her driveway but she insists we drive to a park all the way across town. I'm thinking ""Seriously?"" 

So we get all the way there and I ask her to just be out with it. I was ready to just rip the band-aid off because I'm not the type to want to sit there and drown in our collective sorrow. She began to cry and told me she couldn't do this anymore. She said she loved me but wasn't *IN* love with me. So I figured that was that. The band-aid had come off and I was ready to bring her home for the last time. That's when she started adding some insult to injury about telling me that I have no drive to be successful and that I was dead weight dragging her behind.  

I thought this break up was going to be a quick and clean mutual agreement for a healthy break. Turned out to be a few stabs at me with salt rubbed in the wounds. It was a highly emotional moment for us both so I wasn't about to pull out my arsenal of ways to crush *her* feelings as well. I decided to stick to ripping the band-aid off. She was still sobbing heavily and I knew it was hard on her so I drove us through the nearest drive-thru at Mcdonalds and bought her a large sweet tea and drove her back home. I made sure she had all her things and told her ""See you."" as she exited my car. 

Alongside my mild sadness I feel a bit relieved that I'm back to being single. However, I feel more lost than I have ever been. I don't know how to begin this next era in my life or even how to effectively enjoy being alone after being in such a serious relationship the past couple of years.

495,1mesc4,False,,8,I got pulled over for the first time. I'm going to be sick.,whatsbotheringyou,"So, I realize this is rather inconsequential on a grand scale, but I feel awful and I need to talk to someone.

 I was driving to a babysitting job this afternoon, around ~5:15. I am going down a road that is usually deserted. I imagine I was going about ten-ish miles over the speed limit, but I don't know at this point because the experience freaks me out in my head. I am running late to a baby sitting job. 

Then suddenly... A wild police car appears coming from the opposite direction! Fuck. I hit the breaks, but appearantly he has already seen me. I am about to head in to a set of dangerous curves, so I have no choice to but to continue driving for roughly another half mile until I pull in to a post office. 

I am 16. This is the first time I have been puller over. In my state, a ticket could mean a suspended lisecene till 18. So the officer pulls me over, and asks to see my license. I give it to him, and he recognizes my name. 

He asks if my dad is a doctor down at the hospital. He is. For the record, he is also SWAT and occasionally fire department. So he asks me to call my dad and let him talk to him. So I call him, and the officer tells him I was speeding, and then he tells my dad that ""he can't prove it but I think that she sped up when she saw me turn my lights on"". 

Which is ridiculous because what kind of sense does that make? So he lets me go with a warning thankfully, and I make my way to my baby sitting job. I then call my dad, and we talk. He believes me when I say I in no way sped away, and that we'd talk about it when I got home. I will be home is roughly two hours. 

I am so anxious and nervous I think I'm going to vomit. I don't want to talk to anyone I know because I'm so horribly embarrassed.

Very long post ahead. 

This is my first post in here, but I honestly feel like I’m going crazy in this quarantine with my parents. I mean I feel like they’re abusive but what if I’m just the issue here? I don’t know. My mother threw my meds on the table, her dogs got them off the table and chewed up the bottle, so she in turn threw the bottle into a fucking cup of diet coke and I was unable to salvage any pills, and now after tomorrow I have no meds for a month and I am stressing. I dunno what I’m gonna do. I cant do any of my school work because my parents forced me to give my laptop to my sister and I have asked her for it back four times and shes ignoring me. I tried to talk to my mom about something really important today and she decided to be an asshole and act like a four year old and wouldn’t let me talk and then, got on tiktok and acted like I wasn’t there. I haven’t eaten anything but a candy bar today because I cant cook at all and I have nothing that doesn’t require cooking and they refused to help me out. So I tried to look up some recipes with what we had and it was all too complicated. I told her I got myself a therapist and she belittled me for it. This was a big deal because it required a lot of phone calls to several people and I have horrible anxiety. I’m so frustrated and so tired of living in this house. 

This happened a few days ago. 

Long story short dad asked me to change the trash. We have three bins in the kitchen, one was shoved under the counter and I didn’t even realize it was there. I went to go do the other thing he asked me after stopping in my room for like five mins to tell a friend I’d be back, and as I leave my room he comes stomping down to my room 

Conversation:

Him: whatd I ask you to do
Me: im going to finish right now
Him: Why didn’t you change the trash?
Me: what are you talking about? I did?
Him: Not all of them why dont you do what I fucking ask of you
Me: I literally am doing it right now

He walks away and I say to my mom when i get in the kitchen

“He can get out of bed to come yell at me about not changing the trash but cant get out of bed to change the trash”

He must’ve been eavesdropping because theres no way he heard me say that otherwise. From his bedroom to the kitchen, I live in a rather large house. 

Anyway. 
He comes busting through the sliding glass door in our kitchen and this convo ensues. 

Him: you got something to say?!
Me: I dont wanna fight with you
Him: then do what the fuck I ask of you
(Keep in mind im literally changing the last bin as hes screaming at me)
Me: i am literally doing it right now jesus christ!

He walks away after slamming the glass door so hard it shakes. 

I sit down at the table with mom and he comes down the hall, I look at him and he literally makes a face at me like a fucking five yo.

A min later I say to mom as dad is still in the hall.

Me: alright give me a hug 
Ma: are you going to bed?
Me: No but im not gonna come out of my room for a bit
Ma: Okay I love you

I go back to my room and realize I forgot my phone so I go back to get it. He calls me into his room as im walking back down the hall. 

Me: what do you want 
Him: Thought you weren’t gonna come out of your room
Me: Leave. Me. Alone.

I go to my room. My mom calls me out again to help her with something 

He calls me into his room again

Him: Just wanted to say I love you
Me: Oh so now you wanna be nice?
Him: I’m always nice 
Me: yeah ok
Him: except when you dont do what i ask
Me: Can you stop acting like a five year old? Youre 51 not 5 
Him: Im not you are, and if you’d do what I ask I wouldn’t be mean 
Me screaming because I am so frustrated and on the verge of tears: do you get off on being a douchebag to people? 
Him: no I just wanted to tell you I loved you
Him as im walking out of his room: and I know you love me too 

Sounds less dramatic than it was, but he does this constantly and i’m fucking over it. Excuse my language but I seriously am so angry and so upset. 

My dad had told me he’d kill me if he found out I was gay, because my sister outed my then boyfriend and I to my mother, and in turn she was calling me names and hitting me for a two weeks and in front of boyfriend. As he was there when I was confronted. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I work at Taco Bell like four hours for four days a week and am refused more hours. So I cant get out. They refuse to help me out with anything. I needed physical therapy and my insurance covers it but I cannot drive yet so I didn’t get to go. Six years ago I broke my ankle and needed surgery but he wouldn’t take me, so I broke my ankle again about two years ago or so, and now its even worse and I need it fixed but again he won’t take me. But he refuses and I mean REFUSES to teach me how to drive or to just let me take the test and try to wing it. (I can drive there are just still things I am not confident doing) I don’t have a bank account because I cannot get there to set up the account so I have some weird Taco Bell supplied debit card. I dunno. What am I supposed to do? I am at a loss. Am I crazy? Am I the problem here? I do everything they ask, I take the trash out every week for them, I clean the house, I clean up after my mothers five dogs including my own.

709,eh23z7,False,,5,I am tormented in my dreams with my first love.,whatsbotheringyou,"In don't really want to get into much detail about my personal life. But i need to express how much i've been suffering at my own hands (or by my own mind more likely). Im a high school student, \[17M\] and im not very social. But about two years ago when i was depressed and beaten up by life, i met a girl who eventually became the first person i have ever trully felt in love with, and it was one of those cases where *THAT ONE IS THE RIGHT ONE*. But, long story short... I messed up by being the awkward and anxious kid i used to be, we got separated and the only way i could talk to her was by messaging, but my depression affected my relationship with her by trying to get her to love me by making her think i needed her to live. In the last message i had with her, she got angry with me by always thinking she didn't wanted to see me.

Since then, we have both moved on. But recently, i have been having dreams that just keep getting worse.

First, it started with me seeing her somewhere, then i proceeding to run after her before i lost her, but she always dissapeared, or it was somebody else. So on and so forth.

But then, my dreams actually let me see her. Even in dreams, the moment i saw her and heard her voice, i felt as my heart skipped a beat. I hadn't felt as happier since i lost her in real life, so you could imagine how seeing her in my dream felt for me.

I talked to her, hugged her like we used to. It felt so real, but then, one moment i look away, and she is gone. The world turns darker and im just left alone.

But the worse so far, has been when my mind puts me through dreams where she is there, but in danger. I can only hear her scream in panic, i just run and run for what feels hours. Only for me to wake up before getting to her.

To this day, i keep looking for her, anxious to see her out in the city. I look for her in every social media. But i've only gotten her twitter from 5 years ago.

I just want the dreams to stop, for my mind to stop harrasing me with such dreams.

Im just happy that i no longer have to desperately look for her everywhere and feel like a pos for ruining our friendship.

914,26o6vc,False,,3,My friend seems to be fading out.,whatsbotheringyou,"I know this is how life works--- You have friends, some of them stay in your life and others fade out of it naturally. I was venting to someone about one of my faded friendships, and she brought up a good point. Now that you can have all these connections on social media, your faded friends are still kind of ...around. but they aren't and it's unnatural. It sorta goes against the natural order of things.

So here's my latest faded friendship I'm currently sad about-
I dated this guy for a year 7 years ago. we broke up and about 2 years later we became friends again. We would catch up every now and then on the phone, talk about people from high school and college and stuff. I texted him last month for his birthday and he didnt respond for a few days and texted again and he did. But he didn't hold a conversation with me. Yesterday I got curious about what he was up to, so I visited his Facebook page to find he had deleted me. 

He has a new girlfriend now, so maybe that's why. I dunno. He told me a few months ago this new girl was special and it seemed to me that he'd finally met someone that he had mutual feelings with. Maybe talking to me upsets her, or maybe he doesnt want to risk screwing this up with her? 

He was the last friend I had from high school. All the other ones have completely faded out for various reasons, I didn't have many to begin with. My oldest friend from childhood stopped talking to me after i went to college, giving me no explanation. This guy was the last holdout, and I guess it kind of stings that there doesn't seem to be any closure, just another fade away.

I texted him congrats on graduating last weekend, and sent him a brief fb message asking why we aren't fb friends anymore. Maybe he will respond, but I dunno. Maybe he doesn't owe me any explanation, but I wish he'd give me one. I feel like he's done a lot of things for me and I never got to return the favors. I hope I wasn't a selfish friend, and I wish I didn't always look for things to blame myself for.

My sister is arriving later tonight and my other sister is arriving tomorrow. We are a big family. Vacations like this are usually miserable due to us squishing into suites meant for smaller families. In the suite we are in now, there are 2 bedrooms making a total of 3 beds. There is also a 4th bed in the living room couch. My parents packed a blow up bed. I have no idea where it’s going to fit. I’m stepping over everyone’s stuff trying to get my clothes and shit. Its very cramped. The resort only allows 5 devices to be on WiFi at once and there are 6 of us. It’s a problem. I don’t like being stuffed in such close corners by my family.

I can’t. We are in Las Vegas but no one in my family drinks. So I have no idea why we’re here. My parents say they want to see a Michael Jackson show but it would bore me to tears.

334,2yg3g8,False,,5,My friend is cheating on his wife,whatsbotheringyou,"Where to start? 

We'll call them John and Jane. My boyfriend and I used to work with John, then my boyfriend got a job as a manager at another, much nicer, place, and was able to get a position for John. Then John got his wife hired as just a weekend part-timer.

Now, these certainly aren't our **best friends**, but we double dated a few times and I would consider them to be in our friend circle, even if it was just the outer circle.

When John worked with us, there was a girl who had told my boyfriend that John had been flirting with her and telling her that he would leave his wife for her, but as this was the first we had ever heard of it, we didn't want to think he was too serious. 

But now, at this new place, where Jane also works, there are three girls saying that he said the same thing to them. Then one of the girls finally just straight up tells people that she had an affair with John. Not just a one time thing. She would go to John and Jane's place on the weekends when Jane was at work. My boyfriend, who is now not only John's manager, but also the person who brought John in to this job to begin with, confronted him. He needed to know for sure if these rumors were true, but also felt like John should know that the people he and his wife work with know that he had an affair. 

So now the thing that is bothering me is that no one is telling Jane. Her husband is cheating on her, and while we only know of one other woman he's slept with, it's not like he hasn't tried to get with more. And on top of that, she is trying to have a baby with him and start their family.

On the other side of it though, Jane is apparently an abusive wife. My boyfriend has told me about texts John has shown him where Jane berates him, tells his he's a useless husband, and from what John says, she withholds sex for months at a time, only sleeping with him when she's ovulating to try and get pregnant. 

So I can sort of understand why John would step out on the relationship (although I believe if you can't be faithful then just get out of the relationship completely), but she still should know, for her sexual health (what if he contracts something, it's not like they use protection), for the potential child that would be born into chaos, and for them, because they clearly aren't on the same page at all.

I don't want to be the one to ruin a marriage, but at the same time I feel like John has already done that, and if it were me, and all the people I work with know that my husband is sleeping with my co-worker...

We were having jokes and having a good time. Eventually the conversation goes steers toward my dead grandfather. It's here mum starts getting emotional saying us two are the only family she has now (one uncle is in prison, the other she doesn't talk to because of pretty horrid quarrels which I won't be going into). It's here my brother asks her what happened to nan (All I knew about her was that she was dead and that granddad remarried) 


It's here she spills the beans. She starts tearing up and explains when she was little she heard her father beat her mother to death. 


The meal was awkward after that. She wouldn't elaborate the rest of the holiday. I had to ask my dad to elaborate and he only knew what mum told him: not much. But he confirmed it: my grandfather was a murderer. 


I don't know how the bastard got away with it. He was in the army. This would have been around the sixties/seventies I'd imagine. 


I hate that man. I wish there was a heaven just so I'd know he's rotting in hell. This evil abusive piece of shit used to tell me bed time stories. Part of me wishes he was still alive so I could kick his ass. He stole my nan from me and my brother and a mother from my mother.

630,6ih3y1,False,,3,Anyone else feel like being sensitive and empathetic just isn't worth it anymore?,whatsbotheringyou,"I've been raised pretty much my entire life to always put everybody else first... to set myself aside and worry about how others are feeling, to consider everyone else's feelings before my own. To treat everyone else how I would want to be treated.

Which would be fantastic, I think, if everyone was raised the same way. But they're not. Time and time again, I end up being ignored; people turn on me, take advantage of my kindness, refuse to show me the same respect I show everyone else, and generally just talk down to me like I'm an idiot because I actually consider the possible results of my actions on the people around me.

The worst part about it, though, is trying to change. Telling yourself ""I don't want to be nice and empathetic anymore."" The same people that show you callousness and lack of empathy get really, really angry when you reciprocate with the way they treat you. I'm sick of being hurt because of being empathetic, but when I try to stop being empathetic and just start living for myself, I'm suddenly a villain--when the people around me were already doing exactly that in the first place and got away with it fine!

It just seems like if you put yourself forward as a kind and caring person from the start, everyone wants to take advantage of you and when you stop being easy to take advantage of, they start abusing and hating you. Yet, if you put yourself forward as callous and uncaring from the very start, they don't really bat an eye. They think ""Oh, another one of those guys. Whatever."" and continue about their daily lives... and are pleasantly surprised when you show you CAN be empathetic and kind when you want to.

I just fricking hate how ludicrously backwards and unfair it is. If you try to be nice to people by showing basic human decency, you become their doormat. If you instead raise people a flying middle finger and refuse to offer anybody simple kindness or empathy, you're rewarded with affection and approval for showing even the slightest bit of basic human decency at all.

I hate it. I hate it so much. I hate being this way. I don't want to be nice anymore but I also don't want to anger the people that already EXPECT me to be nice. It's not fair.

When you act nice to others, you become mean to yourself. Stop acting nice. Stop playing nice. You're being a phony and now your phoniness is taking a toll on you. You have a mean side and you've hid it from the public for a long time. Treat others the way you treat yourself is my advice. Are you emphatic and sensitive to yourself? I won't believe you if you say yes. I think you are very angry to yourself by the words you use. Start being angry in the same way you are to yourself to others. Tell people ""fuck off"" if they get under your grill, and tell people ""I hate you"" if you do. You may anger them, so what? What happens for you if they disapprove or get mad at you? Maybe you are more mad? Express that too.

I don't recommend everyone be assholes. I think for you however you're a huge asshole to yourself by denying your anger and only showing certain nice qualities. So I think you need some asshole therapy, for a while just allow yourself to get really angry and allow yourself to be mean and get that side of you out in the public and pay attention to how you feel in your body as you take on that role rather than the nice role. 

Realise in time you are neither mean nor nice, you are an integration of both qualities, both parts exist within you, you will find a centre between the two polarities, but for now get used to being mean. ",2017-06-20 21:18:20

159,1jedi0,False,,21,"In lieu of 400 subscribers, I'd just like to say a few words",whatsbotheringyou,"I find it hard to believe what this has become, but I mean that in a good way.

But when we look at this for what it really is, can you blame me for beening a little incredulous? One day, I sat down on my computer and tossed a question out into the void, leaving anybody to answer it however they chose. ""What is your current reason for being unhappy?"" It's a simple enough question. I didn't even expect many people to answer. But when people did answer, I found myself wanting to have a discussion with them. I wanted to share their grievences and problems with them. I wanted to tell people that they weren't alone and that at least one person, somewhere out there in the universe, can relate to their problem and understands. That at least one person genuinely cares. Sometimes it's easy to feel lost and alone in our worries. I find irony that people can connect so deeply and on an emotional level with someone over a medium that is known mostly for its anonymity. I'm a little awe-stricken by the internet's ability to connect people when they can feel so alone about their problems in day-to-day life. That's an extremely powerful thing to do.

Frequently we find that the internet can be a dark and scary place. People stop recognizing that a username is just a representation of an actual person. It's easy to attack a profile over the internet because they're barely seen as a person. Sometimes just words, sometimes a disembodied voice, and sometimes a picture, but rarely a person. But that doesn't mean those words can't actually have a real effect on someone. It's easy to shoot a bullet at a cardboard cutout of a person, if you forget that there's an actual person standing behind it, but that doesn't mean the person is going to be protected from your shot. I don't like that.

And that leads to what that simple question on /r/AskReddit did. The point wasn't to share thoughts, or opinions, it was to share experience. True, emotional experience that other people could relate to. It served as a reminder that there are real people on the internet, that share your feelings, and have been through some of the same stuff that you have. Everyone becomes more than just a username. They become someone that you can relate to. Someone that you can understand, and empathize with.

I suppose that's why we're all here. Because we need to find someone else that understands our problems, or because we want to let someone else know that we care. Both of those are a pretty remarkable thing. To put yourself out there to the world, and to be there for those people who put their trust in what you have to say.

The internet as a whole could certainly be improved by the example that all of you set here, and I'm very proud to be a part of it.

442,36lkzi,False,,2,"Why did the bullet not go through her skull, and did she suffer much?",whatsbotheringyou,"I had to put down my pet dog, Lucy awhile back. She was close to 20 and in bad health. She only had a few teeth left, and they were loose and rotten. She had been hit by a car when she was young and had a bad back ever since. She couldn't control her bladder well anymore. She was losing her eyesight, and her hearing was almost completely gone. She had lumps in her neck that I thought might have been cancer. She had a few episodes when she would yelp loudly for extended periods of time as if she was being kicked repeatedly. One morning my grandmother told me there was something wrong with her. Apparently before I woke up she had been acting weird and stumbling around like she was about to pass out. My grandmother told me she then yelled, fell over and just layed there not trying to get back up. I got to her as soon as possible. She was lying there as if she was just giving up. Her mouth was open, and her tongue was hanging out. She was breathing heavily. I knew she was in pain and something had just happened to her. Maybe a stroke or heart attack. I don't know. I didn't think she would recover, and I knew that if she did, she would only get worse. I knew for sure at the moment she was suffering, and if I let her she would eventually suffer more. I decided it was time to end her suffering. I couldn't stand watching her that way. We didn't have the money to take her to the vet for them to put her down. So I took her outside, and after the most heartbreaking moments I had ever experienced saying goodbye and letting her know how much I loved and appreciated her and her companionship, I attempted to shoot her in the head with my .40. I completely missed the first time. I guess I was so upset that I wasn't controlling the shot well. Lucy jumped up immediately, startled and frightened. However, she didn't go anywhere. Just looked at me as if to say, ""What are you doing?"" Looking back, I could have decided not to kill her at that point. However, as I mentioned already, if I didn't she would suffer more and longer. So I steadied myself and took another shot. I didn't miss. The bullet hit her skull, but it didn't go through. Instead, it grazed around the side of her head. It left a wound from the top of her head past her ear. She just stared at me, still not going anywhere. I was so pissed off at myself that I had done that to her. Here I was thinking that I would put her out of her suffering, but it seemed as though I was just scaring and mutilating her. I was absolutely taken aback from the bullet not going through. I was disgusted with myself. I knew that the next shot had to count. I wasn't about to have another fluke, and cause her more pain and stretch it out any longer. I didn't trust the bullet to go through her skull, so I did the next best thing I could think of. I shot her in the neck. This time the bullet went through. Blood began to pour. She fell down and began the horrible twitching. I knew that shot had been successful. Please be empathetic with me. I loved Lucy. She was an amazing friend. We had been through a lot together. I was torn apart. I just couldn't let her keep suffering. However, I feel full of regrets. One thing is what I've already described, about how it didn't go as planned. Why didn't the bullet go through? It was a target round because that's the only ammo I had, but still, a .40 round should've had no problem at that range, less than three feet. Did I cause her more suffering than she would've experienced if I hadn't done it? That's probably the biggest one. Next, I wish we would've had the money to keep her healthy and when the time came to have her put down professionally. It just didn't work out, and in a way, I feel I failed her. I think she would forgive me, but I don't know. It just sucks. I'm in tears typing this. I've had dreams about what happened. I've had dreams that seemed so real where we'd be playing together like normal. I had dreams where I'd just walk through the house, look over and see her laying there sleeping or relaxing watching me walk by. Then I'd wake up, and be overwhelmingly sad. It took me weeks to stop looking for her in the house or not expect to hear her walking through the kitchen like always or expect her to run into the kitchen whenever someone was getting food hoping for a snack herself. Any time I think about it, I get very sad and want to just stop. To give you a feel of how much I loved and cared for Lucy, I didn't cry at my great grandmother or grandfather's funeral. Nor did I cry at my great aunt's funeral. I hardly ever cry. That day, I bawled like a baby from the beginning to the end, and I'm crying now. I'd be happy to hear any supportive comments. I want the negative ones as well, though, if there are any. If I'm doing anything incorrectly as far as the post location or format, I'm sorry. This is my first reddit post.

He sleeps in the front room on the sofa instead of a proper bed. He stays up until 5 in the morning. The house is a fucking mess and has been all my life. I'm pretty sure he's a hoarder. Not as bad as the ones on TV but pretty bad. It's mainly laziness opposed to emotional attachment. I think he was depressed since before I was born. I feel horrible for trying to pursue my own needs in the face of his condition and it causes tension between us but I can't ignore my own health. Every conversation we have runs the risk of turning into a shouting match. I expect this and I shut down during the conversation and struggle to answer his questions. This just makes him angrier. He says we both have a part to play in our difficulty in communicating but a lot of them would go away if he didn't talk to me like I was five fucking years old. I'm 24 and living at home with a degree that won't get me anywhere. I have no experience that'll get me a job in somewhere I want to be. I desperately want to work in the arts in some way.

It really, profoundly bothers me when people insist that my anxiety problems are A. all in my head and essentially voluntary, B. fixable with Jesus, or C. *both!*

I'm living back at home due to debts (oh hi, sudden emergency medical bills) and I made the mistake of expressing the fact that I was having an anxiety attack. Or that it had escalated to a panic attack. Or that the past three or four weeks have, basically, been one long anxiety attack with brief breaks for puppy kisses and wine. My aunt cornered me in my room and gave me a long spiel about Jesus. And, I get it, she was trying to help in her own way. I love that my family loves me. 

But, ""You can choose Jesus, or you can choose the panic attacks."" ""You're the only one who can control the thoughts that are in your head."" ""When your mom gets back with the medicine, you can tell her, 'I don't need those, I have Jesus!'"" (I was having a panic attack, and my pills were elsewhere, but I couldn't drive to get them. I didn't even ask, my mom just went to get them because she is sweet.) In the end I played along with it to get her to leave. 

It just makes me feel *even worse* to suggest that my *diagnosed-by-doctors anxiety disorder, complete with panic attacks* is something that I'm allowing to happen, by way of just not trying hard enough or just not being Jesusy enough. I already feel like a wuss for the thought of driving to Dallas alone at night sending me into a knock-kneed, hyperventilating, dizzymaking panic attack and missing my friend's show. 

Now I'm being told I'm letting it happen for not following the same religion that also used to give me panic attacks because I was convinced every loud noise at night was the Apocalypse. I would express this, but I don't want to sadden my mother, and I'm almost certain I would be told that if Christianity caused me terrible anxiety, I was doing it wrong.

She tells me often, and at great length, that my speech is what makes me whole, and that I can change it if I tap into some kind of spiritual something or other.

958,1k7g9t,False,,4,"I am a failure at jobhunting, and probably at life",whatsbotheringyou,"Hello guys, I need to get this off my head asap. This has been bothering me for a year+. I am currently 23, soon to be 24. Last year I have graduated with a first class degree in maths from one of the top universities of the uk. I have ""great"" GCSEs and A levels with awards to match. So you might be surprised then, as to why I have no job, and here sighing.

Last year when I graduated, my dad, who owns a takeaway needed a trustworthy person to handle the counter, organisation of the service, the documents, finance and all that compliance stuff. It turns out I was the one to do it. At first, I was like ""huh? but I don't want to do this, I want to find a real job, a job where I don't work for a member of family"". Well I did it anyway, but as I did, I was wondering what job I actually want to do. 

You see, during university, I tried to apply for those big investment banks that everyone was talking about as well as the normal banks along the way and it didn't work out. I don't know what is wrong with me, but I absolutely hate interviews, whether by phone, or in person. Often the interviewers ask these questions on leadership, stuff that gets out of control and how I approached this and that. To be honest, fair enough if they have to ask it, but it doesn't mask the fact that I feel like pulling my fingernails off everytime they ask me a question. I just dislike talking for some reason. I just remember every failure I did during the interviews, from what I said that I felt could have been better, to the rejection emails. I still remember my epic fail from 2010. Am I just not capable to move on?

So fast forward to today, and I have given up the idea of working for the big guns, because I'm doubting whether i'm actually suitable for the job. But I need to get a job, and many of my friends recommended me to go onto accountancy. The thing is, their procedure of hire (especially for the ""big 4"") is just as, if not more... talkative. There is a phone interview, first interview, final interview and group excercise. ""Oh dear god, give me strength"" is the thought that went through my mind when I read through that. I find it difficult to muster the courage to click ""send application"". I mean, i'm actually quite happy to do those online verbal and numerical tests and stuff which could take 40mins+, but a 15 min interview? No way! Hence, I procastinate big time when it comes to those applications.

I don't know what to do anymore. To add on top of this, I see myself as a failure in society, because I don't have a strong ambition. I'm halfway between going all in on accountancy and i.t. . When I am alone, I just think of how awful I am. I envy my friends. Some are doing what they always want to do. The others? Well, they may not be doing their ideal jobs, but at least they got a job. I envy my brothers. My older brother is rather successful with his career as a banker. I had recently got rejected from one of the big4 with no real explanation, whereas my younger brother (who graduated this year) managed to go pass where I failed.

To take my mind off those feelings, I pass the time by doing what I dreamed of doing when I was a kid - to make computer games. With minimal programming experience, I learnt some Java and some android, and with those armed with google and 2 months, I published a game. It isn't going to compare with ""Cut the Rope"", (in fact there is plenty to improve) but it was the only time since graduation when I felt a little bit happier. I think I will move on to Unity and C# to make a better game.

This feeling does little when every now and again I look out the window, and I see my mother doing some gardening. One time, when I saw her, and her grey hairs floating in the wind, I just broke down alone in my room. I couldn't take it anymore. I am a terrible son, unable to provide any financial resources for her. I told her, that when I earn money, the first thing I would do, is to save up and let her go on holiday. She hasn't been on one since I was born. Instead, I am a leech on her house, her food and her electricity bill.

I wish school took stuff like interviews more seriously. I wish I was taught programming when I was a child so I can pursue a career there. I wish I wasn't so pathetic as I am so I can pursue a career in accounting. I wish for anything that would totally tell me ""I can do this"". My ""success"" in education only adds to the pressure that I am not succeeding. I am failing in life, and I don't know how to fix it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1k7g9t/i_am_a_failure_at_jobhunting_and_probably_at_life/,9,Thank you all for the kind words.

269,fuh0jy,False,,6,"People who call you greedy, when truly its them being greedy",whatsbotheringyou,"Just felt like I needed to get this on here.

&#x200B;

All my life I have been careful about money. This has led me into situations where Ive been called greedy. I have never avoided paying anything ive shared with people. I have never avoided my responsibilites when it comes to money.

&#x200B;

I was the only one who had a car in high school, and people expected to catch a ride with me for free. I told this one dude once, he could pay me about 25bucks per month and I could get him back and forth to school every day (20minute drive to school, 20min back, so 40mins). He refused. He also called me petty for asking this.

&#x200B;

Then there was this time I hesitantly drove a few ""friends"" to a party not to far away. Apparently in the middle of the night, they call me and say I have to pick them up, and that was to be expected when I drove them to the place. I said that we didnt agree on that, and they hung up on me, and all of them screaming greedy fucker in the background.

&#x200B;

And the last story was some one who wanted to hike along, saying they needed to go down the road to their house or something. I told them no, I dont do free stuff. Pay me and perhaps it will be ok. They then proceed to call me greedy, even though its them who wants something for free, isnt it them being greedy?

&#x200B;

And if someone is mad with you for not providing a free service it confirms that the decision was correct. ,2020-04-03 21:34:35

Maybe he's acting like that because he doesn't like your life choices, in which case, I'd say just do what you were going to do anyway and worry more about your future and how you feel about it rather than what he thinks about it.

If you think it's worth it, maybe you could sit down with him and chat about it, or maybe just do something fun with him like go for a drive or go fishing or whatever he likes to do and try to move both of yourselves past it. If you do end up talking about it, I strongly suggest taking some quality time with yourself and really outlining what you'd like to say, and maybe run through the conversation in your head a few different ways so you can have well thought out responses to everything he has to say. This might any knee-jerk anger responses which obviously would make the situation worse, and it'll help him see you as an adult who is going to college and not a kid he needs to be in charge of, you know? If you keep your emotions in check, let him finish his sentences without interrupting, let him say whatever the f he wants to say without objecting too harshly, and presenting everything you have to say calmly and with a level head, it'll show him you're not looking for a fight so he doesn't need to fight either.

My rent is 1100 a month, since I receive parental support and they picked my apartment. However, money has recently become a huge issue between us (booked a trip to a conference, they chose a hugely expensive hotel, they bitched about the cost of the hugely expensive hotel and how irresponsible I was being with their money). 

I've been thinking about the possibility of moving in June (when my lease is up). I don't even know if my parents will let me or not, and I can't afford moving without their support. I have no savings of my own because my entire salary goes to rent and car insurance (which my parents selected). I live off of what they give me (which is generous), but if they stopped providing those funds, I'd be broke. I don't know how I'd afford move-out costs in my apartment. I don't know how I'd afford move-in costs. I don't know how to pay summer fees (900 bucks) on my salary. I'm not even sure I qualify for a loan or anything else, since I just got a credit card a year ago and might not have a credit score yet. I don't know anything, and the people I'd go to for that are my parents. 

On top of all of this, I am horribly depressed. I'm exhausted all the time, battling a food addiction, and paying for depression meds out of pocket because my parents would disown me if I told them I was seeing a doctor for depression. The meds aren't working, so I'm basically paying to try and fail to prevent me wanting to off myself. I was able to get the doctor visits covered through the school (no record of it... long story). Without that, I couldn't even afford to see the doctor. I'm not on any meds right now, because I weaned off the ones that weren't working and am too depressed/exhausted/terrified of the cost to go fill the new script. I don't really feel like I have anybody to rely on anymore. When I first got depressed, people were really supportive. Now, I've lost one of my best friends and the rest don't even notice me. 

I can't even live out of my car for a few months, because I have cats. I don't know anybody that could take them either, and I'm not sure I'd survive not having them around when I get really depressed. I don't think I can move in with anybody either- not only do I have furniture (and animals), but I spend so much of my time crying that I would not be a good fit for anybody.

I barely spoke to the guy that day, mainly because I was busy talking to lawyers and the council and trying to make sure my life doesn't grind to a full stop.

The guy couldn't handle that apparently, and got really really pissy with me. He then became exceedingly narcissistic when I tried to talk to him about it all in the evening. Everything had to be about him, I'd tried to explain to him that I'd broken down and had a ridiculously hard day, that I didn't know how to carry on and I wanted him with me more than ever. Yet all he could do was kick off and tell me his problems were worse.

He then started with the ""I don't wanna be hear tomorrow"" bullshit, telling me he was going to hurt himself etc etc. After the day I'd had I couldn't handle it, I told him I couldn't help as I was broken myself and trying to get my head into a place where I could help him was impossible.

He went absolutely mental at me, called me a lot of crude things, then switched to begging me to talk to him, then crudities again, then told me he loved me (we've known each other 6 weeks....)

I couldn't cope with it and selfishly I turned my phone off and just went to bed.

The next day, I tried to speak to him to sort it out and whatever, but it all got pinned on me. Every last thing got pinned on me and I was painted as the bad guy.

I, like an idiot, pushed it to one side and invited him round for a couple days, thinking we could sort it out and smoothe everything over whilst he was here etc.

Within minutes of him turning up he was throwing shade at me, having the little jabs and comments were coming in full force.

I bit my tongue and carried on thinking it'd pass, but for the last 3 days all he's done is constantly remind me it's my fault etc and when he left today I was so happy to see him go.

My conundrum now is, I genuinely feel quite strongly for this guy, but then at the same time I'm not here to have someone belittle me and make me feel like shit after years of having that from my ex wife.

I don't know what to do, and honestly I don't know why I'm posting this, I just wanted to get it off my chest I think, I don't think anyone can help me here, but I just I dunno.

Especially during what should be the honeymoon phase of the relationship.
The part where we put our best foot forward and enjoy getting to know each other and getting closer.

Unfortunately,  your this person sounds impossible to please and is showing some serious red flags behaviors and manipulation.You deserve a lot more understanding,  kindness and support from your partner and it doesn't seem like he's capable of putting you first at all.
You obviously put a lot of work and effort into making this man(and yourself) happy and enjoying your relationship even while
you were going through a very tumultuous time in your personal life. 
You're going through a messy divorce , being slandered by your ex and missing your kids yet you managed to have done your best to put your new relationship and partner first quite often. 

You did nothing wrong by needing a day or two alone to deal with some  important and personal issue.  This guy's reaction was totally inappropriate.  It sounds like he has some issues with insecurity or with needing the sun to rise and set on him. Not sure what his story is and not meaning to bash anyone but he doesn't seem willing or able to be supportive of you ,or your situation, for even one day.
Don't tolerate another  unhappy relationship.  Put yourself first starting now and give yourself credit for some of your recent positive accomplishments.

Things like finally acknowledging and accepting your sexual preference after many years of denying your needs and staying in an unhappy  marriage. Congratulate yourself for finding someone that you were truly into, attracted to and enjoyed being with.
 Even if it didn't work out you had an enjoyable and satisfying relationship 
for a while.  Next time will be better. 
This sounds like a bit of an unintentional rebound relationship. You need time for yourself before jumping from one relationship into another. 
 Good luck to you..with everything. ",2020-06-12 20:24:21
596,1krmgu,False,,4,"I love him, but I think he's more preoccupied with the past.",whatsbotheringyou,"I don't even know where to start with this one. I'm not sure how much of my problem is actually real and how much is insecurity, but I figure it's more productive to get it off my chest than to just stew about it. I'll try to make it as concise as possible.

...

I've been in long-term relationships before, but I can honestly say I have never felt as strongly about the people I've dated as they have about me. I was never the first to bring up ""I love you"" in a relationship, nor to push the whole public affection thing. I'm just not like that. I never really had any desire to get married and start a family with any of the previous people I dated, although most of them (except one abusive asshole) were, and still are, great guys. I've always had an idea of what my ""perfect"" candidate for a husband would be, although I wasn't sure I'd ever meet him.

About two years ago, I did meet a man who turned out to be... pretty much exactly what I was looking for. We took it slow, since I'd just broken up with someone a few months prior, and he also had apparently been through a very nasty breakup a year or two before (was in love with someone, but she left him before he could ask her to marry him) and wasn't in a rush either. We decided we'd just hang out as much as we wanted to, but not force anything.

Well, fast forward; we are now in a serious relationship. We do not technically live together, as we legally have separate dwellings, but we basically stay at one place or the other all the time. I've met lots of his best childhood friends, and also his family, and he has also met mine. He is the first person I've been with that I really consider to be a good ""team player"", since we are always able to help each other and work things out. We occasionally have disagreements, but we always discuss them and come to a mutual agreement. In short, things are going amazingly well...

...except I feel like there are some things he is keeping me away from, or keeping from me, one or the other. First of all, although he is quite open to introducing me to his male friends, he is very hush-hush about his female friends. He won't introduce me to them, and I actually have no idea if they're even aware he has a girlfriend. (There's one exception, a female friend he's known since childhood; he did introduce us, and he is well aware that I do not have an issue with him being friends with girls). He also has pictures around the house of other girls he's dated, one of which has been hanging directly above my side of the bed in his room ever since we met. I mentioned it once, and he really didn't give me a response. Whenever I have tried to (gently) bring up topics regarding long-term plans, or past relationships, he refuses to answer me and completely avoids the subject. He has never said he loves me, nor anything even remotely close, and while I do understand that not everyone is demonstrative in that way, I cannot shake the feeling that, although he obviously feels strongly for me, his feelings are likely not at the same level as mine.

I don't know what to do. I want to just tell him I love him, because... I do. I don't want to scare him away or put him under any pressure, though. It's not like I want to get married and start a family any time soon- few years from now would be great- but I want to at least know whether or not he sees this heading in that direction, and right now I have no idea. I feel like he's either still pining for someone in his past, or keeping his options open... I don't know. I just don't know what to do, and it's honestly been making me sick, just because I have never felt this way and it is so hard to keep my mouth shut.

TL;DR: in a great long-term relationship with a man I love, but I don't think he loves me back. Whenever I try to talk to him about related subjects, he refuses to say anything, and I think if I say ""I love you"" it might put him off completely.

What do I see in those two statements?  Your own thoughts about your abilities.

Well, you know what?  I think there's two things you need to keep in mind here.

1) We are our own worst critics
2) You are you, you see yourself every day.  If you were getting a little better each day, you might not notice.  But if you were to compare yourself right now to yourself two years ago, there might be huge jump there.  It just happened gradually over time.

I never noticed myself growing taller over time.  I never woke up one day, looked in the mirror, and thought ""Damn, I got really tall yesterday!""  And that's even something that can be benchmarked.  Singing and dancing talents really can't be.

You've been getting better all along and you just haven't noticed.

594,1kt3wj,False,,8,Sports are becoming too mandatory and time-consuming to the point that it's not fun anymore.,whatsbotheringyou,"I like sports.  Some of the ones I've always wanted to do (football, archery, kickboxing, etc) have been closed because my parents wouldn't let me as a child because I am a girl.  But that aside, now that I'm at the high school level, I've been having problems and disappointments with the school sports.  So first, I can do track, volleyball, soft ball, soccer, crew, cheerleading, swimming, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, field hockey, and maybe one or two smaller ones I forgot.  But, people in these teams (except for some not at the middle school level like volleyball or track) have been doing this since 5th grade or less.  This first discourages me because I'm not the best athlete from the start, and I've had no experience in these (and for some like lacrosse, I've tried but hated when I was younger).  

So the problem of picking aside, if I do choose (lets say volleyball) it's so time-consuming I just don't think it's worth it some times.  Practice (minimally for a sport) is everyday after school for 2 hours during the season.  That, I can barely accept, because I'm in academically hard classes and other academic teams/clubs.  If you look at my swimming schedule, it's everyday after school and on weekends for 3 hours, and on Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat mornings at 5 for an hour.  That is crazy, especially when its year round.  Crew, same thing but also you're required to go to races frequently (one was in Florida during one of our spring breaks).  I just find this cruel.  I know, it's a high school level and they're trying to find the ""college"" worthy ones, but for the rest of the people who want to have fun, enjoy a sport they like, or get a good exercise (but not too much) are being put down and discouraged.

Sorry for this being more rant-like than a question.  I just don't know what to do.  I used to hate working out outside of sports, but recently I've almost gone a 180 on the idea.  

Since I was overwhelmed and didn't do any sports last year (except for track but then I was pole vaulting, kind of good at it, but I fell and sprained my ankle, my coach blatantly looked at my ankle and me, and made me do it again despite the fact I could barely step on it...I actually fainted and he didn't help, so that's why I dropped out of track for the lack of help and the fact they refused to acknowledge it.) I decided to try volleyball, basketball, and maybe softball for the seasonal sports.  

I don't know what I'm really trying to get at.  I just am frustrated with the school's sport system.  My school is athletic-oriented, and most people do a sport.  I want to do one, and it looks good for college, but it's just so consuming, not worth it if you aren't the best, and discouraging me.

It's only mildly embarrassing for me when people ask me if I do a sport. Ultimately, I think you should spend your time doing what is wholly valuable to you, whether that be sports or otherwise.

Then she got hysterical and told me she was going to cut herself and commit suicide and stuff like that.

She has a history of mental illness and self harm so I panicked and tried to calm her down and she just broke down in front of me crying. I held her and after a while she calmed down and asked if I wanted some soda. I accepted and we talked for a little bit.

At some point I blacked out. I don't remember anything from sitting on her couch to being naked on her bed. My groin was wet and  had scratched along the length of my chest. And she was sleeping right next to me, also naked, spooning me with her arm across my chest.

317,g1l1e4,False,,1,"I feel like this is it, the moment that could change everything.",whatsbotheringyou,"And of course, in my cryptic title I do mean that ""this is it"" for me. My last opportunity to seize a life that's full of meaning and excitement. If I fail, I don't think there's anything out there for me. Not only am I tired of relying on other people to feel meaning and excitement, I don't believe I can (nor should anyone) even if I wanted to find it in others. 2 of the 3 people I ever loved and felt connected to absolutely destroyed me. To be specific, #1 Stranding me in the middle of nowhere across the country #2 Ghosting me after agreeing to plans, having me travel faraway to meet up. And #3? I was in a relationship with and we broke up - basically because I said I didn't feel as strongly about her as she did about me. 

So, I am looking towards a career that'll put me into a position to positively impact people's lives in a way that I find exciting. As you can imagine, it's a tough career field to get into. And unfortunately, I fell off the damn wagon, I was putting a lot of effort to get into it and I eventually fell apart. Now I can't find it in myself to do what I need to do. Why? Well, besides the fear of failure, I am somewhat content with doing nothing. As in, I could literally sit in my room all day, everyday, doing almost nothing and feel ""content."" I say ""content"" because obviously there's a small yet significant part of me that wants to leave a legacy, make an impact - make a purpose out of my meaningless life (I consider myself an existentialist, and I believe life is meaningless, you ascribe meaning to it). And the fact of the matter is, I can't sustain myself doing NOTHING. 

So I need to push myself to be productive and make this a reality. But I don't know how. I think I just gotta push myself to do a little each day, and hopefully I end up doing more than I am pushing myself to do. Why waste a way a day bullshitting it away, just to forget about the minuscule amount of pleasure I got out of it anyways? Might as well do the crap I don't want to do, but need to do to in order to get into the field, just forget the pain, tediousness and minor inconveniencing as I do the minor pleasure I've experienced doing nothing. 

Lastly, I don't know what to do about the third person I mentioned. We recently reconciled and agreed to have a casual relationship (i.e., it's an open relationship with no expectations that we will get married or anything like that...). I really want to love her in a romantic way. Though, I do love her in some way. She's such an angelic, well meaning person, wouldn't hurt a fly. She's funny, intelligent and beautiful. But the romantic love hasn't been there for me, I suppose the ""chemistry."" A part of me fears that it was only because I was comparing her to my first love who I was crazy for (and well, she was person #2, so clearly she isn't even a good person) - but that could've all been situational (I was going through a lot and she was there for me + nothing beats your first love, it's like taking a drug for the first time...and you're always chasing that high - but you'll never have it again). Plus, there were plenty of reasons for there to be a lack of passion - because we rarely did anything fun and exciting together. We did quite the opposite, we'd spend a week together doing nothing in the confines of her apartment. And now I'm worried I might've lost my chance with her because she seemingly has forgotten being head-over-heels, all-she-thinks-about, in love when we were together. I'm hoping that the whole situation changes when we can actually hangout again. But this is just the cherry on top in my eyes - it makes everything going on with my aspiration chasing 10x worse, if I had my career in order then this alone wouldn't be bothering me enough to post. 

But bothered doesn't even hit the nail on the head. I am hurting so very badly. I've struggled all my life (and I am in my late 20s now). And I will admit I don't appreciate how far I've come. From a loner without social skills, friends or girls to a social butterfly that's realized friends and girls are nice (y'know unless they turn out to be terrible people), but they're not all that.

I've seriously hurt my friend's feelings, and this time I don't have any excuse",whatsbotheringyou,"About a week ago I went to support my friend Anna when she performed poetry at a liberal arts loft. A lot of her friends, whom I knew and didn't know, also came to watch. She did really well. I, on the other hand, drank too much and was talking pretty loosely.

A few days later she's being super curt with me on facebook and refusing to go to anything I invite her out to. I ask my friend Brian and he says he knows she's upset about something, but assures me it's not me. A week later (today) I'm still suspicious, so he asks her again specifically and this is what she tells him:

""well he made a comment about Callum [her boyfriend] when I introduced them

hee bitched about my poetry performance in a non constructive way

he was a dick to my friends Dan and Erica""

I know I did do some of these things, and others I don't. I met her boyfriend Callum several months ago at a pub and when they were both out having a smoke, a friend of mine started making rude jokes about Callum behind his back, and I just went along with it. It seemed harmless at the time, but if he'd heard I'm sure he'd have been hurt and to be honest Callum seems like a really great guy.

I don't remember insulting her poetry. No, I wasn't black out drunk, I remember the night pretty well - I just don't remember ever saying those things, but I guess I did if she's heard about them. 

I don't know who Dan and Erica are. I spoke to Brian about it earlier tonight and he thinks they're a couple whom I borrowed a lighter off of outside. I don't remember ever being rude to them, nor does Brian nor any of the other people who were present - but that's neither here nor there.

I contacted Anna to apologise for anything, and she just didn't reply. My behaviour that night was clearly inexcusable. I'm totally disappointed in myself and ashamed of the way I acted. I want to use the excuse 'it wasn't me, it was the drink' - but what good is that? Whatever it was I said, I said it. Alcohol doesn't talk. I used my words and my words hurt people.

I didn't come here to soothe my conscience. I don't deserve to be made to feel better about acting so unacceptably. If I walk away from this without making reparations to those people I hurt, I've learned nothing and totally failed to better myself as a person.

211,27l4g5,False,,15,My wife left me after 5 years and I don't know how to let go.,whatsbotheringyou,"5 years ago I met a woman that I thought was the love of my life. A person who accepted me for me, made me feel comfortable in situations I had never been able to before and filled me with purpose.  She made me feel like we were true partners in life.  Everything I have done in the past 5 years was with her in mind. I included her in every decision I made. I sacrificed to help build a life with her and prepare for our future.

I knew something was wrong weeks before but I only realize this looking back. On January 6th I got home from work and she said we needed to talk. She then told me our marriage was over. She said that she didn’t love me anymore. That she felt trapped and had to move on. I feel that every “I love you” she ever said to me was a lie. I had never felt the way I did that day; confused, angry – furious even, and unbearably sad. I am not the kind of man that gets emotional about many things but I cried for days. I am still crying sometimes when little things trigger a random memory.

I gave everything I had and put it into my marriage. I promised myself that my marriage was not going to be a failure. That love was what we had between us and that would hold us together because we were honest with each other. I never thought I would ever be alone again.  My feelings float between rage to hate to terrified and alone.  I hate her for breaking my heart and destroying the trust I had built up in her – complete unquestioning trust. I still love her at the same time too. 

We don’t hate each other; she says she hates having to hurt me but that she needs to do this. I just feel sick to my stomach.

What am I supposed to do? I just can’t turn off a switch and move on with my life. I tried to finish our separation agreement paperwork yesterday and it didn’t go so well, just more crying and anger. 

My friends are trying to help me through this as much as they can, making sure I get out of the house now and then. Actually they insist I go do things with them. Which can be annoying but I know they are right. I have great friends. But even they can’t fill that hole of intimacy that my marriage had. Not sex, but real intimacy.  My (now) ex-wife and I found out she was going to have trouble having kids, I was by her side every step of the way and encouraged her as best I could. Of course it is a good thing we never did have kids giving how things turned out. My point is my whole life I have never been the one curled up on someone else’s lap wanting to be made to feel better. I was always the strong one. Now, when all I want is that connection of real trust and intimacy it’s gone. Almost like she robbed me of that too, taking away the only person I thought I would ever need - that would be there that one time when I was weak and alone needed someone to hold me for once – and she just left.

In her words “I thought I wanted family life, a home and all that stable stuff but I can’t stand it and I have to get out”.  She told me she had cheated on me too and I was so afraid of her leaving my life I almost didn’t care.

She came back for a month around the end of February through half of March. We went to counselling (which she hated) and I suggested a physiatrist instead. She said fine, anything that you think would help.  The physiatrist told her she was bipolar.  At first I thought, “Yes! Now we know what the problem may be and I can help her get through it!” 

It is amazing what we can get ourselves to believe so we can smile again.  

As anyone who has had to deal with mental health issues knows, finding the right medication (if needed) and dosage takes time. I would have done anything to find that magic pill that would have made her smile again – a real smile, but would it have been real? I know she loved me once but the more I think about it maybe she was just with me because she thought that is what she was supposed to do?  The mind can make us do strange things.  

So even with this new revelation, her mental health issues that is, she left for good. 

It almost killed me.

I thought about killing myself. I thought about quitting my job and just walking away from everything. I thought about lots of things. None of them made me feel better; they just made me realize I would be doing the same thing she was doing to me. Ripping myself out of other people’s lives that acre about me to suite my own purposes. Then they would feel the same as I do now. Like some fucked up version of the circle of life, circle of misery maybe?

I think she knows exactly how much she means to me. She knew I had made her the focus of my life and that was why she had to go. She had told me that she knew she was always going to have these feelings of wanting to “escape” and that she did not want to cheat on me again but probably couldn’t keep that promise either. That is why she left I think. Maybe what last little bit of herself that cared about me cared enough to leave before she really did destroy me.  

I feel stupid for having trusted someone that much.  Having brought someone into my life like that. I told her things about me that I wouldn’t tell anyone. I feel like a fool for having thought that someone could have loved me enough to decide to share their life with me.  

I have never been this low in my life. I loved her with all my heart and she didn’t really love me.  I feel like a failure that is just another divorce statistic, another stupid couple that failed.  And now I am alone and I can’t remember how to be happy being alone.  Now I am in my mid 30’s and have to start all over again. I have no idea how.

After a while you will notice pissing in public bathrooms even while sober is easier.


I've gone from not being able to pee when someone is looking, to peeing relatively close to other people outdoors, even sober and can pee at pretty much all urinals when drunk.


Also one thing to remember is that pushing it never ever works, fine you might get a few drops out, but just relax and let it come is the way you actually pee, and it helps in the long run. Take your time in the stall, just relax and wait for it to come. ",2013-09-17 23:59:10

We used to be really busy with that distraction because it meant life and death. Like most animals living in a dangerous environment was good it kept us alert and helped us form deep bonds where we relied on one another. 

But now I'm typing this from my apartment alone on the seventeenth floor where the only danger I have is my own body killing itself. I have no need to scour for food as I can go online and order anything I need and as long as I show up to work and continue to do my job I will have plenty of resources to provide for myself until that day comes.

What is my purpose? Well the only real purpose is to find distractions that suit you well enough that you continue to live your life and enjoy yourself. It's a happy thing life... I mean it has it's ups and downs but if you're dead you never feel happiness so when you're alive even a chance at a glimmer of it down the road is totally worth existing for. 

The most fulfilling distractions we have are change and companionship. When life sucks it's time for a change. You'll feel much better at being complacent if you find companionship too. We're social creatures, if I wasn't sitting here alone my brain would probably like that even more. 

Spend your time however you see fit. As I see it life has one purpose. Find as much happiness as often as possible without ruining the happiness of others. If you can do that you've led a fulfilling life. All other things are just wasted desires.  ",2014-08-25 18:09:13
90,gl0rrf,False,,8,Pissed off a well known guitarist. Now I feel bad,whatsbotheringyou,"Hi everyone.

So a few days ago I messaged a well known guitar shredder about some tips, and whether they offered lessons.  They do. They did say they didn't teach beginners.  We discussed my ability and rates etc.  The rates weren't too bad.  So I said I was interested and would let them know. 

&#x200B;

Here's the thing.  I have Cerebral Palsy, I play guitar overhanded with two fingers.  I've been playing for ten years but I'm really not that great.  So I figured scheduling a lesson would be a waste of their time.  I told them I really needed more beginner theory type stuff and not the skills of a shred master.  They basically said: ""Fine, I teach beginner theory but if you don't want to learn from me, go ahead and take lessons with somebody else."" 

I wasn't sure how to interpret that tonally, so I thanked them for understanding.  They said (paraphrasing): ""Yea, I love having conversations like this all day long.""

&#x200B;

On one hand I feel like crap because I annoyed a guitarist I respected.  Maybe I did waste their time overall.  On the other hand, I had the best of intentions, and what time?  It was a conversation over FB Messenger, it's not as if we scheduled a lesson or anything, and they said no novices.

I'm just super bummed.  How should I feel here?

Lately, I am just having real trouble getting motivated and focused enough to do anything, even things I enjoy.  It's getting harder and harder to do everything.  I know what needs to be done and I know I can do it, I just can't get there.  Even taking the dog for a walk feels like a real chore.  It's really frustrating.

Worse than that, I find myself getting very irritable over absolutely everything.  I'm snapping at people and just being a miserable sh\*t, even over something as small as somebody coming into my office to say hi.  I know in the moment that my behavior is irrational, but I just can't stop myself.  It's like I'm standing 3' back watching myself be an a\*\*hole.

742,3kpt0b,False,,1,I feel like poeple hang out with me because they feel sorry for me,whatsbotheringyou,"I wasn't very popular for the majority of my life. Which is fine, becasue you don't need to be popular to be happy. My problem was that I didn't have any friends until high school, when I moved districts. I did have one friend in middle school. Until one day he stopped talking to me. One minute we were pals, and the next thing I know he didn't say anything to me for 3 years (6-8th grade)(This happened to me again in highschool, but that is a different story for a different time). Because of this loss I spent many a lunches eating by myself in the middle of the cafeteria, and many weekends in my home playing video games while everybody else hung out and did the usual kid stuff. 

When I moved to high shcool, things brightened up a little for me. Although I drifted between 3 groups of friends, I finally found one group that (I hoped) liked me for who I was. High school passed and we are all currently in college. I still talk with them at least 2-3 days a week throiugh Skype which is cool I guess. Three of them go to the same college so they see each other often. I usually call them and they only answer when they have nothing else to do. 

I have two friends in college. One is somebody that I met on my floor last year(who lives off campus now) and the other from a class that we were in (he lives a floor above me). I'm in a single room and don't see much of them anymore. The one who lives off campus, I have to ask if he would like to do something. Half the time he's busy or doing things with other friends. When we fist met it was great. We could talk for hours and never get bored. This year we talked for 10-20 minutes before I felt like I didn't have anything more to say. The last two times I saw him though, he told me that I was giving him a headache because I was talking too much. That really hurt. I was making somebody physically sick just because of my presence. I don't want to paint him as a bad guy because he's not. He's the most amazing person I've met, but have I been pushing it too much? I've told myself that I wouldn't invite him to do anything until he contacted me first. I saw this as a way to make sure that he's ready to do stuff again, because I felt like I push him too much to do things. I've told him that I don't really hang out with anybody else and he said to go out and ""get some more friends""(he said this in a joking manner, but it still rings true). Anyways, I'm apporaching three weeks of no contact. Not a text, snapchat, nothing.  I feel like this is my fault for being such a loser. I'm expecting this one dude to be my only friend when he has his own life and agenda, but I still want the attention. I feel like whenever I offer to do something, he's saying yes just because he feels sorry for me. He knows that I don't really have anybody else, and he just puts on a show because I've spent so much time with him and revealed so much of my personal thoughts. Like he owes me or something. 

The other firend is a different case. He also doesn't really have lots of friends. Despite living above me I see him once a week, tops. I tell him he can come over whenever he likes but he only come over for like 2 hours a week. At least I don't have to invite him down, he'll just come down himself. I feel like this is a similiar situation though. He comes down because I've known him for a year and he doesn't have anybody better to hang with. I'm just a placeholder until he finds somebody better. He's very good at talking to almost anybody, I'm amazed that he hasn't found anybody better yet. (Still not trying to make him look bad, as he is also amazing and I respect him very much.) 

As said before I'm in a single room so I don't have a roomate. My floor is very isolated. Nobody leaves their doors open and my RA is never to be found. I've gone to some callouts, however they only meet twice a month, so I don't know if I could make any long lasting relationships from that. I've thought about talking to a prefessional for this problem(and some minor other issues), but I feel like they wouldn't really care. They're paid to listen to people talk about their problems, why would they even care about mine? I feel like my childhood made me distrust people, like anybody would suddenly stop talking to me for no reason. 

Thank you for reading. This was about triple the length I wanted it to be. I've been a fan of this sub since the beginning and all of you are amazing people.                 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3kpt0b/i_feel_like_poeple_hang_out_with_me_because_they/,10,"It sounds like you have some pretty serious self esteem issues and you should definitely see a counselor about that. And don't think ""they don't care about me, they're just paid to listen."" That job doesn't pay well enough to attract people that don't care about other people. 

Now for the part about your friends only hanging out because they feel sorry for you. I don't know anyone that would waste their time hanging out with someone they didn't like just because they felt bad for them. I certainly wouldn't do it, and I don't think you would either. 

As for making more friends, it's super easy in college. Find something that you're really interested in and join a club. You're already going to have something in common with everyone else there so making that first move to friendship is easy. 

And finally, I know being lonely is hard, but you can't find your self worth in other people. You have to make your own happiness. Once you start doing that, other people notice and will want to hang around with you.  ",2015-09-12 22:32:59

This is atrocious. Your dad clearly has no sense of healthy emotional management and is just trying to prove he's better. Based on this alone, I would probably try to minimize contact with him, if possible.

>I’m constantly plagued by the thought of my friends hating me because I’m too reliant on them

Like, financially? Can you do something to make up for it? Alternatively, there's nothing wrong with drifting away and establishing entirely new social circles. It happens to everyone for all sorts of reasons.

>I feel like a failure because nothing I do will ever measure up in my mother’s eyes to my eldest sister, for reference, I had a moment of peace and clarity, so I chose to clean up my house, and my mother’s response was that I should’ve done that already.

Ohhhh, my gosh. My blood boils for you. That is *so* wrong. I hope you can recognize that your mother's nasty opinion is worth dirt, that siblings shouldn't be compared, and that you can take pride in the work that you did/do. ",2020-04-22 07:25:39
543,2n48on,False,,7,A girl I know told me she's going to kill herself [fairly long],whatsbotheringyou,"The things is, I don't know if I believe her. Before you tell me how cruel that sounds and how awful that is, let me state my case.


So, a few months ago, a started working with this girl in the theater program at my school. She seemed really fun at first, and I was actually really attracted to her. I started giving her rides home, and we'd make out a little bit here and there. She informed me, after a while, that she had cancer, and that she's been receiving treatment her whole life. Leukemia. I was shocked, but was surprised at how chill she was about it. Then we didn't talk about it all that much. The cancer, I mean. I'd ask her how chemo was going this or that day, and she'd tell me it was rough, so I'd try my best to cheer her up.


After a while, she really started to get on my nerves. She started to gossip about me behind my back, and tried to do the same thing with me about other people. That's something I have trouble with, because I've had bad experiences with gossip, and it just pisses me off. So I'd tell her how I felt, and she'd respond with something like, ""Oh you know me...just a nosy girl!"" Then she'd giggle like it was nonchalant. 
She never stopped. She kept on with it, and was always very, very dramatic about everything. She also became extremely hypocritical. She'd claim to be a perfectionist, and then, when I'd ask her o go over lines with me, she'd act very annoyed and say no, we didn't need to do that.


But I still liked her. She was still a lot of fun, and quite nice if you could get past her gossiping issues. SO we kept going with our little fling. And it was fun, for the most part. The only other thing that got to me was that she was always VERY flirty with other guys. But I figured I couldn't be too upset, cause we were never officially dating.


Just last week, I told myself I was going to ask her out officially. The, I shit you not, DAY I was going to, a mutual friend of hers and mine approached me and asked why he heard that I'd been kissing this girl at a party the weekend before. I din't know what to say. I asked him why that was a problem, and he told me he'd been dating her for a while. 


I've been fucking livid the past few days. I haven't answered her calls, facebook messages, or emails. She's been asking and asking me to get in contact with her so she could ""fix the problem."" I said fuck it and have been leaving her high and dry.


Today, I got an email from her that, again, asked me to call her. But then she told me that she'd found out her cancer was terminal, and that she'd probably see her 17th birthday, but that was probably it. Then she told me that she's been telling all her closest friends that she's going to kill herself before it happens, and has sworn them to secrecy.


I don't know if I believe it, because this is the kind of girl who may *actually* lie about something like that. But I do know for a fact that she has cancer. I've been trying to get in contact with her, and am now as well. When I do talk to her...what the fuck do I say? I've been practicing my ""fuck you"" speech, and then she drops this emotion bomb on me out of nowhere. This is a person's life. And her may take it before her time. Do I tell her parents? No? Even believe her? What? I don't know what to do. This is the first time I've ever been in a situation like this. Help, please.

Oh, this is gona sound so pathetic and stupid, but i just have to share it, maybe i feel better....

The story is, i live in a small town in Bosnia, and here i didn't have much friends, i was born in Germany and moved here when i was little. I didn't know the language and i was always the freak in school. In Highschool things didn't changed much. Until i met her. She, a girl who i met in High school, she was one year older then me i started talking to her and we became good friends. She was kinda the onlyone who understood me. And so life passed.. She went to college, and I went to college in 2 different cities. She had a really bad period in Depressed because of private reasons, and was there for her I tried my best to help her.

The problem was i never really was beside her, i was talking over the phone with her and encouraged her to get on, to strive forward, and she eventually became happy again.

The problem is in the whole process i fell in love with her. I even told her and she replied that she doesn't want to change our relationship how it is, bcs she is like the kind of girl ""you can have my body but never my soul"" she is with a guy like 1-2 weeks uses him and breaks up with him.

She didn't wanted for me to be like one of those guys. now in the last couple of months we became distant.. She found some Boyfriend.

When I found out about it I felt devastated. I don't know why i just feel pain in my chest, like never before and i want to cry. I had other girlfriends too, i broke up with them they broke up with me and I didn't care that much honestly, but this is driving me crazy, im just sitting in my room trying to study and can't get a hold of myself. I feel really pathetic for having these feelings because of someone else, i sweared to myself that i Don't give a damn about other people who don't care about me..

My problem is simple: I'm 5""5, and I weigh 14 stone. According to the BMI, this means I am obese. For me, it means I'm fat, plain and simple.

Unlucky for me though, I have ongoing health problems that have been troubling me since I first hit puberty. This just so happened to be only a year or so before I started gaining weight.

Everyone in my life is constantly suggesting I'll feel better if I just lose some weight. The thing is, I've faced eating disorders multiple times now, and while it has never gotten dangerous, it is still a mentality that I could easily fall prey to again. Not only that, but I'm certain my health problems began before I gained weight, and may even be the cause of the weight gain, as exercise in general is extremely painful, and has been for years.

Despite this, the suggestion continues to be to just push through it, and if I lose some weight then I'll stop being in pain.

This endless cycle is really starting to get to me. I'm starting to think there's no end in sight. According to friends, family, and even one of the doctors I have seen recently, the only way to stop being in pain is to lose weight, but the only way I can do that is by doing the thing that causes me pain.

The fact youre posting to reddit and asking others to confirm your thoughts means youre having second thoughts.

I was overweight too. I was constantly told to lose weight by friends and family and suggested it by my personal doctor too. I finally bit the bullet and actually decided to do something about it i was better off for it ",2020-02-12 23:23:29
724,b19ce2,False,,4,"Sexually confused, friendless, and frustrated",whatsbotheringyou,"I’m really not sure how to start this, but here goes.

This year, after hating my time at summer camp and making no friends, is the year I’m going away from home. 

All throughout high school I’ve gotten straight As, done well on the violin, played some video games. So, instead of focusing on my grades this year and especially this semester, I’ve decided to focus on the fact that I don’t enjoy my life at all. 

First came my sexuality. I’ve always been someone who’s super conscientious - always want to fix myself, never really enjoying the moment. The thing is, when I was around 12, I started paying more attention to guys and, even though I’d had a gay moment or two as a kid, I totally denied it. Now, a lot of gay kids do that, but the problem is that after forcing myself not to look at guys for a summer, I literally lost my whole sex drive. I feel totally confused. I know it’s useless to stress more, but I just can’t get the stress off my mind. I’m constantly worried about what I’m attracted to. And I wonder if being gay is even worth it or what I want. 

On top of that, I have absolutely no friends. I have 2 people I talk to at school, both of which I feel like Im just trying to please so I’m not totally alone. I try my hardest to relate to them, but I just end up a) stressed out b) not enjoying talking to them or c) feeling alone once they reject me. I feel useless. I don’t even really feel a drive to hang out with anyone. It just stresses me out and is no fun. I’m totally quiet in groups.

Then came the frustration. I am so freaking frustrated with all of this. Why can’t I have friends? Why can’t I have a normal sexuality - gay or straight (I want to be with someone!)? Why can’t I enjoy playing my violin, or being with friends, or just doing anything in my life? I feel like I try so hard and stress so much and it goes nowhere...

I feel like a total moron posting this, but here goes. Thanks for reading.

861,66k48j,False,,1,I have no hope that I can survive in society.,whatsbotheringyou,"Yesterday, my mother admitted to me that if she had the power to have me put down peacefully like a family pet, she would do it.

I turn 26 in a few months.

I am hyper sensitive. I get easily drained by very insignificant actions. Things like going to my therapist take less than 3 hours out of my day but leave me feeling unable to do anything for a day afterwards. I also suffer from very bad allergies. My room has to be kept as a clean room, no clothing or bodies that are not washed or showered are allowed in. When guests visit, I have to be sure I sit in MY spot, or else them sitting with outside clothes in the place I normally sit will cause me to have sneezing, itchy and painful throat, and clogged sinuses which often leads to infections. 

When I worked a 15 hour a week job, I became so drained both physically and mentally that I could no longer keep my relationship healthy. I lost contact with every nearby friend I had. I ate only boxed meals because I had no energy to make anything healthier. I no longer enjoyed gaming or writing, two hobbies that normally distract from my depression. I would get home from work and make my food and sleep, or watch YouTube until I could sleep.

My entire life is a burden. A huge financial burden. I am keeping my mother and sister from being able to save for their retirements.

I have to earn money and live on my own eventually, but doing so will only cause me to no longer enjoy anything in my life. But not earning money makes me a burden and puts me into a depression because I'm burdening everyone around me and I am only alive for three reasons.

1- I am terrified of death.

2- The people who care about me don't want me to die.

3- I am greedy and have things I want to see or experience.

I don't have any hope that I will ever be able to live a normal life. I don't think I will ever have a job that doesn't take over my entire existence and cause me to be depressed. But I also know I will continue to be depressed because I'm actively harming the people who care about me.

I want to help people. I want to create things that make others lives worth living. But I know, statistically, I won't ever be able to obtain a living doing anything remotely like that and even if I did, it would drain me into depression regardless.

I wish I believed anything could change. But I stopped believing in that years ago. Every time I leave the house or even Skype call a friend... After its over I just have this instinctual gut feeling of, ""thank the universe that is over. I never want to do that again."" But I always do. Because everyone says I need to leave the house and have friends. But how many times do I have to slam my face into the brick wall before others will acknowledge the brick wall exists for me and they just can't see it?

But then there ARE some rare times where I enjoy things. 

But it's like fucking gambling. I've lived for 25 solid years and I can think of all the times I've been happy with my life... And it adds up to maybe 2 to 3 years of it. 

What if I live another 25 and that number stays consistent? Is 50 years worth living if I can only look back on 5-6 years of that and say I was happy? 

I feel like I should quit now while the ratio is slightly more likely to be less dismal. I'm terrified that is only going to get worse. I'm going to live till I'm 100 somehow and the number of years worth living for will still be only 8 or so.

I don't know what to do. I'm so tired all the time. Tired of crying. Tired of trying so hard for things that others do like it's nothing.

I know this is really difficult, but you need to make a doctor understand how deeply this is effecting you and your family.

I don't know how psychological help happens in your part of the world, but you need to concentrate your limited energy on getting treatment (it might be short term inpatient, but could change your life) and a therapist who is a better fit.

Good luck - you can get so much better! ",2017-04-20 19:41:44
117,1l6m1n,False,,4,My mom passed away from cancer a month and nine days ago,whatsbotheringyou,"I've posted about this on reddit before but it's keeping me up tonight. It's going to be really long, not expecting anyone to necessarily read it all.

My mom raised me as a single mother and we had no other family close by until my dad moved back when I was eleven, but he didn't live with us so it always felt like it was just me and her. She was diagnosed with stage 4 vulvar cancer when I was 16, and fought that for awhile with chemo, radiation, and talks of one of the most radical surgeries you can possibly get, until she was diagnosed with lung cancer (one lung so bad it was pretty much completely gone). I guess five months ago... wow, it feels much longer than that, like it feels like it's been much longer than a month and some change since her death... but I guess about five months ago she went into a hospice facility and was categorized as ""days to weeks"" left.

Before she went into hospice it was only me caring for her once she was bedridden but it was really easy until she started getting more and more confused. The cancer had probably spread to her brain or if not it was finally the meds taking their toll on her (vulvar cancer is one of the most painful cancers you can get, the amount of morphine and other drugs she was on was absolutely insane, but she was still in constant, often excruciating pain). That's when I first started feeling alone, despite having people that cared for me (especially my dad, my aunt in Florida, etc), because it no longer felt like I had my mom.

When she went into hospice it was one of the hardest days of my life, definitely harder than the day she was diagnosed and I can't begin to imagine how hard it was for her. She never wanted that (she saw her mom go into a nursing home), and I didn't want it for her either, it was actually a total shock to me when I was, essentially, informed of the decision. I'd talked with the hospice people extensively one day, and the next day they woke me up by calling and saying she needed to be moved into a facility that day when everyone had left things on a completely different note as far as I knew. They were certain she needed the round the clock care and a better environment, and I couldn't really argue with them. My mom had no idea either, and telling her is an experience I've almost completely blocked out mentally, I remember the rest of the day pretty clearly but the only thing about that I recall is me trying not to cry and her crying and being confused.

It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened though. The residence was less than a year old, held thirty total residents but was only opened up for ten or so at the time and the waiting list was already ridiculously long, but one of the reasons the hospice people were so hasty is because me being a minor taking care of her apparently shot us to the top of the pile, at least according to one of the nurses that raved about it. It was absolutely wonderful and very comforting in every aspect. The hospital beds didn't look like hospital beds, they were furnished with wood and whatnot, the halls and rooms felt very ""home-y"", and the staff were fucking AMAZING, a lovely fireplace area, a beautiful courtyard, etc. Not at all like the nursing home I remember my grandma being put in, with its white walls and hospital vibe. Or like any of the horror stories you hear on the news sometimes about the less than caring staff at some of these facilities. Almost everyone went well above and beyond for both my mom and me, and she hit it off with a lot of them immediately, some of them genuinely becoming friends to us.

In there she had good and bad phases. Sometimes she'd be confused for weeks at a time, not remembering any of it, other times she'd just be herself. After awhile she began having phases where for days up to a week at a time she'd be passed out 24/7. But she lasted a little over four months in there, through several times the doctors had re-categorized her as ""hours to days"" and we were prepared for her passing, honestly stunning everyone. She really wanted to see me turn 18. It didn't seem entirely likely or unlikely, but I was still mentally prepared for it to not happen, the weeks leading up to it she had had one of her worst spells yet. My birthday was May 26th and she lived until July 18th. She was even in such a good, clear phase mentally that despite her body actively failing her, she managed to orchestrate a surprise party for me.

But after that she kept having longer bad phases that got worse and worse. She'd lost a lot of weight from the beginning, going through the chemo, she was down to around 100 from 135 or so but at the very end she rapidly lost weight. She stopped eating entirely, rarely being able to handle shakes/smoothies, was unable to take her meds, etc. Right before she passed she was easily down to 70 lbs and I remember going to see her one night with my dad and walking in the room and looking at her and only being able to think ""oh my god, she just looks like death"". Before then it had been getting harder and harder to see her but that night I could only stand to stay 15-20 minutes and that was only because we wanted to hit her morphine pump for her again (it was on a timer and it was given to her so she could hit it as needed on top of her regular meds, but at that time she was unable to, completely out of it/unresponsive). A piece of her ear looked like it had just gotten sliced off with an extremely sharp blade somehow, but her skin was so degraded from the cancer by that point the nurses could hardly move her around the bed without it literally... well I'm not going to finish that thought. I took a picture of her for some reason, because I just couldn't believe it, how bad she looked. I was going to send it to my aunt but I decided against it, she didn't need to see her that way. It stayed on my phone for awhile after she passed until I brought myself to finally delete it one night because it was haunting me.

The whole time she was in hospice and a week and a half or so after she passed I lived in the house alone, except for when my aunt came down and stayed. My dad made it clear his home was my home and I was welcome any time, for however long, be it days or for good, and my aunt offered to stay as long as I needed her to, some of my mom's oldest friends offered me places to stay as well, but I felt like I needed to be alone. During that time I sort of half grieved I guess. Many nights I laid in bed thinking over and over about her dying, I dreamed about it. That first night alone in the house was the only time through the whole ordeal I let myself cry without holding it back.

It felt like I had already lost my mom in many ways. She wasn't dead, but she moved out to be on her death bed. Her simply being in a place like that, despite how wonderful it was and the privacy we were given, made our relationship change because we were never really alone again. A lot of the time she wasn't there mentally.

The day she passed the nurses had called me around 7-8 am and told me they were expecting it to be soon, in all likelihood that day, so I should come down as soon as possible if I wanted to see her. I didn't want to. I called my dad and my aunt and told them and talked to them. My dad didn't really believe it (after all the times she'd surprised us before, I can't blame him - I should say here they had grown extremely close again, she met him when she was 14 and they always loved each other very much despite not being always together) but my aunt basically talked me into going down there. She didn't say I should, she tried to leave it up to me, but after our talk I felt certain I needed to.

When I saw her she was awake, responsive, interactive, but she couldn't talk - for the first time completely unable to. We had to use signals, mainly for when she wanted water, because she could no longer handle drinking, I had to dip a mouth swab sponge thingy in some water and let her suck on it, but even that was too much for her. Sounded like every single breath was an absolute struggle. I stayed for a couple of hours or so, maybe less, before I just had to go. I didn't feel bad about this before because I knew she'd have understood and I decided I wouldn't beat myself up over it because she and I both knew just how much I loved her and if it was so much I had to leave, there's nothing I could've done about it I told myself; I had to care for myself as well, if it was too painful to handle I needed to not push myself too far. I obviously feel a little bad about it now, but I'm eternally grateful that fate ended up so that the nurse on shift for her that day happened to be one of her best friends, one of the most caring and comforting people I've ever met. She moved her nurses' station into my mom's room and sat right beside her bed the entire time until she passed. If it wasn't for that I truly don't know how I would have let myself live knowing I left her alone despite what I told myself.

A couple of hours later I had to get out of the house so I rode to the store on my bike, it was a pretty nice day out. I tried to be normal, I don't know how to explain it, but I knew she was going to die that day yet I'd spent countless days thinking that already. I happened to call the nurse to check in on her in the parking lot and she said she was doing about the same. On my ride home, maybe two minutes later, the phone rang and I answered it while I was still riding, it was the nurse telling me that she went back in right after getting off the phone from me to see that she had just passed. I knew what the call was going to be and I always got off my bike (biking is a hobby of mine) to answer a call, so I don't know what to make of me not stopping. You'd think you would stop doing whatever you're doing when you know you're about to hear your mom has passed away. I don't know, I guess I just find it interesting. Although probably I just really wanted to get home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1l6m1n/my_mom_passed_away_from_cancer_a_month_and_nine/,23,"I actually went back on my facebook and looked up my post from that day so that I could think about what I was doing the day she passed.  Your message hits close to home in a weird way.  I'm currently care giving for my mother who has brain cancer.  Its fucked, in all honesty.  She's still her, and some times she's totally normal and others she doesn't know at all what is going on.  Today when she was showering and I went in to help her she was talking about these fish on the shower curtain in our bathroom and how the shark was trying to eat the other fish.  Its just a child's shower curtain for my nephew, but she thought up this whole scenario.  She's not really that kind of person..  Its just a weird example of how brain cancer affects you cognitively.  Let alone confusion, weakness.  Your brain is who you are.  The only saving grace from this terminal disease is that she's not in a whole lot of pain like your mom.  I can't imagine dealing with all of this and then adding lung issues.  

I'm co-caring with her boyfriend of five years, but he's frequently out of town for work so it falls on me to take care of her.  It gets so lonely man.  And I feel so inadequate as a care giver even tho my friends tell me I'm doing everything I can.  Reading your post was almost like my future self could have written this.  It sucks that you've gone through this, but watching her go a little at a time, you start to grieve for them before they are even gone.  I know what it was like to lose my brother 3 years ago, but that was so sudden it was an awful shock.  This loss is slow and painful in a different way.  I mean its our mothers.

After losing my brother and now winding down with my mom, it just leaves me, my dad, and my nephew who I don't get to see as often as I want.  Its really lonely, even with people reaching out to help or be there.  I sometimes isolate myself from the issue at hand, perhaps that is what you were doing for those days after your mom died.

I don't think you should feel guilty for not being there.  I mean as much as I want to take care of my mom, there's a good part of me that doesn't want to deal with jack shit and I'll leave for a day or so here and there.  I think its just our brains forcing us to take the action for self preservation.  After all the time you spent with her caregiving, you already said your good byes.  The final moment in some respects isn't any more significant necessarily for brain cancer patients.  It sounds harsh maybe, but reading what you wrote your mom knew you loved her.  And she wasn't alone, there was the nurse present.  

Anyway, I hope I didn't overstep my boundaries here, I just thought you deserved to know that your story touched me, and I can relate to you in some respects.  Now that you've finished with that pat of your life, when you're ready you can start to figure out what the future holds for you. ",2013-08-27 12:33:16

333,35e22w,False,,5,Who knew glandular fever could ruin my life?,whatsbotheringyou,"Last year I went through a major upheaval in my life. I dropped out of year 12 (senior year?), moved 3 hours away from everyone and everything I knew, was homeless, and was honestly ready to just give up.

I got myself out, finished high school, completed a few different courses, found somewhere to live, got enrolled in university to study justice and confirmed what I wanted to do career-wise, which was to join the police force in my state. I was so determined to do this, I've never had any goals I've been willing to work so hard towards.

Then I got sick. I had glandular fever (mono). Got the usual illness, was sick for a few weeks and then got over it. I was well for about a week when I went to visit my grandparents. A few days in, my back started to ache, though I thought that was just because I was driving grandma all over the place and wasn't used to that. Over the next few days, I couldn't eat, was feverish and shaky, was starting to get sick again. We thought maybe I just wasn't over the sickness and went to the doctor. She gave me pain and nausea medication and a shot to make the nausea go away, none of which helped. 

It was time for me to go home. The morning after I got back, I woke my boyfriend and begged him to take me to hospital. He took me to the smallish hospital near our place, they did test after test and decided it was best to send me to one of the biggest hospitals in our city, as whatever it was, they weren't equipped to handle it. It took a week, a bone marrow aspiration (using six needles instead of the usual two, on the bright side I have very hard bones), a platelet transfusion, and a PICC line (a line travelling down a vein towards the heart, used to take blood, administer meds etc.) to discover what was wrong. I had a rare blood infection, one that can be fatal, which can either be genetic or from infections like glandular fever, in my case. I had an enlarged liver, spleen and very low iron and platelets. They treat it with steroids and 40 weeks of chemotherapy. I was terrified.

Fortunately for me, by the time they figured out what it was, I had started getting better on my own and only needed steroids as treatment. Alas, I was weak for months, I still get exhausted very easily and sometimes my back still hurts where they took the bone marrow. Regardless of this, I bounced back, started my uni course, and was so bloody excited about my future. 

Last month, my heart started racing as I was washing dishes at work. I thought nothing of it and continued pottering about. The next day it happened again during a driving lesson. My instructor took me to the hospital. Test after test on my heart, couldn't find anything so they let me go. The next week I had an ambulance called for me as my heart rate was 130 while I was just sitting in class (average heart rate is 70). They let me go, pending further appointments with a cardiologist. I went and saw him on Thursday and he said it's one of two heart conditions, there are to be further tests but one of them is conveniently caused by 'having had a viral or bacterial infection, like glandular fever'. Wasn't too worried, they're both easily manageable and generally wouldn't cause issues in my day-to-day life. The next day I had to tell my teachers about it (if my heart rate increases I need to leave class and lie down). One of them is a former police officer and was on the interview board for the academy, so I asked her how having this would affect my chances of being successful. She said she'd ask her friend who is a medical officer, but it's very unlikely I'd be accepted. 

I am absolutely gutted, I got home and cried for the rest of the night. This was my dream and it's been completely torn from me by some stupid illness.

I cannot find work that satisfies me.

I am now bored to the degree that I am getting depressed by my work. I hate my job, and I dread every day when I have to leave for work. My work quality is bad, and I fear the day it will be discovered.

I know I have to quit, but I have no other line of work I can apply for. I've been searching for jobs for several months, but I rarely find anything that is even mildly interesting. Getting another boring job will just lead to the same thing (I have tried).

The thing is I cannot find work that is challenging. Most jobs consists of menial tasks with no thinking required.

I know this might come off as arrogant, but I hope someone will understand the feeling of throwing one's life away. I know I have great potential, but I cannot find a way to express it. Besides work I have a family, so using my spare time to follow my passions is not going to work.

141,gscd6d,False,,2,the state of the world,whatsbotheringyou,"These past few months, I've felt myself becoming angrier and sadder every day by the state of the world. There's always a new police shooting. There's always another attack on women's rights. There are people out there who hates me and wants me dead soley for the reason that I am a lesbian. There are so many fights to be fought, and all of them seem to be lost. I don't even live in Hong Kong, or the US, or anywhere else that's currently having people fight for their rights. I am very lucky, but still I feel exhausted, and I can only imagine what it's like to live in the middle of it all.

It's just really draining. I've always wanted to believe that a majority of people *are* good, or at least they want to be. But every day I see news stories of women who were killed for turning down a romantic advance, or read about power-hungry individuals ristricting human rights, or people being shot for daring to be black. I feel so much empathy and pain and anger and fear and it's just exhausting. 

I know I'm privileged. I live somewhere safe, where the law protects me and we rank top in equality. My real life is only impacted by the ocassional sexual harassment and casually homophobic comments, and the things I witness online I can always turn off (which I have, my phone is locked away in a safe until Saturday. I deleted my private Instagram. Besides Reddit for these past 30 minutes, I haven't been on social media). 

However, I feel I owe it to the world to not turn a blind eye. But I damn it, I am so tired. I have been active online my entire life, and I consider myself to be politically active and extremely aware of a lot of the injustices in the world. And I do genuinely care, as superficial as that may sound. My heart hurts and I have this anger that runs deeper than anything I've ever experienced, both on behalf of myself and others. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm probably not the only one feeling defeated lately. I hope I feel a bit better soon, because I don't want to sit idly by for long. Still, I need a break after years of this constant stream of negativity and bad news.

Thanks for listening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/gscd6d/the_state_of_the_world/,22,"You are not alone! It's very understandable for the empathetic and compassionate to feel fatigued when faced with the barrage of curated media that constantly emits the same message, ""Things are not ok!"". 

It sounds like you are taking the perfect steps though of slightly narrowing the scope of information you are exposed to. It may feel like a betrayal to not give yourself to every tragedy that is occuring on our vast planet, but it's an important and humbling realization we all must come to - that our time, energy and attention is limited, and that it's much healthier and more fulfilling to concentrate on the things we can change in our community versus the things that are out of our control. 

Good luck and hang in there! ",2020-05-28 19:00:17
840,dsoaox,False,,2,Wanting something that'll never happen.,whatsbotheringyou,So there's this girl I talk to sometimes and whenever I do it seems like for just that split moment of me talking to her my troubles and pain goes away. I really wish I could tell her this and everything but between the significant age gap and the fact she's dating someone right now I know it'll destroy any friendship we have. I know I have to let it be but being single for so long I just want someone like her that can do what she does. I feel crazy for thinking about this so much but I don't know what else to do besides just not think about it.,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/dsoaox/wanting_something_thatll_never_happen/,10,"Not sure if you're asking for advice, but you just need to talk to more people. She's not a snowflake, she's a person and there are many other people. What you're doing is like someone going on a diet and then agonizing over their misfortune that the only thing in their house is a box of donuts; just go out and get some other food, it's really not any more complicated than that. 

I'm not trying to diminish your pain or say anything negative about this girl. I've been there and I feel you, completely. It's not easy to feel that way, but I know you'll move passed it. You have to realize your imprisoning yourself by thinking that this is the only person who can make you feel happy, it's really very untrue. You're the only one who can set yourself free, so try meditating, be expansive, talk to more people.

254,1rj9ae,False,,8,I am under an enormous amount of stress right now. I want someone who doesn't know me and who doesn't have a biased opinion to just lend a kind ear.,whatsbotheringyou,"Here are my first world problems that are, in fact, bothering me:

I'm a fifth year senior (at an undergraduate institution). I'm applying to law school, grad school, the peace corps, and jobs. I'm only applying to so many different things because I'm genuinely interested in all these options, and I'm not applying to more than one law school and one grad school. 

Anyways, many days I just can't manage to get anything done in terms of these long-ass, daunting applications. I don't know if subconsciously I'm intentionally putting it off, I'm just tired, or a combination of both. It's making me even more stressed because I can't manage to just get it all done.

I know this is supposed to be a process. It's not supposed to take a day or two. But, goddamnit, I miss what it felt like to just have a couple of responsibilities to worry about, instead of what feels like a thousand. 

In addition to multiple jobs and volunteering on top of my schooling, I'm also partially helping support my boyfriend through his PhD program right now, and I'm sure that adds to my stress. I love doing it because I love him, and he'd be lost without me.

I know what you're thinking--*you're complaining about the possibility of obtaining an even greater education and having a loving boyfriend? life must be tough...*--I know I'm incredibly blessed. 

You ever notice that when you are surrounded by loving people you feel even more stressed to live up to your fullest self to make those you love happy? I know, I know--these life decisions are supposed to be about me. And they are. But I still can't shake that feeling.

Thanks for listening, Reddit. Hopefully soon I'll figure at least a small part of life out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/1rj9ae/i_am_under_an_enormous_amount_of_stress_right_now/,18,"As for the applications, two useful pieces of advice:

1. Set a timer for fifteen minutes and do them in chunks. Give yourself a five minute break between sections. Break them up by sections: Fill-in-the-blanks, essay questions, legal documents and whatnot, and so on, and reward yourself for finishing each section. 5-7 big-ass applications can be made much less scary once you break them down in a dozen or so small chunks.

2. You're going to find yourself entering a lot of information over and over again like name, financial situation, residency information, etc. etc. Save a copy of those fill-in-the-blank sheets after you've filled them out and use them to make filling out the next one easier.

As for the bigger questions, all I can say is that you need to think about what's right for you. It's perfectly normal to go through this at this stage in life, and especially normal to make mistakes. To realize you *really* wanted to do X but somehow you wound up in Y. I can't tell you what's right or wrong, but I will advise you to carry out a small exercise to help you think about things.

Sit down at a table with a piece of paper in front of you and a pencil. Set a timer for 10-15 minutes. I want you to fill up that paper with the values and virtues you hold most dear. Really think about them, and what may be underlying them. Maybe ""friendliness"" is just an aspect of a deeper kind of loyalty, kindness, or other, stronger virtue. In other words, boil yourself down to your essentials, the things that make you, you. Discover your foundations, the things that you would die for or never give up on. Then look at the things you're applying to. Think about them in context of what you've just done. Will the things you aspire to, your virtues, line up with this path? Will this help you be the person you want to be, or will you find yourself constantly fighting some aspect of your career because it disagrees with you on a fundamental level?

Good luck, and you've got someone cheering for you. :) ",2013-11-27 00:06:56

279,5jgqj8,False,,4,My Dad died and half of my friends haven't said a thing,whatsbotheringyou,"I my Dad died at the end of October, less than a month after my 18th birthday. He had cancer in his neck that metastasised from an unknown location in his body. He couldn't speak for the last month of his life because the tumor paralyzed his vocal chords and needed a feeding tube because he couldn't swallow. It's safe to say I'm now a fanatical supporter of assisted dying. He had 0 quality of life, and I just wish he could have had some dignity in his death rather than being slowly strangled. He was 50 with long brown hair, picture Aragon from LotR, but with a tube in his stomach and a breathing hole in his neck. He was still so handsome and positive even when he was dying.

My best friend's Dad died of cancer too in August and we have supported each other as well as have other friends who came to my Dad's funeral, just kindness. 

But some people who have heard about my Dad's death through word of mouth, and who I thought were my friends, have said nothing, no acknowledgement no nothing. I was talking to a 'friend' and I told him about my Dad's death and he said, yeah I'm sorry about that, I heard from x who heard from x. I was thinking to myself, why haven't these people said anything? Literally a 2 sentence Facebook message would be enough. 

Interestingly enough, others who I haven't spoken to in years really surprised me. Really heartfelt words, telling me that they were genuinely thinking of me and that they have gained a new perspective. 

Death really does polarise the genuine and the fake. Sorry for any typos I'm too tired to proof read ",https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/5jgqj8/my_dad_died_and_half_of_my_friends_havent_said_a/,17,"I can't know how you feel right now about that, but I want to guess that it's really frustrating or disappointing. I could say that their reasons for this are maybe because they don't believe it's necessary to bring it up to you because they don't want to hurt your feelings of reminding you about that. I mean, when one of my sort-of friend's mother died of cancer, I didn't say much because she was always crying and I didn't want to remind her so much. 
However, I honestly think it's simply because they don't care. That has a good side, but it's also annoying, and that's not even the word I'm looking for. It's so screwed up how little people actually care, or how little their compassion is. I know a similar feeling when something really bad happened in my life. Literally, people who I barely knew other than the hallways of high school or Facebook gave more support than any family members or friends I talked to more. It pissed me off, so I cut them out. I wanted them to know that they're not going to be in my life if they were even there for me when bullshit happened. But, as I said, this is a great filtering of friends oppritunity. It showed you who cared enough to write you a message, or who were concerned with your well being when you were at a horrible time in your life. It sucks how they basically made you go out of your way to mention your father's death, and when you did, they already knew about it and didn't even say a word. That being said, I am sorry for your loss. And I don't know if you're into music, specifically loud music, but I know a song that would help you relate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rz28xa9Fc .

I found some old home movies of myself and I couldn't help but to watch. And seeing my family 20-25 years ago was awesome and funny and heartwarming. And, not to brag, but I was a cutie. But, as I watched, I couldn't help but feel a bit melancholy. I was a bubbly, whimsical and hilarious kid. I had an infectious laugh and smile. I always had a smile or look of wonder. I was a strange bird and I didn't give a shit. Just an example, for my 6th birthday party I had a costume party since my birthday is Halloween. All the other girls i invited were princesses, fairies or ballerinas and I...was a bug. I was a happy little girl. And now I am 24 and just...not. Somewhere down the road I lost my sense of wonder. My confidence. My joy. My optimism. My love of life. My laugh and smile. And worse of all, I lost my happiness. I realized just how unhappy I've become in my adult years and I am motivated to change that. I don't know how, but I'm going to get that happiness and joy back.

I did not see it coming at all, and was completely blind sided by it on a Friday. I had been there for 2 and a half years, and the previous month had received a glowing review. I started looking for work immediately, but due to everything going on that took a while, and I finally started a new job 3 days ago on Monday. I fucking hate being back at work. I have spent the last 9 and a half years working full time, 40+ hours a week, while only receiving 2 weeks of vacation time a year, half of which were used on sick days because I have never gotten any paid sick days. The last 4 months of being unemployed were amazing. I've been on unemployment, which is a little bit over half of what I was making previously, and with reduced spending I've had no issues staying afloat. I've been able to just exist, unburdened by the 9 to 5 grind, and I am now terrified that I'm going to spend the next 35-40 years working 5-6 days a week, just like I've been doing for the last 10, and this small taste of freedom over the past few months has solidified what I already knew. The vast majority of my days are spent somewhere I don't wanna be, doing something I don't want to be doing, for someone who usually doesn't deserve all the wealth that they have. This is no way to live, and yet I feel trapped by it. I feel so tired, and I haven't even finished my first week yet. I just don't know what to do anymore, but I do know that I don't want the rest of my life to be this. I feel like I forgot how miserable this made me while I was unemployed. Had a panic attack over it on Monday after work, and now I'm on some anxiety meds to help cope. I can't quit either because then I lose my unemployment benefits.
