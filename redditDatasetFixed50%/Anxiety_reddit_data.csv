615,gqmycs,False,Family/Relationship,75,Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,Anxiety,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

My naturopath had 2 science degrees from reputable schools and I was actually referred to her by my doctor at the time (who I didn't like and stopped seeing). There's definitely crack pots out there so try to find a good one, but once you do it's life changing. 

She did an elimination diet with me so I basically could only eat quinoa and cooked vegetables with no seasoning and we slowly added things back into my diet to see the results. She put me on a bunch of supplements and then we did a blood test that tested for dietary intolerances (different than allergies) and I got a list of things to avoid. 6months later I was cured and have been fine for years after over a decade of trying everything else.

932,9pv2ve,False,Sleep,70,my method for sleeping with anxiety,Anxiety,"It's no joke. This sub lights up like a Christmas tree at night. With some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. I've been battling it for many years and I think I have found one way that works for me.

Staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. At night, the ""busy"" goes away, so our brains start churning. These thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. 

We can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. You have to learn to manage your thoughts. Sounds impossible, right? It's possible with practice. Here is what I do. 

You HAVE to avoid anything personal to you. I imagine a giant house. Imagine entering this house. The first floor is a long hallway full of doors. Behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. Television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) 

The trick is to STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. 

The second floor is anything personal to you. Friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. All these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. If you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. Back out immediately. 

The basement is the dark place. All your worst fears. Avoid at all cost. 

As for thoughts that are not personal. You will find tricks that work for you. Some things I do...

Take my favorite movie and put myself in it. I imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what I would say with them. Same for favorite tv shows. What would I say to each and every character if I had the chance? 

Word games. I try to come up with every word that is two letters only. I come up with words made from another word. Stupid things like that. 

Eventually, you fall asleep. 

I understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you. To control your thoughts so you can control the physical reaction to those thoughts. Try it and let me know if it works for you.

Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive.

My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure.

793,dw7b3x,False,I Made This!,46,I wrote a bit of a poem about self-doubt. My therapist advised that I share it.,Anxiety,"I'm scared! I shout, to no one

I'm hurting but what if it isn't real? 

There is a duality to the doubt I feel, 

Outward initially, then turned inside - 

Did this even happen? Do I see this right?
 
Can I trust my mind?

Is my memory real or is it defined

by my own narrative?

Of course it is.

Then how do I believe it? How do I know it's true?

If this is just in my head then what do I do?

Am I everything I hate, defined? 

As bad as those I strike down in my mind? 

The jury is out and it seems almost unanimous, 

But what if the crime was committed by one of us? 

The judge is scornful and asks with derision, 

Are you even capable to make this decision?

After all, you wrote your own dialogue. 

Internal monologue, set thrusters to overdrive. 

Constantly in fight or flight, zoom in, analyse. 

Please give me some peace. 

Peace comes to the dead.

I don't want to be die,

But perhaps it might be nice 

To have a rest.

Why can I see so many things?

Not a hallucination, that's not what this is.

It's a sight I can't see with my eyes.

The connections, the links, the things that make my heart stop.

They're not visual but they exist.

They exist in my mind, and my mind alone.

I state them aloud and in pours the doubt. 

I made this.

I have created something, what is it?

Oh, it's anxiety. Hello. 

Sit with me a while. 

Am I propogating my own downfall?

This person is hurting me, let me tell you.

This is all the things that they do;

It doesn't sound bad enough. 

It sounds petty, pathetic, petulent and pitiful, 

Not like it should cause the pain that I go through. 

Yes, I'm being negatively affected by external factors,

But I'm the one processing them.

Am I doing this right?

Is this okay?

Am I validated for feeling this way?

Did I put myself in the wrong situations,

Or have I convinced myself they're bad?

Would things be fine if I saw this differently?

Paint on a smile, adopt positivity, 

Or is that accepting less than I deserve?

What do I deserve anyway?

Decency. Respect. Honesty.

Love, maybe.

But why? 

Do I give these to others?

Can I?

The main point of contention -

Is everything I know just an invention?

We're judged on our action and not our intention.

I'll never see how another sees me, 

So how will I ever truly rest easy. 

Would people be honest? Am I?

You get back what you put into the world.

Did I put this out? Is this projection?

Is this a narrative for my own protection?

I don't feel very safe.

Have I made myself a victim?

Or did other people harm me?

Did they shatter the glass, or did I?

Pandora had hope in her box of demons.

I wonder if doubt always sat on it's shoulder, 

Nesting, infecting, and spilling all over? 

Will things get better, is this just situational?

Are they too broken or too confrontational? 

Or maybe, just maybe, it's me.

I'm always the common denominator, see. 

Am I putting myself in punishing places?

Seeing the lies behind smiling faces? 

Or have I just framed it that way? 

Everything bad happens to me.

Does it really?

I'm resilient. I get through.

Look at everything I've had to do.

I'll tell you, but it's from my point of view.

So how do we know even know if its true?

What would you say? And would I believe you? 

Where do I go when I can't accept my own truth, but can't accept another either?

I view everything I perceive through a fear being
deceived. 

Can any of us be believed? 

I don't trust because I don't want to be wrong.

But then I can't trust myself. 

What if I'm the one with the big bag of tricks?

Pull the wool over my own eyes.

Fill my mind with my own-brand lies.

Is there respite? 

Is there relief? 

Whats the cure? 

Is it self belief? 

How do I believe what I know can't be fact? 

How is everyone else maintaining that act? 

Am I alone?

I feel alone, I whisper, to no one.

It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea.

First, I am shocked this post was upvoted so many times. And I truly believe it wasn’t upvoted because of the victory you had, but because you made a very stressed point about not wanting to hear anything about Jesus. 

It deeply... deeply saddens me, grieves me to see such repulsiveness to the lord on your part. Where you are willing or have the thought of leaving to your car to get away from him. Before you stop reading, and yes I am speaking directly to the original poster, please hear me out. 

What exactly did God do to you to cause you to be so repulsed by him? Don’t blame it on the hosts. Because I don’t think that’s what this is all about. 

God, Jesus Christ, didn’t do anything to you to cause you harm. He didn’t cause any of this world to act the way it does. Mankind, in all his “wisdom” fights tooth and nail against God because he thinks he knows better. And satan and his army of demons, work in the invisible world and heavenly places to seek out and destroy us. It is satan, not God who causes strife. 

If anything, you should be repulsed by CNN or any other news network for that matter, especially modern pop culture. It’s filled with the work of satan. 

Let me stress this again, God did not do anything to you to cause YOU to hate him. You hate him because you’ve been deceived. 

God has done EVERYTHING he could to save us from our sin. When he said, “it is finished,” on the cross, he meant it. Anyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved, our salvation is sealed in him. 

The fact is, in your current mindset and where your heart is, you are going to hell. Many are on that path. Many! The Bible says so. 

God loves us so much. You have NO IDEA how much he loves us. If you think for a second how hard this worldly life is, imagine how bad hell will be. With no second chances. And eternal separation from Jesus Christ, his love and his glory. 

Yes, I’m approaching this the classical hated way by so many who disbelieve by bringing hell into the equation. And I am standing my ground in this. Because that’s the final verdict for all who deny the one and ONLY living God. 

My intention is not to fear you into allowing the lord into your heart. My intention is to show you what’s on the line. God, is beyond good. He offers love like you’ve never experienced. Your family, husband, kids or no one else can even come close to the love Christ offers. He is a gracious, loving, merciful and forgiving God. He’s coming back soon. 

I would hate to see you continue to hold on to so much hate for him and be eternally separated in complete agony. Christ said there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth there. Is it really worth leaning on your own understanding for these things? Your own understanding will get you no where. 

I’m willing to sacrifice all of my karma to stress to you how wrong you are right now. And it’s out of love. 

Over 700 people upvoted this post and it goes to show just how far separated we are from Christ. It deeply saddens me. We all have our own choices to make. And mine right now is to scream at you as loud as I can and say go the other way. You won’t be let down. 

What hope is there for any of us to live a part from God? Honestly ask yourself this question. What really matters in your life a part from God? My belief is a part from God, nothing.... absolutely nothing matters in this life.  If God is not the head of our life, we are dust in the wind. 

I pray you come to Christ someday. You won’t be popular, people will hate you, you won’t be upvoted, you’ll be down voted because you speak in his name. But that’s ok. Jesus said the world hated him first and so we’ll be hated as well as a result.

Wake up people! Jesus is coming back soon. Don’t be deceived! The day of the lord is at hand! And I can’t wait for it. But in the meantime, I desperately want to see people on Christ’s side. Not their own  misdirected side. 

Out of love to all!

I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with.

Which in turn made me much more anxious. When my grandmother died i didn’t eat for 2.5 days. My parents were scared i was going to need to be hospitalized (i also pace or go on long walks in times of anxiety, so i had been walking miles and miles). I lost a ton of weight that week, and I’m quite smol (5’3, 110 lbs). Sorry for the long descriptions, but yes, i get it quite a lot. It hasn’t been as bad in the past 5 years or so, but i have my days. Yogurt, protein shakes, and lots of water get me through spells. But sometimes even that’s too hard.

I feel like anytime i’m out in public that people are just watching me and so i’m hyper-aware of how i’m walking, where i’m putting my arms, and in general whatever i’m doing. 
But the thing is, It’s not really that i think people are viciously judging me, it just feels, for example, like i’m doing normal everyday things except there’s an stadium of people watching, like obviously you’d feel like your every move was being monitored and it’s extremely uncomfortable and tense. 
Even if i’m in the car by myself when i stop at a stoplight i think all the people in cars around me are looking at me, also i can’t walk my dogs in the daylight because i feel like everyone is watching me from their houses or cars that are driving by are watching me too. And when i’m at school walking around campus or in classes, and it’s ALL i think about in these situations. i can’t relax in any public setting alone and it’s so awful of a feeling that when i can avoid it i will. I wont even go sit in the library or go to the student union at school, i’ll go sit in my car instead (i’m in my senior year and i’ve been in the student union alone maybe 4x).
If i have to go in public alone i try to do whatever i have to, as fast as i can. Though when i’m with someone that i’m comfortable with i don’t really think about that at all or if i do it’s very very minimal. 
I would like to be able to go out and feel at ease when i do things like, go to the gym, walk my dogs, go to classes, go to the stores, go to the movie theatre,  etc. but I’ve been like this for so long i’m not even sure how i could get better at this point?

>Levine said the new inclusion was based on a recommendations from the Medical Marijuana Advisory Board, as well as research on marijuana treatment with both conditions.

I am not sure why this happens to me and why I feel like I am personally attacked or feel like I am punched in the stomach when I find out that I was wrong about something 

*(my judgement tells me that either it is because I was raised in a semi-strict background with pushy parents where if you are not on the right, then you are definitely on the wrong; or because I am someone who always took school seriously and when school events are involved like exams or even a classroom interaction, if you posted the wrong answer or the wrong statement, then that means that you are definitely wrong and you get a lower score and in turn, that score affects your self-worth and self-confidence in your ability on whether you are able to think critically)*

Just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.

Here is the letter: 

""Its been difficult for me to find the words to what Im about to share with you because I feel ashamed. Ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I’ve been living a lie. It took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something I have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.
Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.

I am not at peace. I haven’t been since you’ve known me. If I didn’t come here, I wouldve done something to myself. I simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. Theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. Idk what peace feels like. Idk how to relax. My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it. I cant make new friends because of it. I dont trust anyone because of it and Im tired of being held back in my life. I deserve to have peace. I deserve to be happy and smiling. Why not me? I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

Love and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.

It's not anything official so please don't get really angry at me if I have made a mistake.

-	Panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high
-	It's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there’s cortisol everywhere
-	It's just the chemical making you feel this way, this is not you
-	If you start feeling anxious, just try to lower the cortisol levels; breath, ground yourself, feet on the floor, mindfulness
-	These are just thoughts, they aren’t as bad as they seem – it doesn’t seem true right now but you must believe it
-	Be aware and let them happen, don’t fight it
-	You can get through this, you have before
-	Just ride it out
-	Resist the temptation to let the anxiety take over – you do not want to feel this way
-	If you just want an excuse to relax/procrastinate you can do that without anxiety
-	If you refuse to believe that when you’re happy you’re not just faking it, then at least accept that it's nicer like that anyway as you dont have frequent panic attacks
-	Fuck the cortisol
-	Fuck anxiety
-	This won’t last forever

When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and ""accept"" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

Edit: Talking with several other anxiety sufferers, I'm finding that this advice is more applicable to people who experience chronic low-level anxiety and less applicable to people who experience acute panic attacks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9x65wy/what_people_think_is_a_cure_for_anxiety_is/,696,"""I accept and allow these anxious feelings""

I highly suggest you try the book ""DARE"" by Barry McDonagh

He details a response akin to what you are describing. I listen to the audio book when I drive to move through anxiety and panic and remind me of the mantras.

It also helps to reframe your anxious feelings by thinking of them as excited feelings. Since your body goes through virtually the same process for those responses, reframing as excitement may give you a different reaction to those feelings.  ",2018-11-15 00:55:31
585,g4y8e7,False,Work/School,159,"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity",Anxiety,"I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me.

I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying.

This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk.

Partly because I totaled my car and can’t really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that’s walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

332,gg45u4,False,Needs A Hug/Support,197,Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,Anxiety,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort.

It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys.

In May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren’t from “falling down in the woods” and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn’t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.

I never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted “justice.”  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. 

After 32 years.. it’s right there.. all over again.

I want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says “well, she was drunk” or “Boys will be boys.”  I want to vomit every time someone says “why did she wait so long?” and worse.. “he didn’t do anything..he just didn’t help her.” 

I feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.  It doesn’t seem fair after successfully tucking it away for so long  it has resurfaced.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

205,gmezo7,False,DAE Questions,119,"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?",Anxiety,"Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything!

346,8z20x2,False,,85,Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,Anxiety,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8z20x2/who_else_has_anxiety_about_not_doing_enough_with/,1092,"I think it's all about priorities.

I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

508,a0k03f,False,Helpful Tips!,69,A cool anxiety technique I learned,Anxiety,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible!

940,fk4iag,False,,110,Our collective pep talk for today: It will all be okay,Anxiety,"I want to put this in writing so I remember it, and so my fellow anxiety sufferers remember it:

This is not the end. This is a temporary situation. The only way out is through. (That last one, a therapist told me once when I was going through an extremely difficult time with my anxiety and depression.)

Those of us with anxiety know this feeling of sheer terror very well. It feels so familiar with us that at first, we weren't sure whether we need to panic. Then we panicked, because we are professional panickers. We are also professionals at getting through this. We have a unique set of skills!

My two main coping skills right now:

1) Thinking of time in two-week increments. Right now, my focus is on the next two weeks. (In the area of the US where I live, there are, for the most part, two-week closures.) So, okay, we get to the end of March, and we'll see how things look. 

2) Tune out the people who say...""this could go on for months/years/etc..."" ""life as we know it is over..."" These are not healthy thoughts or sentiments, nor are they helpful. People that don't see things through a lens of generalized anxiety disorder DO NOT understand how triggering comments like these are. This is how we anxiety sufferers think on a daily basis, and we know how damaging it can be. Others do not, because they don't know about the spiral of unrealistic fears we can go into any other day of a normal, boring day/week/month/year.

I hope this helps. We are here to lift each other up. Let's not feed into each other's panic - let's keep things positive. It's not unrealistic to say, this too shall pass.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn’t get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I’m too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I’m possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing. 

I’ve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. I’ll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like I’ve lost the knack for things I used to enjoy.

At times it comes out of nowhere, while at other times people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, like me, feel anxious most of the time.

Having problems in your life which you don’t know how to solve, results in ongoing ruminations and negative thoughts of imagined outcomes which can lead to emotional reactions such as anxiety. Overthinking could be the source of your anxiety. People with anxiety tend to overthink everything in their lives. They obsess towards the things they need to finish or take care of. They have their own scenarios in their heads; playing it over and over again until they can’t-do anything because they’re stuck with their own thoughts.

If anxiety is affecting the quality of your life and your health, then you need to start focusing on [controlling your anxiety](https://themindsjournal.com/ways-control-unwanted-emotions/) immediately. Here are a few ways you can try:

1. Observe your thoughts

Do you have a negative thought pattern? Be aware and observe how your thoughts work. Whenever you feel negative or worried about something, question your thoughts and change your perspective.

2. Practice deep breathing

Deep breathing mindfully can work wonders with your anxiety. Practice deep breathing techniques like the 4-7-8 breathing technique as it will help you to calm down.

3. Take a walk

When you start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, get out and take a stroll. Temporarily walking away from a particular situation often helps us to reset our mind and mood which alleviates our anxiety.

4. Start journaling

Write down whatever you feel, positive and negative, and note down all your thoughts to get them out of your head. This will help you to relieve some pressure from your mind.

5. Meditate

A daily 10 minutes [meditation](https://themindsjournal.com/meditation-for-beginners/) routine can help you become more mindful and control anxious thoughts a lot more easily when they come. If you find sitting silently too difficult, then you can also try some [alternate meditation practices](https://themindsjournal.com/7-informal-meditation-practices/2/).

6. Stay healthy

Exercising for 20 minutes three to four times a week can also help you manage your anxiety and stress levels. You can simply start by doing a simple cardio routine to start feeling the positive effects.

I am sure you will find these relaxation techniques helpful in controlling your anxiety. However, if your anxiety persists, it's best to visit a mental health professional.

I believe you will find this article helpful in your situation: [When Your Anxiety Is Getting The Best Of You, Read This](https://themindsjournal.com/when-your-anxiety-is-getting-the-best-of-you-read-this/) ",2020-03-21 19:00:21

831,6okkl2,False,,32,posting on Reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety,Anxiety,"I have been a lurker on Reddit, and many other sites on the internet for many years now. It took me years until I could even bring myself to make a Reddit account (and other accounts.) However, I could not bring myself to post anything or any comments no matter how badly I wanted to. In the past, I have posted a few things when I had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but I always go back into hiding.

The internet, and Reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. Despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on Reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.
Before I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.

Even though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.

On top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.
All throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.

But at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. 
As long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work.

\-second edit, It's been pointed out to me that what I've done could/would cause anxiety in others and what I did was wrong, I'm sad that I might have made someone feel like how I feel every day, but nevertheless I'm happy for overcoming some part of my anxiety but not about the way I went about it.

\-fourth edit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b67d1t/i_just_gave_my_number_to_a_girl/,679,"i wouldn't worry about your actions causing anxiety for others. anxiety isn't a rational thing so anything you do could cause anxiety. it will make you crazy trying to anticipate all the things you could be doing that might possibly make others uncomfortable. and even if you put alllll your effort into this there is still a very good chance that you will accidentally make someone anxious. no, its much better to live your life and do your best to keep people comfortable within reason.

also, its better to ask for their number rather than to given them yours. it takes the pressure off them to make the first move and actually txt you. don't worry, if they aren't interested they will just ignore your txts so you aren't imposing anything on them. ",2019-03-27 17:53:17

However, I constantly feel that my anxiety isn't ""enough"". I don't mean that anxiety is a good thing that we should aspire to have as much of as possible--not at all. It's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. I've never had a panic attack before, and I know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. Mine has never gotten to that point. I kind of feel like I'm lost--I'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others.

And now that we’re have to practice social distancing it’s making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true. I feel like I need constant reassurance from my friends so I know they aren’t mad me even though it makes no sense for them to be mad at me because there has been no actual conflict between us. I guess since I haven’t physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is.

588,8r7ozl,False,Advice,95,Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,Anxiety,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent.
