I enjoy expressing my opinions because personally, I like to believe they're well thought out and expressed (all though I might be wrong) yet, often on a daily basis not only myself, but my fellow peers at school who I consider intelligent, are constantly put down and degraded by varying adults. Of course this doesn't apply to everyone, (for example my English teacher is very supportive of his students' opinions and statements) but it does apply to many others, it's as if we're not allowed to have the right to be treated as humans? Feel free to go through it yourself, but last time I checked, the convention of children's rights says specifically that all children have the right to an opinion and for it to be taken seriously, but how often is that respected? I understand that some of the kids actually are the stereotypical mindless children that we're portrayed as, but shouldn't most adults be smart enough not to jump to conclusions and make assumptions towards every kid out there? So to the question I put in the title, how can I help change this mindset? Do I continue to explain this the way I did previously to others? How can I transcribe to the person that myself and others feel this way? I'm sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

2-minute video intro: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804)

Brief summary:

* They're *democracies*. Every kid gets one vote. The kid literally *hire and fire their own teachers.*
* There's *no curriculum*. Just show up everyday and learn whatever you want to learn. Seriously. So long as it's not downright illegal, learn *whatever you want*.  Learn about jellyfish if that's your thing. Learn about space travel.  Teach yourself guitar or something. Or just hang around and talk to  people! It's all up to you! You have *freedom*.
* There are *no grades*.  If you really want to, you can ask someone to judge your work. But  that's not the default. The default is...just...do stuff. No grades. No  tests. We trust you. It's fine.
* Yes,  Sudbury kids get into college just fine! Turns out colleges are super  open-minded about this. Sudbury schools have been running since 1968 and  they've surveyed adult graduates and they're doing *awesome* (on average, at least).

I  REALLY WISH I HAD GONE TO A SUDBURY SCHOOL WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. If you  are a teenager reading this post, especially if you're creative and  free-spirited and you love learning but you hate the school system, then congratulations, *I am you from the future*. (Not literally, but, ya know, there's a strong parallel here). And I'm telling you, *don't* stress yourself like crazy trying to get good grades in conventional schools. Take care  of your mental health and *seek freedom*.

You're not crazy. The school is crazy.

\*hugs\* (if you want hugs)

196,98gzsw,False,,0,The Truth About Moving Out Early,YouthRights,"INTRODUCTION

I am here to tell you the truth about moving out early. By ""early,"" I mean at an age before legal adulthood. No, don't ""run away."" Move out. It's not the same thing, and you can move out early if you need to or just very much want to.

SHOULD I?

Only you know that.

You are the world's foremost expert on your own life. Other people may have views, and you may choose to take those views on board, but you are the only person who truly knows the experience of being you and living your life. This is your decision, both inherently and because there's no one better qualified to make it.

WHEN SHOULD I?

If you need to move out, you will want to do so as soon as possible. So when is it possible?

In the practical sense, it's possible when you have a steady income sufficient to take care of your basic needs and a little extra. For most of us, that means a reliable job. In addition to the steady income, you'll need a moving-out fund with enough money to set up your own household in the first place -- for instance, to rent most apartments, you'll need \*two\* months' rent and a damage deposit, so that (for example) an apartment which rents for $800/month may actually cost $1700 to move into. There is plenty of planning and budgeting help available on the Internet, to help you get an idea of how much you'll need.

HOW CAN I?

There are several approaches. First, let's look at this emancipation business.

In a rare example of truthfulness, the process of turning from a ""minor"" into a full citizen is called ""emancipation."" It happens automatically on an arbitrary birthday (the 18th in most U.S. states, but a little higher in a few), but there are other ways to become emancipated. One is emancipation upon marriage. Some states allow this. It's not a good escape plan, though, because you would likely need your parents' permission to marry in the first place.

In more than half the states, there is a legal process through which you can be emancipated by court order. This is difficult, time-consuming, and usually expensive, but it's also inarguable. If that option interests you, here's a web site to start you on the process:

[https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html](https://family.findlaw.com/emancipation-of-minors/emancipation-of-minors-basics.html)

If early emancipation isn't looking too doable, your options are limited. Consider whether you can wait it out, detaching emotionally, saving up money and acquiring skills until you reach the designated birthday. If you simply cannot tolerate it, you have one other option for moving out without being emancipated.

It is this: just do it.

I sought emancipation at 17. When I went for legal advice, the lawyer advised me not to bother with court proceedings. She pointed out -- correctly, as it turned out -- that no cop with an ounce of sense would waste his time retrieving a ""runaway"" who was living in an apartment, working, attending college, and otherwise living a normal life.

That's exactly what I did. I saved money, packed my personal items, and moved into an apartment with a roommate. My mother thought that I ""couldn't"" move out until my eighteenth birthday, as if my age were somehow physically preventing me, and didn't quite know what to do when it turned out that no mysterious force prevented me from signing leases, packing clothing, and performing all the other tasks of moving. 

In some states, this is even legally protected. In Oregon, for example, people become ""young adults"" at age 15, and this comes with a few rights. One is the right not to be kidnapped by your parents. If young Oregonians are in a safe location and prefer to remain where they are, the police will not drag them back to their parents' house just because the parents want them to. In other states, no court has jurisdiction to order you hauled back by force. You really should talk to a lawyer if possible, but if not, you can research the relevant laws yourself \[ [https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What\_Are\_the\_Laws\_on\_Teenagers\_Leaving\_Home](https://teens.lovetoknow.com/What_Are_the_Laws_on_Teenagers_Leaving_Home) \] .

In a few states, this is \*how\* you become emancipated. For instance, Minnesota has no court order of emancipation, but young people are regarded as emancipated once they begin to function as adults \[ [https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz](https://www.lawhelpmn.org/resource/emancipation-1?ref=VZwGz) \] . This is a pretty sweet system, because individual Minnesotans can begin living their own lives as soon as they are individually able instead of passively waiting for an arbitrary birthday.

Remember the part where I said that my own moving-out went fairly smoothly, because my mother wasn't sure how to stop me? That's common -- many parents have thought no further than ""you're not allowed,"" and have no backup plan to enforce it -- but it's not universal. Some parents would rather fight than accept, and some have come up with fairly effective methods.

They may physically trap you in their home, for example. This is a terrible shame, because there's really no way to interact with them as family after they've done that. At that point, you must regard them as your captors. If there's a chance your parents might do this, you must keep your moving-out supplies and funds either off-site or on your person, and you mustn't tell them where you'll be living. This stinks, in part because it does start to feel like ""running away"" instead of moving out, but if you're being held prisoner by anyone, any self-respecting person should try to escape.

I heard of a young woman whose parents did this. She then moved out in the earliest morning, to an unknown location, leaving a letter saying that she might contact them after her eighteenth birthday. She did write to them when nineteen years old, but apparently still doesn't feel safe seeing them in person (and I don't blame her, since they used the letter to stir up their ""missing person"" case again). It's a shame that they can't even see each other at Christmas, but the parents wanted a war, and they got one.

I heard of another young woman whose parents forced her to move back in with them by wrecking her life. They showed up at her workplace and caused scenes, repeatedly, until she was fired. When she found another job, they simply did it again. Eventually she was forced to move back in with them because she couldn't keep a job and so couldn't pay her rent. The only other option she saw was homelessness.

She did have other options. If she had understood that her parents were declaring war and that she had to fight back to defend herself, she could have documented their harrassment, and then charged them with harrassment and/or sought a restraining order. She could also have moved to a different city, so that they couldn't harrass her so easily. I don't look down on her for not having the strength and energy to win that war -- nobody wins them all -- but I mention these other options as a way of pointing out that options usually exist.

Pettier harrassment is fairly common. My mother used to call every night to try to push me into eating dinner at my parents' house. Literally. Every. Single. Night. The goal was presumably to harrass me until I gave in, then continue pushing me into living more and more of my life under her roof, until my own apartment sat empty. Instead, I simply stopped answering the phone during the relevant block of time.

Other family members may be enlisted to try to make you feel guilty for hurting or abandoning or whatevering your parents. They are unlikely to listen to reason, so you're probably better off with non-responses like ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" If they won't stop, you may need to minimize contact with your relatives until they've learned to accept the new reality.

In conclusion, you can move out at any age. Often it's even legal, but even when it isn't, it's possible. If it's what's best for you -- and you are the \*only\* person who can know that -- then make your own choice and go for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/98gzsw/the_truth_about_moving_out_early/,14,,2018-08-19 02:19:06

My friend, who is 16, is a high honor roll student with a spotless record of any wrong doings. She's taking college courses and is expected to graduate high school a year earlier than her peers. She has two older brothers, one 19 year old pill-popping drug dealer (well known, popular drug dealer) who lives out on his own. The other brother is a 22 year old heroin addict who also lives out of the parents house, hopping from one friends house to another. Both brothers have a long history of criminal mischief. Her mother works at a well known University and her father is away for work 90% of the time. They are both absolutely, positively insane. My friend is under lock and key CONSTANTLY and suffers psychological abuse on a daily basis, for the past three years. She has no friends because her parents run full background checks on everyone she comes into contact with. She cannot have friends who have ever had a boyfriend, she cannot have friends that will not give up they're cell phone for inspection upon entering the house. She cannot be friends with anybody that is older than her. She is not allowed to go to family reunions because her mother is afraid of ""being embarrassed"" and she isn't allowed outside for anything other than school. Her mother constantly calls her names, calls her fat and puts her down. Her phone is blocked so she can text only her parents. She has a secret cell phone she messages me off of and that's how we communicate. (No iPods, computers allowed). Her father has a history of drinking and blames her for his habits. He also physically abused her. We got Children and Youth involved which proved to be totally useless. They told her parents ahead of time that they would be coming to ""inspect"" so they had days to prepare a story and clean up the house. The agent spoke to the mother first and believed every single lie that came out of her mouth. They didnt even meet the father, who was away for work. Children and Youth then recommended they just see a family counselor, which her mother never did and C&Y didn't follow up on any of it. Recently, her father was picking her up from her baby sitters house (yep, baby sitter for the 16 year old) and told her to hurry up 'or else' and sent a picture of his gun. She talked to guidance counselors at school and brought up the gun situation. The counselor then called children in youth and has left at least three messages. What can my friend do to get authorities involved that will take her seriously? How can she get out of the house to enjoy a normal life? What can be done about her parents?
Side notes: -she called the police on her drug dealer brother once before, the cops went to the parents and told them she did so (she requested to be anonymous) and the parents went and helped him clean up his apartment and no police investigation ensued. -BOTH brothers are treasured by the parents and they do they're best to keep them out of jail. (They have friends at our local police dept) -her mother won't take her to therapy appointments. -my friend has begged the counselor to tell the next children and youth agent to talk to her first before her mother, but who knows what'll happen.
I'm sorry if this is poorly written, and I probably left even more instances out, but I'm at work and will review this post when I get home.

I'm a dad of two little girls. I've always been a strong advocate of treating kids with respect and honor - they are, after all, no less human beings than any adult.

However, there *is* a learning curve here. I'm a firm believer that if most parents would just spend more time with their kids, that alone would sort out most discipline problems. I see this in my own kids. We don't own a television - instead, we read books together. I write stories with them. We play games. We go outside to the park. I spend a lot of time with them outside of work, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom.

At the same time, there are some things that they decide to do that are completely unacceptable. The oldest cannot hit her sister. It is unacceptable to throw toys at us when it's time to eat dinner and they don't like the food being served. It is unacceptable to steal toys from other children.

My wife and I try very hard not to become angry and blow up in these situations. We tell our children to go sit on the bed for a bit and think about what they've done. This also gives us time to cool off. Then we go in and sit down with them, explain to them that what they did was wrong, that it was hurtful, and that they ought not do it.

Sometimes that works.

Sometimes, they decide to start screaming at us.

Sometimes, they tell us they won't do it, again - and then they make it into a habit.

Any number of things can happen.

So sometimes, I have to sit them down again - and talk to them. And sometimes, we have to confiscate things. We have to discipline.

Our children are usually extremely well behaved. But when we do have to discipline them, they definitely think we're being mean. They think it's unfair. They think we're enforcing rules that just don't make sense.

Now, I'm completely willing to hear their side of the argument. I *want them* to tell me why they think I'm wrong, why they think they should be allowed to act as they have.

But ultimately, as the parents, I *do* have to make decisions - not only for their wellbeing, but also for the wellbeing of others. They simply cannot be allowed to harm others or take the possessions of others or things like that.

Am I mean to discipline? Am I mean to sit down and ""force"" them to have a conversation about these things?

I've been chastised by psychologists for my ""mean"" parenting before. Even though I'm quite certain I grant our kids a great deal more freedom than most parents probably do. I also expect them to act responsibly and loving toward others as a result of the freedom that's been granted to them. And I will not hesitate to speak with them about how we ought to act toward our fellow men and women.

Different kids require different parenting techniques, though. I think our approach to parenting is quite modest in terms of the discipline we actually mete out. I know others who have to be a bit heavier with the discipline. Some basically don't have to discipline their kids at all.

If I'm an adult, and I steal or harm another person, that will result in my own discipline. I am uncertain why such rules shouldn't apply (to some extent) within the household. I don't think that makes parents mean. That makes them good parents who are trying to raise decent human beings.

I would like to know what parents *should* be doing more than what people have a problem with them doing. And I'd like to know *specifics*. If they're suggesting that beating your kid is wrong - well, hell, I agree with that 100%. But if they're saying that even modest forms of discipline are ""mean"" - I absolutely disagree.

Anyway. Those are my thoughts. I don't think it's a very helpful article. I'd love to see something like this with real substance, though. It could be very interesting. ",2013-02-08 19:05:37

Translation provided by /u/paninomatic

""
**Lawsuit filed against rabbi for circumcising kids**
**Because of the circumcision of kids a doctor out of Hesse filed a lawsuit against a rabbi out of Hof. It seems to be the first lawsuit because of a religious circumcision in Bavaria.**

The prosecutor of Hof confirmed to the Bavarian broadcasting service that a doctor filed a lawsuit although the chief public prosecutor of Hof says it is still uncertain if it's going to be investigated. The rabbi learned about the lawsuit through the broadcasting service. He perceives it as ""anti-semitism"".

**Man already conducted 3,000 circumcisions**

On his web page the rabbi points out that circumcision is a Jewish ritual. He reports to already have conducted 3,000 circumcisions on kids and adults. He reports to the broadcasting service though, that the last circumcision in Hof has been done more than a year ago.

**Religious circumcision criticized**

According to information of the broadcasting service the doctor from Hesse is part of a group of about 600 medical professionals and lawyers which wrote an open letter to the federal government in July. In this letter they request to make the debate about religious circumcision more objective.

**Mental and physical damage**

The letter quotes: ""The freedom of religion can not be used as an excuse for the application of sexual force against minor males."" It further states that because of the high risks of lasting genital damage and mental and sexual impairments caused through circumcising babies and small children, the public perception has to be sharpened.

330,l6yek,False,,32,What do you guys think of the age of consent?,YouthRights,"I lost my virginity at 14, and when my parents found out, they threatened to put my boyfriend in jail. I still don't regret the decision, as I haven't gotten pregnant since then, and I feel I was mature enough to handle it.

I'm married now (to a different guy), but I'm still only 17, which means that technically my husband can be jailed for possessing nude pictures of me.

What does r/YouthRights think about this issue?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/l6yek/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_age_of_consent/,10,"I know this is an old thread, but you folks don't seem to have many readers or much activity, so I figure someone's still browsing it.

Are you in the US?  I thought that here in the States, at least, most of the states, you could not be legally married if you were under 18.

That's not to say you can't get married.  I mean, marriage is just a piece of paper, financial obligations, tax breaks and a metal band after all (unless you're of the religious influence I suppose?).  That just means that the state and federal governments would not recognize the marriage until both parties turn 18.  It probably doesn't affect either participant in the relationship, though, since most teens aren't full-time employees with a meaningful tax status.

As far as the age of consent, I lost my virginity before I was 17.  I think I was 15 or maybe 16?  Been a while...  Anyway, the age of consent isn't really something that's there to say ""you're ready for sex at 17.  No younger, no older.""  It's really there to keep pervs from abusing emotionally and mentally immature people.  Our brains develop, in some cases, into our early 20's, so it's fair to assume that the tip of the bell curve in means of emotional and intellectual maturity, someone who is 16 years old is immature and can be taken advantage of.

I don't see a problem with that part.  When people start abusing the system to put otherwise innocent people in jail, then it starts being an issue.  Unfortunately, if you are under 18 your parents can decide to press charges against your will.  That seems incorrect.  If the participants relative to the sexual relations decline the right to press charges, then the case should be tossed out.


A lot of folks have brought up voting as well.  I will say this:  my views turned around in my early twenties.  I mean, my views on basically everything.  Getting out of college and gaining some experience in the real world while making it on my own really taught me some things.  I do believe that teens don't have the real-world experience to sort out their thoughts yet, so maybe voting should remain delayed until you are 18.

In high school it's easy to form opinions on many things, but without actually experiencing those things you can't really have a true idea of what they are.  For example, as you will find out I'm sure, you can have the nicest, shiniest degree in your field along with a perfect 4.0 GPA and as more references than you can count, but it doesn't mean shit to anyone until you have some experience in your field.  

Learning about something does not make one an expert.  Learning about a thing only lends knowledge about its topic.  That knowledge was likely imbued with some sort of bias, since it was taught and not experienced.  Once you experience that thing for yourself, only then can you have a true feeling for what it envelopes and form your own, personal opinions.  

Like I said, my views have changed on EVERYTHING since I was a teenager and those alterations came from experience. ",2011-10-10 11:12:06

Update: My friend here got expelled from the school for the last suspension.  The youth in this country is fucked. This country is fucked.

This was the best subreddit I could find with a large audience base for this topic. I just want to spread awareness to the horrors that go on in schools of the good ol' USA. So here goes nothing

So my story begins with my freshman year. I get into high school and all is going well. I only have one person that bothers me at this point and its annoying but one person I can brush off. Well I was doing just that, minding [my own business](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#). Well this person in particular decided one day to take my phone and because I thought I had a tough lock screen password, I was wrong, he got into my phone and decided to show some of my nudes around to a few students in an attempt to say ""look, this kid is innocent. Don't trust him, he is a perv."" So I tried to get my phone back once I realized what he was doing because I was at that moment paying attention to my school work and not my phone because I wanted to get my work done (for once). Well one of the people that was unlucky enough to see my unbearable manhood, decided to report this incident to the office. Now I don't blame them, they were trying to report the person that took my phone because they were harassing me, they even told me this so I didn't hate them (you'll see why I might now). Well I get called down to the office and they ask me about these pictures and all. I'm not thinking that anything is going to happen to me at the moment because I didn't do anything. But after a few questions of the [incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#), the school SUSPENDED ME. the ""victim"" of this situation. Now i'm not one to pull the victim card because I hate that bs, but this time I was a tad angry. So I served a 3-day suspension and it went on my school record because someone that was harassing me, decided to get into my phone and wanted to make me look bad to everyone because they are a sad little soul. The individual that took my phone also faced 0 punishment for harassing me and taking my phone without my permission.

So there wasn't much I could do in that situation because they found a legal loophole in the handbook stating that I had child pornography in the school. EVEN though it was in my LOCKED phone. (and yes it was my nudes and 2 other peoples I had dated before). Well this was my first ever situation and it brought a shun upon me and I was pushed into the ""bad kid"" label.

But now i am currently a sophomore in this high school. My grades have been at there lowest point because through other events in my life, I have just been in a state of mind I never would wish upon my worst enemy. Well the 2nd incident that has just happened (currently still suspended) has not helped with this and now I am even more shunned and the school officials and the students have started to take a disliking in me because I keep being reported and suspended for dumb shit. But my 2nd story is a little longer so grab a drink and sit back and witness the destruction of my high school career because of sensitive snowflakes.

I have to start with this by stating that I and my friends are known to be the edgy group and really out there with shit (I just don't get offended or hurt over vulgar jokes or content). And I understand that the school has guidelines and not everyone can find either humor or ""shock value"" in things that are really out there. With that said, this is why I have become part of certain groups and friends with certain people for the edgy talks and edgy jokes, so this way I don't have to offend anyone because it is within our group and our standards to not care about certain shit because we have all agreed it does not bother us.

Well even though that is the case, our humor outreached to certain individuals (maybe because my 2 friends in this situation were being loud and obnoxious about their edgy jokes that honestly in this case were in poor taste and I only laughed at the remarks because It was so cringey.

Before I get ahead of myself, the remarks in this situation were made toward a teacher that so happened to be in line of view at that moment (also just happened to be female which didn't help in 2019). My friend T started to make jokes about ripping and maiming this individual teacher and raping her and then climbing into her dead remains. I'm summarizing but they went into gruesome detail for shock value. Then my friend J chimed in for the cringe. Again the way they did it and dragged on for 5 minutes, the only laughter came from the cringey aspect of the ""jokes."" I will also add that we do not hate females, we fully support equality between all walks of life, we are just edgy 16 year olds and find ways to joke for shock value, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I will also say that we have said these types of things about males and females in the school (mainly to the annoying people) but i've remarked about ripping a dudes spine out with a sickle and he heard me and did not care, he actually chimed in on the joke saying that he would rip out both of my testicles if he had a sickle and proceeded to laugh and we moved on, its what civil people do. And I understand in 2019 that things have to be taken seriously and my friends know that and understood why they were suspended, keyword is ""they.""

Well this remark about this teacher was reported to the office and both my friend T and J were suspended and they really do not care. For now, i'll explain at the end. They were questioned and because the remarks were made at our lunch table and there is a camera right above us, they confirmed with the gestures they were making. No one tried to sugar coat things or lie because it just didn't matter to them.

(keep in mind that this was a joke that was brought up right then and there for the shock value, it was not a planned thing or an actual attempt to do anything to anyone because we just don't have the [stomach](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/avht7s/the_horrors_of_high_school/#) or heart to hurt anyone in a gruesome way like that.

779,7p02ys,False,,3,"France banned child beauty pageants because they ""hypersexualize girls from a young age."" Should we ban Mall Santas because they deceive children and perpetuate a culture wherein children are seen as gullible and incompetent?",YouthRights,"Everybody was okay with France's decision to ban beauty pageants for children. Why wouldn't we be okay with banning Mall Santas?

Children believe in Santa Claus not because they're too stupid to realize that a fat bearded old man couldn't possibly go through their chimney and leave presents under a tree. No. Children believe in Santa Claus because *we, the adults, told them so.* And children trust us. Why wouldn't they? We give them food, shelter, baths, clothing, gifts, care, love... Why would they have the slightest reason to believe we are lying to them?

Yet, despite our obsession with having honest people in power, it is the cultural norm to lie to children about a whole lot of things. Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, the stork... Sometimes things that weren't supposed to be believed in as true enter the mix: Cartoons, movies, books... I've seen some people on reddit fake a Hogwarts letter for their children when they become 11, as happens in the Harry Potter books. I believed cartoon characters actually existed when I was a kid, and was confused why wouldn't they ever visit us. Again, nobody told me the truth.

Telling the truth to children is seen as a gross, even immoral act. People who do so are seen as the bad people in the story, and the liars are praised as ""defenders of childhood."" I guess some who hear my opinion on this would have thought ""Okay, I wouldn't lie to my kid about Santa, but I would not tell them about sex and reproduction. They are not ready for it! They will be too scared!"" Well, weren't YOU scared when the Snowden NSA leaks happened? Would you prefer to never have learned about it? Of course not, *because being scared is part of being informed of unpleasant truths.* ""Oh, but let they grow up a little before we tell them! Don't tell them while they're too young!"" They start asking ""where do babies come from?"" from a very young age. If you have a ""full honesty"" policy when it comes to adults, why wouldn't you have one for children? Yes, they might cry, but so do many children at any age when it comes to these certain unpleasant truths about life. Heck, some *adults* aren't informed about some of them. Weren't you scared when you learned that the Sun is going to become a Red Giant and swallow the Earth one day? Doesn't it give you an existential crisis to think that we may not live forever? One way or the other, there will (or not) be some kind of suffering when we realize the truth. It's part of philosophy.

Perpetuating a culture of lying to children is part of the ""extension of childhood"" that many Youth Rights writers talk about. (I'm thinking of Robert Epstein and John Taylor Gatto.) It makes society see children as too incompetent or incapable of reason to have rights and responsibilities, and thus we don't give them such rights and responsibilities. This manifests itself in many things:

1) Authoritarian parenting -- a style of parenting wherein the parent believes that the child's desires, thoughts, ideas, and wishes don't matter because they, the parents, are superior to them, and that therefore it's better for the (allegedly) superior adult to make the decisions instead of the (allegedly) inferior child, even when these decisions can perfectly be done by the child. (Subverted by authoritative and peaceful parenting styles, including Taking Children Seriously, where force is avoided in the decisions affecting the child.)

2) Traditional, compulsory schooling -- the legally-enforced style of education wherein the students should be submissive to their adults superiors, and don't have any decisive power over their own education. (Subverted by self-directed education, where the responsibility over their own education is returned to the children, either in a democratic schools such as Sudbury Valley School wherein they have the same decision power as the adult members of the school, or in unschooling, a kind of homeschooling wherein the parents allow their children to pursue their own interests, at their own time, at their own pace. (Shoutout to /r/unschool, where both are discussed, and where I wrote many articles similar to this one. Shoutout also to [the Alliance for Self-Directed Education](https://www.self-directed.org/), a non-profit organization recently launched for advocating for this. One of its founding members, Dr. Peter Gray, also writes regularly about the subject.)

3) Legal discrimination -- If you're in this subreddit, you're likely to be aware of it. Children can't drive and can't vote, no matter how smart or skillful they are, because of the belief that they're too incompetent for this. Robert Epstein writes that a child has twice as many restrictions as a convicted felon. (You can elaborate more on this in the comments, I don't feel very comfortable writing about drugs and sex, for example. That would be too progressive for people outside the community to accept.)

4) Overall prejudice against children in society -- Ever heard people say, ""Stop being so childish""? What about ""This is so bad, it looks like a 5-year-old did it""? I'm sorry, but children can be as competent as adults, no matter what age, as long as they work on it. A 12-year-old with 5 years experience is still more experienced than a 35-year-old with 3 years experience. **Age does not cause experience. Experience causes experience.**

That's it. So, what do you think? Should we ban Mall Santas?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/7p02ys/france_banned_child_beauty_pageants_because_they/,2,"Ok, teenagers aren't children, they are young adults. I agree, there is nothing wrong with telling a child the truth about: sexual reproduction, Santa Claus, and so on. Then they are informed. 
But as for teenagers, THEY ARE NOT CHILDREN! They are really suffering here. And one more thing: Every child is different.
They deserve the truth. And yes Peter Gray is good too. I'll cover drugs and sex for you: (this is about teenagers) 
When you start puberty, that’s when you are an adult. Teens are post pubescent, that means they have finished puberty, and are sexually mature. We are prolonging childhood. We pretend that our teens are still kids. Once a mammal reaches puberty, they aren’t a child. But we still love to lie to our teens and call them kids, when we know that deep down, they aren’t kids, they are young adults. With goats, a kid is prepubescent and adults post pubescent. No middle stage. Because there isn’t one, the adolescent is a 20th century myth, it dates back to 1902, created by the school system at the beginning of the industrial revolution. This is ageism. Read Robert Epstein's Teen 2.0, he explains this better than I can. They are adults. And don’t give me that teen brain shit, there is no evidence of there being anything wrong with the teenage brain. This is all big pharma. Give young people full adult rights, this is discrimination. Robert Epstein explains this. LIVE AND LET LIVE. ",2018-01-08 17:30:08

618,7z9ggt,False,,0,Letter to the Youth of the Nation and World,YouthRights,"**Addressed to all it may concern, of the youth of the United States, and of the world,**

We must now change the way we run the government, of not just this nation, but all the nations and states of all this planet. Our skills and talents, that may be put forth in the halls of government, in the embassies and envoys of diplomacy, and in the skyscrapers of business, as youth, are being squandered on this Earth. We cannot use these talents the better the world as we should, instead we are regulated to backwash.
 
Schooled, no matter if we need it or not, and never in the way of our personal choice. We are not given a voice to choose leaders that might change the legislation to keep us safe from harm in these schools. We don't even get to choose the members of the municipal, county, and state school boards, that, with a single vote, could significantly alter our daily lives. 

We are denied freedom to travel alone, we are denied the freedom to congregate without supervision, or past certain times of the day. And we are denied the right to vote for our leaders or hold the offices ourselves. For surely, the adults say, 'only mature adults may hold these high offices of power and prestige, for youth could not handle the pressure', which they say for their own hubris's sake indeed. For we have at our even highest office, in this nation, a feckless, egotistical, and power-hungry leader, that if we replaced with a three-year old, we would note a great improvement. 

And is this their grand example, is this who they put forth as a person worthy to lead what, arguably, is the most powerful nation conceived on the face of this planet? For if that is indeed the case, I could present ten, nor, twenty, so called 'minors', not even past the age of eighteen, some not even past the age of sixteen, that would be a more effective, righteous, and worthy leader of the nation as a whole. 

And they say, 'surely only adults to vote, because children are too incompetent to do so', which again I say, they proclaim for their own heightened hubris and pride. For if you do not allow all those under the age of eighteen not to vote, just because some of them are undereducated or incompetent, neither should all of those over the age of eighteen, for indeed, many so called 'adults' that are over the age of eighteen, of voting age that is, are too unintelligent and lack the knowledge that a voter should truly pertain. 

Therefore, my friends, my brethren, we must take a stand. We must rise to take what is properly ours. Or else, fall into the pits of oppression and of helplessness. We must not fear this change, we must not fear the speech, the protest, and the petitions that we shall send forth to win our freedom justly and fairly. For it has been said by many, that fear has two meanings. F.E.A.R., Fear Everything And Run, or Face Everything And Rise. The choice is yours to make, make it wisely. 

**Yours in the Cause of Brother and Sisterhood,**

This seems to be a retreat rather than an advance.

Surely mobile phone providers are culpable for leaving an entire generation of children vulnerable to social manipulation.

I know the National Youth Rights Association, but it seems to not be leveraging a great deal of influence. It has poorly functioning website, and seems to be primarily for disseminating information. 

Where are our Super PACs, our lobbyists? What politicians answer to our movement?

People like Mark Zuckerburg and Elon Munsk became successful when they were young. They know what it is like to overcome adultism. How can we make people like them pay into a public presence for our cause?

Business should be supporting us too, for their own interests as well as ours. For example, if minors could open up their own bank accounts, the banks would be able to compete for their patronage and brand loyalty. Minors would get financial independence, banks would get customers; everybody would win.

Youth rights is unpopular. If we are going get into the mainstream, we need real capital, real power. Lets discuss how to get these things.

if you can be tried as an adult,why don't you have the same rights as an adult? It's ESPECIALLY hypocritical because of ""underage"" drinking,sex,etc laws,school laws,etc
 UPDATE:I was thinking of how an everyday person would respond to this. They'd probably say something like, ""Young people are more likely to ruin their lives(when drinking, having sex, or dropping out), than to make good choices with those freedoms,"" or something like, ""Not killing is easier to mentally process than properly drinking, fucking, or working.""
Or they'd mention the lack of a frontal lobe guaranteeing recklessness or something. But, if our brains were supposed to primarily do bad, then wouldn't we be described as just not knowing better (like younger kids), thus shouldn't be tried as adults?

So they know that reckless brain shit is false and we are capable of being responsible with freedom/ deciding to or not to wreck havoc with our lives and others, but are we not allowed to express that responsibility along with having the consequences of raping, murdering, etc?

Why the heck are the laws so inconsistent? We are adults who know not to harm others and can be jailed for doing so, but are also just children who can't possibly know how to drink (or do anything considered dangerous) safely?

We can mentally process not bringing danger to others, but apparently we can't process how to not danger ourselves?

493,111p1v,False,,11,Discrimination Experiment,YouthRights,"As you all probably know already, reddit has a bit of a problem when it comes to discrimination. Ageism is as usual the most socially acceptable form of irrational sweeping discrimination. Offending users do not even feel the need to be subtle about it. The next type is sexism, though this tends to take on more subtle forms. Racism appears to be rare outside of dedicated joke subreddits like /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, but occasionally there *will* be a racial generalization circlejerk that hits the frontpage. I hardly see any homophobia, but I do remember seeing some vitriol directed to the T in LGBT. I don't see much serious ableism going on, but occasionally redditors will use words like ""retard"" as a synonym for stupid.

So to help people recognize discrimination of the nature they often overlook, I will try an experiment. I will transpose the overlooked discrimination with another type of discrimination that appears more blatant and offensive. Here a couple examples.

Original:

>I am so sick of all these teenagers degrading the quality of content here.

Transposed:

>I am so sick of all these *blacks* degrading the quality of content here.

Original:

>Frankly, only pussies would like this shit. Seriously, how retarded do you have to be to hop on this bandwagon?

Transposed:

>Frankly, only *chinks* would like this shit. Seriously, how *homosexual* do you have to be to hop on this bandwagon?",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/111p1v/discrimination_experiment/,6,"Comparisons like this just tend to send people into rage mode and cause them to stop listening. It's obvious to you and me that discrimination is bad, but you need to be a bit more subtle if you want to convert others.

For instance, a homosexual who is ageist would probably get really mad at you for daring to compare ageism to homophobia. But you might have better luck if, for example, you pointed out that parents are still legally able to punish their children for being gay.

So, I admire your enthusiasm, but at the very least you're wasting your time; at the most you might actually be hurting the cause. ",2012-10-06 16:39:00

I'm a 20-year-old university student. I've always felt young people are treated unfairly, even in otherwise progressive communities. 

As a kid, I wrote a series of blog posts explaining my views on youth rights, but I never published them. Every time I dig up those files, I expect to be embarrassed by how I wrote and what I thought. But instead I'm blown away. The points are still relevant and the writing is still lucid. Maybe *I* need to work on not underestimating kids!

So I finally started a blog at [https://niknoble.com/](https://niknoble.com/). I plan on releasing all the posts I wrote as a teenager, one each Monday at 8 AM CDT. When I run out, I'll start posting new content. Right now, I've only uploaded my first post ever: [https://niknoble.com/2018/09/24/oppressed/](https://niknoble.com/2018/09/24/oppressed/).

I’m asking for your vote for the Green Party because we have stood tirelessly for fair and equal elections, social justice, LGBT rights, environmentalism, economic policies focused on helping the average individual, and an intelligent foreign policy. The Green Party has elected 2 past Prime Ministers and has a strong and active showing on the Model House of Commons.

I hope you take a brief moment of your time to help our subreddit continue to function, since we run off of the votes of the public. While it is just a simulation, this of course is very real and very enjoyable for all of us, and your time is a huge help. Every vote matters!

446,hv478,False,,3,Minnesota town considers installing anti-youth screeching machine; NYRA gears up to fight,YouthRights,"**The original article:**

The southeastern Minnesota town of Hastings may try to solve a vandalism problem in an out-of-the way park by installing a noise machine to repel teenagers.

The city is considering installing the SonicScreen technology in Cari Park, a frequent target for vandals who are assumed to be teenagers.

SonicScreen emits a high-pitched screech at a frequency young people can hear but older folks with less-sensitive hearing can’t.

“For young people, it sounds like 15 or 20 people dragging their nails down a chalkboard,” said Jeff Webber, owner of Webber Recreational Design, which would install the device.

Webber told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that if Hastings installs the SonicScreen — made by MiracleTech Security of New Jersey — it would be the first such system installed in Minnesota.

The technology is similar to devices designed to repel rodents by emitting noises at frequencies humans can’t hear.

Shilpi Banerjee, president of the Minnesota Academy of Audiologists, said SonicScreen works because most adults start to lose their high-frequency hearing in their 20s.

Hastings Park and Recreation director Barry Bernstein said Cari Park has been frequent target for vandals. The park is surrounded by homes so police officers it can’t see it from the street. It has no lights.

Vandals have scrawled graffiti on equipment, defecated in the play tunnels and set fire to one of the structures. Bernstein said the city is installing new playground equipment and wants to protect it.

Bernstein also is considering lights, video surveillance and even a machine that would shout at trespassers who tripped a motion detector.

“It could say something like, `Hey, you aren’t supposed to be here!”‘ he said.

But the SonicScreen is the most high-tech solution on the table, even if there’s a low-tech way to beat it. When asked if vandals could just wear earplugs, Webber paused and said, “I imagine that would work.”

But that would require planning — something most vandals don’t do, he said. “Vandalism is typically a spur-of-the-moment decision,” Webber said. “There is not a lot of forethought.”

The city parks and recreation commission is expected to vote on the matter June 14 and forward its recommendation to the full City Council.

**NYRA's response, sent to town officials and written about in the local paper;**

Dear Mr. Bernstein,

I read with dismay this morning that your department is considering installing a ""SonicScreen"" device with the purpose of preventing vandalism at Cari Park in Hastings. This device, and others with similar function, unabashedly discriminate on the basis of age. I do not mean to deter you from preventing vandalism in your community and appreciate that you're pursuing innovative methods - but discriminating against an entire group of people based on the actions of individuals is prejudicial and not the proper way to address issues like vandalism. Despite the actions of a select few, teenagers are not pests to be repelled.

There is no evidence that these devices actually work to deter crime, nor has your department shown sufficient evidence that the culprits in this instance are, in fact, teenagers. Furthermore, the discriminatory device runs afoul of the spirit of Minnesota's Human Rights Law.

These devices lack precision and can effect a wide variety of innocents. In particular, autistic children and children with special hearing needs will be needlessly asaulted by this sonic weapon. Even though I am supposedly over the required age I can usually hear these devices. There is no guarantee that this device will deter any vandals while there is guarantee that countless citizens will be adversely affected. Should you choose to install this device it will be particularly egregious since you will be violating the civil rights of a group of people who had no say in the decision.

Last fall, my organization ran a successful campaign to remove a similar device, this one called ""the Mosquito,"" from the Gallery Place Metro Station in Washington, DC. Ultimately, the DC Office of Human Rights determined that the device was discriminatory and illegal. It is my hope that your office will make a just decision on this matter.

534,7zsiaq,False,,7,Am I being discriminated against?,YouthRights,"There is this policy in my school (Which is in Iowa) that bans international students from dating. This is very odd. In our Host Family Agreement, (which international students make with the school and the host family) it says:"" there is no dating"". It is said by our international student program coordinators that the actions of breaking the rules can end up in expulsion from the school. 
  There are a few problems with this policy: 1.The American students are not subject to this rule (They are able to date). The international students are distinguished although we are enrolled in the same school. (We don't have the same right) 

  To offer you opinions from my school. Here is one of the coordinators' responses to the dating policy for international students:  
  In answer to your questions, we have several policies specialized to International Students and living with Host Families.  You can check it out here:
  The students, their families, and the host families sign this before the year begins and all of our students knew this was a Christian school with policies in place and they did agree to attend with these requirements.  All people have “rights” but as Christians, we believe that “all things are permissible, but not all things are beneficial”.  We have looked at the policies of other private schools in the US also as we considered our Host Family Agreement.
  Our policies have been in place for five years and we feel they are there for the good of all the students and host families.  Just like any educational institution, there are cases in which students have pushed the issue and had consequences if the actions were not following this Agreement.

  The dating policy was based on the belief that you would only date someone you believe you would marry someday.   Students who do date at PCHS are under the guidance of loving parents.  This puts an enormous burden on the host family to be responsible for the dating life of a young person because it could involve this person’s future and yet another student’s life- the person they choose to date.  We suggest that if an international student cares more deeply for another student it would be wise to get to know them in a group setting as a friend.  After high school, if those feelings are still present and mutual, dating could be considered.

  I believe that serious dating is difficult at the high school level because many students are not yet socially, emotionally and spiritually mature.  Also, many of our international students do not profess to be Christians and that makes for concerns from our beliefs.   (2 Cor 6:14)  Marriage is difficult already and now add different cultures, teenagers who may not even know who they are or teenagers who are not responsible for themselves (let alone responsible for another person and possibly a child)  We want to honor God most of all with our marriages and that takes two committed people that are like-minded in the big issues of life.  It is God’s love that unites and sustains two people for years of faithfulness.  

  We allow our students to experience the cultural art of a date by attending the Christmas Banquet or Junior Senior Banquet with a date.

474,2gicnk,False,,13,High School should not require a specific set of classes.,YouthRights,"I would like to preface this by saying that I am currently a college student who has suffered through all of the useless classes which are required in high school.

By the time a student reaches high school, they already know how to read, write, and do simple math. So thus, while core classes should still be offered, they should be optional. One of the most useless classes which I was ever forced to take in high school was Geometry. I am well aware that some people love math, but I am not one of those people. My favorite class was Social Studies, but I am well aware that there are many students who hated social studies as much as I hated math.

My solution is to make all classes optional and allow students to choose the classes which they want to take. Many people will argue that ""a person needs math in case they want to be an engineer."" But a simple response to that common argument is that if a student wants to be an engineer, than they should take math, if they don't want to be an engineer they don't have to take math.

Another argument which I foresee many people making is that ""you need to take core classes to get into a good college."" While some colleges do have strict admissions requirements, many colleges do not. In the United States of America, as long as you graduate high school, you will get into college, even if its not a ""good"" college.

On a side note, I would like to point out that almost all colleges have general education requirements, which is why it lasts for four years. Colleges should also eliminate general education requirements.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/2gicnk/high_school_should_not_require_a_specific_set_of/,6,">Many people will argue that ""a person needs math in case they want to be an engineer."" 

I don't think this is the argument at all.  Rather, the argument is that we live in a world that is often times describe best using mathematical tools.  Thus, if we are going to equip children to best handle the world that they find themselves in, we should teach them math.

The idea of K-12 education is to provide the students with a basic set of tools for approaching the world.  Math is a key tool -- and geometry a key component of that toolbox.  

In the same way, reading and writing are very basic tools for the modern world. 

It is very difficult to imagine a situation where you will not require reading and writing -- and the better you read and write the better off you will be in *almost* any job.

The same goes for math.  It may be hard to believe, being as young as you are (assuming, from the fact you are in college), but basically *every* job is helped by an understanding of mathematics.  And in the real world, which appears to be 3-dimensional, geometry is a great tool to have.   ",2014-09-15 23:44:59

155,gqhjuf,False,,4,"My Abuser Caused Me Brain Damage, But I Couldn't Get Out bc It Wasn't Illegal",YouthRights,"I (34f) had a really terrible childhood, mostly being terrorized and harassed a lot by my father, who would rage at me, yelling and spitting through his teeth right in my face, while he physically restrained me. I used to cry about going to school, saying I didn't have friends and was lonely. He would take these vulnerable moments to explain to me that I didn't have friends because no one liked me, because I wasn't a person that people could like. When I was 13, I asked him why he hated me. He said it started when I was 9, and he saw me struggling to keep up running with the other girls on the field, and he just realized that I was gross and embarrassing or something, so he hated me. For more context on that, I was struggling to run because I had asthma. It is a cheap and easy disease to treat, but my dad just honestly interpreted my lung issues and allergies as me being annoying and fat and just a nuisance or something. I didn't see an asthma specialist until I was about 16, and when I did, he told me that I was looking at ending up in a wheelchair before turning 30. Luckily, that didn't happen, I'm 34 and can jog better than I could as a kid, but I just include it to highlight the abnormal level of neglect to my lungs. I think the doctor was actually shocked, and kind of didn't know how I was walking. 

When I was 14, a teacher called CPS, and they came out to see me. They told me if my life was shitty it was my fault and I had to fix it myself. Then they told my mom that she wasn't being a disciplinarian, and that I needed boundaries. After realizing that CPS couldn't help me, I ran away from home at 14. During that time, I was raped, sexually mistreated, abused, exploited, etc., I don't know how many times, because I had to trade sex for shelter. It was kind of stressful and terrifying as well because I was in a dangerous city with a high violent crime rate, and around the type of guys who would hook up with 14 year olds, ie depraved scumbag criminals who literally don't care how they behave or what they do. But even fearing the types of neighborhoods I was in, and the types of guys I was around, it was still a breath of fresh air compared to living with my father. 

When the girl I ran away from home with got picked up by the cops, I got scared to do it all on my own, and I got scared that they'd take me to jail. So I called my mom and she picked me up and brought me home. 

After that I was totally mentally broken, depressed, crazy, gained a lot of weight, my lungs got super messed up (as I mentioned above), I was smoking cigarettes on top of not being able to breathe just because I was so disconnected from my body, pain, and survival instincts; I was terribly bullied in school because of how messed up in physical appearance and mental health I'd become. I also had to attend an alternative school, where I received basically no education. I'd always tested in the 95th percentile and above in English and a couple other subjects (can't remember, but it wasn't math lol) when we did standardized testing in elementary school, and maybe up to about the 7th grade. I remember they had me take the PSAT's in 7th grade, and the counselor told me I'd done 'very well.' I remember her staring at me like I was a total freak that scared her when she told me I'd done 'very well' -- because here I was the psycho kid who still peed their pants in middle school, and was always crying and acting strange, plus a child of color, and I think it didn't make sense to her that I was testing better than all the nice, white, healthy, good kids. I just remember her face was like startled and horrified, like she was actually scared of me for finding out that I wasn't severely cognitively impaired as I must've looked, but I was actually a very cognizant and mentally aware human being. I think it was terrifying to her like finding out the tortured lab monkey is totally mentally present, speaks English, and can read, speak, and reason an advanced level. 

But that didn't really continue. From that point, around 12, my intellectual development began to slip. I quit trying in school, and ended up at an alternative school. I did not receive an education there.

Anyway... in retrospect, now I see that by the time I was 9 I had childhood bipolar disorder, except it wasn't diagnosed til I was about 25. It took me a long time to get any effective treatment. I've spent years on disability, being unable to work. Due to disability-induced poverty, trouble connecting in romantic relationships, and being way too fucking tired to do homelessness actually, I ended up moving back into my abuser's house in my mid-twenties while I tried to sort things out and get help for my psychiatric issues. It was fucking hell to get help. Everything I tried ended up making things worse or having some sort of adverse reaction, or just did nothing to help. I saw horrible community clinic psychiatrists because of poverty and being on Medicaid. But finally I just decided that I was going to look up the best psychiatrists in my area and pay out of pocket to see one. Then finally with someone who wasn't just trying to drug me into catatonic stupor with antipsychotics, and irresponsibly raise my antidepressants (these cause bipolar mania) when I complained of anxiety, I started to finally kind of get a handle on some things for myself. And even work a bit.  

Anyway, I just found out this week that bipolar disorder -- especially with childhood onset, and a more severe and difficult course with it -- is strongly correlated to the type of abuse I suffered. That there's basically a dose-dependent causal effect between traumatic childhood emotional abuse and the development of bipolar disorder. 

I always instinctively knew that my father's abuse of me was giving me nervous breakdowns as a child, and that it had led to one horrible development in my life after another, that so many horror stories in my life, and difficulties in my psychological development, have their etiologies in my father's bizarre obsessive will to daily hurt my feelings and mentally and physically dominate and terrorize me, yet in a way that stopped short apparently of anything CPS would recognize as abuse. He didn't molest me and he didn't punch me. He terrorized the fuck out of me however, daily tormented and brutalized me, completely fucked me up in the head, and basically ruined my life, like... I'm still struggling with a lot of things and I'm 34. I almost can't even believe that when I type it. It's surreal to me. And the thing that's so upsetting to me, I guess, is how easily he got away with it. 

I really want this to change. I think dependent minors need so much more protection and recognition for their humanity. Quality of life doesn't start mattering when you're an adult; it always matters. And being safe in your home, being listened to when you say you need help to get out of an abusive situation... I don't know. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm a little scatterbrained and falling asleep a bit. 

But it's really important to me that childhood verbal and emotional abuse is articulated as a social problem, and that social change and social movements start occurring, as well as changes to laws.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/gqhjuf/my_abuser_caused_me_brain_damage_but_i_couldnt/,14,You are a beloved child of God.

Well, I have occupied my entire time focusing on how to expand youth rights, spoken and gotten the written support of several politicians, and has bring together several youth rights organizations to unite in favor of the Youth Rights Cause.

Now, it's time that I look to a brighter future. A future filled with joy and happiness, and a National Youth Rights Campaign filled with support and dedication. That's what I have been planning for, and will start doing this year. Come on people, are we all in support of youth rights? Do we all want to see the expansion of it? Because it's easy to write a post saying you support it! So are you down with me? If you aren't, don't bother replying, if you are, here's the ball plan folks. 

We are going to cut the crap and get to work. No more play time. We will start focusing on what's important and start a successful campaign! Now, we will start by raising funds against ageism and age discrimination, recruit volunteers and staff, and throughout 2015, we will peacefully fight for youth rights! Lobby! Protest! Walk-outs! Student empowerment, whatever interests you! 

Now, there is no central or hierarchical leadership to this campaign or body. Everyone is in control of what happens with the movement. There will simply be campaign managers and staff, but everyone controls their piece of the battle. It's time to do something! Rather than talk and play around about youth rights folks!

912,x7avr,False,,0,ephebiphobia in insect nomenclature,YouthRights,"The phrase ""antlion larva"" is curiously redundant. The [antlion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlion) is named for ambushing ants, which most species do only as a larva. As Wikipedia notes, ""Strictly speaking, the term 'antlion' applies to the larval form of the members of this family, but while several languages have their own terms for the adult, there is no widely used word for them in English."" Yet the phrase persists, when it would be much more natural to consider the larva the normal form and the adult the unusual form.

This mindset is also applied to other insects like the [moth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth) and [crane fly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly), where the adult form can be so short-lived as to lack a functional mouth entirely. To consider the crane fly larva a mere transitory phase would be as unusual as referring to human adults as ""unbent senior citizens"". Simpler to refer to the leatherjacket and adult leatherjacket.

I am almost certainly making too much of this, but it reminded me of the sexist tendency in medicine to consider female health the unusual case when most humans are female.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/x7avr/ephebiphobia_in_insect_nomenclature/,0,,2012-07-26 18:30:46
