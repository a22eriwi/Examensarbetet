907,90s6ss,False,,23,Closing out Cancer season and hello Leo season!,astrology,"Wow. Cancer season was a ride, right? Cancers are the mothers of the zodiac and ruled by the moon. We have all been asked to see ourselves for what we really are. The mother is sometimes tough love. Where do you need to be better? Hopefully the Capricorn full moon shed some light on what you need to let go of so you can keep moving forward toward your higher self. That one was conjunct Pluto as well. Oof. Deep digging way down in the underworld of your psyche. I know some of you love that spooky shit lol, but some of us... damn.

That eclipse. The eclipse/new moon in Cancer. Where do you need to mother yourself better? Are you taking care of yourself? Are you punishing yourself for something bad you did a long time ago that you haven't let go of yet? Take the last bit of cancer season to flush out your emotional wounds with salt water. Our bodies are 70% salt water. We all possess the healing power of salt water within us. 

Many people feel bad. I feel bad too sometimes. All this retrograde action, the eclipses, transiting Pluto is conjunct my natal moon right now, retrograde Mars is conjunct my natal Saturn. It's a tough time for everyone. But now, it's time. Cancer season has washed you off with the ocean and this is who you are. 

This is who you are and now it'll be Leo season. If there's one thing you can learn from a Leo, it's how to use your heart to live your life out loud. It's how to be the most genuine, most authentic version of yourself and it's time to fall in love with that person. Whatever you found out about yourself in Cancer season IS YOU. And this is what you have to work with. Use your heart. Do what you love and keep doing that thing. Open your heart to everything and everyone. Keep what makes you happy. Accept yourself for who you are and work to make yourself better. Ask yourself, ""is this really who I am?"". Most of all, have fun! Leo season is homecoming for the sun. No more deep dark moody times. Everything is about to get light-hearted and joyful. Don't miss it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/90s6ss/closing_out_cancer_season_and_hello_leo_season/,104,what a great post üíõ ,2018-07-21 20:17:12
817,fcyfdq,False,,123,astrology and the COVID-19 virus,astrology,"well i‚Äôve been following this train of thought and i wanna hear what everyone else thinks about this. i‚Äôm not sure if this is insensitive..? so do let me know if it is.

but i feel like the coronavirus has some Saturn energy tied to it because of the vengeful nature that it has. because saturn is known for being karmic etc etc and for repaying what people give out. i‚Äôm not saying all the patients got it because of karma, what i‚Äôm saying is that the biggest stories that surface about the virus and the groups involved tend to have some sort of lesson to be learned from it.

for example, in singapore, there was some christian church group who talked mad shit about the coronavirus being some sort of ‚Äúdivine retribution‚Äù like a punishment from God because of the growing LGBTQ+ support in the country. and IRONICALLY, a while later, the group contracted said virus, and it spread to many members of the church. it was like a talk shit get hit kind of situation.

then, there was a korean christian cult that was rather notorious and they experienced the same thing. where a woman literally refused treatment to spread it to the rest of the cult because she believed that they were the chosen ones to go to heaven or something like that. don‚Äôt quote me lol.

there have been a few more instances of stuff like this that i‚Äôll get into if requested, because it‚Äôs a lot. and very complex too, and i‚Äôm a little too tired to type it all out.

can anyone give any insight into the karmic energy attached to the coronavirus? according to the timeline i think also the virus might have been born during Capricorn season, which is ruled by Saturn.

would love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts!",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fcyfdq/astrology_and_the_covid19_virus/,114,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

274,gc7mcd,False,,145,chat application that matches you based on astrological signs,astrology,"Hey everyone! 

I posted about creating an app where you can make friends a while ago on here lol. I thought of maybe having an algorithm where you can be matched with people who have compatible inner planets with you? This option can be turned off as well. You would also be matched with other things about yourself too!

Good idea or bad idea? Feel free to say what you think and why :).

I also want to reallyyyy avoid it being used as a dating app, its focus will be on making lasting friendships.

I'm new to coding, so the app will probably take a couple of years to put out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/gc7mcd/chat_application_that_matches_you_based_on/,331,"If you‚Äôre talking about something complex, that makes sense, but if it‚Äôs sun signs, I‚Äôll pass.

508,fe3eia,False,,27,JoJo (Singer) And the Blessing of the Saturn Return.,astrology,"Edit: Posted this on Twitter and JoJo read and responded! She found it fascinating and loves astrology ü•∞‚ú®


Random but it had to be written. UPROXX recently uploaded a short documentary on JoJo and it resonated so well with what I saw in her chart, rated AA. 

At 13, JoJo experienced massive success (2nd house profection year, hers ruled by expansive Jupiter, which trines her MC--more on that later), but was subsequently held hostage by a greedy (and now defunct) music label. As a result, she couldn't release music for more than a decade.

JoJo is an Aquarius Rising, and her Saturn is at 24 degrees of Capricorn, placing it in the 12th. When the ruling planet of the ASC is averse or ""hidden"" from the ASC, a theme of ""delay"" can prevail, as the steersman of your ship cannot see where it is going. Very frustrating. In JoJo's case, it is further compounded by the fact that her ASC ruler *is* the planet of delay and restriction. And that is further compounded by the fact that its a 12th house placement of loss. Whew!

In the midst of recording additional songs, her label dissolved (12th), yet she was still bound (Saturn) by the terms in her contract. She continued to record music but was not allowed to release any of it. **We need to note that JoJo has a massive 12th house Capricorn stellium--Mercury RX, Venus, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and NN.** That she was forced into relative obscurity reinforces 12th house themes of things hidden, things ending, doing things in secret. Music studios are also the 12th house--forced creative isolation. She remarked in the documentary that she would constantly read articles that proclaimed she must have died. She recalled how frustrating it was to see musicians who started after her start to pass and out-succeed her. (Personally, this is such a huge Saturn struggle. It is the bane of my existence. Anyway....)

JoJo has Neptune and Venus closely conjunct in the 12th. In the documentary, she was gaslit into taking medication to make her thinner, under the guise that her label just wanted her to be ""healthy"". The fogginess of Neptune playing out next to her creative planet, Venus, is also indicative of being sold a bill of goods that never comes to be. In the beginning, she was very glamourized by Hollywood, private jets, opening for Usher, etc.--but when the fog settled, she was completely and utterly screwed by signing that contract: Mercury RX in the 12th. RX Mercury begs of you to dive into the details, to double check, to be sure, transit or natal. And music contracts are complicated and obtuse already. Placed in the 12th, she became a victim of her own pen. (Not blaming her, by the way.)

What ensued were years of substance abuse, another 12th house theme, especially with Venus ad Neptune co present. Unable to release or perform music, JoJo became ""a shell of herself"" and had to be ""buzzed"" in order to function. Only the realization that her dad was an addict (who died of his addiction it seemed--went to sleep and never woke up) snapped her back into reality, and she begun to take control. She hired a lawyer and became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with her former label. Her Venus, in the 12th and conj. Neptune, rules her 9th house Libra of contracts, law, legal endeavors. So she was in for an uphill battle. But she has Mars square her ASC, which, yes, can render one a victim to martial energies from others (her label), but also energizes you for battle as a result. In Taurus, it also meant/means she has to fight for her art. 

In the meantime, she decided to release free mixtapes. A Saturn theme is stripping down to bare essentials. Ideally wanting to release music for profit, she had to settle for releasing music for free, and self-funding a lot of her creative endeavors. Though not firmly in her Saturn Return when she released these mixtapes, Saturn themes prevail for as it is her final dispositor. 

Anyway, the story gets happier. In 2014, she was freed from her contract. It was a 12th house profection year, and during Capricorn season. So matters of the 12th house were doubly activated. And Saturn lurked still behind it all. Mars trine Saturn natives also never give up no matter how steep the odds are stacked. Go JoJo!

*""Just imagine how the free bird will sing after being caged for so long,""* wrote one reporter. Holy 12th house! Only now, instead of entering a prison, she was leaving it. And thus began a new cycle for her, as she entered a 1st house year soon after. She signed to Atlantic Records. 

Despite being away for almost a decade, JoJo still had very loyal fans. During her legal battles ""#FreeJoJo"" was used on social media as a means of support for the singer, and many media outlets and blogs publicized her struggle. Fans and celebrities alike stood in solidarity. And when she was finally able to tour and release music again--she sold out shows, was streamed/downloaded tens of millions of times, soared to #1 on iTunes, and recouped all her expenses. Why? Sun and MC in the 11th house in Sag, ruled *and* trined by benefic Jupiter in Leo in her 7th. The 11th house describes the nature of our fans and friends. Though a ""victim"" of her business relationships early on, Jupiter in the 7th and ruling the 11th ensured JoJo would *always* have support from others. It also ensured that her public image, career, and reputation would always remain afloat and gifted positivity and expansion. The Sun and Jupiter also have mutual reception, each in the sign that the other rules. That's a wonderful tag-team to have by yourself to mediate the 12th house loss. Jupiter and Sun inflate you up again---and again and again. Jupiter also rules her second house so: money.

As her Saturn Return started, JoJo re-recorded and re-released her first albums, as her former label removed all of her music from the Internet. Having to go back and re-do everything, and with precision and perfection, (Mercury RX) is Saturnian, but JoJo found it extremely cathartic. She also changed some of the lyrics to reflect that she was in her late 20s now, and not an adolescent. Saturn as ruler of time and maturity.

As her Saturn Return became exact in early 2020, JoJo won her first GRAMMY for a comeback single released in 2019. She went on to be nominated for several other awards, and is slated for bigger things in the future. She announced a new album and tour for Spring 2020.

Whew, won't Saturn do it y'all! After he hits you with 2 by 4 after 2 by 4.

I hope this is reflection for people with heavy 12th house, and retrogrades, and heavy Saturn. Or people just curious/afraid of the Saturn Return. Mine is exact today so I found JoJo's story extremely resonate and because I'm also a trapped musician with Saturn in aversion to the ASC. Yes, shit does end up sucking hard---but never forever. And usually for the better. Saturn came back around for JoJo and as a result, all the planets in the 12th were loosened up to express more freely, retribution was delivered, debts were paid and money was flowing, and most importantly, life purpose was solidified and confirmed. 

p.s. One of her collaborators noted that she had a wise soul trapped inside the body of a young girl. Apropos for Saturn dominate people.

623,fyil51,False,,70,The Planet Jupiter,astrology,"I felt compelled to write about my thoughts on the planet Jupiter for anyone who might be interested- the good and the bad. 

Imagine you're staring up at the stars or standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon overlooking the *vast* expanse in front of you. It's *awe-inspiring*. It fills you with *wonder*. It makes you realise that there are much greater forces at work beyond your tiny little self. The realities of bill paying and mundane chores are a world away. You look out at the horizon and start to think big and dream and hope. You suddenly have a sense of perspective, understanding, faith, belief in something greater, something higher, something *more*\- this is Jupiter. It is epic in scale, legendary, mythic, beyond words. It fills you up and carries you on a high, makes you soar on optimism and a fascination for what's out there, waiting to be uncovered and explored. It makes you seek out and discover, it gives you meaning and purpose in life, it's your compass. This is why it's the Greater Benefic. It rules priests and sages and gurus and philosophers and scholars. Those who dispense advice and spiritual wisdom.¬†Those who journey to find the truth and then teach and preach it to those willing to learn. And Jupiter does have the potential to shower you with knowledge, wonder, and blessings. Astronomically it's the Great Protector, its gravity pulling in comets that would otherwise smash into the Earth and slinging them away into deep space. 

HOWEVER Jupiter can also become self-righteous, self aggrandising and self-mythologising. Like the Sun it can have an inflated sense of self importance, which with Jupiter can veer into ""I'm divinely chosen, my beliefs are the *right* beliefs, and I'm meant to do something great, it's my calling."" Jupiter can become a zealot. Jupiter can also be too abstract and theoretical and ungrounded, not at all rooted in reality. The professor who lectures from their ivory tower, who promises a lot with big dreams and grand visions but doesn't always deliver. Jupiter can leave you disappointed and disillusioned, the expectations you had about your life lying in pieces all around you. You'll see all these themes (the good and the bad) in the two signs it rules- Sagittarius and Pisces. You'll also see in them Jupiter's indulgence- its indulgence in experiences, alcohol, drugs, food, TV- whatever your vice is, Jupiter (when unhealthy) will want more of it. The expansiveness of Jupiter becomes untameable and unmanageable and can spiral into addiction.  

I wrote a bit of an essay there but I love writing about Jupiter. I feel I can speak to its nature with some authority because I have it conjunct my Ascendant and aspecting other vital planets in my chart.

381,f3ay47,False,,33,How Aquarius Can Offer Us Our Best Chance at Love (Happy Valentine's Day).,astrology,"Hi everyone,

Ahead of Valentine's Day tomorrow, I wanted to re-share this researched dig into Aquarius I did last year. It seems that the Aquarius archetype is at odds with the lovey dovey commercialized Valentine's Day we know of now. But maybe it makes...perfect sense?

Enjoy below and enjoy tomorrow, whether you are coupled or single. 

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

 

**Reframing Aquarius: How the cool and detached offer us our best chance at love**

Like Capricorn and Christmas, Aquarius and Valentine‚Äôs Day seem to be fundamentally at odds. Where the serious Saturn-ruled earth sign seems incongruous to merrymaking, so does the Saturn-ruled air sign seem an out-of-place home for one of the more *romantic* days of the year. If pop Astrology had its way, Aquarius would remain inextricably associated with stereotypes of distance and detachment. While those descriptors are certainly relevant, they are not the end of the story. ¬†You may find Taurus or Libra more fitting for Valentine‚Äôs Day, where the planet of love and romance is home. Or Pisces, where the planet of love and romance is exalted. Perhaps even Leo, where bouquets of red and pink balloons and Leo-ruled heart-shaped boxes of candy proudly boast and roar: *love!*¬† But in removing the superficial layers that surround the misunderstood Aquarius, we can come to understand why Cupid‚Äôs foray through this cerebral sign is no accident, and rather points us towards a more fitting, yet shocking, conclusion: that the Aquarius love is deep and endless, that the Aquarian heart throbs with undiluted passion. If this shocks you, good. Aquarius enjoys a revolution. And so may this revolution set Aquarius free from misinformation, and set ablaze a new way of thinking.

Where Taurus makes love physical, Libra makes love artful and Pisces makes love dreamy‚ÄîAquarius makes love *ideal.* In any working definition of the word *romance*, ‚Äúidealized love‚Äù makes a literal or alluded appearance. It can be said, then, that from Aquarius, the *idea* of love is born and celebrated. And from ideas, all things sprout. This isn‚Äôt altogether odd. Aquarius deals with intellect and logic. And ruled by Saturn, striving towards lasting standards of excellence and fairness, signposts of anything ideal, lines up with what we know about the archetype. So in enhancing love to its most ideal place, the Aquarius romance comes with a bigger heart and bigger mission. As a humanitarian sign, Aquarius is not particular about love‚Äî who deserves it, who is giving it, why it went away, when it‚Äôll come, how it looks, etc. With the power of scope and objectivity, Aquarius love transcends physical limitations and instead becomes a universal concept under which all of humankind can shelter. And what could be more romantic, more loving, than the unrelenting acceptance Aquarius offers? And so where things aren‚Äôt sensual enough for Taurus, refined enough for Libra, or magical enough for Pisces‚ÄîAquarius asks no price of admission, for love to them remains priceless, a public good to be doled out and shared not on pretense, but on brotherhood. It is Aquarius‚Äôs love of humankind and fraternity that expands the concept of love: come one, come all, and come as you are. 

Saint Valentine of Rome, whose written account has come to serve as a historical template for the beginnings of Valentine‚Äôs Day, acted out these Aquarian ideals. He performed weddings for those forbidden to marry and when sent to jail, healed his jailer‚Äôs daughter of blindness. Afterwards and right before he was due to be executed, he sent a letter to the jailer‚Äôs daughter, and signed it, *your Valentine.* Saint Valentine of Rome was also said to give out paper hearts while ministering to people about God‚Äôs love, and a direct line can be drawn from this action to the typical Valentine‚Äôs Day decorations we see today. In this brief tale, we meet two Aquarian archetypes, the former more recognizable than the latter: rebellion and compassion. A humanitarian thing to do despite the laws of the time, Saint Valentine, though perhaps not an Aquarius himself, extolled all of the best, yet often ignored testaments of the sign‚Äîthe push towards equality, that all deserve to have their love legitimized and recognized, endless empathy for the human condition, and the Love with a capital L that drives one to such measures. Religion aside, Valentine lived and died on one principal: that love, in all its myriad forms, is for all. Anyone who dies for love is a romantic to me. That the Sun was travailing through Aquarius as the framework for our modern conception of Valentine‚Äôs Day was underway can be no coincidence. All of Astrology bears correspondence to human events, even if they remain obscured or misunderstood for a time. But let‚Äôs mount more evidence...

In Ancient Greece, Aquarius season coincided with *Gamelion*, the month of marriage. Two festivals occurred then, roughly translated to *Sacred Wedding* and *Divine Wedding.* These festivals celebrated the union of Zeus and Hera. In Roman texts, Hera was known as Juno, the goddess of marriage. If Juno sounds familiar, it is because an asteroid was named after her and has come to represent what is looked for in marriage and commitment. Modern natal chart calculators can show where Juno is in the sky for the native, and most often it points to the characteristics of a most suitable long-term partner. So what is it about Aquarius that corresponds to these cultivations of lasting love and marriage? Look to the element and modality: fixed air. Like any fixed sign, Aquarius holds on tight and when best expressed can exalt the virtues of *fidelity.* Of course, any ideal marriage or partnership needs this brand of loyalty and perseverance. Though much is said about the Aquarius need for space, even the Aquarius need for isolation, it cannot be overlooked that when in love, Aquarius is one of the more steadfast partners, seeking not for frivolous union, but for deep connection. But the elemental structure of Aquarius sets it apart from the rest of the fixed family. It can be said that inherent in the Aquarian archetype are two life-sustaining elements: air, and water, as Aquarius is the water-bearer, often mistaken by novices as a water sign. No living being can do without air or water. And so the Aquarian love is life-sustaining, from which all bounty and blessings grow, from which all beings benefit. It is the grandeur of this concept that gives Aquarius its aloof quality‚Äîtheir love is so universal and welcoming that to the casual observer, it appears impersonal. But it is precisely the scope of Aquarius love that makes it so palpable, an equally matched breadth and depth. Where fixed Taurus can become materialistic, fixed Leo can become self-aggrandizing, and fixed Scorpio can brood and become paranoid, no more fixed is Aquarius than the air it represents: ubiquitous, self-sustaining, stretched over distance yet deeply intimate, as oxygen and the connectivity of breath is shared by all. Co-dependency has long reigned as a romantic model of love, clinginess and self-dissolution perversely used as measures of affection. Psychology has now caught up and identified this proclivity as self-sabotaging and unhealthy. The Aquarius model of live and let live in love can appear threatening to the osmosis some wish to experience, or expect to experience. But it offers us our best chance of healthy love‚Äîas when air is squelched out of the equation, breathing becomes labored, and the life of the relationship is threatened. When inserted in mutually consented amounts, air allows for space, wherein two individuals (or more, \*wink\*) can fully stretch out into their identity, their lived experience, always feeling supported, but never entrapped. That is what Aquarius offers‚Äîa love given the air to float, fly, and transcend.

In a sense, and as alluded to above, Aquarius love can be cerebral. But as all things start with thought, this isn‚Äôt to be feared. The belief of a thing creates the experience of a thing. So for Aquarius to hold you in their minds with love and affection is to tap into a potent creative energy, one that serves as the basis for all emotion and action. Intellect has no bounds. Neither do the Aquarius flights of fancy. And because these ideas are *fixed,* good luck changing the Aquarian mind. Once loved, always loved. For Aquarius, the idea of love for a person, up close or from afar, is to render that love timeless and shapeless, graduated out the physical dimensions of gift-giving, face-time and attention, and into an ethereal experience. Aquarius is the sign of freedom and independence. To give love the freedom to expand, to individuate, untethered by expectation or precedent, is to experience ecstasy. 

Aquarius is ruled by Saturn. There is, then, a resonance with Aquarius and Saturn‚Äôs sign of exaltation‚ÄîLibra. Libra, in some ways, is the sign of marriage, one-on-one partnership, diplomacy, and fairness. Therefore, there is a through-line connecting the idea of peaceful partnership and love to the Aquarius archetype. With this link, Saturn, and by virtue, Aquarius, can delight when relationships become stable and enduring, planting fertile ground for love and romance to blossom perennially. 

In sum, I invite you to reframe what you‚Äôve heard about Aquarius. Leave room for the wondrous ways in which this sign offers us our best chance at experiencing a true love, and hold space for a history that can corroborate it. Remember that as the water bearer, Aquarius has within it all the emotional capacity apparent in any other sign. Only, unlike any other sign, Aquarius shoulders these emotional conditions with impenetrable strength and understanding, turning them into nutrient, tilling human soil, watering it with compassion. In this alchemical process, all human experience, the sordid and splendid, meet their highest resolution in the arms of Aquarius. It is this level of belonging, of feeling seen and heard, that allows unbridled love to flow. It could be that the Aquarius tendency for distance and austerity is merely erected as a means of protection. That the love they feel for others must somehow be contained behind a wall, less it completely overwhelm them, less their waters drown the world. But do not be mistaken‚Äîbeyond the ideas of coldness and detachment lies a soft, loving center. A sweetness disguised, but always alive.

*‚ÄúLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind*  
 *And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.‚Äù*

He's pretty darn self preserved and I was convinced for a time he just didn't have emotion.

Because the Moon (and lunations) can represent where intentions can emotionally resonate, and Jupiter is the principle of expansion, optimism and faith, I'm using the confluence of these two planets and their locations in your chart to construct some fairly simple intentions and affirmations to consider. Capricorn and Pisces also form a harmonious sextile, and the Moon will aspect the Pluto-Saturn conjunction through this sextile, something I think matters as we consider what awaits January 12th and the themes that are probably already presenting themselves. Though not as seamless as a trine, sextiles still provide ease and success when acted upon and acknowledged. The opportunity awaits to be seized!¬†

(I understand that some people will be getting shit faced tonight, but you can easily do these on New Year's Day too.)  


**Aries:** I intend to set time aside to visit and nurture my hidden parts. Time spent in silence and introspection benefits me as I move into 2020. In these spots between my thoughts, remarkable new ideas for my changing career and purpose will reveal themselves to me. I move into my position on the world stage with ease and grace, and with with the invisible powers of cosmic companions always guiding me. Any insecurity becomes my security, and any hardship is insurance for my benefit.

**Taurus:** I intend to find and spend time with the people who matter most to me, whose goals and ideas are congruent with mine, and who champion my growth. I excel in communities of like-minded individuals, and flourish when I challenge my own beliefs and worldviews. 2020 brings to me a refreshed set of principles and beliefs, foreign experiences, teachings, and hope. I look forward to sharing what I've learned and experienced in the spaces that take me as I am.

**Gemini:** I intend to plant wondrously imaginative seeds for my career and invest in opportunities and people who share my vision. As I skip into 2020, I am reassured knowing that all I need is there. Debts are paid, forgiven, and pave the way for my comeback. Financial strength is my birthright and easily achieved through the discipline I am being taught. I learn to share and trust others with my gems, immaterial or material. I move into vulnerability knowing that it is my greatest strength, and provides the biggest dividends for my dreams.

**Cancer:** I intend to form healthy boundaries with loving people, and enter into relationships with a sobered and practical mind. What I have learned from others, good or bad, only serves to strengthen my belief in myself, and my suspicion that life is indeed good after all. As I enter 2020, my faith, though perhaps battered and bruised, remains alive. My emotional immune system is strong. I open my heart to new ideas and ways of thinking, beliefs that soothe my soul. I open my arms to people who wish to bring new ideas my way. I easily let go of people unworthy of my deep running waters, knowing that they will be replaced in multitudes by softer and kinder spirits.¬†

**Leo:** I intend to form a healthy relationship to...health. I know that my body is sacred, and that the foods and tonics I supply it with serve to enhance my day to day life. I am worthy of a firm, robust body, mind, and spirit. As I enter 2020, it is knowing that the work I do on a daily basis matters, and that I have the power to change and inspire my everyday, turning what is mundane into something magical. I rely on my spirituality and the help of benefactors to change what needs changing, and to uplift what may feel deflated. I have sound financial acuity, and am rich beyond means in heart, warmth and joy. The Sun shines forth as I go forth.

**Virgo:** I intend to dream bigger dreams of love, romance, and partnership. As I enter 2020, I know that disillusionment is turned to diamonds--clear cut and beautiful. Where I may have been left adrift by others set me on the path to wash up on shore of a love and personal life I never thought possible. I am grateful for the wild ride, and look forward to relaxation. The people and partnerships I meet, form and continue in 2020 inspire me to create, to play, to have fun, and to just enjoy. I am reacquainted with my inner child.

**Libra:** I intend to grow wherever it is that I am planted. I know that the peace and security of home cannot be taken from me, and travels and flows wherever it is that I go. I am safe, I am stable. As I move into 2020, I know that my body is restorative and strong, that ailments act as a catapult to launch me into stronger and enduring vitality. My work in the world is shifting, but gathers purpose and meaning along the way, as long as I have faith that I am on the right path. I do not mourn anything that has been buried or come to an end, for I know that they were seeds, and the forthcoming blossom will be worth it.

**Scorpio:** I intend to honor my words, thoughts, and ideas. Where my communication and mental processes may have been wrought with difficulty or confusion, I now let move me into creative ways to articulate and express. I am allowed to be unique, to think differently, and to let pain inform some of my greatest works.What I say and what I think matters. The players in my everyday life are of benefit to me. My neighborhood, my commute, my siblings...they all conspire to fill my brain and my life with fresh new perspectives and inspiration. I am out from under the trap of intellectual expectation, and I brand my own version of intelligence. I am the playwright of my own life, and am joyously filling my pages.

**Sagittarius:** I intend to value myself and the creature comforts that bolster my self perception and self esteem. As I move into 2020, I see money as a currency. That is, merely a source of energy that can be expended however I choose. I move forward knowing abundance will find me even around the darkest of corners, and carry me through comfortably as I reevaluate what does and doesn't matter. As I invest in myself, I invest in my home, knowing that firm footing creates the foundation for all of the dreams I have. My family and/or chosen tribe is where I find compassion, solace, and magic. They have my back, just as I have my own.

**Capricorn:** I intend to look in the mirror with pride. Oh how proud I am of myself! The rocks thrown my way do not break me. Parts of me may be cratered, but they are as resilient and beautiful as the moon--enduring, never complaining, always shining. As I move into 2020, I am becoming more of who I always knew I could be, and looking upon my shedding layers fearlessly, welcoming in my sturdy new skin. I hold myself in high esteem, and communicate with myself with unending compassion. I am brave enough to throw away outdated behaviors and habits, and to replace them with newer dreams and visions. As I do, my life resets, and the people and places I share this new life with reflect back to me the beauty of my transformation.

**Aquarius:** I intend to know my worth. Behind every breath, every pause, and every brief moment of introspection, is a whisper of encouragement from the recesses of my soul. As I enter 2020, I marry the immaterial with the material, using the sacred information found in bouts of rest and retreat to move me forth into abundance, in the hand and in the mind. I do not fear what is uncovered, what is ended, or what is perceived. I know that I am big magic, the ultimate alchemist, turning rough metals, with time, into gold.

**Pisces:** I intend to dream myself into being and to become the walking manifestation of my goals. As I swim into 2020, I recognize that the communities, groups and friends that have seemed to block my flow, are actually dams that help my waters runneth over. Associates and associations may have left me wanting, working, or weeping, so I now choose to spend my empathy and compassion on worthy companions and causes. I fear not that I've wasted any time, and am grateful to have been steered into this conviction. I know that the goals I have are worthy and possible, and that the people I need to make them happen are on the way. I build the dream, and the dream team too.

814,bcuggp,False,,118,Moon in Cancer Overview,astrology,"Moon is in domicile in Cancer. This means that, since Moon is the natural ruler of Cancer, it feels at home with this sign.¬†Moon represents emotions, the inner self, our personality and needs and well as the feminine energy and the mother.

The reason Moon feels best when in Cancer is because Cancer embodies all the qualities Moon represents: Cancer is caring and emotional, introspective and (usually) family oriented. Cancer Moons are unusually perceptive when it comes to emotions, even more than Cancer Suns. They seem to instinctively know how you feel and what you need and will do their best to take care of your emotional needs. That is unless they are too preoccupied with their own emotions that they have to put you on hold until they sort their problems out. It's not that they don't want to help you, because they do, but their own emotions can at times be so overwhelming that they have to deal with them first.

If, on the other hand, a Cancer Moon native is not dealing with the intense emotions of their own, they are the best confidants you can find. They will listen to you and actually care about what you're saying. If you feel bad, they will feel bad, too (if they like you, of course). They have very warm and soothing energy unless they go into their crabby moods and start sulking. Nevertheless, their sulking behavior is not destructive and they will try to smooth things over as soon as their emotions are stabilized.

If poorly aspected, they are prone to pushing their way, sulking and pouting when things don't go as they wished. They want peace and harmony but on their terms. Luckily, because they do genuinely care about others, if you present them your case from the emotional point of view, they are likely to concede. The key with a Cancer Moon is always emotion. Because they see the world through the lenses of their feelings, they will be sympathetic to your feeling as well.

The biggest problem for anyone with strong Cancer influence, be it Sun, Moon, personal planets or Imum Coeli in combination with two or more of the personal planets/Luminaries, is the insecurity. That‚Äôs the main issue all the other issues stem from. Because Cancer is so insecure it very often results in all of the selfish and manipulative behavior. Let me be clear here - Cancers are not manipulative because they want to or because of some devious reasons. No. Cancers are manipulative because they don‚Äôt feel safe. If a Cancer would feel safe, all of this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue.

Moon in Cancer people are avid of love and acceptance. It‚Äôs not only that they want to receive love, but they also want to give love‚Ä¶ big time. They are very perceptive of other people‚Äôs emotions but because of the insecurities we mentioned before, a Cancer Moon person also tends to read into things that are not there, like taking a slight from a simple, misinterpreted look.

Depending on the rest of the chart, If the Cancer Moon native doesn't get the attention they need, they might seek it through passive-aggression. They will not be doing it on purpose or even be aware that they are doing it, but if they feel that the other person is not giving them the amount of attention they feel they deserve, they may either attack the other person (verbally) or sulk and pout until that other person does what they want.

Nevertheless, when they do care about you, they are capable of moving mountains for you. Because they are so intuned with your feelings, they will do important things for you that you haven‚Äôt even asked them to. They will take care of you and your emotional needs as long as you show them enough attention and love and, for them, it‚Äôs almost never enough.

If you find yourself in any kind of trouble, rest assured that these people will make their own personal mission to help you out, no matter what. Remember that video of a crab (animal) helping out his crab friend? Cancer Moon natives are like that - they might not know how to help themselves, but they will risk everything to help you if they truly care for you.

i'd say rule #1 for cancer moons is to realize and reinforce your emotional boundaries because things get messy and it's easy to feel at a loss if not clearly marked out ",2019-04-13 19:50:39

Time to take action to better your life & financial situation by manifesting your dreams and transforming your emotions.

Dream to your Highest power and speak it into existence (but watch how you speak it). Combine your 3rd dimensional world with 4th dimensional ideas to operate on a Higher level. Create a vision board and put intention into your thoughts & practices to create the path forward. Mercury is still Retrograde, so don't rush the process and take time to reevaluate, rethink before setting anything into stone. Allow yourself to build with clay before drying into bricks. Don't max yourself out, but remain focused on the tasks at hand. Pisces calls for us to go with the flow; allow the Universe to work through you for you. Give yourself time to relax and refresh to remain balanced in the journey ahead. Take time to meditate. Focus on your biggest dreams, set your intentions, and initiate the action so that the Universe may bring you upon your Divine calling. New Moons may make you feel tired, especially in Pisces, so allow yourself time to rest as a new cycle is beginning. The work begins now.. Manifest. The stars are the limit, and they are limitless.

411,hr743v,False,,32,A Beautiful Astrological Portrait Connecting Naya Rivera and Cory Monteith,astrology,"I want to preface this by saying that this post will be centered on celebrating the life of Naya Rivera, and finding cosmic catharsis about what Astrology can show us about this moment in time for her and her soul. I will be couching everything in my Aquarius brand of impartiality, which I hope conveys a spirit of education and understanding versus usurping a tragic moment for clout. Though, if you see it that way, I do understand. I figured that since now all the what if's and when's and how's of the event have been answered, it would be an ok time to approach this event from a spiritual POV, and add to the zeitgeist of the moment.

I won't be examining the death of Naya or the circumstances surrounding it. I instead was curious about the Astrological through-line between Cory and Naya, and how the day of her recovery marked 7 years since his passing.

One of their Glee costars stated that Cory, in spirit, helped find Naya yesterday, bringing closure and peace. That made me go ""hmm"". And instead of excavating the crude facts of the moment, I was curious to examine what Astrology had to say about more intangible things like spirit guides, or help from beyond, the soul, and other karmic resonances.

Naya's body was recovered at 9:10 am in Ventura, CA (Lake Piru) on July 13th, 2020. [source](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/naya-rivera-dead-glee-star-body-drowning-obituary?bfsource=relatedmanual)

For this, I want to focus on the NN (soul stuff), the MC (the most elevated part of the chart) and the Sun. Why? I figured that a recovery mission, something brought to light, would engage the planet of spotlight (Sun) and the highest moment in the sky (midheaven/MC). NN would point more towards the soul direction of a moment. I will also incorporate the 12th house--where things hide, and especially in water. Here is what I found:

\-The chart of the moment of recovery for Naya has the MC at 27 degrees of Taurus. Cory's Sun in Taurus conjuncts that point.

\-Cory's Sun in Taurus is also in Naya's natal 12th house. When you read this from a synastry POV, there are overwhelming themes of unconscious/subconscious bonds. Trouble, endings, loss. The Sun person illuminates the 12th house. Extrapolate if you will, to see Cory's Sun as helper/finder of Naya's resting place, where she lost her life, where she transitioned into the unconscious

\-The asteroid ""Cora"", closest to Cory (which I've learned is okay--to find the object with the name CLOSEST to the one you're looking for), is exactly conjunct the NN of the moment, 28 Gemini. Naya's natal Moon is also 28 Gemini in the 1st house. Cora, besides being facsimile for ""Cory"", is a name derived from the Greek goddess Persephone. She was goddess of the underworld, and represents the ""perennial change from life to death""

\-With the NN of the moment at 28 Gemini, exactly conjunct her natal Moon--we can see that the direction of karma in the moment related to her identity as mother. She put the responsibility of being a mother ahead of herself (Moon in 1st house). Reports are now showing that Naya used the last of her energy to boost her son up on the boat, unable to muster the energy to save herself.

\-In the chart of Naya's recovery, the asteroid ""Nayam"" was in the 12th house, and ""Nayan"" in the 7th conjunct Neptune, a planet responsible for drownings.

\-Cory's Cancer NN conjunct the Cancer Sun of the moment Naya was found

\-Seven years ago, Mars was at 29 degrees of Gemini, conj Naya's Moon. Conj. the NN of her recovery. Not sure what this means but wanted to make mention.

\-Naya's NN in Aries squares Cory's NN in Cancer almost exactly:

&#x200B;

>*""When one person's Nodes squares the other person's Nodes in synastry this will correlate to two¬† Souls who have been in some kind of relationship in which various dynamics and issues between them has caused them to separate from one another previous to the current life.  Coming into this life with that signature correlates to the intentions of each of their Soul's to 'pick up where it was left off' in order to continue to confront those issues so that the evolution together can continue in some way.""*

I find that to be very resonate, given that she was found on an anniversary of his death, and generally also died around the anniversary of his death. Both of their souls were working in tangent, but it is not up to us to clearly know or see how.

That is all I have for now, or perhaps forever. Without Cory's actual birth time and therefore house placement, there is only so much excavation that can be done. But I hope what I provided above helped you to be able reframe the breadth (and depth) of astrology, and see how it can be used to tie together resonance between two souls.

Thoughts? I'm 100% down with people thinking this is a stretch.

By [Ascendifi](https://www.ascendifi.com)

1.  **Face the Truth**: Has there been a situation in your life you have been turning a blind eye to? Neptune likes to keep the blinders over our eyes but since it‚Äôs Retrograde in its home sign of Pisces it is ripping off your glasses and pushing you straight into the sunlight. It may seem intense at first, but you can no longer hide how you feel about a person/situation any longer. Change is scary, but nothing is scarier than staying stagnant because it may be rough for an undisclosed amount of time. If you think back, weren‚Äôt you always happy you chose change over comfort?  


2.  **Tap into your spiritual side**: It‚Äôs time to take a hold of your anxiety and show it who is boss. Don‚Äôt try to fight these feelings but rather observe them and see what you can do to soothe yourself until the feeling passes. Meditate, ground yourself in nature, be present in the moment, get to know yourself again.  


3.  **Turn your vision into reality:** Neptune has been direct since November 27, 2019. How many of your promises have you kept to yourself? Have you worked on your dreams or even acknowledged them? Have you cut through subconscious thoughts and limiting beliefs? It is now time to look at your progress and make the necessary changes to heal and build your vision.

378,fgzusg,False,,42,Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison,astrology,"his chart is rated C, so take with grain of salt.

I was interested in examining his transits for today (and other timings techniques) versus a natal explanation (which has been done here, If you search there‚Äôs a really good one by u/SmoothieGoat) to see what planetary energies contributed to his sentencing. He will likely die in prison, as his lawyers said even 5 years would be a life sentence.

His birthday is March 19th. So I saw it fitting to cast his solar return chart. There, he is in for a Gem Rising year with transit Uranus and Venus in his 12th. He is being imprisoned for his acts of sexual violence towards women (Venus). Uranus there, to me, completes a sad story shown in his natal chart. He has natal Uranus in Cancer opposite his Capricorn Moon. His relationship to his mom and childhood was most likely cold, hardened, and erratic in some way, and that first relationship to a woman, for men, can indeed portend how one may treat women as an adult. Uranus in his Solar Return 12th, almost at the exact same degree, illustrates a disturbing culmination to that natal promise. And indeed, with all the planets that have and are transiting Capricorn right now, those issues are at the very least karmically highlighted for him if not literally. He has Capricorn moon in the 3rd, which relates to upbringing. 

His solar return Chiron is placed in the 11th (honors, fame) conjunct his Sun in the 10th. Soiled reputation. Chiron in Aries is also ruled by Mars, and his is natally precariously placed in square to Pluto. 

His natal 7th house (Taurus) becomes his SR 12th house (imprisonment revolving around personal relationships), and for what it‚Äôs even worth, his SR 5th house, Libra (sexual desires), is his natal 12th. Venus rules both Libra and Taurus. So generally just a lot of themes of sexual impropriety, women, relationships, prisons, endings, death, etc.

His natal 8th, the place of death and mortality, is his solar return 1st house. Maybe he will literally die. Who knows. But he is certainly in the last chapters of his life. His solar return 8th house is Capricorn, with all 3 malefics currently placed there plus Jupiter. Heavy 8th and 12th emphasis is going to make for a dark year. 

His solar return Venus (and thus transit Venus) is forming a trine with Saturn and Pluto. Retribution and punishment for crimes against women. 

His solar return Moon is in Aquarius in the 9th. Aquarius occupies the 4th house of his natal, opposite that ruthless Pluto conjunct MC in Leo. He will probably be coming to terms with his career, his role in his own demise, and likely through 9th house themes of faith and religion. It‚Äôs not uncommon that convicted criminals come to devote their lives to Jesus (or whatever and whomever) while incarcerated. A real test of faith is beginning.

Transit wise, Mercury direct in his natal 5th. Whatever legal deliberations were needed were carried through with the directness of a Mercury direct station. Inward analysis became outwardly expressed conclusions. Pisces occupies his natal 5th so: sex crimes and the general dark side Piscean gaslighting, seeing how far one can take things, zero boundaries, etc.

There‚Äôs something about his NN at 0 Pisces (conj Venus) and his Sun at 29 Pisces that is profound to me. I can‚Äôt articulate it but his soul incarnated for some challenged lessons around women, sex and pleasures. Yeesh. 

Interestingly but not exact, his natal progressed mars stationed retrograde and is marching backwards into his 12th house to join his natal RX Neptune and RX Saturn. While his natal progressed Venus is marching up into his 8th. 

His progressed Moon is also conjunct that natal Uranus I spoke about above. He is also in his 8th house year right now about to enter a 9th house one, where that Uranus and progressed moon are. 

A culmination of themes.

892,8xqk7w,False,,53,Jupiter is Direct Y'all. Let The Church Say AMEN!,astrology,"I'm interested in how Jupiter's retrograde worked out for you all. What did you learn, how did you grow, what did you acquire? And how will you use it to know go forth?

Jupiter RX'd in my 6th whole sign house, and stomped the breaks on my day jorb and to a lesser degree, my health. A raise I was promised was halted. I felt very stuck in my job and was considering all these radical (and nonsensical) ways to leave. My daily routines were becoming boring and borderline depressing and out of step. I hit a plateau in my fitness journey. I had health ""scares"" (mostly hypochondria), and my mental health plummeted. I had to take a break from my tarot readings. Money flow was TIGHT. SO TIGHT.

And because Jupiter was in Scorpio, I fell down a rabbit hole of examining everything to death, piecing together deeper meanings. It was a rich, introspective time that spawned from a lot of external turmoil.

Mostly what I learned was confidence in self and what I can offer to the world. I also learned not to rush things, as Jupiter RX makes luck and blessings seem THAT much more out of reach, and I was rushing around trying to create them for myself.

During the last few days and certainly today, I don't feel blocked anymore. I've been optimistically throwing my resume around, pitching myself for projects, creating random content and ideas. Most surprisingly (and a lil coz of Uranus), I got a lightening strike idea for a business I want to start, and am receiving help and guidance there.

Coincidentally, today I am finally seeing a new doctor (6th house!)--one who has compassion and bed-side manner through the roof. I've been seeing a really stoic, cold and clinical doctor for years who just throws pills and unhelpful advice at me, and today I am cherishing the chance to be seen by someone who actually cares. Thanks Jupiter!

I'm feeling very hopeful now, and in the midst of some upcoming eclipses on my Sun and money houses, the addition of Jupiter direct makes me feel like a turning point is truly on the way, and gives me an extra boost of joyful anticipation. A grand trine this week too.

864,eysxl7,False,,50,Rush Limbaugh Announces Advanced Lung Cancer. Saturn conj Pluto.,astrology,"His birthday was January 12. The day of the exact conjunction bearing down on his Sun in a Capricorn in the 12th house of endings, loss, misfortune. (The lunar eclipse that happened 2 days prior took place in his 6th house of health). He actually also said he knew something was wrong on the day of January 12th, when he experienced shortness of breath. 

His solar return for this year had the Saturn Pluto conjunction taking place in his 3rd house. While it may be a stretch to assign the function of breathing to the 3rd house, lung capacity and the actual mechanics behind talking goes hand in hand with being able to consistently communicate and verbalize ideas over a broadcast radio show. He said he will have to be off air and miss some shows in order to receive treatment. Chiron is also in his solar return 6th.

His solar return Moon in Leo is conjunct his MC. That he had to come out and make an emotional revelation that will affect his career is in direct opposition to his Aquarian sensibilities ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like making things about me,‚Äù he said in the release.

839,a7u4e9,False,,103,The Astrology of Racism,astrology,"I recently read a forum about possible placements and aspects that could point towards racist tendencies.

A few years ago, a study was conducted by a student from Purdue University on the birth details of members of the KKK dating all the way back to the early 1900s.

They found that 40% of the members in the study had their Sun in Pisces, while the majority of the remaining 60% had their Sun in either Scorpio, Cancer, or Capricorn.

They also found that only 8 members in the study, past and present, had their Sun in an air sign.

What‚Äôs with all the water? The thing that REALLY surprised me was the large percentage of Pisces.

I read some opinions stating that water energy in particular could be prone to getting ‚Äúmolded‚Äù by emotional manipulation. I suppose this would be especially true if an impressionable, sensitive child were raised by parents with racist mentalities.

637,erg3e4,False,,36,Understanding your chart using the Ship Analogy,astrology,"I read an analogy a while ago that helped me. 

Imagine your chart is like a ship. Your asc would be the bow of the ship, and represent the direction you are heading. This is your life path. Everything you meet in life, and everything you send out to the ‚Äúocean‚Äù passes over the bow. Lots of people call our asc our ‚Äúmask‚Äù but that‚Äôs not totally accurate, it‚Äôs more like a filter or lens. Yes, how the world sees you is colored by your asc, but your asc also tells how you see the world. Representing our direction in life, the asc is the most important part of the birth chart (speaking generally, there can be exceptions to any rule.)

Anyway, back to the ship, your Midheaven is your ship‚Äôs mast, it is the first part of your ship people may see coming up over the horizon, this is where your flag waves to announce to the world ‚Äúthis is who I am‚Äù and where the wind meets your sails to carry you forward.

Your descendant is like the deck of your ship, where people come aboard. 

Your IC is the bottom of your boat, hidden under the water. All boats are built from the bottom up, it is your past. It is the foundation that carries you along.

Your chart ruler is the captain of your ship! What state is he in? Is he restricted by Saturn or amped out by an unruly mars? Is he in a good position to see the direction the ship is headed? Is he shining in exaltation or hindered by detriment? His house placement tells us from what area of your life does he command the ship. Aspects to other planets tell us what crew members help or hinder his rulership. The zodiac sign tells us how he expresses himself.

Also every other planet near a key point of your ‚Äúship‚Äù carries extra significance. A fallen moon near your IC makes the bottom of your boat leaky, an exalted Venus at the Midheaven fills your sails with beauty.

I am a visual person so this analogy really helped me understand how my chart works together as a whole, and it also helped me figure out what my key planets are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/erg3e4/understanding_your_chart_using_the_ship_analogy/,158,So if I have Scorpio asc and Pluto in Scorpio... is that exalted?

848,b9gzr3,False,,113,Moon in Aries Overview,astrology,"When people think of Aries, the first thing that comes to mind is a high-intensity warrior who goes after what he wants without taking obstacles into account. They are goal oriented people with an instant gratification streak.
 
This is mostly true for the Sun in Aries people (mostly, because one‚Äôs chart is not composed only of their Sun sign), and even though it‚Äôs also true for Moon in Aries natives, it‚Äôs very different from the Aries Suns.

The greatest difference between a Sun sign and a Moon sign is that Sun is overt and Moon is covert. What I mean by this is that that you should see Sun as the character and Moon as a personality. Sun is seen by everyone (who get to know you a little bit, that is, because otherwise, the first thing people see when they meet you is your Ascendant), and Moon is seen best only by the people who know you well. Some people exude their Moon Sign characteristics more acutely than their Sun Sign but generally, this is the rule of thumb.

If we translate this to the Aries Sun/Moon, it goes like this: Aries Sun will be outwardly active if a little aggressive and pushy. Aries Moon will be like that on the inside while they may present a different exterior to the world (unless they also have Sun in Aries).

Moon in Aries people feel the intensity and impetuousness of the Aries on a much deeper level. They may not behave like an Aries, but they will certainly feel like one. Their emotions will be constantly in turmoil as they feel acutely about everything around them. Nothing is lukewarm with them. In that sense, there is a similarity with the Moon in Scorpio but unlike this Moon, Aries intensity is more positive and brighter. Though they get upset easily, they don‚Äôt tend to brood and ruminate like the Scorpio Moon. They get upset, go through that emotion with both intensity and velocity and once it passes, they forget about it. That the good thing ‚Äì Aries Moon natives don‚Äôt hold grudges and they generally forget things as easily as they get upset by them. It‚Äôs all flowing naturally and fast for them ‚Äì they are the fire that initiates (Aries is a cardinal sign) but doesn‚Äôt burn too long.

On the other hand, it‚Äôs not easy to have an Aries Moon. Because the Moon represents the inner Self and the emotions, taking things too intensely on a daily basis can be overwhelming. That‚Äôs why it would do good for an Aries Moon to do some sports, to vent out all those intense emotions they are having inside. They usually do have the inclination to do sports or do some other physical activity that will match the intensity inside. Even if they are not playing any kind of sports, you‚Äôll usually find them walking briskly and/or leading a fast-paced life.
 
Aries Moon is action driven and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs difficult for them to stay passive. Even if the life circumstances require them to lead a more passive life they won‚Äôt definitely be happy about it. They‚Äôll feel like a tiger trapped in a cage. Regardless of the rest of the chart, once they feel cornered they will explode in a frightful manner.

How strong the Aries Moon will manifest itself for the native and if there will be any issues, depends on the rest of the chart. Still, when we compare Luminaries (Sun and Moon signs) there are some Sun signs that can tolerate Aries Moon better and some that won‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs find out which Sun/Moon combination is smoother for the native and which one is more explosive.

I've definitely found this over the years. A few off the top of my head:

Gemini: Geminis have a strong self-righteous, argumentative, often bluntly rude aspect that is very overlooked. I've known many Geminis and not one hasn't had this. They really think they know best in most cases.

Cancer: I feel as if the caring aspects of this sign are highly over-played. I'm sure there are some very caring Cancers, but I've met maybe one, and only to her own kid.

Leo: Leos have a major quiet side that is often ignored. Even very gregarious Leos have the capacity to be extremely quiet and distant at home, or when they don't feel the need to perform.

Libra: I feel like the cardinal, determined aspect of Libra is often downplayed. And their love of trying to make people mad and being rebels.

Sagittarius: The Sagittarius description often reads like a clown, and overlooks their almost universal propensity for anxiety and intense spells of negative emotion.

Capricorn: I feel like the Capricorn love of creature comforts is often overlooked. It is an earth sign.

Aquarius: Yes, they are all a bit eccentric, but they are also capable of being quite calculating.

No to anxiety for Sags.

591,d9050q,False,,53,"I noticed something interesting about past libra seasons, and possibly this one as well. Could there be a connection?",astrology,"I should preface this by saying I know essentially *nothing* about astrology, so I have no idea if any of this could be related. But anyway, I happened to notice that some interesting events have happened during this time in past years.

**2014** - Hannibal Buress brings Bill Cosby's *many* allegations against him to light, bringing ***many*** women forward, ending with him in jail now.

**2016** - Trump's ""grab em by the pussy"" tape surfaces. This seemed to have no effect however, but it definitely showed his character much more clearly.

**2017** - the rise of the Me Too movement and Weinstein's fall.

Then, yesterday there was Greta Thunberg's address to the UN, and *then* impeachment hearings, as well as Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament being declared unlawful.

So now I'm wondering, could there be a connection between things like these in past years and it being the time of the scales of justice? I saw another post seeming to relate the impeachment with Saturn's position, but I wonder if this could also be a factor?

332,fhmr7m,False,Modern,41,Insights for those looking to astrology for signals about coronavirus,astrology,"Before I go further, I want to stress the important basics:

Stay grounded in the facts. Listen to local & national updates about the pandemic. Wash your hands for 20 seconds. Don't touch your face. Quarantine if you feel ill. Take advantage of the newly launched coronavirus telemedicine services (like [Roman's](https://www.getroman.com/coronavirus/)) if you feel you may have it.

I love looking to the sky for answers, but to make good work of it, we have to keep our feet on the ground.

Okay - that said...I want to share some interesting finds.

Here are my two resources:

* [Llewellyn's 2020 Astrological Daily Planetary Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Llewellyns-Daily-Planetary-Guide-Glance/dp/0738749427)
* [New York Time's Official Coronavirus Timeline page](https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html)

For a few years now, I've found Llewellyn's daily guide to be a poignant resource for tracking both the major and minor movements in the planets from week-to-week. I like that the book calls out the key information of what is happening from an astrological sense and then provides some loose interpretation on top of it.

The fact that it's printed and shipped ahead of the year also helps imbue me with a sense of wonder when it gets things right.

For 2020, the Weekly forecasts were written by astrologer [Pam Ciampi, whom I'm sad to say seems to have passed away in January of 2019](http://sandiegoastrology.com/past-president-pam-ciampi-has-died/). May it only add to our respect for her life's work that this allows us to know with some degree of certainty that she wrote these forecasts well over a year before 2020 began.

Below are the passages that stuck out to me - alongside the NYT Coronavirus timeline and with some of my own commentary added in where I have something to add:

\*Emphases are mine.

# January 6-12

""Get ready, because even though this is only the second week of the new year, it features two celestial attractions that could rock your world.  The first is a Cancer Full Moon/Lunar Eclipse on Friday, January 10, that makes up the first of a bookend of **Cancer Full Moons that begin and end this year**.  The second is the **Saturn-Pluto conjunction on** ***Sunday, January 12***\*\*,\*\* that spells trouble in a number of different ways...

...Because these two heavy-duty planets only get together about once every thirty-four years, the results can be life-changing, with long-reaching consequences. While Saturn is busy protecting and preserving security and order, Pluto is seeking to destroy and transform by ferreting out what lies hidden beneath the surface.  Let's look back at the beginning of the twenty-first century to examine another time when these two planets were aligned. The Saturn-Pluto ***opposition*** of 2001 foreshadowed 9/11, which was a day that rocked the world because it was the first time the US had been attacked on its mainland. The events of 9/11 brought chaos and upset, including the never-ending war in Afghanistan and the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2020, Saturn-Pluto are ***conjunct*** in **Capricorn**, which highlights the **stock market, world banking, government, and big business**. This large, slow-moving transition is expected to include a global conversion to a virtual form of money (like cryptocurrency or blockchains), trade irregularities, economic downturns, and serious corruption and misuse of power. One way to approach the stress that the Saturn-Pluto conjunction is sure to bring is to be ready for any challenge that comes your way...With Mercury sandwiched directly between Saturn and Pluto, **the impact of this conjunction will be featured in news cycles around the globe.""**

***From the NYT timeline:***

**January 11 - China reported its first death.** On Jan. 11, Chinese state media reported the [first known death](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/world/asia/china-virus-wuhan-death.html) from an illness caused by the virus, which had infected dozens of people. The 61-year-old man who died was a regular customer at the market in Wuhan, where the illness is thought to have originated, and he had previously been found to have abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease. The report of his death came just before one of China‚Äôs biggest holidays, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.

# January 27-February 2

""Tuesday, January 28, is a low-energy day because that's when Mars, the action planet of the zodiac, makes a square to a **Neptune** that is overrun with negative feelings like guilt and shame \[*my note: this is due to some qualities of being in* ***Pisces***\]. Because this Mars-Neptune square also represents a **low immune function, go light on alcohol, eat well, get enough rest, and exercise regularly**. February begins with a square between the Aquarius Sun and Taurus Moon on Saturday, February 1, that brings a brief **tug between freedom and security**.""

***From The NYT timeline:***

**January 30 - The W.H.O. declared a global health emergency.** Amid thousands of new cases in China, a ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern‚Äù was officially [declared ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-world-health-organization.html)by the W.H.O. China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that it would continue to work with the W.H.O. and other countries to protect public health, and the U.S. [State Department warned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/Coronavirus-travel-advisory-.html) travelers to avoid China.

**January 31 - The Trump administration restricted travel from China.** The Trump administration said it would [suspend entry](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html) into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. By this date, [213 people had died](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html#link-6a63a9b7) and nearly 9,800 had been infected worldwide.

# February 3-9

""**Thoughts and communications get more emotional** this week, because on Monday, February 3, Mercury leaves Aquarius and moves into **Pisces** for the next **two months**. Pisces is a tough sell for Mercury, because it's hard for the most logical of planets to lose its common sense to Pisces's ocean of emotion...Because **Mercury** will turn **retrograde** later this month, **communication will be under the influence of this emotion-based sign until April,** which is much longer than its usual three-week tour.""

# March 16-22

""Communications have been more confusing than usual this year with **Mercury in emotional Pisces** for an unusually long two and a half months. **Saturn** makes a **major sign change on Saturday, March 21,** as it shifts from **Capricorn**'s old-school traditions to future-forward **Aquarius**...**Saturn** will return for a temporary tour of **Capricorn in July and reenter Aquarius in December** for the next two to three years. **Mars**, also in **Capricorn**, makes two once-a-year conjunctions this week that have very different effects on energy levels. A positive **Mars-Jupiter** conjunction on **Friday, March 20**, combines **confidence** and **enthusiasm** with **courage** and **bravado**, which makes it easy to take action and start something new...The second conjunction, late on **Sunday, March 22,** is a dangerous once-a-year **Mars-Pluto** meeting that brings **power struggles, ruthlessness**, and possible **violence**. Take action Wednesday and do your best to stay away from conflicts on Sunday.""

# My Interpretation

When the year kicked off, I really felt the doom-and-gloom was America-Iran's explosive conflict and the Australia Fires. However, that was clearly (for now) not the case - and in fact, Fire is not the element where all of this action is taking place.

The transformation is happening in ***Water.***

Oddly, this also came through on a Tarot reading I did yesterday on coronavirus in which the [King Of Cups](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/king-of-cups-tarot-card) was suspended between the [High Priestess](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/the-high-priestess-tarot-card) and the [Death](https://www.keen.com/articles/tarot/death-tarot-card) cards. That, along with some other cards in the reading painted a picture of deeply rooted transformation on the emotional plane - with specific relations to water and health.

It didn't quite stack up with how I've been logically feeling about everything, but these astrological insights help.

**Water Signs** are playing a huge role in 2020. Most of the action taking place right now is in **Pisces** \- and the year itself is bookended by Full Moons in **Cancer**. Both, water signs. The dance between the two is in the awesome and/or terrifying emergence of our hidden, inner worlds (Pisces) and our sense of self-preservation and comfort (Cancer).

There are two levels to what we're struggling with right now as a planet: The **Pandemic** (our health) - and The **Panic** (our emotions).

The other signs very much in play with Saturn's energy are **Capricorn** (Earth) and **Aquarius** (Air). Capricorn, which is supposed to be a grounded home where all is in order, has been a domain of chaos since Pluto entered it in 2008 (see: the last financial crisis).

# Where It All Goes

Overall, the Cancer Full Moon bookends indicate we're in this story until the end of 2020.

I think we're going to feel some **relief in April** when Saturn gets its a\*\* out of Capricorn for a minute, but we'll be right back in it for its gnarly retrograde from August through next January after it slips back in for a bit before finally moving off to Aquarius for the long term.

So perhaps we're going to see some indicators of **how to beat coronavirus** in the **last week of March**, but they'll be hard-won. I'm guessing that has to do with the **strict quarantines** we're about to implement (especially in the US where a number of states are headed toward a shut down) showing that we can truly [flatten the curve](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/science/coronavirus-curve-mitigation-infection.html). I think that ""solving it"" feeling is inside the Mars-Jupiter energy. The ugliness of the Mars-Pluto energy in the same week is probably people not handling quarantine measures well.

leo :: gimli ‚Äî loud and proud, warm-hearted and funny!!!! a little prideful and stubborn, doesn‚Äôt want anyone to see his failures or shortcomings so he puts up a lil bit of a facade but hes incredibly loyal and he‚Äôs willing to fight for those who he loves. HAIRY AF

I did not expect him to go out and buy one the next day but that's what he did. I told him he should wait for mercury to go direct and I would help him but he's not too into astrology...or wasn't until now. He is a Taurus rising so a bit stubborn about asking for help. 

The first computer had a cracked screen that was not noticeable until he turned it on at home. He went back to the store for an exchange, but they were out of that model. So he got a different model for the same price. 

The second computer has this horrible, very bad, nearly fascist OS called Windows 10 Mode S. Mode S means you can only install programs from the Microsoft store, which is useless. So he went back today to complain and got a refund and went to another store. 

At the new store he described exactly what he needs and specified no Mode S. The sales rep recommended a new model with Windows 10, no Mode S on the box. 

He got home and the third computer is also Mode S. He is not happy.

That‚Äôs the energy of Gemini NN to me haha.

On a societal level...

SN in Sagittarius: end of my way or highway soap-boxing, end of dogmatic thinking being accepted as Truth, the illusion of fake news lifting, losses to the way we travel globally, less my way or the high way

NN in Gemini: fact over philosophy and theorizing, able to hold many ideas at once, expanding on the ability to change your mind, common sense, letting new information in

In general, SN Sag is the archetype of a well-traveled and knowledgeable sage, in whatever field, seeking to share what they know. This archetype appears to know it all, about everything, and will make sure you know that. The plus side is what this placement does indeed have a lot to share. The downside is that they don‚Äôt listen to other people, factor in the details, and have a hard time separating their ego from their smarts. Marco Polos.

NN Gemini is seeking to be that better listener, to siphon through all the relevant details and facts, to be comfortable learning from others. This placement is community oriented and less about traveling far and wide. Time to be in the present moment, here and now, what matters this second.

On a personal level...

It depends a lot on what houses Sag and Gemini are for you. And if there are planets there.

My basic approach: SN DRAIN, NN GAIN.

So wherever the NN is where we can experience gains, and wherever the SN is where we can experience drains.

Here are some ideas to get you thinking.

**ARIES ASC**: gains in the third house, drains in the ninth. a period of community oriented endeavors, of letting new ideas permeate your daily life. less lusting after faraway places and lofty mindsets, but letting the here and now spark wonder

**TAURUS ASC**: gains in the second, drains in the eighth. personal income from your own personal endeavors. make right with what you owe people and get your head around your debt. retooling your beliefs around money and possession.

**GEMINI ASC**: gains in the first house, drains in the seventh. a period of coming into your own without seeing other people as a necessity in that journey. speaking up for yourself, face forward now, retooling which relationships are needed and which you can jettison

**CANCER ASC**: gains in the twelfth, drains in the sixth. the daily habits or jobs that once sustained you are becoming beige boring or broken. looking towards the metaphysical to bring back a sense of magic and wonder, and letting that seep into your routines

**LEO ASC**: gains in the eleventh, drains in the fifth. less about what personally makes you feel good and more about what you can bring to the community to make them feel good. creation needs an audience, be it a piece of work, art, a child or yourself. you may make lifelong friends and associates, time to find your tribe. mingle

**VIRGO ASC**: gains in the tenth, drains in the fourth. volume is turned up on your place on the world stage. opportunities to bolster your sense of purpose will be abound. you may have to say goodbye to staying small or staying hidden, and bloom past what your family expects of you. an end of the comfort zone.

**LIBRA ASC**: gains in the ninth, drains in the third. a period of travel, whether journeys of the mind or journeys in real life. commit knowing all there is to know and seeing all there is to see and practicing all there is to practice. this will expand your horizons. true wisdom requires time and a nimble mind. spiritual passages await

**SCORPIO ASC**: gains in the eighth house, drains in the second. your sense of personal insecurity will be made up for by the graciousness of others. a period of true sharing, investment, and resourceful intimacy. the ways that you waste money or valuables (your time and energy and patience too) will become apparent, and asking for help from others is your best bet

**SAG ASC**: gains in the seventh house, drains in the first. a period of relationships that can help you reevaluate who you are and where you‚Äôre going. not the loss of self sufficiency per se, but the ability to let others co-pilot this stretch

**CAP ASC**: gains in the sixth, drains in the twelfth. time to be more real world oriented. the isolation that serves you, the spiritual practices that unnerve you, these are to keep and help you become better in life, on the job, and for others. all the other psychic chatter, alienation, trauma, sabotage that does not bolster you must go. break down to build up, not to stay broken. this opens up new ways to be of service, to remain flexible in your duties, and to remain childlike and light as you approach each day

**AQUA ASC**: gains in the fifth, drains in the eleventh. social exhaust. extraneous friends. arsenals of acquaintances. groups and beliefs you have grown out of. time to spring clean your social networks. a true sense of belonging comes from authenticity of self, and all else that spring from that. opportunities for pleasure, joy, art, creation, romance and love remind you who you are and who is worth keeping around. your own best friend.

**PISCES ASC**: gains in the fourth, drains in the tenth. a place for solid roots, a home, a family. these are all themes that are of concern. it is less important that you be respected by the world, by your colleagues, than it is that you have a place to relax and retreat, to feel safe and secure, to delight in the smaller successes of comfort, a family dinner, a mortgage in your name, and a place to lay your head. you step down from an authority figure, and are content to just feel content. your mom, your dad, your home.

NOTE that the drain/gain paradigm isn‚Äôt black and white. There won‚Äôt be complete losses in one area so don‚Äôt expect that. Rather, a clearing up, drain, allows for the gains to have space to settle in. For example, Gemini rising draining of relationships that don‚Äôt serve gives Gemini rising the space to come into their own. Doesn‚Äôt mean all relationships are doomed.

The SN and NN work in tangent. No need to completely ignore or abhor or fear one in service of the other. The SN is the launching pad. The NN is where we go once launched.

Also remember that the Sag/Gem axis is one that is inherently cerebral in nature. It deals a lot with the mind. So Gemini information gather versus Sag ""I know it all"" is what is fundamentally at play here. At the end of this period, you will **KNOW** more about what there is for you to learn i.e. these changes could, for some, play out entirely in your brain.

607,ejmv7p,False,,102,Who/what is the Saturn in your life? Why it may not be as obvious and cliche as you think,astrology,"Approaching this upcoming notorious Saturn/Pluto conjunction, I have been seeing a lot of posts on different platforms talking about power and how to not give your power away to anyone else.  In other words, the real power comes from inside yourself, and anything coming from something outside yourself is limiting your own power.

At first glance, I always considered myself as someone who was ""above"" anything that would normally be perceived as authority.  For example, I have always seen my parents and older family members as equals to me.  And at work, I have always proudly considered myself to not be a victim of the manager's influence. Even when it came to taking drugs, I always knew confidently that I can live with or without them, and the choice was always up to me.

So when I would see these messages about not giving away your power, I would naturally think this doesn't really apply to me.  I could check that box off my ""to do"" list.

However, this past year, having done more internal work on my fears than ever before, I realized there had been an elephant in the room my entire life that I had been giving my power to.

The best way I can describe it is that I always felt I had been banished to live within certain limits.  Growing up in a lower middle class environment, I just always assumed that I was never going to be ""one of those"" people.  Some people lived a great life who got to have all of the nice things, with a family, a nice house, a nice car, and a job that they loved. But I was not one of those.

I created this ""phantom God"" in my mind, who limited my existence to where I could only live in apartments and work minimum wage jobs.  Maybe if I were really lucky, I would be able to even have a spouse that loved me.  But overall, I was to live in this small circle of limitations, and other people were living beyond the circle.

So when you think of who is really controlling you, it might not be as obvious as you think.  It might not be an authority figure that you can point to and say ""There! That's it!"".  It might be something much more ethereal and vague than you could have imagined consciously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ejmv7p/whowhat_is_the_saturn_in_your_life_why_it_may_not/,161,What does everyone think of Saturn in the 8th? ,2020-01-03 22:24:53

There is no much mistery about, I can resume in 3 rules.

- Don't lie to me. I don't like to lose time, have in mind that I'll try to love you. So be yourself. Don't try to impressionate me, I want to love you, cooperate. 

- I'm extremely monogamic, so don't cheat/betray me. I'm pretty much into anything that doesn't hurt this rule (everything has limits, and I don't want to use your toys). I'm yours, you're mine. Sound possessive, but I don't want control you, that's kinda much because in essence what turn me on is duality, duo, the couple idea. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Tristan and Isolde, I love the idea of partnership in love. So clingy girls makes me turned on. Well... Be ready if you are into me and is clingy... 

- Take responsibility for yourself. Or don't make me guilty for things that aren't actually my fault. Basically if something in me makes you feel bad indirectly, don't act like I'm guilty on your inner trauma. Ofc, I care a lot about how you feel, but I care even more about what makes you feel like that, so I won't be condecending. We'll talk and I'll try to understand you, help you and work on it with you. But you need to be honest with me and say me the truth on preference in a objective way, draw if necessary. If something makes you feel bad, I'll try destroy it at once. I want to protect you, so I think that act as a Terminator sometimes is good for that... Hasta l√° vista. 

If you're genuinely kind, you got 20% on way. 

Also, idc much about your body, you can looks like Jinx, Illaoi or Miss Fortune, just avoid be obese or anorexic, I'm not superman and neither want to break you. If you give me what I've wrote above I'll suck you mostly every day, just have hygienic habits, spend in soap, not in make up.

 I prefer if the girl is smart, has strong traditional values (I want a family, kids) and it's fair.There are some shallow stuff like be nerdy and wear glasses, but actually I'm mostly careless about (please, don't be dumb or shallow.)

966,9ha186,False,,17,Notes On The Upcoming Aries Full Moon and what it could mean for you (9/24/2018),astrology,"(I was inspired to make this a separate thread in response to my post in the ""what happened to the news!"" thread. I'm sorry if you're seeing this twice, but I've also added some new info).

I am looking forward to this Full Moon as a time of culmination and movement, but just as easily, for some, it could be a time to pause and reflect. Here's my take:

Happening at 2 degrees of Aries, opposing the Sun at 2 degrees of Libra, highlighting the axis of self and others. This will be a full moon that certainly deals with our relationships to others. Central theme: where do my needs fall in relation to the people in my life, where can compromise be made, what conversations needs to be had, what relationships need tending, and, what may need to end. Sounds dramatic, and opposing planets always kind of insert tension. Look to where Aries and Libra fall in your chart in order to get context. For example, the moon will hit my 11th house and oppose the sun in my 5th. A consideration for me: are the connections, groups and friends I have in balance with the pleasure and joy I seek to create and have? And it can happen in your life, or just be something your observe in others.

I'm looking forward to it especially because Mars rules this Full Moon, and Mars is finally direct. Where the summer had many of our desires and pursuits on pause (and for good reason if you used it as a time of planning and reflection), September 24th, to me, marks the official end of this holding pattern. Aries, cardinal fire, wants to start, to move, and its ruling planet is finally done taking a nap. I always set intentions for what I want to experience during any moon cycle, and for this one it is the courage to finally make some moves, have some chats, and get out there to get what I want (especially because its an 11th house theme for me). It brings a physicality to any manifestation work you've been doing during this summer of downtime.

(Remembering that Mars can rule the physical body and Aries has ties to the first house of self: will the relationship I've been desiring finally show up in the form of an actual human man?! Just a fun lil thought I'm having. What have you been trying to manifest into your physical reality?)

Retrograde Mars may have hidden our courageousness and assertiveness for some time, or just our passion/desire, and his implied marriage to this Full Moon could mark a return to feeling an emotional joie de vivre!

But anyway, Saturn, also newly direct, is in the picture as the focal point of a T Square between he, the Sun and the Moon. Sobering. But ensures a practicality. Mars is also in a nice aspect to Saturn, so it could be that actions taken are done so in a tactful way, with a dutiful eye on what the long-term implications will be (rather than just having rash Aries movement, Saturn tames the fire, but could just as easily douse the joy for some. Depends.). And then Saturn and Uranus continue to have a nice little tango. Marrying the Uranian nature of change and re-calibration, with the action of Mars and Aries, with the integrity and structure of Saturn says to me that whatever may be endeavored upon during this Full Moon will have legs, substance, and long-term dividends. Saturn being the focal point of the T-Square is also where we can look to ease any tension felt with this Sun-Moon opposition. So that is looking for your saving grace in being patient, mature, wise, and approaching whatever comes up with a healthy detachment and with a calm affect. Saturn is the long game. Full Moon emotions are transient. Let Saturn anchor you. If need be.

Two other things of note: Chiron and Mercury are also joining in on the conversation here. Chiron will be conj the moon, and Mercury conj Sun. Each forming vestigial little legs to the T-Square. Sun spotlights, and Mercury is communication. Again, what needs to be said, and to whom? Moon is emotional landscaping and Chiron are the wounds therein. Potential for hurtful communication, given or received? Yes. But also potential for HEALING communication, given or received. Or healing that eventually does come from a conversation had. Again, this Libra-Aries axis has me thinking this is relationship oriented. Mercury is also the mind, so these conversations could be happening internally.

Mars is also over the south node again, where he was for that Lunar Eclipse in Aquarius this summer on July 26-17. Very well could be a continuing theme for whatever was brought up then, and could be a time where it meets its ending and culmination. South Node again hinting to some emotional discomfort, but all the same an opportunity for healing and cleared karma.

Some logistical notes:

-This full moon may be felt more strongly by people with cardinal sign placements (especially personal planets) between the degrees of 0-9.

-A Libra New Moon is to follow on October 8th, providing fertile ground to begin, begin again or refresh any relationship woes (or relationship endings) that could be provoked by this Full Moon. Or, it may solidify and reinvest in what may have started. It will be ruled by a newly retrograde Venus. More on that later, maybe.

-This is a Harvest Full Moon, falling in line with the Autumnal Equinox. A new season, a new beginning. A Harvest Moon is, well, when things come to harvest, placing another emphasis on what is to be received, enjoyed, and started with this Full Moon after putting in the work, spiritual or otherwise. Time to eat the fruits of your labor after a nonsense summer!

I think that's it.  Thanks for indulging me this!

Where they want to be happy, they want everyone around them to be happy too. They genuinely feel when people aren't happy and it affects them very negatively.

934,fbjuy0,False,,91,Astrological indicators that can point towards someone being a procrastinator,astrology,"When I think of procrastination, I think of Mars in Pisces and Mars in the 12th house (low energy), Mars in Libra (indecisive), Moon in Taurus (slow to act, too comfortable, not motivated), Moon in Gemini (disorganized, not focused, wants to do everything at the same time).

What sign placements or house placements or aspects do you associate with procrastination?",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fbjuy0/astrological_indicators_that_can_point_towards/,94,"Neptune is a big one. I have mars in Scorpio in the eighth house as my chart ruler. This is supposed to give someone a really strong drive and endurance to do anything your passionate and committed to. However moon conjunct Neptune is one of my strong aspects (0 degree orb) and I have found this makes me COMPULSIVELY DAYDREAM about EVERYTHING I want to do more so instead of actually doing it. Pisces is also the ruler of my 12th house but I don‚Äôt really understand yet if that has even more significance with the moon Neptune aspect and it increasing procrastination tendencies. 
But moon conjunct Neptune makes for a very very sensitive person in every aspect and way there is to be sensitive. So in that case it can increase escapism behaviour - drugs, daydreaming, etc. 

However I have also noticed on the high side of this Neptune/Pisces aspect in a chart - if the person turns to surrendering to a higher power (which can be hard to understand until you actually experience surrendering to a higher power) amazing results can show in the persons life.

851,8t79nq,False,,47,CANCER SEASON SURVIVAL GUIDE,astrology,"Cancer season (June 22-July 23) is wonderful - it marks the beginning of summer, and if navigated correctly, it can be a great period of positive internal change. But it's also known for its emotional messiness and general turmoil, and it can be especially rough for people who lack water placements in their chart. However, I believe that if one uses each season's unique conditions to grow and adapt, they can create a cycle of positivity throughout their entire life! So, using my experience with the zodiac seasons, I will give you some tips on how to turn this messy season into a positive one! 

1. Spend Time With Loved Ones. This season can bring on an onslaught of insecurities, fears, and emotions that you may have never realized you had, and may have trouble understanding. And the instinct for many people (especially air-dominant and mutable-dominant people) may be to isolate themselves until the storm passes, so that no one else has to deal with them. But in excess, isolation can become extremely detrimental! You must remember - everyone around you is experiencing the same energies you are. Yes, it would be less than ideal to call your friend at 1 AM crying; but Cancer season is a time where emotional vulnerability makes strong bonds even stronger, and loved ones can help each other heal. So if you're feeling moody or lonely, consider talking to a friend or loved one. You never know - they may be feeling the exact same way.

2. Get Some Alone Time. I know this directly contradicts the previous tip, but I believe balance is important, especially if you're extroverted and don't often think to give yourself alone time. The emotions that surface this season have a purpose, which is to show you subconscious problems you need to resolve. And in order to solve these problems, you have to spend some time with yourself, looking within. This takes practice, and it's not always pleasant, but it always leads to better self awareness.

3. Remember That Your Expectations Affect Your Reality. During this season, people are especially vulnerable to negative mindsets. But if you walk into a situation believing it will be terrible, it will inevitably be terrible. This applies to everything from running errands to your self image. So, try to catch those pessimistic assumptions early on. Even if it feels like a total lie, keep telling yourself that it's better than you think it is, that it's just the season's energy making you feel that way. And you may be surprised that things aren't half as catastrophic as you think they are! (Of course, it doesn't always work - but it helps retain your sanity.)

4. Be Open to Change. Cancer season is a time of emotional vulnerability, but a lesser known source of the turmoil is Saturn Retrograde, which often occurs at the same time. This is a time where one must learn harsh lessons in order to grow, often causing misfortunes of all kinds, of varying intensities. There are few ways to prepare you for these harsh lessons - except to remember that change has purpose. No matter how bad you feel, you must always remember that this experience is teaching you something valuable, be it strength, honesty, trust, or selflessness. Sometimes, the only way out is through.

I have a firm belief that every season has a purpose in the cycle of internal growth. And Cancer season may be a lot to handle, but it is essential in developing inner clarity and strengthening bonds, and because of that, we would be worse off without it. Best of luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/8t79nq/cancer_season_survival_guide/,106,Thank you for this! Cheers. ,2018-06-23 03:37:12

368,ervycq,False,,99,Observation regarding fire signsüî•,astrology,"I decided to share this little note I wrote on my blog a while ago because I think fire signs are a little misunderstood.

*Disclaimer: these are my personal thoughts and observations. I am a fire sign myself.*

Fire & water are right-brained elements, which means that they are both inclined to be very creative (fact often overlooked when it comes to fire signs for some reason) & that they both deal with really strong emotions.¬†The difference is that water feelings run deep, while fire feelings burn out quickly.

People often portray fire signs as impulsive & volatile. One moment they‚Äôre mad, the next they‚Äôre laughing. It‚Äôs not because we‚Äôre unstable or inconsistent. It makes sense when you think about it. Fire, out of all elements, is the only one that can be created by hand. It‚Äôs there, then it‚Äôs not. It burns, but only to a point. Our emotions are the same.

Fire is candid and simplistic. A feeling is just what it is: a feeling. We feel it and we let it go. We don‚Äôt swim in it like water signs do. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not inclined to hold grudges like earth signs do either. And to be honest, we're oddly sensitive to other people's energies too. Why? because fire engulfs everything around it when set free. Of course, it depends on the person‚Äôs other placements too, but that‚Äôs fire at its purest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/ervycq/observation_regarding_fire_signs/,275,I disagree.

124,d4cvd2,False,,83,Alternative animal symbols for the Zodiac signs.,astrology,"Aries- Wild Boar- Historically associated with the Greek god Ares (Mars to the Romans). The boar has long symbolised courage, ferocity and conflict as well as confronting life‚Äôs challenges and never retreating. Boars are frequently associated with warriors and many of the Norse berserkers channeled boars in battle. The fierce independent spirit of Aries is unrivalled. ¬†

Taurus- Elephant. Gentle giants. Endurance, stability, loyalty, protection and abundance are associated with elephants, who are also matriarchal animals, fitting for a sign ruled by Venus and the exaltation of the Moon. Elephants form strong loving bonds with each other and have a responsibility over the natural world (Taurus connection to nature) due to their size.¬†They are the stewards of the Earth. 

Gemini- Parrot- Bright, quick, colourful birds. They are experts at mimicking sounds, often to comedic effect, and are highly social. They are winged messengers. They have strong associations with language, clarity, intellect, whimsy, playfulness and the power of words in speaking the truth. Above all they are fun, lively and witty. (Another good symbol for Gemini is the trickster fox- but I ultimately felt a bird was more appropriate.)¬†

Cancer- Sea Turtle- The ancient Babylonian symbol for Cancer. Soft, gentle, tender animals with a hard protective shell (home on it‚Äôs back) and the ability to move between water and land. Emotional strength is their gift as well as true understanding and guardianship. In many cultures turtles are symbols of motherhood, creation, fertility and longevity, and have long been associated with the Moon as hatchlings use the moonlight to find their way off the beach and make their way to the ocean.¬†

Leo- Peacock- Regal, proud, ostentatious. The peacock is a well known symbol of royalty, the most spectacular of birds. Glory, confidence, vibrancy, expression and nobility come under it‚Äôs associations, as well as integrity. Like Leo‚Äôs you can‚Äôt take your eyes of a peacock, who uses its tail feathers to impress and draw attention. In the ancient world peacock feathers were frequently engraved onto the thrones of royalty.¬†

Virgo- Cat- Virgo is strongly associated with domesticated animals but the cat is the most Virgoan to me. Cats are astute, observant, independent, self-contained, selective, solitary and watchful. They meticulously groom and clean themselves and their owners can feel like they hate them (Virgo's resting bitch face). They can be downright mean but they secretly care underneath it all and feel the need to assist when others don‚Äôt meet their standards (cats hunting mice for their incompetent owners).¬†

Libra- Swan- A bird that is the symbol of love, grace, harmony and beauty. Swans are universally known for their elegance (they are evoked often in ballet- which is ruled by Venus/Libra) and their devotion to each other as swan couples mate for life. Their curved necks come together to create a love heart, cementing them as a symbol of romance, union, partnership and reconciliation. In mythology the swan was attributed to Aphrodite/ Venus.¬†

Scorpio- Serpent- An ancient symbol for Scorpio, and one I actually think fits better than the Scorpion. A much maligned and feared creature, they are venomous and capable of shedding their old skins. Since ancient times this has led to serpents being associated with death, rebirth, transformation and the purging and elimination of the old. Poised and coiled they conserve their energy for the fatal strike. The kundalini is a strong connection between these two as well as the fact that many species of serpent are aquatic- fitting for a water sign.¬†

Sagittarius- Wild Horse- This one is slightly cheating as Sagittarius is already symbolised by a half-horse centaur, however no animal comes close to representing Sagittarius better than the wild horse. Freedom, movement, exploration, journeys, nobility and victory. The wild horse lives without limitation or restraint, roaming under vast skies, much like Sagittarius. They refuse to be tamed.¬†

Capricorn- Crocodile- The animal associated with Capricorn in Vedic astrology, the crocodile is ancient, hard, stern, patient, powerful, resilient and conserving of it‚Äôs energy and resources. Wisdom that comes with time is attributed to crocodiles along with Saturn, Capricorns ruler. The crocodile is cold blooded, armoured and intimidating, a creature to be respected and feared. Ultimately they are built to outlast all others.¬†

Aquarius- Human Being- Many people like to forget that we are animals, but we are, and the human is the only animal that can accurately represent Aquarius- the sign of humanity. Humans are noted for our intellect, inventiveness, development of technologies and our many complex social behaviours. We are the animals with the greatest vision for the future.¬†

Pisces- Whale- The peaceful leviathans of the oceans, symbolising solitude, deep wisdom, compassion and the mysteries of consciousness which we cannot fathom. Whales are symbolically sensitive to all ‚Äúwaters"" and open to embracing the unknown, surrendering to higher powers. Whales are shy and have an elusive magic to them, but when seen they are awe-inspiring. The whale is a true, soulful representative of the vastness of the ocean and of Pisces.¬†

This is the roughest week of the year, and take careful note - we'll have some themes from this week repeating in late autumn and early winter, from November-January, so write in your journals!

*Summary:*

Starting off this transit we have [***Saturn retrograde in Capricorn***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/saturn-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-29-september-18/) **sextile Neptune**, bringing the support of father figures and superiors into this lifting fog. You can rest assured you will have strong support through this trial. With [***Jupiter retrograde in Sagittarius***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/jupiter-retrograde-in-sagittarius-horoscope-april-10th-august-11th/) making a **square** to **Neptune**, however, be mindful that you should not trade one addiction for another. You may be tempted to trade a smoking addiction for a gambling addiction, for example.

This is a great time to delve into spiritual pursuits, such as divination or meditation, to help you move forward and heal with clarity now at your disposal. This is going to be a gentle reminder that we cannot run away from our pasts forever, and that we must find a healthy way to overcome our fears and paranoias.

The mysterious shadows in the fog are often more frightening than their true forms.

923,a83nj6,False,,79,Saturn is about to move in to 10¬∞ alignment with Pluto...,astrology,"... and financial markets have seen the worst December decline since the Great Depression, protests are on the rise in Europe, and tensions are growing between China and North America.

In chapter 5 of his book *Cosmos and Psyche*, Richard Tarnas describes Saturn/Pluto periods as

""... especially challenging historical periods marked by a pervasive quality of intense *contraction:* eras of international crisis and conflict, empowerment of reactionary forces and totalitarian impulses, organized violence and oppression, all sometimes marked by lasting traumatic effects. An atmosphere of gravity and tension tended to accompany these three-to-four-year periods, as did a widespread sense of epochal closure: ‚Äúthe end of an era,‚Äù ‚Äúthe end of innocence,‚Äù the destruction of an earlier mode of life that in retrospect may seem to have been marked by widespread indulgence, decadence, na√Øvet√©, denial, and inflation.""

The First World War, Second World War, 9/11, First Crusade, founding of the Ku Klux Klan, and the rise of fascism/totalitarianism in Europe in the 20's (Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler) are just a handful of the examples Tarnas gives of this archetypal complex manifesting in history... Yikes.

Obviously the first thing that comes mind when thinking of present-day manifestations is the Trump phenomenon, along with the growing polarisation in geopolitics marked by strong nationalistic and anti-globalisation/anti-immigration tendencies. Since Trump has taken office astrologers have all been quick to point out that the apex of this Saturn/Pluto cycle is falling directly opposite of his natal Saturn.

I'm also interested in whether all this debacle around finance keeps up much longer, especially given that we're still at the tail end of the Uranus/Pluto square (remember, the 2008 crash happened during a Saturn/Uranus/Pluto alignment). Once this Saturn/Pluto conjunction really starts cooking Uranus will finally move in to Taurus, which brings financial matters even more in to the equation. I'm starting to wonder whether grandmaster Saturn intends on inspecting the stability of the global capitalist order....

Personally, I will be bracing myself, as this sucker is lighting me up. I would advise everyone else to check whether 22¬∞ Capricorn is a sensitive part of your chart, and prepare accordingly :P

681,9fdjz6,False,,61,"Playing with fire, about fire signs (Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) and their differences.",astrology,"**Sun signs don‚Äôt mean everything, in fact this is also having to do with the sign in its raw power as well as how it can be associated with other planets.**

I am going to do a few of these but wanted to start off with fire signs first due to some unique reasons.

**Apparently they are considered among the most ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù**

Aries is considered to be the most masculine sign out there, not saying this is a good or bad thing, followed closely by Leo. Sags are right behind them which makes fire signs the most masculine, not saying that this is a good or even a bad thing. Cancer which is the most feminine sign which is why it is associated with being more motherly. I found it unique in the sense that these signs express themselves more openly but I will get more into how they are different about it.

**In terms of how we typically think of astrology, which is sun signs, Leo is domiciled in the sun while Aries is exalted**

I am sure by now most of us are all too familiar with the words domicile and exalt but if you aren‚Äôt, you should probably look those up as that will also be mentioned. So while Leo is supposedly the ideal placement for a sun sign like Capricorn is for Saturn and Libra is for Venus, Aries is the sun expressed at its greatest extent which is its exaltation. It never really gets mentioned for some reason in astrology and I actually had to look it up, for a while I never knew that the sun had any domiciles or exalts.

**Now lets get to the differences I‚Äôve noticed between the signs and how it plays to their nature.**

**1 - Aries is a ball of raw energy that is fearless yet it moves on.**

I‚Äôve rarely known an Aries to do things like holding a grudge or holding on to things in general unless their chart had other placements that would indicate such a thing. An Aries is the kind of person where if you piss them off, they‚Äôll punch you in the face or chew you out then and there, after that they will just forget about it. In terms of examples, think of Aries as almost being child-like in a good way, they tend to go head-on and not care too much about what may happen, the true example of fearlessness.

In worst cases, it can mean some drunk guy at a bar who will pick a fight with anyone but in the best cases, it means a freedom fighter or someone that comes up with a brilliant idea in tough times. Unlike a lot of the other signs, expect for Aries to tell you what is on their mind then and there. I find them to be very forgiving compared to the other fire signs.

While the popular idea is that Leos (more on them later) are people persons, in reality I find that Aries tend to have a lot of friends and be popular because they just don‚Äôt care all that much, especially in younger ages where bold behavior is admired. 

**2- Leos might be fearless but they plan a lot more, never forget and can get away with a lot, it speaks to the nature of them being a fixed sign.**

In terms of pure raw energy, Leos cannot match Aries and they also do care a bit more about what others think of them yet they‚Äôll always do things they set their minds to. There are a lot of misconceptions about this sign but the one thing I have often found to be true about them is that they are very good at reading people. While flattery can get on their good side, they can often tell if it is fake or genuine. I‚Äôll say of all the fire signs, Leos are tactical in that they will see things through to the very end, for better or worse, and speaking of that‚Ä¶.

One thing I‚Äôll note about Leo heavy charts is that there is a lot of class and upscale type of vibe associated with them, its tough to explain in words alone but if you know enough Leos you just sense that.

I would say that Leo is the only sign that will not only hold a grudge for the longest of time but unlike other signs who just think about it but rarely act (e.g.:  Scorpios which is pretty much an all bark no bite type of sign), they will always act on it. To make matters even worse for someone, they almost always get away with doing a lot of damage to people as we have famously seen with politicians and celebrities that have this placement. Even if they smile in your face and pretend to forgive, they‚Äôll always carry out their revenge behind closed doors, always. 

Getting on a Leo‚Äôs bad side is the equivalent of a king repeatedly stabbing you with a sword as the crowd cheers, they‚Äôll get the world to turn on you and hit you where it hurts, hard. Compared to other fire signs, they‚Äôre not above fighting dirty but unlike other signs that also fight dirty (e.g. Scorpio), they‚Äôll look clean doing it. 

At worst, I would say a character that embodies a Leo well is Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars, very good at scheming and often the cruel sign out there when angry that is creative in making someone‚Äôs life miserable. At their best, I see them as a sign that is capable of inspiring a lot of people through a lot of the better qualities that are associated with the sign.

Of all the signs, this is the last one you would to offend outside of maybe Capricorn. Word of advice, do not offend their ego.

**3 - Sagittarius are the old souls among fire signs, wise beyond their years and the most resourceful.**

A Sagittarius can get itself out of the worst situations and also has the power to make the most out of a bad situation. I have found that of all the signs out there, they tend to travel a great deal. Initially I thought that Gemini was the sign that traveled but it is actually Sagittarius in a natal chart that indicates a person is the type to travel a lot.

Of all the fire signs, I have Sagittarius to be the most open minded and free to trying new things. I have also found that this is the one sign who can be your enemy one day but if they see it beneficial to be friends with you, they will be friends with you. It is a sign I think should be embodied by diplomacy and fairness.

Now I have found this sign to be wise beyond their years, for some reason I noticed a lot of my college professors had this sign. Imagine a cafe with people talking about intellectual things an average mind cannot grasp, without question it is Sagittarius territory. The sign is almost like a sage in some ways, the voice of reason in a room.

Edit: Made some updates to Scorpio and Libra. Thank you for the criticism! 

Edit 2: made some updates to Aries, cancer, Gemini, Taurus, leo, and Pisces.

*Scorpio Rising*: This world and the people in it are cruel, evil, manipulative, harsh, scary, and conniving. So I have to be (insert traits of mars sign here) to survive.

*Mars in Aries*: Direct, confrontational, violent even, physically fit, ambitious, arrogant, impatient, and masculine. (Dignified because aries traits will help the native flourish in the real world when going after what he or she wants. Mars in aries with Scorpio risings tend to overuse force and are very very blunt. They purposefully push other people away by being this way because they don‚Äôt want their soft side to be shown cuz they‚Äôre afraid to be seen as weak. Temper problems. The most angry combo ever. Will probably physically fight you if you get in their face. You wanna talk to them but you may think that they don‚Äôt like anyone. Confrontational. RESTING BITCH FACE. Men may be very violent. Lift weights to scare ppl off. Will tell you how it is and not give a fuck. Threats. Mean. The only thing that holds em back is themselves and they hate that. Hates being politically correct. ‚ÄúFuck your feelings‚Äù. Cynical when it concerns others, optimistic when it comes to themselves. Black and red. Physically resilient. Self-involved. Doesn‚Äôt fear death. Doesn‚Äôt believe in others. Selfish but they believe their justified because they see others as selfish too. Will snap at the drop of a hat. Will self-destruct and hurt everyone around them if they don‚Äôt care. Warriors in every sense. On the inside very scared but is aggressive to compensate. TOO INTENSE AND PASSIONATE. Sex with them is probably an experience. You might have to tell them to calm down in bed lol. Lose themselves in sex, work, and their ambitions easily. People don‚Äôt fuck with them. are childlike softies at heart. Can actually be happy and social but gets tired easily doing that. This is my mars and it‚Äôs incredibly accurate)

*Mars in Taurus*: Sensual, physically appealing, patient, chill, careful, stubborn, and possessive. (In detriment because Taurus traits do not come in handy when trying to tackle issues head on because Taurus is a more steady, feet on ground type of sign and really wouldn‚Äôt mesh well with Scorpio/Aries as an ascendant. Probably loves sex and intimacy. Very patient. Silent. Smile in your face but they know whats up. Suspicious of others so they‚Äôre probably distant but are relaxed overall. Could have very quiet, deep, and beautiful voices idk. Probably hefty or a little on the heavy side.)

*Mars in Gemini*: Talkative, mentally agile, argumentative, restless, friendly to many, close to no one, and mischievous. (Mars in Gemini with Scorpio risings could be veeerrry good at lying. Like extremely good. When mad, they probably will say some seriously fucked up shit. Liars. Scheming. Won‚Äôt steal from you outright, but will probably tell you a lie to get your money. Cheaters. ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs a game but it‚Äôs not fair, I‚Äôll break the rules and I won‚Äôt care.‚Äù Will say some fucked up shit just to get a reaction out of you. Funny dark humor. Always up to no good.)

*Mars in Cancer*: Persistent, strong-willed but not imposing, touchy, protective of those you love, family oriented, reserved, security-oriented (in fall because cancer traits does not do well when forced to interact with the outside world. Mars in cancers with Scorpio risings tend to be verry introverted to the point where it‚Äôs scary. Silent. Fuck with their loved ones and they‚Äôll see to it that you‚Äôll pay. Manipulators from behind the scenes. Probably get others to do dirty work for em. Offputting in public.)

*Mars in Leo*: Flamboyant, ego-driven, masculine, cheerful, friendly, funny, dramatic, and generous (Leos with Scorpio risings tend to pride themselves on being the ‚Äúlight of the world‚Äù. They kind of feel like it‚Äôs their duty to make people happy in this dark and cruel world. My mars is in fifth house so I can vouch lol. Won‚Äôt beat around the bush when interacting with others. If you make them angry the whole world will know. Not as bad as mars Aries with Scorpio rising because Leo‚Äôs are overall more chill but still it‚Äôs probably best not to fuck with em. They look more imposing than Aries with Scorpio rising too. Well-built and muscular. Contained in themselves. PASSIONATE. Hates that they love love. Wants attention but at the same time will be relatively silent. This probably will be evident in their flashy but dark clothing style. Black and gold. Will make black flashy and glamorous. 

*Mars in Virgo*: Calculating, nit-picky, practical, logical, detail-oriented, responsible, and conservative. (Virgo mars ppl with Scorpio risings ain‚Äôt fun at parties. In fact don‚Äôt take them anywhere. I swear they will point out every flaw both physical and personal with everything they come into contact with. You‚Äôll genuinely wonder how they‚Äôre even able to smile or laugh cuz all they seem to do is be so negative about everything. Venus or mercury in a positive sign would offset these tendencies tho)

*Mars in Libra*: Diplomatic, feminine, non-confrontational, graceful, tactful, possibly physically good-looking, and emotionally distant. (In detriment in mars cuz libran traits don‚Äôt do well when going after what you want. Mars Libras with Scorpio risings tend to be in denial about how they see the world and try to see it more positively but, due to that denial, the unfortunate things that keep happening to them repeatedly prove them otherwise. They want to be beautiful in this ugly, cruel world.

*Mars in Scorpio*: Cruel, reserved, mysterious, blunt, honest, passive-aggressive, ambitious, and very sexual. (Dignified because scorpio traits can help you when trying to go after what you want, or when trying to just get by. Mars Scorpios with Scorpio risings are kinda tragic imo. Like every Scorpio rising they probably found out that the world isn‚Äôt what they thought it was but instead of being direct and confrontational with the world like Aries with Scorpio asc, they‚Äôve become what they fear in the world in order to survive. These natives are way better at hiding their soft side compared to aries with Scorpio asc, because they‚Äôve lost themselves in their own world. They dont force themselves upon anything like an Aries w/ Scorpio asc would. They just... survive by becoming their enemy. Very sad. they could also be the exact opposite due to Scorpios tendency to be very extreme. Not necessarily happy go lucky, but content with themselves and their animal instincts. They may embrace their animalistic side and see nothing wrong with it. Dark humor. Could view society as too secretive and mysterious. 

*Mars in Sagittarius*: Cheerful, jolly, lucky, friendly, detached, honest, goofy, and wise (Sagittarius with Scorpio risings tend to want to make people lighten up around them because they know how fucked up the world can be however they don‚Äôt pride themselves on it like Leo mars with Scorpio asc would. They just want to share their happiness with this cruel world.

*Mars in Capricorn*: Reserved, logical, hardworking, responsible, ambitious, patient, and unemotional (exalted cause Capricorn traits have the native do enough to achieve his goals but not necessarily flourish as fast as  like Scorpio and Aries because of their patience and slowness, however they probably won‚Äôt make as many mistakes as them either. Mars Capricorn‚Äôs with Scorpio asc tend to be very detached from people and focused on their work. However if they like you they‚Äôll stick by you no matter what. They probably choose not to go out much and aren‚Äôt necessarily buzz kills. They‚Äôre just kinda grumpy and awkward.

*Mars in Aquarius*: emotionally Detached, logical, unemotional yet considerate of others in their groups, talkative, unique in their own ways, very chill, and friendly. (Mars in Aquarius with Scorpio risings tend to be so damn chill and funny to be around. Very witty people. But also very detached like they fear getting serious with people. But they‚Äôll talk about societal issues with so much passion cuz that Scorpio Ascendant has a hand in how they see the world.)

*Mars in Pisces*: Emotional, sensitive, empathetic, kind, adaptable, hospitable, and somewhat physically detached from human beings. (I honestly don‚Äôt know why this position isn‚Äôt falling in mars. These people are worse than libras and Taurus when it comes to trying to live on their own and they can be easily taken advantage of due to their kind nature. INTUITIVE AS FUCK. PSYCHIC. will be able to tell what‚Äôs wrong with you EASILY. To the point where it‚Äôs scary. These people need to be protected. ESPECIALLY if their rising sign is in scorpio. Scorpio risings already see the world as too much for them but couple that with a mars in Pisces and this combo can make this person very depressed. Mars Pisces with Scorpio risings could avoid the world altogether and just be drug addicts or monks or something. These people know how weak they could Be to others so they need ppl by their side at all costs. Not even that, but these ppl NEED some type of emotional support when shit gets real for them. And it does. Often. They also need to have a good home probably with some good books or movies or something to get their mind off shit. Love these ppl tho Pisces are so cool


Thanks for reading. 

Disclaimer: this post was written with the pure 100% scorpio rising and the pure mars in Aries Taurus Gemini and so on in mind. If you are not mars or Pluto dominant or heavily influenced by whatever sign your mars is in, the following could not apply. mercury, sun, and Venus in different signs could offset the described traits too. If you are female, you will likely express your Venus sign more easily than your mars sign. Men are more likely to relate to this more than women are due to how easily men express their mars.

552,bf0qap,False,,73,In Celebration of the Aries Season...,astrology,"Let‚Äôs do some fun facts about our beloved rams to close the season off:

Aries (mostly Sun, Mars, Moon, Rising) could give a fuck what anyone thinks about them, they‚Äôll do what they want. Unlike most other signs, they are uninhibited by social standards and will do and say things that will shock others because of how raw and uncensored they are. 

Aries love to laugh! Leo‚Äôs are known to laugh a lot, but Aries is up there too. Especially if you have Sun in Aries or Aries in 5th house. They seem super serious at first glance (especially the men) so this catches ppl off guard.

Aries, along with Sags and Leos, can make the room burst with laughter. Though, all the fire signs have different ways of making people laugh. When an Aries tells jokes, their brutal honesty and slapstick is what makes them so funny. Sun in Aries/Aries in 5th house can make fun of themselves a lot! 

You can‚Äôt censor an Aries. They will eventually speak up and won‚Äôt even consider the consequences. 

Aries may be heartbreakers, but they‚Äôll never, ever lie or play games with you. They‚Äôll tell you what they want right from the beginning. They literally have no time to waste trying to keep up a lie.

You will never see an Aries involved in drama for too long. These people shut shit down as soon as they see something that needs addressing. They are known for ‚Äúsolving‚Äù conflicts immediately after becoming aware of them. 

...but the way they solve conflicts are by being violent, brash, and loud. but hey, it is the fastest way to solve em! (Mars, Rising, Mercury and sun in Aries most likely)

When an Aries fails, they get pissed, but oddly energized at the same time. They truly see failure as an opportunity to grow and learn. These people are very positive.

An Aries (especially the men) will look you in the eye for a very long time and it‚Äôll be very unsettling. Aries know they can come across this way, but they don‚Äôt want to appear weak, so they‚Äôll keep staring!

If you stare back, they‚Äôll have a tremendous amount of respect for you. (Another reason why Leos and Aries are best buds)

They have firm handshakes. Even the women will have firm handshakes and will take you by surprise.

Contrary to popular belief, Aries, especially the men, are solitary by nature. Despite their energetic and extroverted nature, they don‚Äôt like being around a lot of people for a long period of time. It exhausts then. They love being by themselves which is why a lot of Aries are single.

Another unpopular fact, Aries don‚Äôt care about outside attention much. They‚Äôll put on a show, sure, but after it‚Äôs over, leave them alone. They‚Äôre not like Leos who love to bask in the attention. An Aries will love the compliments and the attention, but they can see through people who are just trying to kiss up to them. Not only that, but they‚Äôll feel like they have to move onto another thing they wanna do after awhile. 

Aries feels with great intensity. When happy, they jump for joy, when sad, they get on their knees and scream about how the world is so unfair, when mad... they end up paying for some damage.

Most of this is because they are the infants of the zodiac. Everything they feel is new to them, time and time again.

Because of this, Aries easily identifies with children. Probably a little bit too much; they sometimes even act like a kid. (Jumping on things they‚Äôre not supposed to be on, eating too fast and getting a stomach ache, laughing at inappropriate things, being unapologetically honest yet non malicious) more mature signs find themselves having to be a parent to an Aries and remind them to not say or do stupid things when in the moment.

Aries have this odd mixture of masculine and boyish/girly physical traits. Have you ever seen a guy who looks very manly but at the same time, boyish and childlike? Or maybe a very ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù looking lady who can also look really girly and young? Chances are you‚Äôve ran into an Aries! 

Aries love sports. Weightlifting, boxing, football, hockey, anything that has to do with putting their body under stress. They get a thrill out of it.

Speaking of which, Aries like pain if it means they are growing from it. 

Despite this, they hate pain they see as a waste of time and will be quite the baby about it. Dentists, getting shots, a pulled muscle, everyone hates these things but an Aries LOATHES them.

Aries listens to their body which is why so many of them are so healthy. They are in tune with their physical selves. 

Aries don‚Äôt feel fear until after the fact. Their impulsiveness tends to get them into a lot of hairy situations. 

Aries, when confronted, feel an exhilarating rush and in response, will do or say something that can easily escalate the confrontation. They can‚Äôt help it though, they feel so energized when shit gets real.

That being said, if this energy is misplaced, an Aries will find itself very, very anxious. Bordering on disorder levels. To avoid this, Aries should get a lot of exercise to have their energy flow evenly.

Aries (Leos too) are those people who are a little bit too happy at work. They can‚Äôt help it though; they love being productive. The way they see it, they could spend their day moping around doing nothing or spend it getting paid!

Aries are simply born to be. Leos were born to create, Scorpios were born to transform, libras were born to harmonize, but Aries? Aries are just here to exist. There‚Äôs no deep, complicated message behind Aries‚Äô existence. They‚Äôre just... here. 

Aries hate gossip. They always wonder why people complain instead of taking action and solving the issue. 

Don‚Äôt bring the ‚Äútea‚Äù to an Aries. They really don‚Äôt give a fuck and do not have time to waste listening about how bad your life is if you‚Äôre not making any effort to fix it yourself.

Aries love stories that are based around the underdog winning, tragic beginnings and happy endings, and people who keep moving forward no matter what life throws at them. Aries get hyped up just hearing about them!

Nobody will stick up for you like an Aries will. As long as you‚Äôre making efforts to better yourself and your life, an Aries will be your ride or die.

But if you‚Äôre lazing around not doing shit, don‚Äôt expect an Aries to care. 

Aries don‚Äôt play that passive aggressive shit. If it‚Äôs not worth you saying to their face, then why should it be worth Aries‚Äô time?

Aries men don‚Äôt talk much. They let their actions in life speak for them.

Aries women are more intimidating than the men because they aren‚Äôt afraid to get in your face. In fact, they may be LOOKING for conflict.

All Aries, even the men, have this sassy attitude about them. The men can flawlessly have this attitude while still remaining masculine. 

An Aries will observe your actions before they listen to your words. Despite their apparent gullibility, when focused on someone, they can be as discriminating and judgmental as a Scorpio. They just choose not to be most of the time because they believe everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt. Much like Scorpios, can easily see through bullshit. 

Aries are simple, not shallow. They won‚Äôt hang with people based on status and rank. They don‚Äôt kiss ass, quite the opposite really. They may even go out of their way to remind ppl of higher status that they are still a person who bleeds the same blood as them.

Aries will dine with Kings and vagabonds alike and will treat them the same too.

Aries always DO something with their feelings. When angry, they may punch a wall and go to the gym to lift to clear their heads. When sad, they may hit the books hard and get an A on an assignment. 

An Aries HATES wasting time.

The reason why Aries are so impatient and productive is because at one point in their past, they were really lazy and probably suffered the consequences of it. Now they go hard and won‚Äôt stop!

Aries love hard.

Aries have their heads so far up their own asses that they literally don‚Äôt even see other people. They need to be snapped out of it sometimes.

Aries sniffs their own farts. Not even joking.

If you‚Äôre trying to better your life, an Aries needs you as their companion. When they see others bettering themselves, not only will Aries push you and support you, but they will also take steps to making their lives better too.

Aries believe in the law of attraction. If you say it, it‚Äôll happen.

The worst thing you can say to an Aries is ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù. Second worst is ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù.

The best thing you can say to an Aries is ‚ÄúWell done.‚Äù

Because they rule the face, An Aries has a very expressive one. People can tell what they are feeling just based on their face.

Aries have gotten into so many quarrels that they think conflict and fights are apart of life. They‚Äôre right though!

Grab yourself an Aries today and tell them that they‚Äôve made amazing progress in their lives so far and that you have faith in them!!! The more sensitive ones will probably choke up a little bit. The tougher ones still won‚Äôt be able to hide their intense appreciation for what you said. 

If you genuinely support them 100%, an Aries will support you 110% and eliminate any obstacle that stands in your way.

The whole world could stand against an Aries, but if an Aries thinks he‚Äôs right, then he‚Äôs prepared to die.

It honestly doesn‚Äôt matter how many people stand in Aries‚Äô way, they will keep trying no matter what. They‚Äôd rather die than to give up on life.

Aries will keep falling and getting back up, again and again. 

Aries don‚Äôt care about your past! Make something of yourself now!

Aries don‚Äôt need your love. In fact, they may be too busy focusing on themselves to even notice you! ‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/bf0qap/in_celebration_of_the_aries_season/,184,"Aries are cool as long as they don't ""bully"" and they learn to control their temper.

971,a8m0mm,False,,15,The best christmas Present: an end to Retrograde Season,astrology,"This retrograde season has made a profound impact on me. I actually got into astrology just before it kicked off with Mar's reverse motion in the summer (which, though exciting and even reckless at times, seemed to last forever!). I had a chance to remember what type of active energy really gives me the thrill of living to the fullest. I went back to basics and found many of my peers and friends (and even literary characters!) to be excellent mentors and role models for my strengthening Mars aspect. Mars retrograde was a profound, prolonged wake up call after a few years where I had become outwardly passive and inwardly paralyzed. You don't know what you are capable of until you really test yourself!

Next Venus came along. The retrograde kicked off with me bungling a promising affair with a beautiful yet much younger vixen. After not having dated for years, the terrible, nightly self-inflicted pain of losing 'what could have been' ate at me until I stared deeply enough into it to find the treasure it had for me: I had to admit, finally and fully, that I had no idea what 'relationship' really meant. I had cultural ideas of the idea relationship, but I had never been brave enough to find my own relationship bliss. Venus also helped me become aware of just HOW MANY relationships we have in our lives, with people, pets, ideas, vices, habits, objects -- everything is in relationship. This realization is just a step away from the holy grail, enlightenment, oneness, normality -- whatever you want to call it. Venus deserves the attention we heap upon her.

And finally, Mercury. The mind. Through my later 20s, I felt like parts of my brain became less and less accessible to me. It wasn't a total loss: I became intensely perceptive of subtle energies. The flows that drive so much yet normally pass conscious attention. But the basic, lucid mental functioning required of anyone who wishes to convey a point, was slipping away from me. I am a Gemini Sun, my natal Mercury is in Gemini, and this loss of focus and mental discipline was a very painful and frustrating phase to live through. Mercury retrogrades are fairly frequent, but I think we have to admit that this one is especially special. Not only is it happening at the end of two other major retrogrades, acting as the golden cap of knowledge upon the pyramid of experience, but we also see it occurring in Sagittarius at the very beginning of Jupiter's glorious 12-year homecoming. The higher mind and the lower mind. Woo and reason. The King of the Gods, and his Swift Messenger. Synchronize your watches, ladies and gentlemen. 


I was looking up some important dates for when to take a ritually symbolic infused epsom salt bath. And it struck me: Mercury leaves it retrograde shadow on December 24th. That means when we wake up Christ-mas day, it will be the first day of a new life. A life after the trials and tribulations of retrograde season. Enough! Life calls again, we all have our new operating system. Now is the time to see what it is capable of.

To me, Aquariuses drive each other mad as well with their detachness in relationship, because they are uncomfortable to commit or grow too attached to their partner. I know it's stupid when an Aquarius says to you, it's not you, it's me.

931,fd0jfo,False,,47,Let's look at whether it is possible to create a program that can analyze every possible combination in an astrological chart and give us an accurate computer-generated report that is unique to every single person's natal chart.,astrology,"Some think it's possible. Some say it's not mathematically possible. Of course, the sampling below doesn't even begin to cover all the altering factors for a chart delineation, but it certainly does answer our question.  u/thatotherothergirl has worked out the math, just using only the Moon as an example to work from:

You get so close to infinity combinations so fast, it's not gonna be possible. Let's do some back of envelope math, starting with moon, like you said.

12 possible moon signs

AND 12 possible rising signs

AND 12 possible sun signs

AND 3 possible mercury signs (only gets so far from the sun)

AND 3 possible venus signs (see above) *sorry, typo: should read 5*

AND 12 possible mars signs

AND 12 possible jupiter signs

AND 12 possible saturn signs

let's break for a moment and see what we're at already in terms of combinations.

12\*12\*12\*2\*3\*12\*12\*12 = 6\*12\^6 = 17915904 -- almost 18 million combinations. Now let's add in the possible outer planet placements

AND 12 uranus placements

AND 12 neptune placements

AND 12 pluto placements

17915904\*12\^3 = 30958682112. Over 30 billion. Figuring out how many possible aspects the planets can make between them gets more complicated. But even just assigning one to each possible house roughly would square that final amount.

So 30958682112\^2 = 9.5844e+20 (meaning move that decimal place over to the right 20 spaces).

Now let's say you have a team of 1000 astrologers to work on this project. They create a specific interpretation of one whole chart combination possibility at a time. The average professional astrologer takes about 3 hours per chart for a paying client, not counting the time they are taking to counsel the client, just doing the upfront looking and note-making. So 9.5844e+20 \* 3 hours = 2.87532e+21 man (or woman) hours of chart interpretation. If each astrologer devoted 40 hours per week to this task, it would take 7.1883e+16 weeks to complete. There are 52 weeks in a year so 1.3823654e+15 or 1,382,365,400,000,000 years. The current estimated age of the universe is 13,800,000,000 years. **So this task would take 100171.405797 times the age of the universe to complete.** Again remember we aren't even accounting for aspects.

If every adult on earth spent 40 hours a week on this task, that's 5.7 billion people. It would take 242,520,242 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fd0jfo/lets_look_at_whether_it_is_possible_to_create_a/,93,Probably with ai like costar üòâ ,2020-03-03 20:05:08

However, I think the change of the ages is actually massive and intense and I think it affects everyone around the world on a very personal level. 

The changes I have seen which I believe can be attributed to the rise of the age of aquarius are the following:

1. Intense, abrasive, instantaneous karma. The words you say, the energy you put out and the actions you take are mirrored back to you almost instantaneously.

2. Twin flame and karmic relationships. I believe Aquarius is the sign of karma which is why you see the rise of these twin flame and karmic relationships. 

3. An extraction of emotion from the world. People empathize less and sympathize less because we are no longer in the feeling sign of Pisces. Contrary to that, we are in one of the least feeling signs, Aquarius. 

4. The outing of sexual misconduct because Aquarius is the collective karma of our entire consciousness. 

5. The rise of hyper intellectualism because Aquarius is incredibly intellectual and a vey thinking sign.

6. A lowering of spirituality and religion throughout the world. People don‚Äôt cling to the unseen anymore.

483,fokze6,False,Western,40,Thought I'd share this reading from Astro Matrix. It's about the world going through a material change (Uranus in Taurus) within the next 6 years.,astrology,"
Uranus then re-enters Taurus on March 6, where it will remain until 2025‚Äì26. Financial systems and food production may be in for a shock, since Uranus can bring instability, but this may be necessary to shake us from our complacency. On a personal level, many of us are looking for an improvement in our values and attitudes towards money and the methods we use to survive.

Uranus and Taurus are an interesting combination to attempt to fathom. Taurus the sign that, out of the entire zodiac, is the most resistant to change meets the planet that insists upon it. Uranus challenges the status quo and forces both the individual and society to change and, in particular, to break from the past. From the purely Uranian point of view, clinging to the past can only hinder progress. From the deliberate, enduring, and persistent Taurean viewpoint, change not only might topple the much-beloved quiet life, it also threatens the most important thing of all: security.

A dynamic square aspect between these two highly energized planets on May 16. Forecasts for the Uranus in Taurus years (May 2017 through April 2026) include financial upheaval, radical environmental changes, and a revolution in how we handle the planet‚Äôs resources. Uranus last traveled through Taurus from June 1934 to May 1942; in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act and the Social Security Act, both of which significantly altered how U.S. citizens handled their savings. It also saw¬†the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936), Japan‚Äôs invasion of China (1937), the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland (1939), and much activity from Nazi Germany, with finally the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From a Uranus in Taurus point of view, many of these happenings changed borders; land ownership changed hands. The way in which land was used also changed in several European countries.

¬†Uranus in Taurus might well deliver all sorts of changes to various economic systems, but perhaps more interesting will be the changes in how we use our resources; how we use, make, and spend our money and what we spend it on. With Uranus, we know to expect more technology in the making and spending¬†of money.

The ingress of an outer planet into a new sign often coincides with major world events. The very day that Uranus entered Aries (March 11, 2011), an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, triggering the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

¬†Uranus in Taurus does give rise to individuals feeling that they are trapped by debt and that money is not offering them the freedom they would like, this could create tremendous growth in so-called sharing economies, or what some people call ‚Äúcollaborative consumerism‚Äù ‚Äî the idea being that individuals can rent out their car, their bike, their apartment, their computer, almost anything, when they are not using it.
With Uranus entering Taurus, in addition to possible Earth changes, we could see shake-ups in the financial world. Disruptors of the financial status quo are already at play and likely to gain traction: cryptocurrencies, micro-banking, crowdfunding. We may see grassroots movements to free humanity from the control of the banking system, and free the Earth from an economy based on extracting and exploiting resources. On a personal level, we could become aware of the ways we feel restricted when it comes to money, and take steps toward liberation. Relationships and sexuality are also ripe for revolution, and we can expect trends like polyamory, ethical non-monogamy and sacred sexuality to continue to rise",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/fokze6/thought_id_share_this_reading_from_astro_matrix/,210,"Didn't we have a sexual revolution in the sixties?

* Friends/parents calling, upset and angry out of nowhere. Most of my friends and family members are Virgos/Leos/Capricorns/Geminis
* My ex boyfriend (aries ) completely wiped his social media after a terrible phone call we had two weeks ago, and has also disappeared
* Yet, I'm actually completely fine! Everyone else is nuts.....can someone tell me what transits are going on to cause this chaos? It's honestly like everyone I know has completely lost their shit except for me. I love being a Scorpio. Lol.

What do you appreciate about Taureans?,astrology,"Taurus season started yesterday, and so I wanted to make a post dedicated to  appreciating Taurus since I feel like Taurus is never really talked about and is very underrated. I find that I come across a lot of Taureans (probably cause I‚Äôm a Taurus descendant) and almost all of them I meet I find them to be nothing short of amazing. I believe that Taurus is the kindest and loyalest sign out of the zodiac, and they‚Äôre very caring as well. Taurus offers a stable support system that you can certainly rely on, they always offer a hand to those they care about. They‚Äôre great at advice, and can help you see the beauty in life‚Äôs most difficult situations. They will always be there to encourage you to keep pushing forward even when your life seems to be getting off track, and they do this in a very gentle, caring and nurturing way. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be friends with them you‚Äôll know that they offer a ride or die type friendship, and they will always be thoughtful of you. You will also be aware that the stereotype of them being boring is far from true, they will surely have you entertained even in the most mundane situations. They are as loyal as they come and will not only fend for you in your presence but in your absence as well. They offer genuineness, stability, loyalty and beauty to your life and I very much appreciate all the Taureans I‚Äôve had the pleasure to befriend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g4yiof/happy_taurus_season_what_do_you_appreciate_about/,344,"Taurus hurt me and lie and steal and cheat.

34,giguah,False,,323,Venus Retrograde Through the Houses: What You Can Expect.,astrology,"Tomorrow Venus stations retrograde in Gemini. Actually, Venus has been slowing down for a bit now, called a station, meaning her footprint is heavy in the sky. Likely, you've already been acquainted with the pitter pattering of themes you can expect during this period. Venus retrograde corresponds to general themes such as: relationship reviews, rewinds, renewals and reversals--evaluating how you relate to your own self-worth and esteem--retooling what you actually value/need--budgeting, getting serious about finances--hiccups with beauty related tools, industries, purchases and decisions.

**But Venus RX means more when you account for the house it will be drudging stuff up in**. My general take on Venus RX is: detouring into the ugly and resurfacing with a new appreciation of beauty.  Kind of like the plot of Shrek. Where are the ogres in your life? And can you just decide to marry them and live happily ever after in a swamp with your donkey dragon friends? I digress...

This RX will be decidedly less brutal than the 2018 one in Scorpio. Those were some dire, uggo times. Venus in Gemini is peregrine, and to me, far more effervescent. Like a La Croix. Some gross flavors. But mostly ok. The reviews and themes will have more to do with ideas, thoughts, beliefs, etc. Very much juggling many dissonant thoughts and being okay with not settling on a conclusion. This will be a mentally exhausting time for some.

Gemini occupies a house in everyone's chart. Welcome to the circus:

**First House**: a time to reconsider what makes you feel beautiful, to redefine what beauty has to mean and look like. a time of enhanced social awareness (from a distance) and learning how you bring a distinct value to people--but first settling on how you wish to value yourself. being comfortable with your many faces, but also eliminating the faces, the out-grown personalities, that do not suit you anymore

**Second House:** a time to reevaluate how material possessions add beauty, add value, add ease-- or completely distract you from the assets that matter the most. a renewed version of self-care, a hard and honest look at your bank account and closet and cabinets, a purging to make room for new beautiful things to bloom. divine dividends 

**Third House**:  a time to reconsider what needs to be said. holding space for new ideas to take the place of old ones. learning to value your unique perspective, whilst also respecting the perspectives of others. work that neuro plasticity, pave new grooves into your gray matter. a time to stop and smell the roses as you are out and about. rekindling bonds with siblings and teammates.

**Fourth House**: a time to spackle, paint, hang and rearrange. where has the beauty in your home become stagnant, and how can you insert new pathways of inspiration into your halls? retooling your roots, beautifying your sanctuaries, finding Aphrodite in your ancestry. this can be a time to reacquaint yourself with the value a tribe, a home, a family, and a foundation gives you. that's how beauty can blossom.

**Fifth House**: a time to make friends with that blinking cursor on a blank page, the dried paint brush, the stack of half-finished poetry in the corner of your room, and the project that makes your heart sing--but that you've been too afraid to sing along with. retool your relationship with your inner child, that spark in the dark. your authentic self could use some authenticating 

**Sixth House**: a time to throw out ugly habits, dead-end jobs, and the futile and self-deprecating sense of duty and responsibility you hold. time for new rituals. time put your worth and value ahead of the needs of others. you are more than a cog in a machine. you are the machine. an extraordinary one. and an extraordinary one needs all the tonics, tinctures, remedies and herbs. beautiful insides make for a beautiful outside, so celebrate your vitality, and appreciate all that your body does--in sickness and in health

**Seventh House**: a time to throw out ugly people! where are your relationships failing to live up to the happiness, joy, and wonder that you deserve? time for the talks, time to press send on an apology, time to ask for help, time to delete the dating profile and jump into the vulnerability of committed partnership, or time to unwed yourself from the security of singledom and start to mingle your heart out. also a good time to take inventory of the people you've invited into your hopes and dreams, the business affiliates that either help you sink or swim. choose people who bring beauty and warmth into your life. unbreak your heart. time for new patterns.

**Eighth House**: a time to get a handle on your debt, obligations, on your portfolios and investments. where are you over-sharing, where are you under-sharing, where can you give more, and where can you divest? immaterially, your heart, your humanness, your deeply disowned ugliness--they all deserve some TLC. those ogres aren't so scary or ugly when you get to know them. nothing to fear but fear itself. a time for magic and mysticism to inform your path forward.

**Ninth House**: a time to reevaluate your schooling, your education, what you have accepting as TRUTH actually has more to it.  become more nimble with your personal dogma and ideology. challenges to your way of seeing the world don't have to be challenging, but rather, give you a wider array of intellectual and cultural beauty to sample from and enjoy. though not a good time for travel, certainly still a good time to plan. that faraway corner of the world is calling out for you. and that faraway corner of your mind could use a refresh. where are your gurus and mentors failing to inspire you? ditch the old paradigms. there's a yellow brick road with your name on it.

**Tenth House:** a time to reevaluate your career, your place in the world, the value that you bring to the world, and your unique set of talents. where are you asking to be respected yet still bumping up against gatekeepers? where can your creativity be better suited? you are your own boss, and your manager can't manage you. time to step up into a firmer sense of self and confidence. take up space. be loud. this is your world and we are living in it.

**Eleventh House:** a time to reevaluate your social networks, your friend groups, your hopes, accomplishments and your communities at large. unfriend the group think. jettison the crusty cliques. deactivate the profiles. consider where society has perhaps let you down, and recommit to creating environments worthy of the cause that is you. there is beauty to be shared. humanity has cracks but that is where light enters. be the light, even if you need to go dark for now.

**Twelfth House:** a time to reconsider where you self-sabotage, where you isolate, where you needlessly alienate yourself and others. this can be a deeply creative time when you burrow in the right direction, where unconscious gifts lay, where spirituality sparkles, where the undulations of life at large are within your grasp. beautify your alone time, make it work for you. give your mental hardships some love and tenderness. play around with the unknown, remold your trauma and psychic entanglements, find the beauty in necessary endings and loss. for that is how you begin again.

Understand it is beginner, meaning lots of descriptions are simplified, and so, one has to go beyond this book for further and deeper understanding of the transiting planets and their impacts. But it is an excellent place to start.

[Astrological Transits, by April Elliott Kent](https://www.bigskyastrology.com/astrological-transits/)

[Table of Contents](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479718451875938304/670349632567640064/unknown.png)

For each transiting planet in a sign she gives a guide at the end of that description. And i want to explain a bit about that. [Here's a screenshot.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/479718451875938304/670349664540688384/SNAGHTML6e30f34.png)

She uses, as shown in the red box, 3 guides of interpretation. What she's doing is saying that when  transiting jupiter is in capricorn (just in this example), then if you have planets in the listed signs, here's what that may be like. So... these will always be specific to the transited sign that's being described......

""Biggest rewards"": these will be the *natal* signs that are conjunct or trine by the transiting planet.

""Pressure to take risks"": these are the *natal* signs that will be squared or opposed by the transiting planet.

""Significant opportunities"": these are the *natal*  signs that will be sextiled by the transiting planet.

As a companion, i highly recommend you find a copy of Robert Hand's book Planets In Transit, which describes in much more detail, every transiting planet in each sign, in each house, and in each aspect to each natal planet (major aspects, no minors). But his book is just that, the descriptions of the transits. Kent's will help you understand how transits work, so i'd start with hers.

Kent's book is available on amazon, and used, and on kindle.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/etff8e/good_beginner_book_for_learning_about_transits/,95,Thanks for the suggestion! ,2020-01-24 19:40:40

Water signs are very tuned into emotions and it can come as a surprise that Scorpio is such a difficult position. It is said that Moon is in ‚Äúfall‚Äù when Scorpio inhabits it. Because Scorpio is such an intense sign, it is not compatible with Moon‚Äôs nurturing and gentle attributes. It is difficult to live with Scorpioinc intensity on day to day basis. Natives with this Moon position feel intensely about everything and even if they are happy and content, and nothing special is going on in their lives, they will still feel the seething intensity within them.

It is no wonder that Scorpio Moons are more prone to have addictions than any other Moon sign or even Sun in Scorpio. When I say addiction, it doesn‚Äôt have to be drugs, alcohol or sex. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be recognized as an addiction. It can be something benign and even beneficial that you start using to feel better (like meditation, exercise, needlework, etc) but soon you get addicted to it to the point of obsessively doing it just to numb the intense feelings raging inside you. Over time you realize that you are not doing it just because you like it, but more because it tames the intensity. Even if it‚Äôs not harmful, it‚Äôs still an addiction and in the long run, it can prevent you from doing other things that you love that require you to feel intensely. This is why relaxation methods (whichever they are) don‚Äôt work with Scorpio Moons and can instead have a counter effect.

Scorpio Moon natives often live in the survival mode. They see this world as a constant struggle and are acutely aware of the dangers that lurk at every corner. This is why they can get easily suspicious of people around them through this is usually subconscious. While Scorpio Sun will be aware that they are suspicious of people, Scorpio Moon people may only feel a strange sensation when meeting people that they can‚Äôt even properly articulate. Moon is our subconsciousness, it‚Äôs buried deep within us, it is our very soul. That is why it has the strongest influence on us.

These natives are very perceptive and intuitive. They understand the dark side of the human soul, though it depends on other planetary positions if they will try to ignore it or not.

Usually, these natives are quiet and observing, though if their descendant is in a more extroverted Sun or Ascendant sign (air or fire) they may portray a more outgoing and even loud personality. It‚Äôs only a facade and they can use their Sun/Ascendant to purposefully appear different from how they feel on the inside. They are not doing it because they want to deceive you. They are doing it to protect themselves. The best way to protect your true self is to act in a way that it appears that you aren‚Äôt hiding anything. Scorpio Moon natives know it best.

Scorpio Moons are naturally mistrustful of people. Because Moon represents early childhood, it‚Äôs possible that in that period these natives experienced some kind of abandonment or betrayal. Maybe they had a difficult birth, their mother‚Äôs affections were erratic and not constant, or maybe their mother just had to work hard and spent long hours at work. Whichever may be the case, the child felt from the early age that mother‚Äôs affection could be gone at any moment and that they can be easily abandoned. This created that deep mistrust which resulted from the fear of being abandoned by the people the native loves the most.

It‚Äôs a subconscious fear and the native may often not even know they have this fear. After all, Scorpio Moons usually see themselves as strong and self-reliant people who don‚Äôt need others for help. In order to survive in this cruel world, they must rely only on themselves. If they open up and let go of that fear, they will not be able to protect themselves anymore.

In love, Moon in Scorpio natives are either very cautious or very reckless. Mostly they are cautious because they have that deep need to protect themselves. Even if they are reckless and go from partner to partner without much thinking it‚Äôs only because that way they don‚Äôt have to attach too deep with them and can experience passion and intensity on their own terms. If they do get to trust you, they will form a strong bond with you and they will stick with you through thick and thin. Unless you betray them, which is never a good thing.

Even if Scorpio Moon native‚Äôs other planetary placements are in more detached and easy-going signs, this Moon will still give them black and white attitude towards life. It might not be obvious, not even to them, but they will have either strong loves or strong hates towards people (and things/places/etc). Scorpio Moon natives have a high tolerance for emotional pain and suffering as they are extremely resilient. Unfortunately, this often leads them to be misused by other people. This doesn‚Äôt happen because Scorpio Moon people are weak, quite the opposite. It‚Äôs because they can withstand things but also because they can understand the suffering of others that they will be the least judgemental of all Moon signs which people can sometimes abuse. It‚Äôs often people who are closest to Scorpio Moons that abuse them emotionally the most. If a Scorpio Moon gets attached to somebody they can do anything for them even to their own detriment. As long as people respect and acknowledge this sacrifice, a Scorpio Moon will continue doing it (which is not good for them in the long run, though).

When Scorpio Moon feels that you‚Äôve taken them for a fool, they are capable of switching from love to hate in an instant. Because Scorpio is a fixed sign, once their heart is set on something, it takes a lot of time and effort to change it.

The sun just entered Gemini and so I wanted to post an appreciation post for Gemini‚Äôs since they‚Äôre one of the unappreciated signs. I‚Äôm surrounded by a lot of Gemini energy (whether it be someone‚Äôs sun, moon or any other personal planet‚Äôs sign) in my life and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. One of my favorite things about Gemini‚Äôs is they‚Äôre constantly expanding my interests since they‚Äôre interested in various things and give great recommendations for topics they‚Äôd think I‚Äôd find interesting. They‚Äôre also amazing conversationalist, the longest conversation I‚Äôve ever had was with my Gemini best friend where we talked 8 hours straight, and not even for a second during those 8 hours did I get bored. They‚Äôre very entertaining, interesting and just all around fun people to surround yourself with. As an Aquarius I often feel misunderstood but Gemini placements are one of the only signs who I feel really understands (or at least attempts to understand) and accepts me. Gemini‚Äôs are very open to new ideas and perspectives so they‚Äôre not one to be judgmental if you express your true unfiltered self to them. They respect individuality and give others freedom to be who they truly are. They‚Äôre also very adaptable and go with the flow and won‚Äôt be shaken if unexpected changes occur and can adjust well to them. They‚Äôre down for anything life has to offer and they‚Äôre great at coming up with amazing new adventures that the 2 of you can experience together. Gemini also makes everyone feel welcome by starting conversations with anyone, even if they don‚Äôt hang out with the same crowd as them. For example when I was in elementary school I had barely any friends, but there was a Gemini girl who was popular who would always converse with me and make me feel included whenever she was with me. I also can‚Äôt forget to mention how creative and intellectual Gemini‚Äôs are, they spread knowledge and inspire others creatively all at once. Last but certainly not least is there humor, their witty comments are shockingly hilarious and they‚Äôre definitely one of the most comedic signs there is.

These lessons have dated back 6 months to the previous new moon in that sign. Think back to the New Moon in Scorpio we had in November. What new seeds did you plant then? How have they manifested? Who are you now?

**Full Article:** [**Full Moon in Scorpio 2019**](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/18/full-moon-in-scorpio-the-butterfly-emerges/)

*Summary:*

**Scorpio** is best represented by the phoenix. After one final blaze of glory, the phoenix fizzles and dies, cremating itself and falling into a pile of ash. In that ash is a tiny chick ‚Äì the phoenix reborn, and it will grow to be stronger in this incarnation that it was previously. This is the cycle of life and death that manifests within **Scorpio**.

A **sextile** to both [***Pluto***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/pluto-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-24th-october-2nd/) and [***Saturn retrograde***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/saturn-retrograde-in-capricorn-horoscope-april-29-september-18/) while opposing [***Mercury in Taurus***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/06/mercury-enters-taurus-solid-decisions/) will highlight the [***energies at play yesterday.***](https://mysticalmaigaia.wordpress.com/2019/05/17/daily-forecast-for-may-17-2019-retrograde-revelations/) In order to achieve, you often have to tear down and rebuild what you‚Äôve made. **Mercury** wants to keep thinking in one direction, as **Taurus** often does, but the **Moon in Scorpio** has a need to let it all go so it can change and be reborn. Those who have succeeded have failed thousands of more times than their peers, and understand that sometimes you need a new approach to solve a problem. **Mercury in Taurus** would rather sit in their failure and accept it as reality, whereas **Scorpio** would burn it all down and try again.

‚ÄúAstrological symbols are neutral. There are no good ones, no bad ones.

Individuals are responsible for the way they embody their birthcharts.

No astrologer can determine a person‚Äôs level of response to his birthchart from that birthchart alone.

The birthchart is a blueprint for the happiest, most fulfilling, most spiritual creative path of growth available to the individual.

All deviations from the ideal growth pattern symbolised by the birthchart are unstable states, usually accompanied by a sense of aimlessness, emptiness, and anxiety.

Astrology recognises only two absolutes: the irreducible mystery of life , and the uniqueness of each individuals viewpoint on that mystery. 

Astrology suffers when wedded too closely to any philosophy or religion. Nothing in the system matters except the intensification of a person‚Äôs self awareness.

You‚Äôve seen the meme going around. The one that tallies up infamous serial killers and their Sun signs. The result? A heap of mutable signs. Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces. I‚Äôm tired of the slander! Jokes aside, it does seem to perpetuate harmful stereotypes, especially for Gemini and Sagittarius (or Sagiterrorist as Twitter says---yikes) ,that there is something inherently dubious, untrustworthy or sinister about these signs. So here is a brief examination of all 12 signs, the infamous killers who belong to them, and the planetary conditions that can compel heinous acts. That‚Äôs right, murdering is equal-opportunity and doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on sign. Leggo!

**Aries:** Donald Harvey, born 4/15/1952. Killed 37-57 people while working as an orderly. Method: mostly poison. RX Mars in Scorpio square Pluto in Leo. Mars in the 8th, Pluto in the 5th. Poison, a rather passive way of killing someone, can belong to a RX Mars in Scorpio, and the perverse pleasure from such acts can belong to Pluto in the 5th. ASC ruled by this Mars, out of aspect to the ASC‚Äîsuggesting a hidden, unwieldy martial nature. Tense aspects between Mars and Pluto can manifest‚Ä¶darkly. He also had Neptune opposite his Sun-Jupiter conjunction in the 1st. Neptune can destabilize the ego, create low self esteem, and produce disturbing fantasies, especially here with a sextile to Pluto. Uranus in the 4th in Cancer is the apex of a T-square, with the opposition between his Sun-Jupiter and Neptune, both of which square Uranus. Acting out in erratic and disturbing ways whilst taking care of people in a place they call home (Uranus-Cancer-4th). Harvey said he killed out of empathy, wanting to end others‚Äô suffering, or out of anger. Jupiter conj Sun in the 1st in Aries can create a hot-head whose anger gets out of order (Jupiter expands)  very fast. Harvey also had tense aspects from his Venus to his Moon and from his Venus and Mercury to Saturn. Unloved, a hardened love, loss of confidence. Moon in detriment in Capricorn.

**Taurus:** Albert Fish, born 5/19/1870. Killed 3, confirmed. A suspected 9-100 others. Method: variable, but sexual in nature. No time of birth and therefore no rising sign. Mars conjunct Pluto in Taurus. So we are sensing a Mars-Pluto theme. In the fleshy sign of Taurus, this conjunction unfortunately manifested as a fascination with genitals and sexual mutilation. Mars can be our sex drive, and Taurus is a carnal and physical sign, concerned with the body and physical pleasures. Pluto adds the darkness and obsession. Fish also mutilated himself, sticking several needles into his, uh, pelvic region. Mars in Taurus cuts into the flesh. Fish said that he felt God was compelling him to torture children. His Capricorn Moon was opposite his Uranus in Cancer, disturbed rationale on the idea of taking care of children. Here, Venus was also square the Moon, conjunct Neptune, and square Uranus. His prevailing sense of value and love was disillusioned by Neptune (feeling directed by God, a higher force) and completely abnormal (Venus sq Uranus). He was apparently nicknamed *The Moon Maniac* because he struck at night. Weirdly enough, the Moon exalts in Taurus. Not astrologically relevant but ironic.

**Gemini:** I feel like I should skip this re: the meme alluded to above. So many to choose from‚Ä¶ 

Uh‚ÄîDavid, ‚ÄúSon of Sam‚Äù Berkowitz, born 6/1/1953. Killed 6. Method: stabbing and shooting. I know you‚Äôre wondering by now: what are Mars and Pluto doing in his chart? Well, they‚Äôre in a softer sextile, Mars in Gemini and Pluto in Leo. But Mars is conjunct Mercury in the 8th and trine Neptune in Libra in his 12th. He famously suggested that he was under the influence of a demon dog while at the time of the murders, feeling compelled to carry out these terrible acts because of this voice in his head. This is the seamless conversation of Mars (aggression) Mercury (your mental processing) and Neptune. He made up a fantastical lie, probably to be declared mentally incompetent. The 8th and 12th houses are also a fitting arena for stories of demons, possession, killing and other otherworldly phenomena. Berkowitz enjoyed the publicity he got from his crimes, perfect for an 8th house Gemini stellium and for a Leo MC. He also enjoyed writing letters to the police, taunting them. Gemini loves a cat and mouse game. Sadly, this was a disgusting one. He mostly victimized women, perhaps owing to a fallen Venus in Aries opposite his ascendant, Neptune and Saturn. This is also the 3rd serial killer in a row to have Moon square Venus, an infelt tension between his emotional gratification and the principle of femininity. 

**Cancer:** Genene Jones, born 7/13/1950. Killed 2. A suspected 60 others. Method: poison. No birth time. Jones was a nurse in the pediatric unit of a hospital. And so yes, all of her victims were infants and children, fitting for a Cancer Sun. She also had her Moon, Mercury and Uranus in Cancer, with Uranus in a tight conjunction to her Moon. This goes without saying by now but pretty erratic emotional nature. Mars was conj Neptune in beauty-loving Libra, and Jones worked for a time as a beautician before becoming a nurse. This combination later ended up producing a woman who murdered (Mars) but injecting lethal amounts of drugs (Neptune) into her patients. 

**Leo:** Luka Magnotta, born 7/24/1982. Killed 1 human, several animals. Method: suffocation, decapitation, severing and stabbing. No birth time. Subject of the new Netflix docu-series: *Don‚Äôt Fuck With Cats: Hunting An Internet Killer.* Magnotta had Sun conjunct Mercury in attention-seeking Leo. He tried out for many reality shows, was a porn actor, and portrayed his life online as a jet-setting model and socialite. He had several fan pages on Facebook, with almost all the comments praising how beautiful he was. It later surfaced that *he* created all these fan pages, wrote all the comments, and doctored images with his face on other people‚Äôs bodies to give the illusion of a glamourous life (His Sun-Mercury conjunction is square boastful Jupiter). His Moon was in shy, calculated and sometimes cold Virgo, square Neptune, embedding within his emotional life a perverse kind of dreaming and wanting. His emotional nature was at odds with his Leo Sun, setting the ground for a person who needed to find attention in a less obvious way. Oh and yes, here he had a Mars-Pluto-Saturn conjunction in relationship oriented Libra, sextile his Neptune in Sagittarius. Mars and Pluto square his Sun‚Äîa magnetic, forceful, lustful, and aggressive personality, an ego bent on control and perverse desire. All 3 malefics in Libra show that relationships would never be easy for him, owing also to his Virgo Moon, which can view emotional satisfaction as a struggle. Magnotta uploaded videos on YouTube of him murdering kittens, never showing his face (Virgo). This is how he ended up filling the dark desire of his Leo Sun: he got A LOT of attention. Later on, he also uploaded a video of him killing a Chinese man studying abroad in Canada. He had Uranus trine his Sun-Mercury conjunction in Leo. That he used the Internet to display the attention-seeking needs of his Leo Sun is no surprise.  

**Virgo:** Paul Bernardo, born 8/27/1964. Killed 4. Raped 13. Bernardo was known as *The School Girl Killer* which off the bat is an eerie coincidence for a Virgo Sun and Rising. If there is anything that conjures up the innocence and purity known (kind of stereotypically) for Virgo, it is the archetype of the school-girl. He has Mars exactly conjunct Venus in Cancer, and trine Neptune in Scorpio. His first rape was against his sister in law and aided by his wife. So, grossly, it was a family affair, the domain of Cancer. Neptune brought in the element of drugs and alcohol‚ÄîBernardo drugged his wife‚Äôs (Karla) little sister with rum and sleeping pills, and took advantage of her when she passed out. Mars conjunct Venus can indicate violence against women. But strangely, in Bernardo‚Äôs case, it also represented that he carried out many of his crimes with his wife by his side. This theme continued‚Äîwhere Karla would bait the victim and drug them, and Bernardo would assault them. Bernardo‚Äôs Mercury, Pluto and Uranus were involved in a tight conjunction in Virgo in the 1st, opposite Saturn in Pisces in his 7th. His identity to the world and within relationships was wrought with control, obsession, restriction, and darkness. He frequently boasted about his sexual prowess, experience and preferences‚Äîa signpost of compulsive Pluto defining the personality from the 1st. His wife Karla (Taurus) had the same Mars conjunct Venus aspect in her chart and Pluto conjunct Bernardo‚Äôs ascendant, fueling his sexual appetite. Bernardo‚Äôs Mars conjunct Venus fell in Karla‚Äôs 7th house of relationship. They also both had Moon in Aries conjunct, solidifying the sordid theme of Mars in both of their charts. This is the story of a fated relationship intertwined with the ominous themes of death, sexual gratification and predation.

565,hbfhjc,False,,107,The Astrology of Sex Crimes ft. Danny Masterson (trigger warning),astrology,"He played Steven Hyde on That 70s Show, for reference. Also--apologies for the troublesome nature of this post, but I always look to see what is happening in the sky for these people when dramatic incidents take place. And here, hopefully the arc is towards justice for the women who alleged rape. Yesterday, June 17th, he was arrested. 

I always look to **Venus and the Moon** in the charts of men who domineer and commandeer women. His Venus and Moon stand in opposition, Aqua and Leo respectively. That places the emotional needs of the person at odds with how they value and love another person. There's a heavy dislike factor, sometimes, with these folks because they are so on the make to fulfill their own personal needs, that they fail to take care of the other. Why? Well the Moon is the more innately felt planet here. It is easy in a Moon-Anything oppostion to lean far too hard on the Moon side. In Masterson's case, he did so, with reprehensible results (allegedly). The Leo Moon propensity for being the star of any show, mostly private ones like within the family or within relationships or within the confines of hubris, can very well turn into acts of pride and power turned devious (allegedly).

His **Pisces Sun** rules over that Leo Moon. At least one of the women who alleged Masterson raped her said he did so by drugging her. This also all happened curiously over the backdrop of Scientology. Without incorrectly stating truths, Masterson himself was or is a practicing Scientologist, and one of his victims was or is as well. At least 3 of them were pressured to keep quiet by the Church of Scientology. So a very Piscean arena for darker Piscean themes.

Well, why now?

Curiously (aka Astrology is legit), the **South Node** has moved into Sagittarius. Sag, like it's Jupiter bro Pisces, has a lot to do with religion and dogma--Jupiter things. All over the world and likely with these women, all this is coming into light in a dramatic fashion in part because there is a drain happening around Sag things. Masterson has his Neptune in Sag, and while the SN will not conjunct that planet for a while (and when it does--what news will come with it?), it still does awaken a natal promise of that placement, sending some undulations into that part of his chart. Neptune the planet of drugging, religion, delusion. Also a planet that can think highly of itself within the context of organized religion. I AM the ONE and ONLY prophet--shush and listen. Stuff like that. Big drain over that shit now.

Now, the **North Node** is over Masterson's **Mars in Gemini**. Which, yep, means the SN is opposing it. Actions wrought facing their karmic resolution. His Mars in Gemini trines that Aqua Venus I spoke about above. Though trines get PR for harmony, please never forget that the seamlessness and easiness of the trine can get people into trouble. In this case, Masterson's ease with women, coercing them, getting them to do what he wanted--are all a part of this trine. Likely there was charm and magnetism involved, as he was a star on a hit television show back then. 

The **North Node** is also squaring his Pisces Sun. There is a change in direction happening in the development of his ego. The public cannot be privy to this, as it is more an internal function. But from the outside looking in, reckoning with rape allegations from decades ago seems like a major ingredient in ""Life Changes 101"".  The square engenders friction, challenge. Difficult events come up during this transit to chisel away at the intended direction of your life. 

**Neptune is in Pisces** right now, conjunct his Sun. This neatly ties up, to me, this Neptune story he has in his chart. Why? Well that natal Neptune in Sag squares his natal Sun, by sign. Now transit Neptune has caught up and is sitting on his Sun, rounding out in someway Neptunian themes as they have to do with ego development or in this case, ego DISSOLUTION. Nothing humbles a celebrity like being arrested. 

Couple more things...

Masterson's **NN is in Scorpio conjunct his Uranus**. Where is Uranus now? Opposing both of those planets. Uranus opposite Uranus is the midlife crisis aspect. The word ""crisis"" kind of says all it needs to say here. Maturation through difficult events. This is a wake up call for him. Youth is gone. Time to grow up. **Transit Uranus opposite his NN** also indicates a sudden change in direction, sudden events, and high wattage soul electrocution. I would like to extrapolate further that Uranus is in a Venus sign right now, likely causing a revolution in a sense regarding Venus industries and issues. This means this transit will awaken a lot with women's issues. Masterson's arrest is a microcosm of the macrocosm. 

Lastly, **Venus herself is RX**. Have you heard? Did you know? (Of course you did). This transit drudges up many long-forgotten Venus issues, or at least is asking of all of us to re-examine them. Without knowing the house this is happening in for Masterson, we can still bet that his arrest has something to do with the retrograde, as it is literally dragging up sexual incidents he has had with women from his past. In May, Venus stationed RX at 21 Gemini, conjunct Masterson's troublesome Mars.

690,g2h9a9,False,,63,The key to Saturn transits,astrology,"Is patience. Saturn is very unrelenting. But what ppl don't realize is Saturn is mainly self imposed. Planets that come after Mars or the personal planets are reactive. It's the world around us reacting to our own actions. It's out of our control yet still impacted by our decisions. Pretty much, it'll happen regardless. Saturn, Saturn is conclusive. As is Mars and Pluto and combining them gives a person killer instincts. Not in the brutal way but very much in a finalizing way. And with Saturn, he closes useless chapters. Pluto closes destructive chapters. Mars closes whatever chapter he chooses. But they all end things.

With Saturn you have to be patient. To have to let the storm pass. You have to take care of business, do what has to be done so you can lighten your load. But you still have to deal with the ramifications. I see that now as Saturn is transiting my moon until it moves back to Capricorn. It opposes my leo moon. Let me tell ya, I'm lonely, a lil depressed and just agitated. But with the moon we often reflect. And with Saturn, we are buried alive. My emotions are doing just that. But you have to be patient. The storm always passes as does Saturn. Saturn offers strength and wisdom by cutting you off. You are cut off from what you deem important. And when you are all alone, all you can do is think. But you have to do more than that because destruction with Saturn can be hard to stop. He is habitual by nature and uses repetition for his method. 


But just be patient. It's a test of virtue. Like Hercules who I feel is also represented by Saturn, he is a task completer. He finishes the job and gives his all. Cronos, was not always bad. it was his fear of karma that consumed him. Before that, he ruled with Grace and honesty. That's the flip side to Saturn. But he comes to add depth, wisdom and strength. He comes to uproot things, untangle weeds and allow for growth. He removes restrictions by showing them. At this time, I must grow but when I do.......
It will be powerful. I slipped into some very bad habits But I can overcome them. All it takes is effort. 



So I will March down this path...... alone, hurt, angry. But these are all emotions that I must uproot so I can be emotionally calm, stable and at peace. I wish I knew how this ends but I don't. But I have been on the positive side of a Saturn transit and when I was patient and controlled.....the benefits were just....amazing.

818,eqavyz,False,Horoscope,23,Aquarius Season 2020/ The Art of Detachment #AstroWitch,astrology," 
On Monday January 20th, 2020 the sun makes its way into Aquarius. The sun is detrimental in Aquarius and gets burned easily. It doesn‚Äôt want the light shined only on itself, rather it‚Äôs light shined on its knowledge. In astrology we call Aquarius the mature one of the air signs and it‚Äôs key phrase is ‚ÄúI Know!‚Äù Aquarius in the chart represents friendships, organizations and inspiration. Are your friends inspiring you to be your best self? 

Aquarius energy can often come off as detached. This is due to their wisdom of being an individual while also being apart of the collective. Aquarius season asks us to detach from our personal feelings and connect to the ALL! The Art of Detachment is NOT running away or fading to black. The practice of detachment is the ability to be fully present in any situation while detaching from the pain and sadness coming from individuals. I compare this to those who work in emergency care, they are focused on solutions and healings all the while screaming and pain is all around them. They do not run and hide, yet detach bc they KNOW you are in pain and are finding solutions to the problem. Chaos is always around us, chaos does not have to be within us. 
 
This zodiac adapts and gets to the solution using its knowledge. The new moon in Aquarius on January 24th will give us the a fresh start with our emotions and feelings. This opportunity will allow us to let go of the idea that something is happening to us and flow into the feelings of I‚Äôm happening to something. Neptune and Venus are both in intuitive Pisces, heightening our psychic abilities and also showing us victim personality that may be attracting the situations we profess we do not like. Dream big, attract big. 
 
The Full moon on February 9th, in Leo is an heartfelt moment to tap into your inner child. Is she still there waiting for something? Go within and speak the words and give the comfort to your inner child, bring her to the present. Give her the apologies and forgiveness she deserves to move forward. 
 
Saturn in its comfy spot of Capricorn has a few more weeks before it makes its leap to rebellious and unique Aquarius. Spend these moments checking off your to-do list, setting up healthy boundaries and structuring your goals. 

In tarot the Fool card is governed by Uranus while Aquarius is governed by The Star card. Both cards remind us this is all apart of the journey. While these days ‚Äúfool‚Äù is used in negative context, in tarot the fool is free. The fool does not care what the masses perceive and goes foolishly on its journey knowing all is right and exact.

717,a449d4,False,,27,Reframing Capricorn: How The Serious SERIOUSLY Know How to have Fun.,astrology,"(*I want to start looking the archetypes of the signs and reframe how we have come to view them as strictly this or strictly that. I've come to find a lot of wiggle room and nuance in them. As Capricorn Season approaches, and all of us are inundated with the holiday season fervor, I looked first to the GOAT of the zodiac.)*  

You may wonder why Capricorn season corresponds with two of the biggest celebrations of the Western calendar year: Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Eve. And across different cultures, societies, and ethnicities many more celebrations occur during this time of year. So what is it about the Saturn-ruled, stoic goat that hints at anything but coldness, dryness or despair. Or in pop Astrology terms‚Äîthe workaholic. Seems more like Sagittarius‚Äô job to impart the gifts of conviviality. Centaurs were known, after all, for their rowdy parties, excess, and disregard for manners. Sounds suspiciously similar to the type of audience you‚Äôd encounter at a bar or club on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and the materialism you witness during Christmas. But it may surprise you to know that these correspondences are no accident, and rather point to a side of Capricorn rarely ever talked about: **the joyful and giving party animal**. Let‚Äôs look briefly at Saturn, Capricorn‚Äôs ruler.

Our modern Christmas bears historical similarities to the ancient Roman festival, *Saturnalia.* Held in honor of the god Saturn and on the Winter Solstice, *Saturnalia*, a week-long extravaganza, had all the typical signposts of the holiday season we know today: partying, gift giving, and masses of food. Plus, slaves were freed for the day, given agency to act how they pleased, and moral misgivings were not only forgiven, but encouraged (i.e. gambling). Some even describe the day as distinctly Mardi Gras (*named after the planet, Mars‚Äîbut that‚Äôs another topic for another day!)* in nature, with chaos bleeding through the streets. People dressed as crazily as they could, played raunchy games and chased people around. All this plus a bevy of booze. How, you ask, does this debauchery relate in any way to Saturn, Saturn who we know to preside ominously over law, order, and integrity? 

In Roman mythology, Saturn was said to rule over The Golden Age, a time of abundance and equality. Agriculture, and the seasonal structure of crop and bounty were taught to the Romans by Saturn. Saturn also gave them laws and societal structure, but not under the pretense of rigidity. Saturn was not tyrannical. Rather, Saturn established order, that there is a time and place for everything‚Äîincluding fun. And so in talking about Saturn‚Äôs rules and rigors, we must also acknowledge its lighter side, the satisfaction achieved through meeting those rules and rigors, and the justified celebration of a job well done. Here, Saturn is not like Jupiter, giver of gifts just for the sake of it, or excess in excess. *Saturnalia* was limited to a seven days. This should sound familiar‚ÄîSaturn restricts. But our modern view of Saturn leaves out the grace periods, seeing it only as an energy of work or hardship, unending. *Saturnalia* reframes this bias‚Äîwhere Saturn is measured and practical, so is it practical that life should be enjoyed.  Work hard, play hard‚Äîthat is optimal balance. We can see this concept mirrored through our understanding of The Saturn Return. A period of hard work and stress is then rewarded, usually through a sobered maturity, status, accomplished goals, economic gain or heightened responsibility‚Äîall things that serve to enrich life and make it more enjoyable, even if in the long run. And have you ever thought about the spelling of Saturday? It is Saturn‚Äôs day. Saturday can be a day of rest or leisure following the traditional Monday through Friday work week. (*I get paid on Saturdays, thanks Saturn!).* One last tidbit: the greeting during the festival of *Saturnalia* was ‚ÄúIo Saturnalia! Io, Io, Io!‚Äù Though yet proven, many believe this to be the root of Santa‚Äôs famous catchphrase, ‚ÄúHo, ho, ho!‚Äù Could Saturn be Santa Clause? Maybe. Saturn does represent, in some ways, the energy of an old man tallying up whether you‚Äôve been good or bad, and then rewarding you accordingly. Only now we can understand that Saturn doesn‚Äôt only give coals, but cherished gifts too.

Tied to the holiday season is also the idea of charity‚Äîbeing altruistic and spreading cheer, especially to people and communities of need. All this as the Sun makes its annual dalliance into a Saturn-ruled sign. The Scrooge? Think again. Saturn is concerned with equality and order, setting up structures (and safety nets) wherein outcasts (economic or otherwise) are brought out of the fray and into consideration. Giving to the needy, spreading happiness to the forlorn, spending time and energy on causes oft ignored the rest of the year-- these all speak to a Saturnian balance. So forget what you think you know about Saturn being the bad guy. His law and order often protect and serve those otherwise forgotten. And what good is holiday cheer if everyone hasn't the chance to be cheerful?

Related to the word Capricorn is *capricious*, given to fickleness, impulse, and unpredictability. Sounds distinctly un-Saturnian. Look at any video of a baby goat and you‚Äôll see it prancing, frolicking, and jumping around, as if free from worry or care. But it is precisely this changeable nature that can give Capricorn their surprisingly sharp humor or infectious happiness. So why is depression the only part of the spectrum ever talked about? Jump deeper into the history of Capricorn and you find gems that confront our modern understanding.  The Greek myth of Capricorn surrounds Pan, the God of the wilderness, music, always surrounded by nymphs. What a party. Pan did eventually turn himself into a sea goat, the horns of which were known as the *cornucopia* or ‚Äúthe horn of plenty‚Äù‚Äîanother allusion to abundance, bounty and pleasure. In some versions of the myth, Pan was erotic and seductive, teaching his practice of personal sexuality and fulfilment to others. Capricorn, especially its ruler Saturn, are talked about now in ways that appear to limit sexuality and intimacy. But let‚Äôs not forget that Capricorn is an Earth Sign, and particularly susceptible to sensuality in all forms. Statistically, sex in couples peaks during December and January‚ÄîCapricorn season (northern hemisphere). In Babylonian Astrology, Capricorn was known as the Goatfish, and had affinity with benevolent deities, one of which was called ‚Äúthe granter of requests‚Äù, a quality you‚Äôd hope for when making a Christmas or New Year‚Äôs resolutions list, and a quality we all imbue when giving Christmas gifts. Moreover, this Goatfish invented arts and crafts, and gave civilization modalities through which to enjoy and celebrate life.

Capricorns are said to age backwards. Born as old, serious and studious souls and eventually aging into childhood: play, joy, mischief. So always inherent in Capricorn is the propensity for pleasure and amusement. Even the presence of Saturn in our natal charts ferments and softens over time, or, let‚Äôs loose! So while the serious and hardworking, or even melancholic and sacrificial, side of Capricorn prevails and is correct, all things exist in polarity. Capricorn also brings the party, and corresponds astronomically to the point in time where the Sun starts to *gain* light. So look closely at the Capricorns in your life. You may find you can take some pointers from them about how to have fun and enjoy. And if you carry heavy Capricorn energy yourself‚Äîmake like the solstice and lighten up! You may find it easier than you think.

424,dtl9ly,False,,77,The Delusion of Kanye West ft. Neptune and Jupiter,astrology,"Just read an article that Kanye is considering a 2024 presidential run and a name change to ‚ÄúChristian Genius Billionaire Kanye West‚Äù or some such. 

The armchair psychiatrist in me screamed: ‚Äúget this man on medication post haste!‚Äù

But the Astrologer in me was like ‚Äúthis all makes sense.‚Äù

Kanye West is a 16¬∞ Pisces Moon. Which means RX Neptune is right on his Moon right now, a second pass, and will have a third pass later when direct.

Pure fodder for delusion and being fanatical about Christianity now. His natal Pisces Moon (and therefore transit Neptune) also squares his bombastic and frankly narcissistic Sun conj. Jupiter in Gemini, further exacerbating these delusions of grandeur. Neptune square natal Jupiter is perfect for finding religion, and unfortunately can result in a lot of fanaticalism. Most Christian televangelists have very very strong Jupiter or Pisces. With the natal Sun there, his ego is more than tied up in this new, ramped up holier than thou disposition. Adding fuel to the fire. 

Now his natal Neptune is in Sag. Guess where Jupiter is now folx? Yep, Sag‚Äîin Western Astrology. That means there is a double Jupiter to Neptune circus playing out for him, and BOTH worsened by the triple passes of retrogradation. Transit Jupiter is pretty much done with him, but laid the groundwork for his...I want to say, extended manic episode. Jupiter blows everything up. 

What does this create? A t-square! Neptune opposite Sun/Jupiter. And a Pisces Moon apex. The release from the tension is found through his Pisces Moon, which is why religion is of particular importance for him right now. (Plus I didn‚Äôt mention that natal Neptune opposite natal Sun and Jupiter can create this fantasy wherein you believe you are the best, that no one understands you or is on your level, and frankly someone with disassocative personality and mood disorders. The ego is fractured by the dissolution of Neptune). A mutable T Square can also make ripe conditions for someone who is erratic. Also fitting for his bipolar disorder.

I also found it interest to note that Kanye‚Äôs mom died the last time Jupiter was in Sag. Many think his latent mental illnesses were worsened by her death and ultimately laid the groundwork for the woefully flawed personality we see before us now. A Jupiter cycle indeed. 

Runner up‚ÄîUranus in Taurus is also conjunct his Venus and Mars conjunction. Shake ups and eccentricity and sporadic direction galore. Specifically regarding the women in his life (forbidding make up for North, forbidding sexiness for  Kim). 

Kanye‚Äôs rising of Cancer is not rock solid. But if it were true, the moon in Pisces would be playing out in the 9th house of religion and spirituality (along with transit Neptune there now), and the Sun conj Jupiter in Gemini would be playing out in the 12th house of psychic trauma, undoing and mental illness. Plus transit Saturn and Pluto would be in his 7th, explaining his tightened reigns around the relationships in his life. We don‚Äôt know his birth time for sure but this sure lines up...

714,g097s8,False,Discussion/Debate ,80,The Ascendant through the signs,astrology,"(This is based on what I‚Äôve specifically read and noticed about each sign as of now)

&nbsp;

The Ascendant is among the specific three sign placements that I usually notice others mention *a lot*: the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù signs (Sun sign / Moon sign / Ascendant sign). The importance of any placement and sign isn‚Äôt necessarily the same, and I‚Äôve read a number of times how these ‚Äúbig three‚Äù are written or talked about with the intention of finding an opinion of which one is the most effective or which ‚Äúmatters more‚Äù. I might do other analyzing posts like this one for Sun and Moon signs, and this one is for the Ascendant.

&nbsp;

The Ascendant is about how you see the world and how the world sees you. This is what these theoretical exaltations from ‚Äúgreatest to least‚Äù are based on. Again, this is superficial and there‚Äôs always more factors.

&nbsp;

1. Aries Ascendant (sees the world as a war zone, but likes to fight. fears relying on others and losing their independence / own opportunities)
2. Taurus Ascendant (sees the world as already peaceful, in a way. is logical and is self-nurturing, wants comfort and sees it as possible)
3. Gemini Ascendant (wants to be seen as smart and quick and sees the world as fun, exciting. fears losing curiosity and their knowledge)
4. Cancer Ascendant (believes the world is deep and emotional. sees the world as their home and fears feeling like they don‚Äôt belong anywhere)
5. Leo Ascendant (wants to rule the world with their ego and needs validation and attention. wants to be seen by the world and validated.)
6. Virgo Ascendant (focuses on details of the world before engaging with it, fears imperfection. needs to feel useful and knowledgeable)
7. Libra Ascendant (sees the world as a utopia and sees the never-ending potential of beauty the world has to offer. fears a lack of balance, chaos, and competition)
8. Scorpio Ascendant (sees the world as always wanting to hurt them. big issues with loss / fear of others ruining their life somehow)
9. Sagittarius Ascendant (sees life as an adventure and an extravagant experience. fears losing their sense of freedom)
10. Capricorn Ascendant (sees the world as a ladder to success and fears never fulfilling their duty and reaching a high social status)
11. Aquarius Ascendant (feels a need to never conform and always stay ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù / unique to feel like they matter)
12. Pisces Ascendant (views the world in a delusional way where all people aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem even if they are)

&nbsp;

751,b1zsyk,False,,44,Mercury Retrograde Isn't All Shit,astrology,"I've noticed a lot of posts here lately focusing on how Mercury Retrograde is basically six weeks of hell. Maybe it's because my natal Mercury is retrograde and also my chart ruler, but I really don't find this to be true. 

I *do* however notice a marked effect... 

For me, Mercury Retrograde is a time of revisitation in the area of the house it's traversing.  Thoughts, conversations and weird coincidences bring things up to be worked through again in retrospect, and personally I love it. 

This retrograde in Pisces is working through my 11th house. Friends I haven't seen in months have contacted me out of the blue. A former neighbour has been in touch asking me to come visit her abroad in the summer. I've rediscovered a scrap of paper with the address of a friend I lost contact with years ago. 

So, if you're feeling a little overwhelmed with the negative aspects of the retrograde, take a minute to check what house it's working on for you and take a moment of self-reflection. Mercury is giving you the chance to take stock of this area of your life - an opportunity to rework. Look for the opportunities, and work with them. It'll help.

Edit: Someone pointed out 10th and 11th were the same. That's my error on transferring the notes, not sure what happened. Updated the 11th house.

Note: A lot of you are scrutinising the 'house=sign=planets'. I don't think 'corresponding' or 'associated' are words which indicate a meaning of equating one thing or another. Rather, it's a look at patterns. Astrology is a practice of patterns. Personally, I don't think Forrest is equating house to sign to planet, he's merely associating the patterns that lie between the three. Take the 1st house as an example, being associated to Aries. Whilst the 1st House at first glance doesn't seem to have anything to do with Aries, it does have something to do with our decisiveness, action-taking ability and how we assert ourselves in the world. Aries likes doing that, being decisive, taking action and asserting oneself in the world. It's not extraordinary to associate these patterns between sign house and planet, but by no means does that mean any sort of equation! Anyways, the discussion below is worth a read on this post :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/f7csm9/a_comprehensive_guide_to_the_12_houses/,327,"Very cool and simple, though i think theres more to each house, but very informative, didnt knew about 12th house as the house of troubles, i would atribute 'trouble' to the 8th house with all its changes, but its debatable.

142,g5ropu,False,,123,The Cancer Archetype- Feminine Authority and a Mother's Wisdom,astrology,"Cancer is a sign that has suffered more from the historical subjugation of women than any other sign. It's a feminine sign- strike one. It's an emotive water sign- strike two. It's ruled by the Moon, the planet of women and motherhood- strike three. The same stereotypes that were designed to break down women and put them in their place are the same stereotypes pushed onto Cancer in astrology circles today- weak, histrionic, irrational, unstable, not in control of their emotions. It seems Cancer has been pegged as the weepy nurturer with not much else to offer, a weakening influence on a chart. That mindset speaks more to societies view on femininity than it does to the sign of Cancer. It seems to me Cancer is in need of a re-framing. 

The cardinal signs offer different brands of leadership. The forceful military command of Aries. The fair and democratic leadership of Libra. The firm and responsible hand of patriarchal Capricorn. And finally Cancer- the matriarch, the feminine authority (for whatever reason I'm picturing a circle of women on a beach beneath the Moon, tapping into their feminine power). Supportive leadership, emotionally driven leadership. Leadership that sustains and nurtures those that it directs and governs. Leadership that connects and instills a deep sense of belonging. This is the nature of Cancer and its ruler the Moon, the Queen of the heavens, beloved of her subjects. Cancer is the life-giving properties of water- water that is nourishing, enriching, life-affirming- water that rushes forth to envelop and cause everything that it touches to flourish. It is where mother ocean surges forth to meet land creating one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth, a place where life thrives. It is the creative nexus of the womb and the birth of a child into the world at the breaking of the waters- a vulnerable but powerful moment when emotions are heightened and hearts are open. This is not weakness, this is strength. To walk through the world open and receptive is potent and remarkable. To take something so vulnerable and nurture it to full strength is a feat. 

And this is why Jupiter is exalted in Cancer. There is nothing Jupiter cannot accomplish in the life-giving summer solstice sign of Cancer, where creative life force is in absolute *abundance*. It's also fair to say that for the majority of people the person that guides them, advises them, offers wisdom and support is their mother. Good mothers are the counsellors, gurus and guardians of all that they support. This is a vital and inherent (yet overlooked) quality of Cancer energy. And so Jupiter *loves* it, because here he has the broadest reach- you may not open up to a priest- but you will open up to your mother. And so we see the protective, guiding hand of the matriarch. Guardianship. Feminine wisdom and intuition. Emotional attunement and responsiveness. Cancer is the waves and the tides of the ocean, ebbing and flowing, pushing and pulling; ever fluctuating like the waxing and waning of the Moon. But the waves and tides are not always gentle, they can turn forceful as the mother who defends her child, as the matriarch who defends her community, as the Moon goddesses of old who were both tender and nurturing but fierce. And so Cancer shields those who need them. They take something small and vulnerable and nurture it to the point it can be delivered into the world. This could be a person, it could be an idea, a business, a creative project- all nurtured and grown, infused with genuine emotion and birthed into the world. The creative potential of Cancer is only rivalled by the other luminary sign, Leo. Together they light the world. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading. I hope you see how the lack of respect Cancer receives in modern astrology is unjust and is a legacy of the subjugation of the feminine. I hope this also brought some validation to people with Cancer placements who feel overlooked or poorly represented. We are not told that we are powerful, we are not told we are charismatic, we are not told that we are intelligent, we are not told that we have much to offer beyond being of service to others. So it's often a long road to learning to love our Cancer placements. I'm there now, I see how special and powerful it is, and hopefully this has helped you to do the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/astrology/comments/g5ropu/the_cancer_archetype_feminine_authority_and_a/,478,"Wish my NN, Mercury and Sun were in Capricorn instead Cancer.
